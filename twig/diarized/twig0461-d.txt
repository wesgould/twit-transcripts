Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I really wanted them to put the lower third. Yeah, we saw you on MSNBC

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that would be like the lower two-thirds

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think you should make who was interviewing you on MSNBC. That was Ali Bilshev. Oh, yeah, they should make Ali  Ali say the whole thing once just once. Yeah. Yeah, so you were there to talk about a huge  Story, which has just gotten  Huger and I bet you you already predicted this the huge story broke yesterday when a judge  cleared  AT&T's  $85 billion bid for Time Warner and said no conditions you're in different businesses  No big deal the government had been seeking to stay this although I have to say  it's all tarnished by the fact that there's some evidence the government didn't like it because  The president doesn't like CNN

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Considerable evidence and he continued it from the podium in Singapore calling CNN fake news to the CNN reporters face  Yeah, it was a political vendetta. He had nothing against  Disney and and Fox but everything against CNN. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but however, however, not a great deal for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, there were good and just reasons for blocking this but but once that happened  That's the idea that's the point Ali Belshev made on the air today  The once that happens that even people like himself and me who might have questioned this deal more once that happened. We kind of said nope  Yeah, it's it's got to go now because we can't allow that kind of political interference

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That Trump will be gone in and at most six years and this is gonna live forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I was willing to I was willing to fall in line with Trump on this one  Yeah, there are a few things that I'm like, oh, yeah, I'd go for that. But this would have gone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is a vertical it is a the thing is Stacy under the law as it stands and thank goodness  At least one third of government still does follow the law until it's taken over  It is a vertical it's a it's a it's a defensible vertical

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Merger yeah, it's kind of a meta it's a meta concept, which the law probably doesn't contemplate  We might need to rewrite this is why we need to bring it. We need to change antitrust law

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We need to bring it into the 21st century Jeff. Did you disappear?  Suddenly you got so dark it was like talking to a black  Am I here I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twig therefore I am it doesn't matter. Most people are listening. So your

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes as strong and I keep getting darker there without doing anything and the Sun's not doing anything but it's good  I can't win

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're advocating for evil that's the indication right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So AT&T  Of course is a pipe company. They are  That's what they are they're an internet service provider  They're a common carrier their phone company Roto-Rooter

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're not a common carrier as an internet provider they have not that was but they are a phone company still

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a common carrier  No, but I'm saying AT&T is a phone company for a significant number of people in this country  but as part of that they also are DSL provider to some and a  Fiber provided to others as well as their phone. So they're both a common carrier and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whatever an information technology information technology. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What they get with Time Warner is HBO  CNN TNT a  Lot of pay TV stuff, but they don't what they don't get a studio movie studio or time magazine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, they don't get timing timing was sold America timing was sold way long ago  It was it was it was yeah, it was it was shot off because it was it has cooties

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do get Warner Brothers though. They do get the movie studio time Warner cable, you know was sold some time ago spectrum

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I make was was was was spun off a OL of course this puzzle. This is basically the whole a OL time Warner  This is the last gas pump. It's dead now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And actually that's probably why the judge could clear this because had they owned some of those other things  It wouldn't have been as clear right if they don't work cable, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Closest analog is Comcast NBC Universal. Yes, well, that's the other she'd go through with conditions

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the other this does bring up the other shoe that just dropped because as I'm sure you noted on Ali Velshi show this morning  Jeff  Comcast has been waiting to see what the judge decided before going forward with its bid for 21st Century Fox and they in fact  Have just now made it up their bid to oh how's how big is the bid 65 billion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Versus Disney's what fifty four billion I think and are the apples apples are they bidding for the same parts of Fox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's up to Disney. I think yes. Yes, they are. Yes. It's up to Disney now to  Up its bid or back out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What interests me is and I'm gonna be very partisan what I'm about to say  Part of what I fear in all this is how much control Rupert Murdoch keeps over  brainwashing minds in America because he keeps and news but he'd lose  Keeps keeps the no eat no Fox News goes with I  Prince the prince stay yeah the  News Corp has already separated off. He keeps that. Yeah, so that's the New York Post

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They get the sports stuff. It's so complicated to me  The big issue is that the pipe companies Comcast and AT&T are in buying increasing numbers of content companies  NBC is already owned by Comcast  AT&T will own

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  CNN and are they taking on any debt to do this?  Man, you're asking tough questions because or AT&T both because because that's what did in the newspaper business, right?  All of the all of the consolidation  There was still all cash

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm cast as an all cash deal. It's a  Stock deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm looking for AT&T because the debts what what what kills you in these cases?  I mean essentially I like to argue that this is the dinosaurs huddling together against the cold wind of the internet and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Netflix and Amazon I'd agree with you except that these as pipe companies these guys also are gatekeepers to the internet  Yes, and with the fall of net neutrality on Monday  You know, there is a very scary confluence of factors that worry me a little bit  of  Information sources but also concentration of power

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I would argue this let's see if this gives you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you want do you want me to answer your debt question before you get into this first day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me first say this I can give you palpitations  In terms of companies that are too big that could do scary things that were frightened of they're awful  I have a lot more faith in Google and Facebook than I do in Comcast and AT&T

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm more scared of them. I think you're misguided on that. I think they're all just about as bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't listen to you. Jeff. Well, who were you more scared of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm more scared of as usual stacey. Why did you change? No, I was looking up dead  You were doing work for me because I was too lazy  I'm more scared of of Comcast and AT&T  Than I am of Google and Facebook  And then all this attention is going to Google and Facebook is the big scary companies  Comcast AT&T have far worse culture. I have far more power to do bad stuff or ripping us off  Uh have impact on speech that's greater. I I think they're I agree with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're the evil empire the difference between them Google and Facebook is they've Google and Facebook at least continue to pay lip service  to uh fairness and equality and don't not being evil AT&T Comcast long ago gave up any pretense. Amen. So stacey, what'd you find?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, so  Uh AT&T's deal  Does include now I gotta go back to it. I got distracted see this is  She the deal Jeff it their total debt load is 163 billion  After this deal when they take on time warner's debt, it's going to be at 185 billion. Wow  but  They say that uh debt to EBITDA ratio they're going for after the deal is 2.5 x so that's  High but that's not out of whack with the telco. It's not unmanageable. Okay. Yeah, EBITDA is what?  Earnings before income depreciation and taxes. So they're saying their debt to income ratio is two to one  Basically their debt to net income is 2.5. So that's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Awful. I mean if you own a home your debt to income ratio is probably a little worse than that. Well, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It in AT&T also has a lot of physical assets  So you I mean when we're talking about this sort of thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure they're making they they can make a strong case to their shareholders that this  Makes them more valuable and their revenues will go up to to meet the debt  It's a risky thing to do. I mean, this is what almost brought down clear channel the company I work for on the radio  And they only had 20 billion dollars in debt  Was that they bought they they borrowed a lot of money to buy radio stations and even though they're cash fought very good cash flowing  It's hard to service  20 billion dollars in debt. It's really hard to service 185 billion dollars in AT&T can service 185 billion in debt

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're looking they're saying that they'll see a hundred or they'll see one billion an annual  Say or they call it run rate cost synergies within three years that deal  um, i'm not worried about that what they're gonna get is the think about how these guys play today, so  Remember all of those fun  franchise disagreement dramas that pop up every now and then with the cable guys and the isps  The cable guys so people who own  Cable and they fight with the entertainment companies over how much they're going to pay to run their channels  So this gives at&t just like comcast never have those fights anymore  Well, you have different leverage in those fights. The other thing is like with the end of net neutrality. We could see the beginning of  packages that  Zero rate or that even not just advantage but like hey you can have all the at&t channels on this for free  Um, just sign up for our broadband our quad play. Whatever however much they want to jam it the more zero rated content on at&t

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And comcast the worst it is for independents like me like twit. Yep  It in effect costs you to watch the independents when it doesn't cost you to watch the other guys and that's right  That's what you wanted that neutrality

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So and I don't know if we're going to see this actually play out in net neutrality ways  So I don't know if we're going to see much  Advantage on the actual packet flow for these things  I think what will be interesting is we might see  Advantage against data caps so both comcast and at&t have data caps. That's a little bit more subtle for people  But it's closer to what's happening on the mobile side and the fcc has already said yeah. Okay, that's cool  Yeah, so that that'll be an interesting thing to watch tom wheelers fcc was very  They were interested in bad behavior on data caps. I can't imagine ajit pi really giving a hoot whatsoever

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And technically by the way fcc would still have to rule just because the judge gives a go-ahead  Although I did note that at&t said yeah, we're going to close this next week

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I don't think they anticipated any slowdowns from federal judge essentially told them don't told them doj

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't bother that's the doj but the fcc technically could still weigh in but I yeah, you don't think I doubt it  So you said something very interesting jeff and I wanted to kind of uh pursue  Note that in the history books. That's good. You always say stuff. That's interesting. I always give you credit for that  You're not always right, but sometimes you  And in fact steve case echoes this he was asked by cnbc course steve case was the aol executive during the time warner aol  merger, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He uh, that's because of him. It's because of him my fu money said fu to me  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That uh, they split into two companies after the merger several years after the merger. It was a failure  Case warned at&t according to cnbc against suffering the same fate  He said that really what's going on and he echoing your statement jeff at&t and time warner and fox and comcast and others are really  Playing defense. Yes  They're really worried about their position in the future compared to facebook netflix and amazon  So what is the threat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, netflix pays for more original programming than any network ever eight billion dollars this year  And and netflix and amazon and facebook and google  all have far more  Well, no, actually your carrier does have a lot of data on you. They just don't know how the hell to use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I disagree so they have use it and they use it and they're they're just using it not in as a  Obvious a way, but I think they're not using a smart way to give you what you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not thinking in a customer centered way, right? Um to give you more relevance and more of what you want and and sell that wisely

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stacy so the carriers for a while weren't allowed to use all the data they had they that actually was taken  They solved that problem  Um fairly recently in the scheme of things but I will say there is very much a telco mindset an isp mindset we'll call it  versus an innovation mindset exactly and  These guys want to control everything  They want to run it through their own walled garden and they really don't want to be a commodity service  They don't want to be a dumb pipe in that every decision they make is driven by fear of that in an attempt  To control and consolidate as much power as they can so they can keep their pipe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Super valuable as opposed to a commodity. You don't think this is about as as they  Asserted is diversification  Putting a foot in the digital waters. You think it's more about consolidation and control

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think  Having those assets gives them a lot of leeway to negotiate  It gives them content that they can actually push to users and kind of keep them locked in  so  Yes to both is I don't think it's an either or  But I will say that of all of the isps the best one and the most innovative actually in the one to watch is also  probably the most evil which is comcast and  They so when they bought nbcu  It made a ton of sense just like at&t doing this today makes a ton of sense  We all knew video was going to go to the internet  No, no, nobody was like, oh that's not going to happen even even the cable providers knew so  Getting that content in helps preserve  Your quad play or your your triple play or your

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sceptic play

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean comcast if you think about it, they're actually up to like a a quintuple play because they've got broadband  They're starting wireless. They've got  A phone cable phone and home security now, right?  Like home security service and that's a quintuple play quintuple play

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you're a pipe company  And net neutrality is gone  It wouldn't it make more sense to put all that money into strengthening your position as the carrier  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is human behavior. You got to worry about too. You're not just worrying about the  Um, yeah, you don't want to be a dumb pipe. That's just where you don't want you don't want to be a dumb pipe  Why not a commodity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what but if you're a dumb pipe and there's no net neutrality rules, which means you're also a gatekeeper. You're not that dumb

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because what's gonna happen is wireless is gonna kill your monopoly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, so that's a that's a that's not a strong monopoly. So here's the here's the actually go ahead go on jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you go. I was gonna start a parlor game. I'll start in a minute you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, so we also have to think about 5g which is coming down the pipe and i'm not saying this in some bse kind of  5g will save the world thing i'm talking about specifically fixed wireless  Delivered via facebook and google which they're both investing in so if you look at that  These guys are saying  The telcos are like holy cow the one thing i've got  Well, two things i've got is a kick butt wireless network  and I have  Fiber in fiber in the ground. Basically, these guys are coming through and saying hey  We're going to do that last mile fiber, which means you can have the rings and there are other companies building rings  Facebook has their own fiber  so  this is  This is where it's getting interesting. So diversification matters, too  Because they're going to need some more money  Their networks are not going to be monopolies possibly for much longer everywhere else

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see a content  Monopoly also shattering though. They they're very worried about youtube  Uh last night I had an epiphany  I went home and instead of watching tv  I watched microsoft's streaming gaming service their competitor to twitch which is owned by amazon called mixer  And I watched the fortnight pro-am which was professional esports  Gamers, it was very excited playing fortnight. It was very exciting  There was a three get this three million dollar purse  The winning team won but it was for charity, which is even more interesting the winning team won a million dollars for their charity  Is these two young guys game were they playing fortnight? Which is a fortnight very popular game right now. Yeah  So there you have that you've got microsoft mixer coming on strong. I mean, there's all these channels. We're on it now, by the way  there's  Amazon's twitch we're also on that there's youtube we're also on that  leo isn't that dumb  Uh, those three to me, uh, you know, and then I look at people under 25  They're not going home and watching  NBC they're not watching two and a half men  They're watching youtube and twitch and mixer and they're playing those games  And I you know, it's interesting because i'm watching it and the part of the epiphany was  Uh how it's presented which from my old media eye looks very kind of amateurish just as i'm sure jeff to a newspaper man blogs  Looked pretty damn amateurish  Then I realized I is one. Yeah, well now you are one  But I realize and now i'm new media  But but I realize that the standards that we have in old media are very different from what a 20 year old expects

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not just standard but but the but the but the the motif the style the voice the style that stuff i'm re i'm rereading. Um

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Understanding media is he and it's relevant today's media environment. Oh, Jesus. It's just amazing  I'm not gonna do him justice. I'm not gonna try to summarize but but his observations and he was so much ahead  Of he thought that electric media tv radio and such  We're gonna do more than they were he was anticipating television a hot medium and radio a cool medium, right?  Yeah, and I always get confused but I can't I still can't get my head around

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is the medium is the message

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So he argues that the form uh is everything we tend to look we we we we miss the frame by looking at the picture  um  Uh, and and so it's absolutely fascinating how I mean it's a media analysis of all life  He argues that media is an extension of our bodies and our neural systems, right? Well, he was right on that's exactly what's happened  Oh, it's very much so and he considers, you know, he's fascinating because it's very academic he considers the wheel a medium  And steam power and medium and you get them going on gutenberg and on the typewriter  The impact of the typewriter on the way people think um, you know from what I went from a typewriter to a computer and how it  Changes how I wrote  Uh completely how I thought  um  So yeah, that's where we are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that you jeff  I'm not on fire. Is your smoke alarm going off? Yes, get the hell out of there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, it's okay. It's the air conditioning, but sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it everybody listening at home ran to their smoke alarms

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some people here's out of the house already. Here's the parlor game I want to play  So, uh, i'll start the bidding here. So I think netflix could now part of what this decision does too is it is it opens up?  Less antitrust  Scrutiny of other kinds of deals that could occur see I would think netflix is now in peril

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they're a content company, but they don't own the pipes and these pipe guys are getting very strong

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do they turn around I want to play the parlor game

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So do they buy does netflix buy cbs?  Does um google buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who's in play so abc is owned  By disney by disney  CBS is nbc

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  CBS is way in play because cbs and viacom split up  And there's efforts in viacom to bring cbs back in cbs is resisting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so each one is in play. What would why would netflix what would the value of netflix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Buying cbs be I I one hand it's why why the hell would we go by in the past and buy that on the other hand?  It's distribution of a sort

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They need distribution, but I don't think broadcast is the right way

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think they care about broadcast distribution what they need is a they need internet  So they would they would do well to help fund some sort of shared internet infrastructure. There you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Netflix so yeah, here's a tech rich article netflix  And alphabet will need to become isps fast. This is in response to net neutrality  But I think it also is in response to all of this everything. Yeah  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now does google fiber start back up?  Right this guy's saying it will now  I don't know if google fiber will actually start back up in the iteration that it's had  I really think it's too expensive to do last mile. So doing  Fiber to and google lays like in austin they laid all of their metro fiber ring down  They didn't use anybody else's and that's very expensive. Yeah, they had to stop doing that  If they do that in other places and they rely on like 5g

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To do everything else. I think you're right wireless is obviously the only way you can if you're not an incumbent you can play

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  now  But you have to own your backhaul if you're going to be a five if you're going to use fixed wireless at some point in time  You have to get back on the internet  Now with those fiber rings google and google has fiber so they could actually do it as opposed to like  T-mobile today poor t-mobile, you know, they're they can do everything they want in their radio network  But when they get to their towers, they're still paying verizon and at&t

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Backhaul so there used to be the story that there's all this dark fiber  In the united states  It's like it's like deep state  And is it is it avail who owns all this dark fiber? Is it the incumbents?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it no it's a lot of different companies. So cities own dark fiber  Fiber sometimes they can't use it because the incumbents have written legislation to make it difficult  Random players, I mean the dark fiber though the thing about fiber is you can have lots of dark fiber  But if it's not on a route that needs to be accessed, it's not going to be worth it turning on and that's  so  You know, we we're like, oh dark fiber will save us  But it actually really matters where the fiber is and a lot of our fibers between major metro areas, which is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so but google has the resources to  Acquire the dark fiber it needs for interconnects to build rings where it needs to build rings and to set up wireless  Where I wonder why they will only

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They will only do this if at&t and verizon make it  Necessary so google and and you can actually see this  google launched  Google fiber in an era where the cable providers were implementing bandwidth caps they were charging  Incredible prices for gigabit networks. Do you remember when a gigabit network was like  Three hundred dollars a month or even five hundred dollars a month  So what happened is when they launched that they actually got pricing down tremendously plus  Boosted the base broadband speeds that people would accept  So when they launched free broadband, I think at 10 gigabits or five  Not sorry, not 10 gigabits five or 10 megabits per second  That actually boosted because comcast was doing a free broadband program at a much lower data rate  So they boosted their free program to meet google's program  So when google did this they actually had a huge impact on pricing like at&t came into austin at 70 bucks  Right your gigabit ethernet or your gigabit service now in austin from at&t is about double that  So what's happening is google's?  Stagnated and the cable guys were like and the isps were like, oh we're back to raising prices  So until it gets too untenable again, and they start implementing crappy policies, which they might because that's what they do  Google doesn't actually it's it's better for google to work with them  Than it is to actually build a network because that's one of the more expensive things you can do with your money

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good parlor game jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I still want to so so let's try to do some match ups  Let's do some match ups, right? Does somebody buy netflix netflix buy somebody what could google buy can google google app apple  We keep on forgetting about apple has  Zillions of cash is getting into content. Does apple buy netflix?  And apple has a really interesting vertical content

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple's always said and I think I credit them with this because they've been very slow to spend their hundreds of billions of dollars in cash  They've always and that which is bad by the way now repatriated so they could buy netflix with it  They've always said that we don't  You know, there's only a few reasons why you buy a company actually ben thompson observed this but I think he's accurate  There's only maybe it was well. Anyway, whoever observed it. There's only a few reasons you buy a company want to acquire  Customers apple doesn't need to do that for sure  Acquire technology apple does do that, but they do small acquisitions, but what you want to be very careful about is  trying to merge  Corporate cultures that are diverse  And I think apple is very reluctant to acquire anything large  Because it has a very distinct corporate culture and it doesn't want to have to try to merge that with anybody else's corporate culture  So I think apple is not I mean apple we've always said could buy the music industry  I mean the whole music industry if they wanted to the whole music in it, but all of it all of it, but uh  That that's not really what they're interested in and so they're very very conservative with their acquisitions  I think so they'd only do that if they saw there was a a defensive need or a real aggressive opportunity  I don't think in either case now bezos is another question. That's bezos doesn't because he hasn't gone for profit

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He doesn't have a lot of cash, right? Yeah, he has he has he has but he has equity that's worth a fortune  So does he buy netflix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you would actually see them create some sort of shared infrastructure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really do and I think and amazon relies on bandwidth too, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they rely tremendously on  and they get hugely upset when uh  When their services don't work because of crappy bandwidth, but what I see because again way back in like  2010 2008 the fcc actually did a national broadband nationwide broadband plan and  The cost of putting broadband like everywhere via fiber though was  Multiple billions, I mean tens of billions of dollars  So you're not going to see that kind of effort. I think ever what I think you would see is these guys come together  Create a shared infrastructure and use that to squeeze the telcos  Because again, they still want to do business with them. Verizon at&t  Comcast they still own  The networks that google's trying to run their services over so they can't just go all out to war  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a this is very much. This is very much game of thrones going on right now  Yeah, this is a number of fiefdoms all vying  To to control it and it's a it's a very interesting chess game because you're right. They can't outright fight each other  they need to you know, they need the alliances need to form and  And and and break up and people have to this is a very interesting chess game  I wouldn't keep jeff bezos out of this one. I would if I had to put money on anybody I would  Put money on him certainly not at&t  Or comcast although comcast  Is really a behemoth now, you know at&t owns direct tv. Who's the third largest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  isp now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Verizon  I can actually answer this question for you. Hold on. Do you want it be a telco or just in general?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, that's interesting. That's interesting question. I want pop. I want cable  In cable, okay. Give me two seconds. So at&t comcast time Warner cable tower has been taken over. So hold on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right broadband rankings

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Charter is the second largest. Oh really no way  That's a big shift charter did not deal with comcast what?  Oh because they bought the pieces of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The bus warner they bought oh, you're right char. Okay. So yeah, so it's come cast 26 million charter spectrum

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At&t char charters got to have tons of debt. They can't buy anything. So all right. So so does amazon buy charter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does amazon doesn't want that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon is going to face this as an issue though  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because they've already  Dealt with this is an issue  I just don't these guys have historically they're not going to get into the networking business unless they absolutely have to  And it affects their cost of goods of amazon web services  No, I know there's incentive but again right now  They're not dumb  They can build all of this infrastructure on top and create value there and one of the reasons they can do that is because they've created an open  Infrastructure like they've created a true platform where the isps were like  No, our platform will only be for us. So that's just that's on the isps. I feel no shame. I feel no pity

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, so looking out into the future the smart thing to do  Short term people might kind of try to occupy the current internet  But the smart thing to do would be to build a wireless internet and let's go beyond wireless  Let's go beyond 5g because you're right. You got a backhaul issue. What if we did space-based internet? What if we did satellite internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Latency is going to kill you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to now i'm i'm all very excited about satellite like internet. It depends on which band you're in  That depends on how much how many megahertz stones the beetles?  No, sorry, which it  When you start talking about doing anything in wireless you have to think about  The the amount so they measure spectrum in megahertz and they allocate it in chunks that are different bands  so  The number you can only cram so many bits per hertz  So you could only like that we're technologically limited in that that's shannon's kind of law. That's shannon's law. So  You can't go infinite without a huge technological breakthrough. So lte was a breakthrough over 3g  5g is less of a breakthrough in terms of being able to cram more information into every hertz of spectrum  So you're going to hit limits there. So you can't do things like 8k television  unless it you especially can't do it if you have lots and lots of little players because  They're going to get lots and lots of little chunks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's where satellite succeeds because latency doesn't matter in one-way television broadcasting  And you can put up enough what is how many satellites is spacex planet put up  hundreds, right  Of low earth orbit, so there's low latency  um  Lower latency lower but well, but again, it doesn't matter for if it's 8k tv latency is not an issue at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, let's see how many bands we have in the lower earth orbit band. We just can't use it for the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't help us. Well latency is not a problem for us either  Alayne's is a problem for gaming for skype literally for three of us. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right downlink how big are your channels?  oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay  so rf 2020 says that they're that  Elon musk wants to put up  thousands more than 4000 satellites

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See elon's looking at looking at the long game here. So and that's and that's actually so the the tinier the more satellites you have  The more you it's like having more cell towers so you can actually divide  By the number of users that are trying to pull right downlink it up. Are we running out of real estate for these things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess space is a big place jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Physical real estate or rf real estate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No physical running into each other. No, I think we're all right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're gonna do so much with like swarming algorithms and they'll they'll just like magically pass each other  But we are spending sending a lot of junk into space

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Elon wants to put up 12 000 satellites 4000 of them for the backhaul 8 000 of them for direct to users  12 000  Oh, how many how many can you put in one payload?  I don't know, but it's interesting that both bezos and musk are looking at space

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's because they've got a rocket launching program. I mean if you have a hammer or if that's why they have a rocket

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Launching program as well. He's saying the reverse stacy. That's why I know but he's he's got the rocket launching

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  program for  I wouldn't put it past either elon or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bezos to a have other plans and and say something about mars when that they really want to do is  Take over the internet. I would put it past either one of them  That's true. I think they're smart enough to be looking at I mean look if we figured this out they must have

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But okay, but y'all satellite is tough and I say this having written for 15 years about satellite  Everyone wants there's so much  Challenge there that is really deep and nerdy and boring but so important. So you've got to deal with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not impossible. I mean if not impossible if you want to say challenge living on mars is kind of a challenge, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and we're not there yet. No, but yeah, but stacy's stacy's right because because the leap from

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fiber to the home to fixed wireless itself is big right?  Fixed wireless is not as good as fiber to the home, which was which was part of susan croffert's argument against the  Comcast mbcu  Merger everybody said well, it's okay. We'll get 5g. It'll be okay. She said no  It's not ever going to be what fiber the home is and satellites never going to be what fixed wireless is  Right, right. That's true. Yes, that is your choice. You'd want fiber

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your choice you'd want fiber I mean don't you remember was it snow crash where they were like, you know, they were all  Running around having their fun on their their wireless network  But when they really wanted to do something serious they had to go to the wired wired network because there just wasn't enough capacity  I know that's a fiction, but it's actually based in physics

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I always you know given the choice i'm always going to bet on physics  I think it's very it's a very interesting, you know, we're obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and you would still need so stuff that satellite needs

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You well you need so satellite needs again backhaul is going to bite you in the butt here because to direct to satellite  You need some sort of massive power battery powered  Big transmitter and receiver on your handset if you want to do it on handset  What's more likely is you're going to do satellite to some sort of base station either consumer premise equipment  Or a tower like infrastructure, so you're still going to need that backhaul

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that make sense? Yeah, but you only have to buy a few of those compared to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it depends on how much capacity you need. It depends on all kinds of things. I mean like  You don't just have to have a few  It it depends on the nature of your backhaul if you're going to do yeah fewer than you would if you wanted to do like terrestrial  I mean, you wouldn't have to do it to the premise, but you would have to have I mean, I guess you could do satellite  Let's see  Satellite to cpe to wi-fi or to 5g wireless. You don't have to design the network. We don't have to get that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you get the whiteboard out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm like sitting here going okay. Who do I need to call the test of physics here? Is it possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't actually know I wonder I you know, so the parlor game continues and I think it's a good parlor game  Of what what the moves that the next moves are over the next year or two  Uh, but but at least for now  Is this not bad for consumers jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that was the argument I had on tv today and everybody's saying prices are gonna go down. I don't think so  I think they're gonna go up  But that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with with antitrust  It's just it's just that the mass media you've heard me before the mass media ad supported business model is suffering under dying  Um free content supported by advertising will become junkier and junkier broadcast tv  And so I think the reason prices are going to go up is because you're going to find more and more stuff going behind walls

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And people are willing to pay it. I mean look at we're just talking about shows on hbo and netflix

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and and there aren't that many competitors hulu  So you have amazon you have netflix you have hbo showtime  Hulu is owned by the the media companies so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That ownership will change significantly if comcast buys  21st 21st century they will have a 16 controlling share of hulu. Yes, which is part of the reason they want it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so so there's a there's there's actually a fairly limited number of competitors now unless you consider it next week  I'll be at vidcon, you know  10,000 18 year old boys and girls making shows that have sizable audiences that aren't part of this equation at all  Um in terms of a huge attention market and people watching, you know game tournaments like you're talking about  Not part of this calculation at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This has always been a problem for for advertisers is reaching the 18 to 25 year old and it's only gotten worse  Yeah  And uh, and I don't know what advertise, you know the advertising market which I guess is what's financing all of this. Is that right?  Oh, are we gonna well if everything goes behind a paywall then advertising doesn't matter anymore, right?  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah advertising  Pardon me for getting into this but this is where gdpr comes in too. Is it the is the less you can target?  The more it's going to be just mass volume, which is awesome for twig. It's awesome for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because we don't target and god, you know, we just lisa got off the phone today with you do target

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you do target  You are the you are the essence of targeting. Well only because our programming is niche programming, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we don't but we don't we don't compete well against facebook and google where you can say to to google  I'd want 18 to 24 year olds that live in hyana sport  You can't do that with us  And there are advertisers. You just got off the phone with a big company  Big company that won't buy ads because we we won't give them a redirect so they can see who downloads the stuff  we won't give them tracking cookies because  They this is all stuff they want and they're going to get they can get from facebook and google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so you you tell me who that is. I'll go talk to them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll set them straight. They're not too far from you  So but it's I think it's fascinating  And we're just kind of we're kind of barely keeping our head above water at this point because google and facebook are eating so  much of the digital ad spend  Because of that targeting now i'm hoping gdpr changes that equation. I really am

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But uh, it's very interesting. Well gdpr is going to extend the life of stupid mass media and yet aren't and that's for sure and yet aren't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh brands moving off. I I heard a few years ago procter and gamble moved off of facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And back to their big tv buys because of what they do they give you something you don't have a relationship with  really

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Are you talking about I have a relationship with my charmin and your downing  And my tide

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's absolutely true. You have a brand very strong brand relationship, but that's why branding advertising is what they want

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what they're just branding advertising. Yeah, and and and it's product it's product introduction  Which you're only ever going to be able to do through non-targeted

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We you know we're caught as as a lot of small networks and early cable channels and things are caught  In this bad space where ultimately you'd love to be a brand advertising buy  But but nobody's going to buy podcasting as a brand advertising. They always want direct response  They're always going to measure it somehow and so we're kind of caught somewhere between lots of deep tracking  Direct response and branding but what you'd like is the branding buy  So I was talking to a bunch

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, go ahead. Well, so I have this community practice a cd you first

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never mind go. Sorry. We don't want to interrupt. Stacy. No, you we want to see to talk you go stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not I was just going to say I get a lot of brand advertising for some of some brand advertising  For people who are targeted but again, it's it's kind of niche brand. Do they not always?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Though want a offer code or something. Nope  So you'll get advertisements for a company and they say just go to our website  They're not go to our website slash stacy and iot

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I don't know if it's because they're less sophisticated or they're but they're all happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean so notice that the the twit ads that don't have a direct url are very few

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I I have noticed that and I I offer you get paid on a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We never just basis. No, and one of the things I said when we started twitter  So there's two ways you can sell advertising in in this kind of medium cost  per impression cpm  or cost per lead  Or click and we've more action or action cpa and we've never done cost per action  ad buys  Actually, wait a minute. We did one once netflix  And it was more an experiment to see what else netflix would never pay cpm  Cpm means they just just like regular tv advertising they pay for the number of eyeballs  they wanted cost per acquisition and  But it was like 50 bucks per acquisition, so he said all right, we'll try it it did not work well  But but I so but I want to I always wanted to see I felt like if cost per acquisition devalues your product in my opinion  because  You know you you you're not you're not monetizing people who heard about you but then didn't click the link or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You really want to monetize the impressions. I think this is this is the discussion we've had before but I have this community practice  I started at cuny with my colleagues there for commerce in news media  and  It's working pretty well now what this is this is this is selling stuff off amazon. This is doing deals for heavy blankets  This is this is fairly straightforward, but it's something we've never done in news media  And as I as I've discussed in the past  It needs more trust  You know throwing tabula ads in your page. You're obviously telling your readers. You really don't give a damn about it  Yeah, we'd never but if you're if you're saying this is the best deal of the day I stacy higginbotham know  the best wire  Wi-Fi router is not going to rip you off  Uh, I leo the port know the 10 best, you know, you become a wire cutter  And and you gotta put some investment in that and you gotta know that but no wire cutters so valuable by the way  Yeah, it is and and um, they don't do  Advertising I don't think they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't really now know uh because because it is an affiliate is it affiliate links. How do they monetize?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's it's both affiliate links. They they will put up so they're part of the group. They will put up  um  The best they they pick the best product then they put up the best links to those products and that's not always the cheapest  Right. It's not always the cheapest  Because it depends on what their users prefer and a lot of users always prefer amazon  And amazon the interesting thing is amazon is as closed and secretive as as as with this as with anything  But they clearly value this channel

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's the amazon affiliate  Uh fees that makes that make them money by the way, yes, the new york times owns the wire cutter now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's wire cutter. Yes. So when it was bought the rumors were that it was netting about 10 million dollars a year  And you can gross that up. Uh, one major online pure play  publication I know of  uh is bringing in uh  100 million a year in in gross not net gross sales, uh  Reportedly, yeah gawker reportedly what it was last year of his life as gawker was grossing again grossing  250 million dollars in merchandise sales

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the reason gross is an interesting number is because you have to consider how much it costs them to generate that revenue  And so you subtract it from the revenue. It's not their profit. And so something like the wire cutter, which has a lot  They have they have high costs I guarantee you because they have a lot of people what's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's but it's an editorial cost. It's it's it's not different against your gross believe me, of course it does

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, I know all about that part

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're used to that kind of kind of content cost as are you so so that's how we're calculating  It's just a different kind of advertising in the end, right? Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's also a lower dollar advertising I would think but maybe not oh, yeah, but but you're not competing for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The damned cpm  RFPs  Uh, there's a different relationship with your with your audience one of trust  Um, no, it's a very good from the audience point of view very good both of you  Both of you should be experimenting  I believe with commerce see what it's like. So it's different leo from because one thing I was saying to the group  I said my friend leo the port  Right. What happens on on the twit network is that every new direct response?  Um company comes along and says well i'm gonna try this out on the podcast  casper harry's wink all these companies that you've helped launch  Because you are a great platform for seeing what people respond to at a low cost and low risk  They're willing to pay the cpm just because it's not that high. It's a small audience  They get a lot of data back and you're launching all these companies and then they leave you. Yeah, so how do you keep ongoing value?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you as soon as they get as soon as they get to a certain size?  Yeah, they do buying tv ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They go on tv, right? It was hugely expensive. Why don't you keep on selling those things? We try in a different way we try

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because we have no way to do affiliate links. That's a different that's the difference between  A podcast and a website  I mean we have an affiliate link program, but we don't make much money on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's something and stacey you you could rake it and I would I would follow we are we are launching

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're launching an affiliate link effort  Um that is that is coming very soon  Um the the challenge for me as a journalist old school journal as an old journalist  is um  Do I is is how we talk to our readers about it? So do I?  And this is just in the site. This isn't for the podcast  So how do I do I give them some people give you the option of like here's the affiliate link and here's a non-affiliate  Link for people who really hate that. Why would somebody not want to do an affiliate link?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, but I can understand people might say oh you're not going to recommend the best product  Just the one that makes you the most affiliate money  That's why you have to never do that  Of course you wouldn't but that's why you have to disclose and that's why you build a trust relationship  But I and I know there are people who say oh, I remember when pinto when it was revealed that pinterest  Was using affiliate links people were up in arms like  Well, it doesn't cost you anything  Right. I don't really understand it  But so I think you just disclosed stacy you say this is how we  We make money through affiliate links  If you click this link, we'll be making a few bucks. Thank you for your support

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the other great thing the wire cutter does is they had a case of a I don't know some kind of coffee maker thing  Whatever and they recommended the 32 ounce whatever  And the audience came back and said no no, you're wrong. That one has a problem  You actually should recommend the 18 ounce because that's better for these reasons and wire cutter said oh, you're right  So we recommend the 18. So it's not a you know, you can have a back and forth because think about both you  Guys is that you have really smart audiences that that use this stuff too  And that can keep you honest  And keep improving the recommendations and I just think it's a it's a little spin-off thing  Because leo the point is yeah, I think you're right  In your normal flow of your media. No, but you could start a side brand that is leo recommends

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we've always thought about that. We actually did for a while do that  Uh, i'm right the market's changed. I think jeff i'm writing this business model into the ground  I'm going in with this business model. I i'm too old to change. I like this  But stacy's a young girl so stacy I would buy  An iot thing from you and I would pay more you're more in a position to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Frankly than I am right and we do have we do have reviews and that sort of thing  So yes, it makes total sense, which is why we're  Going to do it. We're just trying to figure out  The right way because we did again

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did a review show kind of with that idea in mind, but it never our audience's doesn't they don't like that kind of stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A good chunk of your audience is is my audience too. So yay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go spend your money at stacy and iot. That's where you should spend your money  But we love our we you know, I really love our model because we can  We pick advertisers we like I talk about them. It's a relationship thing, you know  And uh, I have a relationship with the audience we talk about it and I think it's something's good for the audience  I love this model if it's not, you know if if an advertiser says no  Yeah, but we've got to track and we've got to do this and that fine they go basically lisa this morning told that company  Okay, fine go somewhere else

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't I was telling I was telling these media people about you  Right and and saying that you do reject advertisers because they're not relevant to your audience because you don't like them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's trust. That's trust. Yeah. Yeah, that's trust. Yeah. I mean originally I wanted to make this a paywall

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, seriously from day one. No web 8716 leo basically retired

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think people think i'm retired

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You do travel the world a lot but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do show up a lot. I get vacation time just like any other schmuck. I don't get any vacation time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you get vacation time stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um, no, I I actually built it into my contract for this year with and by contract I mean with with  Andrew and I was like look I am not working that last week between christmas  I was like there will be no products do not sell ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  good  You have to negotiate that with your husband. I have to negotiate that with my wife. Exactly. Yeah the other a couple of years  Ago, I said honey. Can I go on can I get three weeks of vacation a year?  And I was very I thought she was saying absolutely not and she said yeah, of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, do you have to go with her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I choose to go with her

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stacey I love her. What are you doing stacy? And I would I'm gonna get a nasty gram for it. Yeah, you're causing trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to go with her. Are you kidding? I would hate going somewhere  At because the whole time i'd be going hey lisa look. Oh  Hey, look at that lisa

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, I have to go with her

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to have somebody to point things to if you can if you can spend three weeks on a on a small cruise ship  With somebody you know, you're in love. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, lisa and I travel better than we do work. It's hard. It's very stressful working together  Uh, and it's stressful for her more than it is for me because I don't really work but but it's hard and uh  When we're on vacation, we're like lovebirds.

Transcript:  She also has had to talk to a friend about suicide  Yes, she's also very she's really good. There's there's a there's a lot of awareness now about mental health on youtube  I think that that's been something  I think you could say it's been clearly that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Digital side has pushed that into mainstream. It really hasn't we had we had many of you remember we had a phenomenal end to the show  uh, I guess three weeks ago with with um  Ant and kevin ant pruett and kevin tofel. Yeah both talking about about uh, ant his wife's depression  He was very open about him talking about it and kevin about his own and and I I had  exchanges with one email afterwards  I'm just so grateful for the courage that they showed in doing that that taking away the stigma. This is a phenomenal  Medium and opportunity for that for people to know they're not alone. You know, we've all been crushed by the recent celebrity suicides  um, and and so yeah, so the fact that hannah hart  Uh will talk about that openly is amazing. I also put on the rundown down at the bottom. Um, will uh, will we  Yeah wrote gave a speech and put the text of his speech about his depression and anxiety which was  Very touching and brave as well. Well, what's interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, it's a better way to say it than you originally said it. Yes. Oh, believe me. I have mental health issues

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not it's I have no stigma. Believe me no stigma at all  Uh, in fact more more and more I think we all do  I really do  Um, so but it's great when these people are coming forward. I don't know her  The blog yes, you don't know jenny losson. Oh my god  I'm hysterical  But you know what? It's I guess when i'm when i'm saying in my justification is like many comics  A lot of comedy seems to come out of pain personal pain, right? Oh, yeah  But it's not just comics it's everybody it is yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So different topic this is a little bit of uh kind of breaking so facebook promised to  uh label  political ads  And to reveal who bought them right which everybody said yeah at last right? Yes  Well when I was out at f8, I I quickly saw they were wrestling that and they've been wrestling ever since  Uh-oh, so when the new york times  Advertises their coverage of a topic  The effort to scale this made facebook want to say political ad new york times has a s fit  Over this and other publishers do too, but facebook kind of didn't know what to do about this  So they just announced just as after we started the on the air they changed their policy  so now  A couple things one that they're gonna their their label is going to be paid for by which is great  Which should be on every ad alive every ad everywhere should have who paid for this  I agree. I agree and then b they're gonna have to figure out how to how to segregate political stuff from  News and that's actually harder than it sounds. Well, wait a minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because the new york times is not paying for that article on facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, the new york times does pay for things. That was the point the new york times does pay to promote its coverage  Nick christoph

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Covering but it's hasn't always said that paid paid promotion or something  on facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But now it had to say political ad  Oh, they also required that you had to like give your passport to say who it was and prove you were an american citizen buying this ad  That's not political ad. That's journalism  What that's they're in line the problem  They're in line the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it isn't a political ad it's journalism. I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's hard to who's a journalist  Wait, though, because some of their editorials I would argue are political ads almost  Almost what they're doing. I would not call the editorial pages of newspapers journalism  I think that's actually a really important distinction. Maybe you need multiple distinctions here in life

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're nick christoph and you have a pub opinion piece in the new york times the new york times promotes it on facebook  It doesn't need to be  It doesn't need to be billed as a political ad paid for by the new york times. It doesn't make any sense at all  All right, so a lot of writing a lot of writing has point of view that doesn't make it political advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so like when ajit pi writes something in the wall street journal, is that political or is that not if the journal publishes it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No  If ajit pi writes an article that says you should vote for candidate x

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That might be but there's more to politics, especially in today's world

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, which is don't forget what the russians did they went after issues like race, yeah, you gotta be careful

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because if you start billing everything as political advertising then it means nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I couldn't agree more and that's what they're that's what they're facing and that's what they realized  The world pushed them to a solution. They said, okay. Okay. Okay  Well, they were political ads  Then the way they wanted to do that was to say if you if your ad bought ad is about all these things  That's political well if it's about coverage of that thing that's a that's one remove  um, and and they didn't know what to do with it and and they went through  About two months of the publishers just screeching  And and I get it. I think publishers are right to screech  Uh, because this I agree with you leo. This is absurd, but they didn't know how to do it  So this is this is the world that we're in now  It's just fascinating to see these things that you wouldn't have expected would have caused headaches cause real headaches

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that that that change came out just I think we can find a definition of political advertising that does not include  op-ed pieces

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But well stacy disagrees with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do I might write an op-ed about it  Do we want to talk about uh, google because I have a question for y'all  There's a difference there's a difference between political speech and political ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what's the difference?  Oh, okay. Yes  Yeah, political speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if you make an advertisement based on political speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but they're not making that's new york times buying promotion for the new york times  That's indirect by by indirection of one. That's not the same thing as a paid political ad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that that's I agree, but that wasn't easy to do. Well, I just did it

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you have to have a list the problem is this you have to have a list of  Who is a legitimate?  News organization. I'm actually working on a project. Yes, you're right. I guess if bright bart

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bought bingo bingo  Promotion for a bright bart editorial  supporting  Anybody but mark sanford  Right that would kind of count like a political ad. All right, even though they call themselves a publisher a news publisher

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, their agenda is clear their agenda is propaganda. I feel like there's political speech. There's advertising there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Promotional advertising for content that should not be politic. That should not I think it's it's it's worth  Maybe there's some gray areas getting through  To being very clear that this was an ad purchased by  Organization x to promote candidate y that should be billed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about uh, uh, uh purchased by?  um  Um  Uh planned parenthood  Uh, and the and the and the and the ad pushes the agenda  Because planned parenthood is not not a journalistic entity. No. No, but is that a political ad? Yeah  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What if ann richards writes a okay, she's dead cecile richards  writes a  It's a miracle

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Op-ed op-eds no op-eds never a political ad. That's just a political speech. Okay, political speech is protected  That's the other thing you're gonna have a very hard time

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they're not saying that it's not I mean they're they're not saying they're not gonna run it  They're just saying they want to label it right? I don't that's right. I mean, okay  That's like those people who argue that their free speech is being violated when they get fired for being a jerk on the job

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it dilute the value of those labels if you put it on too many things maybe not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's well, that's part of the question too. Yeah, I mean so at the root of this  So i'm about to start working on project. We're talking about it now because they're going forever  But another week i'm happy to  That looks at  Uh, what is quality news? You have to start with what's news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they just say  Wait when I worked at the san francisco examiner, we we used a cbs called sii systems integrators  And they had a standalone terminal i'm going to get to a point believe it or not  Where it was just considered the most rock star amazing coding that somebody managed to get hyphenation and justification  onto the terminal locally  This was just phenomenal  That you could do that, right?  And now you consider you can store 59 languages and translation and all this crap on your phone in your pocket

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come a long way babies  Yep  And by the way, you still can't do hyphenation on uh,  On an android device so maybe that was maybe that was just a hard  So facebook's they're hard hyphens are hard hyphens are very hard  Uh facebook memories and yeah, um  Fire tv cube. I did order one of these this is going to be interesting amazon has announced this thing  with infrared coming out of all the sides so you put this in your  Your cabinet with all your other gear for your tv and it can control them with the voice with the echo

Yes  Anything you can turn on off or on with your infrared remote  and uh now i'll i'm gonna get one because I have a lot of experience with large  Logitech's universal remotes and one of the things logitech has going for it is they have an online site  Where you that knows about every kind of brand and receiver and everything. So this is going to compete heavily then with the logitech harmony. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  if

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it's good, it's as easy to configure and that's going to be the real test harmony has been around for years  So logitech is easy to configure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And here's some good news  Podcast ad revenues hit 314 million dollars in 2017. So who got the other 14 million leo?  Well, it wasn't me that's up by the way 86 percent from 2016  But I gotta tell you this  The number last year was wrong. I don't know how close this is to accurate. This is done by the iab

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You actually have a a impressive percentage of that really

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well  Last year when they said it was um, 169 million  We had 10 million of that and I thought well, there's got to be more than 16 of us  Yeah  but um, I you know  Um, anyway, I think that that number is tough because podcasters don't all belong to the iab. It's very expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, oh, I don't belong to the iab. Right. I don't belong to the iab

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why would you?  Um because i'll tell you why we've looked at it, but it is really expensive  I can't remember what it's going to cost but we're going to do it because we want representation  Because the iab unfortunately, it's the interactive advertising bureau  It's equivalent of the rab for radio and what is the magazine version of this? Um the um  It's I forget similar but the idea it's the cab I think but it's the same idea which is the circulation ad bureau or something  Like that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's it's the idea is it's really advertisers that put this together  And so a lot of advertising agencies use iab  boilerplate contracts and standards  and uh  Many of the terms in the ib contracts are death to podcasters  uh, so  Uh, we don't accept iab contracts. We amend them  So we want to understand why you would join  So that you can argue and weigh in and say look this is you gotta understand. This is not acceptable  Like we can't do this and then also so that these numbers become a little bit more accurate  Uh host read ads were the most heavily used ad type  Two-thirds of all ads in 2017. I'm going to take credit for actually bringing that to podcasting. You bloody well should yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Direct response, you know leo, you know leo. This is like a howard stern rant now  He has a fit about the uh, the broadcasting hall of fame  There should be a podcast hall of fame and you should be the first person and I was there is yeah  Oh, well, then good.

Uh adam corolla  Dave whiner should be he really created a code that made it possible  Uh host read ads a direct response ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you win the second prize you're in philadelphia. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's true. There it's in philadelphia this year  um  Let's see  Let's see. What else can we talk about?  Oh, there was some other stuff. Oh, yeah, here's a good one  Plume which I use

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the one I want stacy to talk about. I like plume

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um and still like them now this so this is that's the story I wrote two years ago  So you actually need the verge story which is below it talking about the 60 fee. Yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use plume  Along with the euro in my house. I've spent a lot of money. I have 12 plume units  Dear god, well, you're supposed to put one in every room. I mean it really is a sponsor or was they are not eros a sponsor  uh the  Now remember plume took a big investment from our favorite company  Comcast  And when you get xfinity's wi-fi solution you get plume pods to extend it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Only if you need to extend it. Yes, and you actually have to purchase them. Oh, you don't get them you buy them  Uh, yes, so if you have crappy wi-fi you call them up you complain and they're like I can offer you this for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how much it is 39 bucks. I think plume has added a new router a three tri-band bigger router than the little ones  I'll probably buy that but you have to pay 60 bucks a year to keep it active and this is the thing that's most offensive  If you don't pay the subscription it stops working

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so if you pay the subscription  You buy the three pack for 40 bucks you get a deal. Yeah, right. So  Basically, so the original is 180  so 40 plus 120 gets you to basically two years two free years

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But on year three if you don't pay that they brick that hardware, which I think they should not do  I do think that they're justified in charging euro has a  Optional subscription service for additional features. I don't understand why

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is because it's not like you put your whole it's not like your old-fashioned router

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where you buy it you plug it in you're done  But all of these new mesh services are are constantly  Updating with firmware and they claim  Constantly modifying their behavior to adjust to your network and so there's my chromebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. Okay. Hold on you guys. Let's talk about this for a little bit  So what plume offers is slightly different than what ero and some other guys offer all of their intelligence and all of their routing  Happens in the cloud  so they are actually constantly pulling data for these things about the devices trying to connect and the state of your network and  They're optimizing that literally on the fly. So  think about that  So they're also even my microsoft laptop had new printer drivers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you also get parental controls you get additional security features  Um, there's additional there's stuff you're getting that you would you could conceivably subscribe to from other people

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Keep going and you could still get that from you know, ero offers a subscription  The challenge for a company like plume is they're actually making a very different case. They're trying to take wi-fi and turn it into  More of a service and this has always been their case, which is why two years ago  I was like, oh hey  They're going to charge people for this because I knew that was where they wanted to go  They're actually licensing their stuff to isps like comcast so their software that runs in the cloud and on these edge devices  That's that's a continually running an updated service. It's not like i'm pushing out an update  The service is delivered via the cloud constantly. So that's one so your network  changes like moment by moment  two  Their their big market isn't into consumers  Their big market is selling to isps and to selling to having other companies that make wi-fi hub type devices  Put their software inside their devices. So they have a deal with samsung and the theory is eventually samsung is going to put the software  into  anything that has not anything but anything that has enough processing power and wi-fi and help create these like  Like mesh networks around your home using existing smart home stuff routers, that's interesting. Yes  so  that's  The goal and I would also say  This gives and i'm not against this because I think it gives you  More certainty that you're going to need in today's era of lots of devices running in your home  It gives you a lot more security because you can if i'm paying 60 bucks  They darn well better give me a security update on every vulnerability asap  I think for most of your audience leo  They're going to hate this because they're smart enough and they they deal with their own stuff  But like a common normal person  paying 60 bucks a month to have guaranteed awesome wi-fi  Sorry a year. Sorry five dollars a month six wait six dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting is the website has kind of changed the language it now says not buy plume but join plume  Oh, yeah, they're really acting like you're you're really subscribing to a service that happens to have some associated hardware now as an existing plume guy  I don't think I have to worry about this right i'm granted. No somebody said oh really I thought one of the stories said

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're they changed it. That's not a lot clear the verge originally reported

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That in there they came back with clarification the verge was like, oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the verge one of the many things I hated my cable company for  Before I got Verizon was that they rented me the damn rubber. Yeah, right  And and forever  And and long after I paid them off for it  Right, so we finally got freed from that just like the old telephone. We had to rent our telephones  This is something consumers have had to do but they hate  Hey, I mean, I think it's just it's kind of it's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are 11 bucks a month, right? But you know what?  People paid for it people continually pay for it. A lot of people do not go out and buy  Their  No, and it's not the aol people it's normal people who just are like, eh screw it. It's all part of that  I mean, I know we in the tech press get so aggravated by it, but  You know most people don't think about it. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I pay for that's a kind of awful business model. Isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think so. I think it's just because your expectations are conditioned by what a router used to be  This is a different this is a different thing now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think about your link sys or tp link router somebody in the chat room was like saying isn't this like it's a half-baked product  and I say no because they're continually like  routers are continually being targeted now as  Great devices to hack and they're looking at the vulnerabilities are like everywhere. So having somebody who's willing to  Upgrade that and do it very proactively. I think is a really important thing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I probably won't pay for

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  our

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plume service because that's my iot network. It's a separate network from the euro, but I do pay for euro plus  Which is a similarly priced product that gives you all sorts of additional security services  It's kind of like open dns and and services like that. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think euro plus is twice euro plus is ten dollars a month. Is it?  Yeah, so it's actually it's it's twice that. Let me make sure before I say that  I don't because I I looked at buying it and I was going to buy it and they have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One password and vpn services as part of it. So it has encrypt me one password malware bytes you get advanced security  Prevent access to sites that host malicious content or viruses  You get ad blocking  So that's network wide ad blocking  You have family filtering which means I can have filters for my kid that are more aggressive

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait a second it blocks ads coming through the router

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To the web prevent most ads from appearing on your mobile phone desktop and other connected services

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That sounds like like a oh as a publisher, of course, I hate that. It's a copyright violation. It's awful. It's  I turned it on it ain't that neutrality  It's for damn sure  No, yo  You're starving journalist leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, they basically get a vpn service. So I think for what you get that's not an unreasonable amount of money  but uh, and I think  Again, it's going to really come down to what do you get with plume and is it are you getting what you're paying for?  Is it something worth?  Why? The problem is you have to buy all this before you find, you know, there's no way to  You have to kind of buy into it  I don't know what i'm going to do because i'd like to get one of the new routers  It looks like the only way to get a super pod  Is to buy a lifetime membership and two more pods and like I said, I have 12 of these guys  I got I got heroes. I have plumes everywhere because it's my I have them in my garage and stuff because it reaches out to all my  You know, it's my iot network

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so 200 dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, that's a lifetime membership by the way, which I think is a lifetime membership and that's for five years my tivo  Oh  Lifetime is five years

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, and I think it's you may you may hate that but i'm going to tell you that's a good thing that they're putting a limit  On it as opposed to just being like yeah, it's lifetime and then five years from now being like you want new routers  Anyway by then. Yeah, I would say yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think the good news is there's choices. I still don't like it, but I got it, but you have a choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, and you do you can buy other there are plenty of other routers out there. So I just  Yeah  I think it'll be really interesting to watch  It's a good indicator as more and more connected devices try to be focused more on the service than the hardware  Are we really ready for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there really are a lot of things a router can do better than the current proper routers  There's a lot of ways it could be better if it's an ongoing service, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we shall see

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it time for our things it's time for I want to do one thing one thing first  Just uses me. What's his name?  Where'd it go former facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Palmer lucky, oh my god, this guy's insane

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He is, you know, he discovers corporate politics. Gee, some people don't like these we don't like  You know just because the guy was what three years old when he sold the company and became a billionaire, you know  What's gonna do to his head?  So he's all concerned about facebook and he spent three years there and some people just don't like me  They speak but here's the point of the why I wanted this, you know what he's doing now  Just killed me. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Virtual reality border protection  Palmer lucky was the founder we should mention of oculus  Made a lot of money selling it to  Facebook he actually first made a lot of money off of me and others like me who gave him money in a kickstarter campaign  And then turned around a couple of years later and made a lot more money selling it off to facebook  Uh, he made it good because he gave us the new oculus rift for free. So that was okay  I was I got two oculus rifts out of it  He got he kind of got let go of facebook after it turned out he had created a kind of meme  troll  agency  on on reddit  Pro trump kind of  Meme system that was bizarre  Uh, and they didn't they didn't like that. So he went off and did this new thing and he's been you know  He has close relationship with trump. He's been trying to sell this to trump and apparently it's being used  And apparently successfully according to this article

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With this is the wired article  A virtual border wall verge

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh the verge  He has successes is we've got success stories

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So  instead of a physical wall his idea is you will build a  Vir a virtual one built of cameras with machine learning to identify people and that sort of thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the the the verge says they've already caught dozens of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, it's barely a year old  They've installed three tower three 32 foot towers packed with radar communications gear and a laser enhanced camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, it's called lattice and soon lasers to shoot you down probably  So that's the question is separate you from your baby

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's being tested on private property right now, right? So but there's a lot of interest  Over a 10 week span and derail. That's the name of its security towers. It's probably something out of middle earth, right?  Apparently help border agents catch 55 people  Sees 982 pounds of marijuana  39 of the rest were not connected to drugs

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anderil is the company lattice is the technology the lattice is the communication gear. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, it's better than a wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh it it is  I mean in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't deny we have the right to protect the border

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, I would have a hard time with this knowing what happens to the people afterwards

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should fix that separately. I think yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not but I would I would definitely have a hard time as a founder building something that  Then is used and the the other thing is once you have this there  Why not put it?  Everywhere. There's another issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Casey hunt and mbc just tweeted infant ripped from mother's arms while she was breastfeeding the baby at border detention center mother  Handcuffed for resisting right? That's the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  However, that's unrelated  But there is a little bit of concern because palantir a name that should send chills down your spine is also involved

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Peter teal in being involved sent enough chills down. I'm like, yeah, you know, by the way both palantir and anderil are tolkien references

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They are from middle earth  Ah  I bet you jrr tolkien is spinning in his grave. This is a lot more like sauron than it is like a hobbit  Um interesting so palantir has been known for doing all sorts of kind of creepy surveillance stuff very secretive  Company and they have oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a it's an enchanted blade for the lord of the rings palantir anderil is yeah anderil is uh, what aragon's blade

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

I mean like here in texas building the wall is a big issue because there are places

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are places that a run through private property run through like wildlife and bird reserves  Run through like wildlife and bird reserves so something like this is a lot  You know, it doesn't hinder migration patterns of animals, for example  Well, and it probably costs less than 18 billion dollars, which is the I think they had 7.6  Was that the number of the story? Hold on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it sounds like it actually might be more effective than a wall  The problem with walls is people can tunnel right under them. I guess you if you you wouldn't be this  You could tunnel under this too. Yeah  You have a long tunnel

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, now what would be interesting is because you can  you can  uh  Not hack you can fool ai cameras by wearing weird makeup or doing so if you change your physical profile

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would be interesting all the new, uh immigrants will be wearing. Uh, just a robot masks or or no  I'll tell them right now what you should do. You can make a led collar  That emits light that blinds the camera you look. Oh, that's true ir collars. Yeah  You everything looks normal to you everything's going fine. You're wearing a strange necklace  But other than that and you're completely invisible to the camera and some you know what jeff let's let's stacy  Let's start a business making those. Yeah  That's gonna be huge mexico  Not just everybody will wear one of these so that the face recognition stuff doesn't work. Okay. This is your first

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  um  Affiliate commerce deal. This is brilliant

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Uh, uh  Colleen our old chief engineer was gonna make one of these for me. She's now working at facebook  There's a silly walk  So you do that so the gait analysis won't work you wear one of these uh, infrared beaming necklaces  And you just look like a strange silly glowing ball  And what are they gonna do shoot you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Probably yeah, probably i'll just send people just send people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh the soon they'll make those collars illegals what they'll do  Stacey egg and bottom. Do you have a pic this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do I just did a review of the camera that we have talked so much about the ah, it's moving

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, mine's on order. Oh, I have you three and I love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so I  if you  On the website, I show videos of it doing things  It's hard to do without a stable base for it. I can I can I can fire it up on my phone  Here we go. Hold on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Well, I just want to show you it moving around. Yeah, put your microphone next to it too because there is a little bit of  mechanical noise

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, but you don't see it. Do you oh, this is the wrong camera. I'm an idiot. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I would never say that because you'd punch me  I'll show you i'll show you while she's setting that up here. This is there it is  This is the view I can double tap it to go full screen  Of my office just in the other room and what's cool about this?  Is um, you can zoom in you can pan tilt and zoom  Just with your finger, which is really cool or you can use the controller  It does a patrol

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It has it's 30 bucks. This thing is amazing and it stores like two weeks on the cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, two weeks for free in the cloud for free

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can have a pan scan which I turn that on and it'll automatically patrol  It also tags with motion and by the way, it doesn't store anything. There's no motion. There's no video  But you can turn it on and go live anytime  And what's really interesting about it is there's no website. It's all on the device on your on your phone  So there's it's kind of I feels a little more secure for that reason to me. I maybe not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you think it does use aes 128 encryption? Yeah  So it's not quite bank grade, but it's good  Um, and yeah, I I love it. I think it's for 30 bucks  Yeah, I wouldn't use it  Like all internet connected cameras my when I talked about it  I was like I have two places where I could see this being useful one is in my garage because when my garage door is like  help  Um, i've been open too long. I want to be able to see what's happening before I close it because I keep closing it on  my husband  and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is very thoughtful of you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it in 30 bucks that feels reasonable, um, although I don't need this one  I could use the 20 dollar one for that and then the other use case is when we're out on  Vacation just sticking it in my house. The thing I don't like about it is there is no privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't actually turn it off. Yeah the light so that's what I like about the lighthouse one either lisa or I are home  There's no camera  Otherwise, she does not like the idea of having a camera in the house. She won't accept it  So I can't put this in the house for instance

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's it panning all around and I was just showing how it's  It's 15 frames per second in the day and 10 at night. So it's not like  whoo  But it's it's good enough for 30 bucks. I'll show you I got it for the uh, the cat problem. I discussed last week

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I see what your cat's doing and people were very nice on twitter  No, she doesn't have an infection. She probably has a balance problem and gets confused in the box

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me show you one of the things so this is a view of my office from a distance  We're gonna zoom in a little bit  Um, which will degrade the picture. It's actually a better quality than that. But uh, you mentioned stacy the 15 frames  I don't think the motion is a big issue and I can zoom in there's a license plate  Watch this. Oops. I gotta take come here camera. You're going the wrong way go the other way. I'm trying to control it with my finger  Come on camera. Come on. Stop it. There you go  I can zoom in  There's a license plate  um there whoop  I gotta turn off the uh, the the pan and scan  And zoom out again so I can find it but there's a license plate that's at the at the end of the range I can read  So let me show you I mean it's way way far away  But this is enough resolution that if I zoom in

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  God damn it. Yeah flip your phone to the side. We can then see the whole image. Oh, yeah, you're right. Of course. What am I thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on go full screen  Huh, do you have it in portrait mode, uh, I probably have it turned off that I can do that. Hold on go back

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, somebody brought this up in the chat room. I don't know if this is true, but I have no reason to doubt them  Um, they say that the wise cam 2.0 has a 4d or 4d character limit on your password  Which I mine is sub 40 characters, but  I would not I would not buy this and have to change all of my device passwords  I'm really sorry about that. There's a there is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a license plate  Pretty far and it zooms away  Pretty far away. I have to say it's got time date standby. I think it's look turn off all that automatic stuff, right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you can turn off the automatic panning and all that stuff. I like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah for your cat you don't want to do that. You want to keep it pointing where it's pointing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you just would set on motion alerts. I assume for you and if you pop an sd card in there, it'll just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  It also uh somebody on reddit was complaining. Hey, I see it pinging china  And what I like is the developers were very responsive. They get right on and they said yeah on an android phone because there's no notification system  We on the apple phone. We use apple's notification system on the android phone  We have we have a paid service that happens to be out of china that does those uh,  Notifications for you. So that's why but the camp but the video is not sent to china

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right leo, does it have multiple camera views on the app? I only have one camera because I gave my other camera away. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, you know, I haven't set up the other ones. I would assume so but uh, I don't know. That's a good question. Why wouldn't it if  Um, I never assume anything. Yes, it does and i'll tell you why  It does because so i'll show you there's a devices page right now. I only have one thing in it, which is a named  Camera, but I could have more cameras there. Yeah, so it's in the devices page you can choose  And I don't know what the limit is but uh, i'll i'll you know, i'm sure it's a few you can see a history of notifications  The main thing is the price. I mean there are probably you know, this is probably the lighthouse is probably a better deal  I mean not a better deal a more powerful device  But it's a lot more expensive and you have to and you have to pay a monthly fee for subscription  There's no monthly fee for this, which is amazing to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey on on yours. I didn't see the wire going to the electric plug

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there is there is there is it's because it's on a white countertop

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I see. Okay. It's got a little micro usb port and plugs into the wall  For I think for 30 bucks  Somebody said hi web saying he has four cameras on on one app. So yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, someone's saying that these should not be considered for security because of their five-minute cooldown

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know what missing's talking about what that means

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Missing you'll have to explain more things say more  um  So yeah, this is I mean this this just seemed like a really  Fun thing. I would not keep it running all the time, but you sold one last week  Woo, yeah, and at a one percent commission three sets well, but you could have stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could have bought it through you or you leo  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to spend fourth week on the cruise. This is why i'm not rich  I don't i'm not spending time thinking about monetization particularly. I'm just trying to keep my head above water  Jeff jarvis, you have a number for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, so I just uh, no not really so i'm gonna fake this one  So I was going through uh links today and I saw that already search engine land is is gearing up  Be writing about the google 20th anniversary 20 years. Oh my god, when's that gonna be approaching?  Uh later this year, so we're gonna have the endless birthday festival google, but I did say, you know two decades of google man. That's that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's hard to believe that's amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, but still in gutenberg time it's only 1470. It's nothing what would we have done

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If there had been no google we'd still be using altavista  Uh, mine is not something I necessarily recommend but I think it's kind of interesting  uh  If you if you're encyclopedia botanica, you're really wondering what do we do in the 21st century?  There's this free thing called wikipedia that in many cases actually  Is is better and more up-to-date than encyclopedia botanica yet botanica has for years generation's been considered the  You know kind of definitive  Keeper of truth  so they've made a  They're gonna make some big bucks on this a chrome extension called botanica insights  And as you're in your search  As you're looking around on the right you'll get a new knowledge graph  with botanica content  So the same this is I guess in addition to the google and shall we search for something and see let's uh,  Let's see. Let's look for macedonia because macedonia is about to rename itself  because of the greek  There's the britannic insight above the knowledge card  from google  So if I want to learn more about macedonia in addition to the wikipedia entry, that's a good way to kind of  Make their assertion  You can at least compare the two. It's free  Britannica wikipedia britannica wikipedia  There's a little little tip for you something nandy or chrome everything in the cause of truth  Yeah, I think that they probably saw this as an opportunity to uh to jump on the truth bandwagon  So  I think that's a good way to do it
