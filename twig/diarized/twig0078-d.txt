Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not right.  Gene is first.  She's on the left.  I'm on the right.  The world is completely messed up now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's time you got the pride of the place.  Better billing for JJ.  Does anybody ever call you JJ?  Yeah, I've been working.  When you were little?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My friends, my mothers in school would call me Jarvis.  Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's very English public school of them.  Jarvis, get in here and shine my shoes.  Jeff Jarvis blogs at BuzzMachine.com.  He's also the author of What Would Google Do?  and is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  You better not.  And he's in his library today.  I like that.  You have a very nice...  There was an article in the Yale Alumni Monthly about somebody who stole a Yale Law School  dining hall chair and wrote and has it still.  And it looks like that chair over your right shoulder looks exactly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my father-in-law's, my late father-in-law's, Dennis Hoffa's chairs.  Oh, how...they're cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're very classic.  Yeah, they are.  Man, I wish Dennis Hoffa still had chairs like that.  Yep.  Take some of the sting out of the Root Canal.  And here is the lady who takes the sting out of every day.  She brings sunshine everywhere she goes.  Gina Trapani of SmarterWear.org.  You're in an office today.  What are you up to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm in my regular office.  Oh, okay.  I just, I don't take care of my internet connection.  I'll email you about that.  We'll upgrade your internet connection.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll talk about that.  But no, I'm just in my regular home office today.  Awesome.  Are you standing up?  I am standing up.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your desk is not what I envisioned.  It's looking at it on SmarterWear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I would have thought it would have been a little more oaky and neat.  What is it?  Oh, really?  Is it Ikea?  It's funny.  It is Ikea desk.  It's very high techy.  I don't know, but I just, you know, I don't know.  It wasn't what I pictured.  I'm just, it's nice.  It's nice.  I'm not knocking it.  It's nice.  But it just wasn't what I pictured.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, people looked at it and said, is this where you do twig from?  What the hell's the story?  It's just a table.  It's just a table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see the King's speech yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he built him a desk in Buckingham Palace.  Here's the picture of her desk.  Oh, yeah, this is a computer.  It's a classic computer desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's an Ikea desk that's like modular.  And I know there's a lot of wires in that picture.  I didn't stage that very well.  Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the shoes I'm worried about.  It looks like you jumped out of your shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I put the shoes for scale because I was trying to show that it was high up, you  know, because I raised it to standing.  Gina starts here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the shoes.  Gina's mysteriously been erased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you know, there is a program, Leo, that that program or Cleveland, I think,  worked on one to erase the people from Google Street View.  Yeah.  The neutron bomb program.  Right.  But it occasionally misses up and it leaves shoes and dogs with leeches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly what happened to Gina's desk.  It got neutron bombs.  She got neutron bomb.  So why work standing up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, because I'm using this program called Rescue Time, which kind of monitors what you  do on your computer, how many hours you spend and different things, which is interesting  in and of itself.  But it also gives you like emails you the end of the week and says you spent this many  hours at your computer.  So just shuttered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just he said, why don't you watch time on Twitter?  You know, I don't want to know.  There is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is that.  But the week before last, I get the weekly summary report and I find out that I was on  my computer for 48 hours that week, which isn't unusual.  So that's 48 hours that I'm sitting on my ever expanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think that it impacts your buttocks?  I think I'm sitting on a ball might help, but I don't know.  I mean, maybe maybe it's making you know, I never do you think, Eileen, that my am I  getting whiter?  Eileen, just give me such a spread.  So that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's more about my posture and it's just more about wanting to be like more more active.  I tend to kind of slump forward when I sit in my desk.  I just felt like I want to I want to burn more calories.  And you know, really what I want is that treadmill computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I was just going to say that.  I was just going to say that, Leo, you have to now send us all treadmills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the this is the mid step.  So you shouldn't go from like sitting to walking.  You should go to standing for a while.  So this is kind of the the the mid the mid level between the sitting and the treadmill desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, for you, I like standup desks and I think Thomas Jefferson, a lot of people used standup desks for years.  I would hear.  But maybe I could maybe in the new studio, I'll make this stand up because I don't I don't mind.  In television, I always work stand up.  The reason I sit on a ball is because it approximates that kind of live standing as opposed to sitting slumped in a chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, right. I mean, you you the part the ball works really well for you because you get the posture benefits and you're also your core is is always engaged.  Right. Because you're balancing the ball is actually really good.  It's a good idea.  I have to tell you, the first week, which was last week, I was in pain.  My feet really hurt. In fact, during the show, my feet hurt.  Good shows. Yeah.  Yeah. I mean, yeah.  That's why I have I have my running shoes on.  I bought one of those kind of squishy mats.  That's a good idea.  But this week, it's much easier.  So I've already lost like a pound and a half.  I mean, literally.  What?  What?  So that's really great.  I mean, I'm also sort of working on losing weight and other ways, like in the regular ways.  But I feel like there's just a more efficient way.  Oh, guacamole on the way to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, but no, look, this is what the other thing that I do with having the ball is great.  You get to get some weights and you have a round and every once in a while you can do, you know, there you go.  People at home listening are going, what the hell?  It's this week in sweat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will. I will crush my Macbook.  What I like to do is play the Glee soundtrack and just dance while I work.  Oh, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, please do it for us, Gina.  Please do it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've already danced for you.  Let's get physical.  You know, I tend to kind of shift and dance.  I want to get physical.  Exactly. Exactly.  That's what I'm talking about.  It just feels like more energy, you know, thinking on your feet, getting moving around, get the hip action going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think that's actually really true.  It's so easy to sit in a chair and slump.  And when you know you're spending 48 hours a week slumped in a chair, I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm all self-conscious.  I just bounce Jeff.  Jarvis the slug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anyway, the Internet is funny.  It's been a long time since I've written an article that got a lot of attention.  I haven't been a lifehacker for a while, but I wrote this article about a standing desk and it just got so much attention.  I just had you know, Internet is just such a funny place.  People are like, well, you're going to get varicose veins and there are health effects associated with standing too much.  People get so kind of like riled up about these things.  I didn't check with my doctor.  This is just sort of like I would like to stand, you know, a little more.  I'd like to mostly stand.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's really good.  It does hurt your feet after a while.  I always stood in television and that would be several hours a day.  This treadmill desk is very intriguing.  Somebody's making one, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there are desks that they built to fit on top of treadmills.  They're expensive though.  They're really expensive.  And then a lot of people, you know, will mod or buy some, you know, treadmill off of Craigslist or achieve one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is not that bad for a desk, $479.  But the idea is that you could then put it over.  Yeah, I don't know.  That's not going to work for me.  I can't imagine me doing the show like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you put it, you put the treadmill at a very, very low speed.  Right.  Well, obviously, otherwise you're really.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We actually enabled the chat room to control the treadmill.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If we start talking about glee, they speed it up in punishment.  Bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did want to, and I still may do this, attach an inflation pump to my ball that would be actuated by donations.  So if people gave money, the ball would inflate.  If they if they took away money, the ball would deflate.  And I could just be going up and down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How often do you have to inflate, Leo?  Oh, I inflate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no.  There's some seepage.  Something's not wrong about that.  But occasionally, every I'd say every month or so, I'll break out the pump and and inflate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, that's not bad.  That's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's very little leakage.  These things are pretty damn robust.  I might be a combo stand ball.  OK, well, there was a time Colleen, who used to be our studio engineer, found exercise balls from a company called Valeo.  They were cheaper, but they were not.  They were not.  They were not as good.  They were cheap Chinese knockoffs.  And I blew out two of them before I realized, you know what?  There really is a difference.  So you want to get one with thick walls.  So I sit on a brand that's called the Antiburst.  It's a Gopher Sport Antiburst UltraFit Stability Ball.  Hey, don't get me started, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anything that I make you want to stand, it's blown out two balls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing worse.  Because it's a...  It's this weekend ball.  There is a video on YouTube.  And what happens is basically it's like when somebody pulls out a chair, you go from zero to 60.  I mean, it's like there's nothing there.  And then you're on the ground.  I mean, it's just instant.  It's not like a sudden...  You know, there's no intermediate.  You're supported and you're not supported.  And this happened during a show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's video on YouTube.  I'm surprised you haven't seen it.  It's actually pretty funny.  Because what happened is I could hear a hissing.  This is...  Okay, another lesson.  I could hear a hissing and I thought, oh, you know me.  I'm a little bit of a clown.  So I thought, oh, this will be funny.  I'll sit on the ball and slowly descend.  Okay.  Okay.  These balls do not slowly deflate.  So I sat on the ball.  I sit there for a while and then it goes, boom, and I'm on the ground.  And I didn't hurt myself, but it was a humorous moment.  I'll show it after the show.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are many YouTube links in the chat room.  Oh, yeah.  The chat room knows all about it and they celebrate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let us talk about Google.  After all, that is why we are gathered here today.  It's so funny because I should let people know this.  Really for us, it's just a social hour, this show.  We just, you know, we're just getting together.  So we have to kind of force ourselves to talk about serious subjects because frankly, you know, we're just chatting away here.  But there is news.  You shared a really great link.  And I hope nobody gets fired at Google for this from the XTA Developers Forum.  Is XTA Developers like where you go to find out how to root your phone?  Oh, sorry.  That's my farm.  There we go.  Is this where you go to root your phone, Gina?  Is that what this kind of is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a place where there's advice and information and discussions about rooting and firmware mods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So somebody joined it with a phony name and there's only one post.  And the post is they claim to be a Google employee.  The post says the Samsung secret why Galaxy S phones in the U.S. are still running 2.1, which is, by the way, a huge source of dismay for Galaxy S.  Owners. I like the Galaxy S hardware.  He says, I'm going to step across the NDAs and explain the issues.  Does this person claim to work for Google?  I know at the end, some might wonder why I didn't deliver this over a more legitimate news channel.  The short answer, I don't want to lose my job.  However, I appreciate transparency, which is why I'm here.  This person could, I suppose, be working for Samsung, not Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Arrington would be happy to run the tech WikiLeaks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Arrington should.  Yeah.  If he would stop feuding with Josh Tepulski, maybe he could.  So Gina, explain the story here. What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the story is that the reason why the Samsung S owners don't have the latest version of Android, actually not the latest version, 2.2, right, which is Froyo.  The latest is 2.3.  Right. The latest is 2.3, right.  But these people just want 2.2, Froyo.  It is not a technological one.  It's a political one.  So now correct me if I'm wrong about how this works, Leo, but just to summarize that the issue is that this person is saying is that Samsung wants to charge users for the update for these new features.  So it doesn't want to push the over the air update could go out.  It's not a technical technological problem, but that Samsung wants to charge for the update because it's a feature update.  That's kind of the simplified version.  He explains he or she explains here that money change hands when there are different types of Android updates, there's critical, there's critical updates, there's maintenance updates and there are feature updates.  Right. And the update to 2.2 is considered a feature update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Critical updates are free because that means there's a problem.  And so they're going to they're going to do that.  Maintenance updates are basically free, but you have to pay a lot, he says, for feature updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what he's claiming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, if you go back, by the way, this comes from the days when you had a Motorola StarTAC phone and Motorola, you know, Motorola would send you a critical update or a maintenance update.  No big deal.  They're going to push that out.  The carrier is going to push that out and Motorola is not going to charge you.  They need to do that.  But if Motorola says, hey, we can add this shiny new feature to a StarTAC, but you got to pay us for that.  That was that made sense in that era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the Android era doesn't make sense because there's so many updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, it doesn't.  So so he says, now here's where the politics come in.  Most U.S. carriers aren't very happy with Samsung's decision to charge for Android updates as feature updates, especially since they're essentially charging for the for the Android open source projects efforts.  And the effort on Samsung's end is rather minimal.  As a result of perhaps corporate collusion, all U.S. carriers have decided to refuse to pay for Android to to update in hopes that the devaluation of the Galaxy S line will cause Samsung to drop their fees and give the update to the carriers.  The situation has panned out differently in other parts of the world, but this is the situation in the United States.  Now, there's a post of this.  There is an update at which I'm looking at the Gizmodo post about this.  And Gizmodo posted Samsung's official response.  Samsung does not charge carriers for updates to new versions of Android.  We are working to make the Android to to Froyo upgrade available to all U.S. Galaxy S owners as soon as possible.  Due to the complexity and unique functionality of each Galaxy S device, we are performing additional testing.  Samsung's feels it is important to make Android to to Froyo upgrade available only after we feel we can give the millions of Galaxy owners a simple and reliable upgrade experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Except they've done it already in Europe on essentially the same hardware, right?  Right. Right. So it's kind of not credible. Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I call it a brand problem. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because now, you know, I got my Galaxy tab and I'm you know, that makes me very nervous about living two years with this.  So they better be very, very strong.  Even if they were thinking about it, they better be very strong to pull back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they saying, Gina, that the Galaxy S devices in the U.S. are somehow different than the Galaxy S devices in Europe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, due to the complexity and unique functionality of each Galaxy S device, that's what that's what they seem to be talking about.  It just doesn't it doesn't make sense.  The whole thing is just crappy and it makes me even more determined to just sort of wait for the official, you know, whatever the official sort of Google devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, as we should point out that this Google device that's current, the Nexus S is a Samsung Galaxy S basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, right. Right. But Google says we'll keep it up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, what who pays that fee?  Because this is a T-Mobile phone manufactured by Samsung.  It's an official Google phone, not a not but it but still does T-Mobile pay Samsung for the updates on this thing?  I mean, I'm very confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good question. That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is this Google guarantees will be updated.  Maybe Google is going to subsidize it and say, well, if there's any carrier fee, we'll pay it for T-Mobile.  It's unlawful. Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm very right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It seems like it seems like Google would pay that fee, right, because they want to get out.  They want to sell the new phone with new operating system.  Speaking of my Nexus S still does not have gingerbread.  What? What the hell?  But that's a Google phone.  I know. And it was the next few weeks, several weeks ago.  What's up, Google? Come on.  What is up?  So maybe my plan to stick with Google devices isn't a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you got to stick with the latest Google device, apparently.  This is by the way, this hurts Android.  It does.  And it's up to Google to really if you want to protect Android, you got to solve this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there were stories this week about about the lag in updates across the entire product line.  And it's and it's really bad.  You know, you I have the latest version of the iPhone operating system, but I don't have the latest version of the Android.  And huge chunks of the customer base are left behind.  That's just no good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and Google, I'm going to I'm going to channel Google right now.  Google's response. I'm making this up.  Is that where you can always root the phone?  Well, because it's open, you can root it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That would be the unofficial Google engineer response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think it's kind of parallel to the response, given that's why we make it so easy to root.  So that if you want to do something, the carrier and or manufacturer don't support, well, no problem.  Just do it right.  Well, can I get the update?  That one? Yeah.  You go to XDA developers, you get the ROM.  And in fact, Gina, you could do that to the Nexus S or Nexus one rather.  Next one. Yeah, I could.  And somebody who has a Galaxy phone, I presume, can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That still makes it into a geek device. That's point one percent point zero zero zero one percent of their audience is even capable of knowing what a root is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that after all what people are saying about Android versus iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's that's not a business model.  No, the business model has to be that this thing is simple.  You do it. It is taken care of.  It's done.  And that's the beautiful thing about Google updates is they just do just happen.  You don't have to do the manual. They do just happen.  They should happen. Google.  I don't understand architecturally why it's so hard, why it takes so long to mod a new version for a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't get it. Well, the story with Gingerbread is they haven't open sourced it yet.  Right. Two point three is not yet.  You have to wait till the source drops.  Then the manufacturers will get the chance.  So the sources drop for two to so allow them a month to or whatever to hack their apps to work with to two if they need to.  I can understand that. But two two has been out for six months for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's been out quite some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, here's here's Google's information on the distribution of Android versions.  Eighty seven point four percent of Android phones are now at two point X.  Up from fifty five percent in July and more than half of all phones out there are using Froyo two point two, which has been out for seven months, according to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's low.  That's my point.  Yeah. And that probably that ninety five percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is global. I'm sure if you had that number in the US only, it would be a much lower share.  Although the droid, the droid, incredible, the Evo 4G and all and the desire are all updated.  Right. Froyo's share in one month, on August twenty ten, Froyo's share grew from five point five percent to twenty eight percent when the big droid droid, incredible, Evo 4G and desire phones got updated.  I don't know. I think this is a big problem for Google because I think I'm starting to hear customers complain.  I think they are more aware than one would guess of what version they are using.  And that doesn't sit well for people if a later version is available is out but not available on their hardware.  That's they don't like it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I guess in some. Go ahead, Gina.  No, I was just going to say it's it's a it's a it's frustrating. It's very frustrating.  I want gingerbread. Yeah.  Of course you do. So compare this to Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So Apple is going to come out with the iPhone for one presumed soon.  There'll be a new operating system.  Apple in the past has delayed the operating system rollout to earlier devices by some time.  Right. Two, three months.  So I guess it's not that different from Apple or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's different because you know it's going to happen.  Yes. Yes.  So you buy an iPhone, you know, well, I'm going to have what I have.  So that's simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a matter of communications and transparency about how you operate,  which by God, Google should do and the phone company should do.  I dream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never knew you were such a dewy eyed optimist.  A little Pollyanna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was on Glee there for a moment.  But the moment is a leak.  Oh, I was. I was the lead in my high school play.  Oh, yeah. What was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't say don't say I'm guessing you were Nathan Detroit in Guys and Dolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Woody Allen's Don't Drink the Water.  I was Walter Hollander.  Perfect.  An irascible Jewish caterer from Newark, New Jersey, of which there are no none left.  Did you did you do the Woody?  Jackie Gleason played the part in the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many how many how many?  Love Jackie Gleason.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll figure.  Sorry for that interlude there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, like I said, it's just us getting together.  Just chatting. Just chatting.  It's just us. If I could put a fence up for us to it's a coffee clutch.  It's it's a cracker barrel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cracker barrel.  Oh, I could use my Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, is the iPhone update different because Apple delivers it through iTunes?  It's been a really long time since I've had an iPhone.  But when you upgrade your iPhone, you do it by syncing through iTunes on your computer, right?  It doesn't happen over the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does not do OTA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Apple controls this process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not only does Apple control it, they pay the bandwidth.  Right.  And, you know, you they clearly extorted that from AT&T as a condition of getting the iPhone.  And they control and they were in the position to do it.  And this was always my complaint a little bit about how Google handled Android was that they didn't.  Well, I wish Apple had made an open GSM phone, but they wouldn't have been able to do this.  Google made the open phone and as a result doesn't have the ability to extort that.  Right.  Anybody can do an Android phone.  Google doesn't have to say.  So what are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's the Google.  But but but only the phones that get the Google logo have to meet certain requirements.  Right. So Google could use that to make to create situations that treat users better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you tell me which phones have the Google logo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, no, no, no.  But that's a pretty big deal.  I mean, the major the major manufacturers are are are doing that.  Right. I mean, they're they're they're getting they want in the ad they want to say powered by Google.  That's I think a big thing.  Yes. No. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I guarantee you.  That's why Verizon spent so much money on the droid campaign to create a brand that is not a Google brand.  It's a very strong brand, by the way, even Regis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw that.  I saw that.  You were spectacular.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You were spectacular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I showed Regis the Atrix, the Motorola phone, and he said, is it droid?  Is it droid?  Is it droid?  And I was kind of to be honest, I was a little taken aback.  It's like, what? You know that?  But that shows you the effect.  I mean, look at Regis.  He's 80 years old.  He's he's not tech literate.  In fact, when I was you'll see next couple of weeks, I'm going to show him how to tweet.  And when I said, OK, now you click the tweet button with the mouse, he literally lifted the mouse up and started to go to the screen.  So, yeah, so he's not I mean, look at not to knock Regis.  He's an amazingly sharp, very sad, with it.  Great. One of the great performers of all time.  So I'm not knocking him up, but I'm saying he's not a computer whiz.  And even he knew is it a droid Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So hey, Lucas Films to build that brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They built a brand and it doesn't say powered by Google droid powered by Google.  It's droid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but it was droid with Google.  I mean, I don't know.  I think the Google brand does have a lot a lot of sway there.  And I wish that Google would would would take the tact that they take with video codecs with Android a little more and kind of insisted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's talk about each dot two sixty four.  Now it's been a week.  We've absorbed the the dropping of age to sixty four.  We talked a lot about if you didn't hear last week's twig.  Kevin Marks was on.  He was great. He explained it all.  We've had time to think about it.  Do either of you feel a little bit better about Google dropping age dot two sixty four?  I'll say upfront, I kind of do.  I kind of I kind of maybe I'm a true believer, but I kind of think that they took a pretty big hit in the name of openness.  You feel better, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They definitely took a pretty big hit.  We were we were pretty hard on them.  I do.  I do feel a little better about it.  Although I have to say I have to say I'm just looking at the Engadget article now.  They did they kind of they issues are a public defense.  Well, it wasn't a very it wasn't very public, was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was public, but I don't think it was that compelling.  They basically just reiterated, no, we did this for openness.  I don't think that they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the core of this argument is like we're not evil.  Like we're doing this thing that could be interpreted as evil or not.  Just trust us.  Our motives are not evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think that's a good argument.  Trust us.  We're not evil.  Trust us.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, we can't we care about the future of the web.  We want to make it open.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, I mean, it carried water for me because I believe fundamentally that that's true.  I know too far too many Google people, which is always a mistake.  I admit it.  In fact, one of the things I've always done in my career is distance myself from the companies I cover,  because once you start knowing them and liking them, it's very hard to believe ill of them.  Amen.  So maybe I know them too well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I admit to that too.  Possibility as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But all the engineers I know at Google really are highly committed to open.  And so I find it.  I mean, even if corporate says no for business reasons, I think that that's not going to they're not going to the troops at Google are not going to go along for the ride.  And I do believe you could say, look, we understand Web M may be slightly may be slightly encumbered, may not be desirable.  Yes, nobody's using Web M.  No browser supports it.  But we want to put a, you know, a flag in the sand.  We want to say opens better.  If there's going to be some pain, we're going to suffer some pain.  I understood their argument why we're but don't don't confuse flash.  Because we said that this de facto helps flash.  But they said, OK, yes, maybe.  But don't confuse flash with H.  Two sixty four.  These are different things.  What we're talking about is the video.  And I did say this last week.  It's the video bracket bracket video bracket thing.  What is H.  Five going to do when it sees bracket video bracket and you can all add plugins, you can all add plugins for every codec you want.  That's fine.  But we want to put a stake in the sand to say, well, what it should do is use Web M.  It should use an unencumbered open standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that a different way to say it, Leo?  Is that is that that's a default rather than support?  They said we're going to stop supporting H.  Two sixty four.  We're not going to we're going to make it a plug in the codec with it.  But default to Web M.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you use Windows and Chrome, you don't it will support H.  Two sixty four because Windows builds in the codec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the Chromium project never supported H.  Two sixty four there, nor did Mozilla.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did more nor did Mozilla.  But the Chromium and Chrome are different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  So Chrome is the Google product that they're going to ship like.  So they used to support H.  Two sixty four Chromium didn't.  But now they're not.  I think honestly, this is just a this is just a bad PR move.  I think that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you could say it differently and say we're default to open now and would have been everybody would have hugged him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the problem is it's too technical of it.  I think that kind of was what they're saying.  But it's just technical.  They said bracket video bracket.  But I don't think most people, you know, most even technical people say understand the difference between a plug in and native support and the pro.  You know, there has never been in HTML a definition of what happens when you see video in every case up until now.  When you see video, you have to have a plug in the browser.  HTML does not support video.  HTML does not support video.  HTML 5 will support a video tag.  What happens when that tag happens?  What does a browser do?  Does it go out and launch a plug in?  Well, it could.  In fact, it will have to in Safari.  It will have.  In fact, and that's why Google says we're going to make WebM plugins for Safari.  We're going to make a WebM plugin for I9.  But that's interim.  The real question is if it's a HTML 5 browser and it runs across a tag, it has no plugins, is no flash, is nothing installed.  What's it going to do when it sees video?  And we believe that all browsers should say should default to a baseline of WebM.  That's fine.  If you want to add more, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem here is the precedent set by Apple, right, with flash.  It sounded like that.  Oh, you're right.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  You hit the nail on the head.  In the context of what Apple did, it sounded like they were doing the same thing.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the PR problem they had.  And so that was so easy to say, you can install whatever you want, folks, but we are now going to default to open.  We're doing fine.  Perfect.  You're right.  We're going to not support Azure 64.  That sounds like such a Steve Jobs thing.  Love you, Steve.  Hope you're better.  But, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They should hire us to do their PR.  Yeah, I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think that they expected the backlash that they got.  You know, like some project manager kind of posted this on the Chromium blog.  I don't think they maybe expected the response that they got.  I think that's the case.  And this is one of the reasons I kind of like Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not that polished, actually.  Right.  You see it all the time.  They'll launch three products on the same day because they didn't coordinate.  You think they would get Esquire's worst dressed award as a company, do you think?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They wear corduroys.  They wear saddle shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or I don't know what the modern equivalent of saddle shoes and corduroys is.  Saddle shoes.  I'm sorry.  God, I'm sorry.  I wore those in like first grade.  I remember my saddle shoes.  They wear, they wear ThinkGeek t-shirts and chinos.  Yes.  And sneakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I like that about them.  I kind of, you know.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another name.  I'm going to do it again.  Name drop.  And I said, that's good, Regis.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You're going to get a typo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to get a typo.  You're going to get a typo.  You're going to get a typo.  You're going to get a typo.  You're going to get a typo.  You're going to get a typo.  When it's not perfect, people know, oh, Regis must have done this because nobody, the paid  tweet, that he calls a tweet-a-rella, the woman who's paid to tweet for them is going  to make sure it's perfect.  Right?  If you have a good PR firm, if your PR strategy is great, you don't make stumbles like this.  I love it.  It's authentic.  It's real.  It means that Google is just some, a bunch of engineers.  Yeah.  Ill coordinated.  Wearing saddle shoes.  I just put the link to dress like Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's actually, no, tell me what.  I put up the link on the, on, on, on right, right there.  I'm not really sure.  I just saw Mark Zuckerberg, fashion for men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Esquire says, Mark Zuckerberg, Russell Brand and Joaquin Phoenix are the worst dressed.  Well, I don't care about Russell Brand, although I love Russell Brand and I think Joaquin's  fantastic.  And again, I liked him because of what he did on that Letterman thing where he was willing  to be a complete jerk.  No, if he had asked his PR department, Hey, should I go on Letterman as this character  in this movie that's going to come out in a year and completely confuse everybody and  make them think I'm a drug addict?  Do you think that's a good idea?  The PR guy would have said, no way.  What are you nuts?  I like it that he was more concerned with his acting than he was with his career.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is the thing, and I can't believe I'm going to defend Zuckerberg, but I kind  of like that Zuckerberg refuses to, I mean, he lets his ideas speak for himself.  You know, and I say this as a nerd who hates getting dressed up and like, I kind of appreciate  the fact that he's just like, I'm going to let my work speak for myself.  I'm going to dress the way that I feel comfortable and this is the way I want to present myself.  I kind of like that he's no compromise about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can bet that the Winklevoss twins will never be caught dead and slip on Adidas sandals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not saying I like the sandals.  I'm just saying I like the general attitude, although it could be considered condescending.  I think he had a meeting with the president and wouldn't put, or no, he interviewed Bush  and he didn't put on a suit.  That's something I probably would have put on a suit before.  You wear a tie.  For the rest of it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Celebrity style hall of shame.  We've already discussed the Facebook muppets.  They called him a muppet.  Sartorial choices at some length.  Hell, we even suggested him as a stylish Halloween costume.  But just to reiterate, no matter how much money you have or how many people's secrets  you hold in your digital palm, you cannot show up to a black tie event in a t-shirt  and jeans and expect to be taken seriously.  Maybe not by the guys in the black tie, but I could tell you as a nerd, I love it.  I think that's just, that's fantastic.  There's Joaquin Phoenix.  Nick Cannon.  I think Nick looks all right.  The green tie I could get.  I'm sorry.  Ed Westwick's shoes don't even match.  Jared Leto.  That's a good look.  He's in good company.  Skip the ad.  Thank you.  Okay.  I think he's in good company.  Charlie Sheen, David Spade and Nicolas Cage.  John Mayer.  Oh, plaid pants.  That's one thing Mark never did, plaid pants.  Yeah, thankfully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think he did his hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, if you go to markbymarkzuckerberg.com,  it was a store put up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like his fashion brand.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, boys, boys, don't do that.  All right, let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Instructing all the young male geeks.  No, no, you can be like Mark without dressing like him.  Carry the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bathrobe, plain white socks, so far so good.  Adidas flip flops, elastic jeans.  The best thing is the bottom.  I'm sorry.  Elastic jeans are for pregnant women, not for men.  That's true.  I'm sorry.  A sweet tie.  The Mark by Mark.  I want this.  I would buy this T-shirt right now.  The Mark by Mark Zuckerberg Fashion for Men.  I would, if that really were real, I'd buy it.  I think you can.  I'm buying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They should have, it should say a Mark Zuckerberg production.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A Zuck.  You can.  $23 canvas tote.  American Apparel.  Wow.  But it's not made, I love that.  Fashion for Men.  Mark by Mark Zuckerberg.  I want the scent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Again, young male developers, do not admire the man's ideas,  not his clothing.  You do not have to dress like Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, you go to a meeting.  You've got a million dollar venture fund.  You want to invest in somebody who's going to make the next big thing.  Are you saying you're looking at him,  he's wearing a natty blazer and gray slacks, tasseled loafers.  You give him money?  Hell no.  That's the Winklevoss twins.  Yeah.  You say, who'd you steal the idea from?  You say, okay, who are you going to sue?  Because that's the one I want to invest in.  Who'd you, the Goldman sack?  The Goldman sack, isn't that great?  I admit I don't wear the Adidas shower slippers ever.  Does Mark wear those?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, with socks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh!  With socks, which is a worse offense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's doing that purposefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was his great line about the social network,  was that the one thing they did get right was his wardrobe.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, so now Sorkin decides that Zuckerberg is a good guy?  Now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, his acceptance speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, on the Golden Globes, he thanks Mark Zuckerberg?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and so did Rudin, the producer,  thank him for letting us use his life to make a point about social relationships today.  Oh, B.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's so much butt kissing, so much butt kissing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, oh, Hollywood, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Mark is a real person.  Yeah, he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cynical little worms.  Hollywood.  They suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, I have to say that I think we came to this conclusion  that the social network was the best thing that ever happened to Mark Zuckerberg.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the fact that it beat Inception is criminal.  Criminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You thought Inception was a good movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did.  Did you not like Inception?  I loved Inception.  I was surprised that it beat the social network.  I was offended.  Do you not like Inception, Leo?  Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.  This may be the first time that Leo and I really kind of diverged.  Yeah, we do have similar tastes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not going to get you complicated.  Why, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a terrible movie.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The characterizations were so thin, they misused Ellen Page.  She could have been somebody in that movie.  Instead, she was a cardboard cutout.  The plot was absolute.  I mean, I followed it.  I wasn't one of those people saying, what's happening?  I don't understand.  Where's it going on?  I figured you would.  I completely understand recursion, Gina, and it was basically recursion.  I understand recursion.  It was recursion.  So I wasn't confused.  In fact, the minute I saw the little, when he washed up on the shore,  and I saw that the top, I immediately grok what was happening.  It was going to end with the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It wasn't that deep.  The whole thing was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I got the whole movie right in the first two minutes.  However, I thought not...  Okay, I know I'm completely upstream on this one, but...  Hey, what about that Mark Zuckerberg Tunisian protest sign?  Isn't that great?  Changing the subject very quickly.  Thank you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could you please explain this?  I don't understand.  I don't...  Jasmine revolution.  Thank you.  Good.  Mark Zuckerberg by Fazazah Feza Tunisian people.  Versus Ali Bad.  Versus Ali Bad.  I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's a huge argument going on right now.  You have Genni Morozov is fighting against Andrew Sullivan and Clay Shirky,  where you have the Shirky and Sullivan are the Twitter triumphalists accused thereof.  They aren't really as strong as you think, but they're saying they're giving credit to  Twitter and to Facebook for its role in Tunisia.  Whereas Morozov in both Iran and now is saying, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're far overdoing  it.  Well, I understood the argument in Iran, which was that all of the quote during the Iranian

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Green Revolution, all the quote protesters were in the UN.  Because why weren't they writing in Farsi?  I mean, they weren't even they were writing in English.  That was that was Peyton.  That was obvious.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But the fact is, there are people there in Tunisia who are thanking Mark Zuckerberg for  having Facebook, which is pretty incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's pretty clear that both I don't I disagree with the argument that Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who was it wrote that in the New Yorker?  The Twitter supports the same thing.  Twitter.  Who was it wrote that in the New Yorker?  The Twitter supports the status quo as opposed to big hair, big hair guy.  Yeah, Malcolm Gladwell.  I'm glad.  Well, not not glad.  Well, that's that's that's the international symbol for Malcolm Gladwell.  You got to move your fingers. Yes.  Gina, if I had seen Inception with you, I might have liked it.  It was probably just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, what sad is, I think that Jeff agrees with you.  It's almost like two on one.  I don't even have a shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm I'm I liked it.  I liked it. I don't think it was brilliant.  I don't I you know, even God Social Network versus Inception.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Social Network is actually a better movie.  Much better. Oh, wow.  Like twenty.  Eileen, you disagree, too?  She OK. So maybe I'm just not a geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just it's probably the I think that I'm just dumb because I blew Inception.  Like I really enjoyed it.  You're my mind.  It did. I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So clearly I'm just like see the matrix blew my mind.  I walked out of the matrix going.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  I walked out of Inception going, who cares what happens to the top?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really?  Oh, see, I spent an hour discussing the top.  Did it fall over at the end?  Is it real?  Is it not real?  Is it in time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  And then he said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  I was in Google Wave discussing it with a friend of mine.  Here's my my buddy is a big sci fi fan in Google Wave having a threaded  conversation about that inception and what all the symbolism meant.  And I was like, I think Google Wave is a metaphor for inception, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And somebody screwed up below.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody screwed up in the basement.  Somebody messed up in the basement.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  This is a this is a discussion that I'm sure I will hear about in Twitter.  And people say you lose your your your geek cred if you don't like Inception.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I think it actually proves that you are a super geek.  You're a more highly evolved geek.  Yeah, I think so, too.  Had the top thing in the first three minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I immediately got the recursion.  It was like, oh, come on.  Well, because I knew it was a time travel.  I kind of knew a little bit of the I guess I probably read some a blurb somewhere.  And I you know what?  I here's what I went in.  I said because I knew people were confused by the movie.  I said, OK, so this is a confusing movie.  Let me see if I could figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it was so you were proactively.  I was thinking about modeling.  Is this going to make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  OK, look at already on Twitter.  Last Leo Laporte hates Inception.  Anyone want to troll the guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Too lazy to do the trolling themselves.  They're trying to get through.  That's right.  Do it.  I'm so bored.  I don't really want to troll him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if anybody would like to please go right.  Be my guest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's a good reason to troll Leo.  Thank you.  Welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me mention Squarespace.com.  We're going to come back.  Gina Tripani from SmarterWear.org is here and Lifehacker.com.  And of course, Jeff Jarvis from Buzz Machine.com.  We're talking about Twitter, Google, the cloud, Facebook.  If it's on the net, this show, we talk about it.  Movies, anything, Chipotle, anything.  Squarespace.  I'd like to talk about Squarespace.  Squarespace.com, they call themselves a secret behind  exceptional websites.  I would agree for several reasons.  First of all, Squarespace is hosting plus software.  So you need to understand that.  They will host your website.  Of course, you can have your own domain name and everything.  But then they have this great software.  It's a content management system.  But I don't know if that does it justice.  The best way to do this, go to Squarespace.com slash twig.  And there's a big green card.  Try it for a button rather.  Try it for free.  You don't need a credit card.  Just make up a site name.  Give it a password.  Give it an email address.  They don't collect those.  That's just so that if you forget your password, they can  email it back to you.  And then a little bit of a, you know, one of those things so  that you don't have to be, it can't be a robot.  And once you do all that, you can set up a site.  I mean, for two weeks, no cost, no charge, full site.  You'll be starting with these incredible templates that  Squarespace uses.  There's 60 plus designer styles.  Very easy to modify the templates.  So you start with a template, but you are in complete  control, and that's nice.  Even if you don't know anything about web design, you can make  it look like your own.  I just read an article that said, people, you should trust  yourselves.  You don't need to run out and get a designer.  You should trust your eye.  Let, you know, do it yourself first.  I thought that was kind of interesting.  And this certainly makes it possible.  Using Ajax for drag and drop and so forth.  It's got great stats.  An iPhone and iPad app make it so easy not only to post, but  to monitor your site, your stats, kill spam if it should  appear, photo galleries, forms.  It's really powerful.  Easy to use, very easy to try.  And then if you decide you like it, just take that site you  built and say, OK, let's make it active.  Let's make it, I mean, it's active already, but let's keep  it.  $12 a month, and you can take 10% off when you use a promo

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  code 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can take 10% off when you use a promo code twit on  checkout.  Or if you subscribe for, that's for one year, if you  subscribe for two years, $10.67 a month minus 10%.  So it's like $9 a month.  Squarespace.com slash twig, the secret behind exceptional  websites, we use it for our twit blog.  And I have to tell you, after wrestling with some of these  other content management systems, I'm tempted to just  use it for everything.  It's really great.  Squarespace.com slash twig.  Try it yourself.  Google has grabbed a Kinect researcher from Microsoft.  I thought that was kind of interesting.  You think it was for the brains, or you think they  actually want to do something with Kinect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they have a game portal coming up, but I think he's more  of a researcher brains kind of guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Johnny Chung Lee, there he is in a Krispy Kreme hat.  And you love that, don't you?  That's actually at Google.  You can go to one of the cafeterias and get a Krispy  Kreme hat.  And then they have those Krispy Kreme donut burgers.  You ever try one of those?  Mmm.  That'll kill you.  Oh, jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That'll get you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Better than Chipotle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is exciting.  It's really bad news for Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, hey, hey, fighting words, mister.  Oh, come on.  Have you ever tried, OK, you slice a Krispy Kreme in half,  you fry it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I can't take the whole sweet beef thing.  Oh, no, it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's sweet and savory together.  It's perfect.  Oh, that's why peanut butter and jelly is so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, there's something a lot less wrong with peanut butter  and jelly than a donut.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He apparently, Johnny was a Wii hacker, developed head  tracking on the Wiimote, among other adaptations.  So you're right.  It's about brains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to see Kinect-like gesture recognition  on Android someday.  That would be really cool.  And your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that that solves the TV problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google TV.  I want that there.  Google TV.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, I've used Kinect on the Xbox 360,  and I have to say it's a little frustrating.  For instance, when you want to exit out,  you have to hold your hand up,  but because it doesn't want to have...  The problem is accidental gestures.  So it has to do something so that it can be done  by doing something so that it can distinguish  between an intentional and accidental.  And the way it does it is you hold your hand up  and then you pause, and then it knows,  oh, I see the hand and then a little clock goes,  and it's only a second or two,  and then it goes, okay, I get it.  You really are holding your hand up,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  not just going like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  But it loses you sometimes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not trying.  And it's like yet another progress bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  You don't want to look at another progress bar yet.  So there is that issue, maybe Johnny can do it,  of issuing between the two.  I love on Dance Central when you go like this  and you swipe.  Yes.  So you move your hand up and down to select an item  and then you swipe.  And it's just very natural.  Feels good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And very satisfying, yeah.  Maybe just because it worked, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ooh, I'm satisfied it actually worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what you want in life is the pad with no pad.  You want all the same gestures to be able to work in life.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  You're saying multi-touch in life.  So now people will walk down the street  not just talking to themselves on a headset.  Oh, God.  They'll talk to a computer  and they'll start to swipe you suddenly in the ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was at Regis, I was going to demo the Nintendo 3DS  and they had an augmented reality demonstration  they wanted to do.  And I said, look, I only have five minutes.  You want me to explain augmented reality  in 30 seconds?  This would take the whole segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  I was impressed with Leo and the whole thing  but just from the first second  you didn't let them waste a second gabbing.  You knew you had to get the stuff in  and you took charge and said, here's the first one.  Right, you have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you did.  You kept it on track.  You really did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's not just me.  You don't see this, but off camera  Michael Gellman, the producer,  has a whiteboard that says Next on it.  He holds it up and if you don't move on  he starts tapping it like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can imagine that would be stressful.  Basically everybody...  Does he do that in the Twit Cottage?  No, she doesn't.  Eileen is not doing that?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eileen, you can control him.  Try it.  One of the reasons...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, she can't.  One of the reasons I created Twit  was in direct response to mainstream media's  desire to...  Don't get into the details.  Nobody wants to know that.  Show us pretty pictures.  Yeah, you're exactly right.  There was an article about an interview  with Roger Ailes, the head of Fox News,  in which the...  You probably read this, Jeff,  in which the writer talked about the fact  that Roger doesn't have the sound on  when he watches Fox or any television  because he says if you can't grab me  with the sound off in eight seconds  or actually he said three seconds,  then you don't have any talent on TV.  It's very visual, right?  And people were stunned by this  and I said if you knew anything about TV  you'd know no television executive  ever has the sound on.  Everything's about hair and visuals.  Yeah, I know, and this is why,  unfortunately, mainstream media...  Good thing I'm on Twit.  Yeah, we're about ideas.  Well, you have very nice hair.  Oh, thank you.  But we're about ideas.  And even the chat room sometimes is going  next, next, next, next, next, next, next.  I mean, a lot, in fact.  But we're here to talk.  But we love your chat room.  Oh, we do, and I understand it,  but I like the leisurely pace.  Yep, I like the leisurely pace.  Yep, I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think it deserves...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're saying it right now, by the way.  They're saying it right now.  They're the smart-ass chat room.  Next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next,  next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next,  next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next,  previous.  Somebody said previous.  I like that.  You're all so fucked.  Previous.  Next is S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Next is S.  They're clever in that chat room.  Well, this is this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What we do, we do for smart people, right?  We assume that you care about this stuff.  You're intelligent.  You're willing to spend a little time with it.  We are all ADD.  We accept that.  But we also assume that there's some interest in intelligence  and that's exactly what mainstream media...  Well, Jeff, you reviewed TV for years.  Yeah, I don't...  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it was...  Watching the Golden Globes, I tweeted that I'm so glad  I don't cover showbiz anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's brain dead.  It's...  I didn't see it, but I understand Ricky Gervais  was like very dismissive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's much controversy about that.  And the Brits are saying, welcome to British humor, folks.  He's not all kiss-assy and sucky and he's...  That's why we love him.  I agree, but the stars did not.  The funny thing about it is it's become,  like everything else these days, political.  I saw a story today that says that the right-wing bloggers  and TV folks love that Gervais stuck it to liberal Hollywood.  Ha-ha, it's liberal Hollywood, eh?  But John Stewart also said that he loved it.  He loved it.  So he was...  I thought he was very funny, but he was mean.  Oh, yeah, he was mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he was mean.  I loved him, though.  I thought he was hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He didn't disclaim, did he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure that he did.  No, he didn't.  But I wouldn't even forgive him that.  I'm a New Yorker.  I like that kind of humor.  I work for Denton, so the British humor, I get it.  It's not just British.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you talking about here?  All right, google.com.  Let me see.  Are they doing the Google Doodle Day?  Yeah, they are, because it's Cezanne.  It's Cezanne's birthday.  This is a good Google Doodle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love how going to google.com is like visiting the museum.  Like, let's see what's on...  Yeah, because nobody ever visits it normally.  Because no one actually goes there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you see the word Google in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep, I see it.  G-O-O-G-L-E.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the style of Paul Cezanne, and it's his 172nd birthday,  they're doing a contest.  It's the Google Doodle for Student Competition.  And you could win thousands of dollars.  Let's ask the Christian Science Monitor what's going on.  It's weird that Google links to the Christian Science Monitor.  That is the first result.  Today, Google announced its fourth annual  Doodle for Google Competition.  They're asking art students across the country  to draw, sketch, Photoshop or finger paint their own logo,  $15,000 scholarship for the winning entries,  and a $25,000 technology grant for their school.  Wow.  That's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One talented kid will have his or her picture  posted on the Google homepage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The judges, Google staff, and Whoopi Goldberg,  ice skating champ Evan Lysacheck,  and Garfield creator Jim Davis.  Last year, a third-grader won.  Mackenzie Melton.  Here's her Google Doodle.  That's pretty cool for a third-grader.  That's very nice.  Very nice.  From El Dorado Springs, Missouri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is, when you end up with these things,  you end up with a million crushed little kids.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had one of them a few years ago.  Really?  My daughter, yeah, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've got to explain that there's probably  a million entries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're a kid.  You're a little kid.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm proud of what you've done.  I remember when I collected...  Google, crushing the dreams of children.  ...a bunch of cornflakes box tops.  You didn't get an A. You're nowhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sharing my deepest childhood trauma with you.  Sorry, sorry.  Let's go ahead.  Sorry, Luke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's my fault.  It's all right.  I'm not going to talk about it.  I collected a bunch of cornflakes box tops

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to get a Mr. Potato Head,  and it never came, and I'll never get over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I hate Tour Story 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's it.  We're sending you Mr. Potato Heads.  No, no, please, no!  He's ready for the onslaught.  No, I don't want them!  Tweet Cottage.  Look up the address, kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All I can say is when Mr. Potato Head  went from an actual potato to a plastic potato,  they lost me.  I want my Mr. Potato Heads to rot on the shelf.  So, Social Network, we didn't really say who won.  Social Network won four Golden Globes.  Golden Globes are, we don't even know who they are.  They're the Hollywood Foreign Press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, which means it's nothing.  The guy who got up had no accent anymore  from the association.  He's been living here too long.  Yeah, it's a dozen people who are hangers on  from strange foreign lands.  Oh, is that you?  Oh, it's some small number.  But somebody came along and said,  we need another award show.  There's this crazy Golden Globes thing  and it's been blown up into other ridiculous things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And because it comes before the Oscars,  which of course is intentional,  it carries this weight because it's like,  is it a precursor of...  So, best motion picture drama, Social Network,  I think we can all agree,  for whatever its flaws,  that's going to be best picture this year, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ooh, Gina.  Inception.  Inception?  I shall, I still argue in Inception.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whatever you think about Inception,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hollywood does not give science fiction movies  best picture awards.  I mean, they don't have a chance.  I will accept that.  I wrote it up to like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought that the nerd movie of the year was Inception,  although now I'm rethinking that.  No, no, it can be the nerd movie of the year.  I can't think of a more nerdy movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's definitely the nerd movie.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I wouldn't argue that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You wouldn't argue that,  but you think that Social Network was a better film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Overall.  And remember,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  both Jeff and I were kind of nasty about it.  Oh, I still think morally,  I had a problem with it.  It was morally reprehensible,  yet in a vacuum,  it was a well-made film with a great script.  It was such a cynical act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why Sorkin and Rudin on the Golden Globe  is just so much better.  And Rudin on the Golden Globe  just upsets me so much more.  We used you, Mark Zuckerberg,  and oops, people do like you.  We didn't manage to destroy you.  Never mind.  So we like you now, too.  Yeah.  It was even more a cynical act.  It doubled the cynicism.  It doubled the cynicism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right.  Best motion picture drama,  best motion picture director,  best screenplay.  I don't know what the fourth one is,  but they won four.  And best original score.  That's a Trent Reznor score.  Black Swan, Natalie Portman for best actress.  I love The King's Speech.  Have you seen that yet?  That's a great movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great film.  Great movie.  And Colin Firth won best actor.  I don't know why.  This isn't the show for the Golden Globe results.  I'm going to stop right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but Glee,  to top TV honors.  Oh, but Glee.  But Glee, let's just get that in there.  Jane Lynch's acceptance speech, hilarious.  Oh, I didn't see any of it.  You realize it's actually not all the writers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jane Lynch was on a plane.  I didn't see any of it.  So what did she say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, she was just really funny  and I would try to reenact it,  but I will just absolutely ruin it.  But she made just really some very, very funny,  like very Sue Sylvester-like jokes.  She's been for writer  and then she delivered these incredible lines,  funny lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's really, it's funny.  She's, Jane Lynch is such a wonderful actress  and has done so many great movies,  but she's really found her character,  her persona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, she has.  She was Sue up there.  It was really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She was Sue.  Well, of course she's Sue now.  I love it, that TV ad  where she kicks the kid off the bench.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, she said something like,  you know, when I'm not too busy eating,  I really appreciate all this,  all the good things that Glee has done for me.  It was very funny.  You look it up on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would, except this video is no longer available  because this YouTube account associated with this video  has been terminated  due to multiple third-party notifications  of copyright infringement.  Sorry about that, says YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of course, I was too busy squealing  and jumping up and down,  so maybe my recollection of it is better than it actually was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it a squeal or a squee?  A squee, a squee.  A squee is specific to fangirls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, which I am.  Tween fangirls, which is what I become.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I was really,  my wife was very upset this morning  because she got an email.  She's not a member of LinkedIn.  She got an email from LinkedIn  that had five people she knows  saying these people are on LinkedIn  and want you to be a friend with them.  And she said how, she was really upset.  She said, how do they know?  How does LinkedIn know this information?  She was very upset.  And after thinking about it  and talking with the chat room, I realized  those people all, when they signed up for LinkedIn,  said, help me find my friends.  Here's my contact list.  Oh, yep.  And I mean, it's not like you're going to be able  to find your friends.  And I mean, it's not just Facebook.  This stuff is happening everywhere  and it's very offensive.  Facebook has had to suspend its address  and phone sharing feature  because of the same kinds of,  what the hell, reaction.  They announced a new feature that allows users  to share their mobile phone number  and address with applications  and third party websites.  They said today they're suspending the change  in order for us to clarify the permission process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's a good thing.  I think they've worked.  Rather than shoving it out first  and then fixing and doing damage.  Well, they did shove it out.  Well, they did what they pulled back  fast with the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it went out Friday  and they're making a user's address  and phone number accessible  as part of the social graph.  The issue is if you haven't explicitly said  don't share that, it would kind of share it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As long as they iterate quickly,  as long as they learn and iterate quickly.  Yeah, it's just like Google with Buzz, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They responded fast.  Although I do have to point out  that maybe they should have realized  that this was going to be an issue.  Yeah, phone numbers, it gets kind of sticky, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like as soon as you email someone,  they have your email address.  Your email address is in their address book  which they will likely upload to wherever  to contact their friends.  I mean, at that point,  it's like it's the nature of it, right?  But yeah, phone numbers,  it gets a little sticky, right?  It's a good argument for Google Voice.  Yeah, having a single phone number

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which is not your number.  Having like a public phone number that you share.  It's free, why not?  And if you want,  and this is what I do with my Google Voice number,  I give it out because I use screening.  And so I don't have to,  I mean anybody can have my Google Voice number.  I'll give it to you right now.  It's 302 Leo Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, bold Leo.  I like that more.  And suddenly all the phones  in the Twit cottage are ringing off the hook.  I like that more on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  who gives out his Social Security number.  Try-by-service.  Don't do that.  No, bad idea.  Park, the Palo Alto Research Center,  did a study on the usage of the location feel  in Twitter profiles.  They said, you're doing it wrong.  This is the new meme.  They select a group of 10,000 active users to study.  34% of Twitter users do not provide  valid geographic location on their profiles.  Instead, they use them for joking  or none of your business.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the open text field in your profile.  This isn't the automatically posted.  Yeah, and I can, working on ThinkUp,  I can say that this sounds absolutely correct.  And it stinks, but it's an open text field.  People can describe where they are,  however they want.  And that's a good thing.  I think so.  That is a good thing.  That's why it's an open text field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, my phone is ringing off the hook.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  You get a lot of Planet Earth under my desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used to always register, actually,  software I always used to register  to all mankind location, Planet Earth.  That's my little way of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Contribution to the dirty data pool, Leo.  Yeah, the dirty...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, for a long time,  when Apple asked for my email,  I'd say Sjobs at apple.com.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think that's appropriate.  It's tempting to do that.  Now, Apple, when you get a new Mac  and if you don't fill out that form properly,  they won't let you use your Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, they validate your email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They seem to do some validation  because I've gotten rejected.  They say, no.  Uh-uh.  Sjobs, we don't think so.  But that doesn't stop you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  from actually using the machine, right?  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seemed like I had to get through it  to continue on.  That would be evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That would be evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what do you think of...  I don't want to talk about Sjobs' personal life  because it's none of my business,  except to wish him well and hope that he gets better.  But there is a larger story,  which is Apple without Sjobs,  Apple being very...  Even the business press says,  well, we can't trust Apple to be straightforward with us.  We don't know what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's all kinds of things going on.  I talked to Michael Arrington earlier today.  There was the Apple director who died  and who was a source for various journalists.  And now there's a debate going on  in journalistic and online circles  as to whether or not his death is appropriate  to give up the promise of confidentiality that he had.  So that's one issue that's going around.  Oh, that's really interesting.  Isn't it?  If you go to TechCrunch,  TechCrunch, it's fairly high up.  And I'm suddenly forgetting the name of the director.  Farhad Manju had a piece,  which I like him normally,  but I didn't like this one  where he was basically speculating  that Sjobs will never go back  because he's done everything he needs to do.  Well, that's right in the damned O-bit.  And I find that offensive.  Going through...  The guy, as I said in the next bit,  had the first half of what Sjobs had,  and that was amazing enough.  And then he had a liver transplant.  Of course things are going to go wrong,  but he's fought back before,  and I'm betting he's going to come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, Michael cut through the debate  by revealing the guy.  I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, he's well revealed all over,  and the irony is the New York Times person  who said I wouldn't do it obviously then did it  because she was confirming.  Matthew Ingram, who's a great giga-homewriter,  and I were kind of leaning the other way  that the death changes the contract.  What do you guys think?  I think if somebody is a confidential source,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they stay a confidential source

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  regardless of whether they happen to be breathing.  For eternity?  Yeah.  No, no, for 100 years.  Life plus 30.  I don't know.  Yeah, is it like public domain?  Like at what point?  To the point where nobody cares anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To the point where like Mark Twain's like autobiography  was at 100 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but that was just the greatest marketing stunt

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  of all time.  Yeah, but I think it's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that was just the greatest marketing stunt of all time  because if you read it, it's like,  who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like, oh, I could prop up my monitor with this thing.  Yeah, it's like,  I almost bought the book.  You're a great monitorizer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I read a review in the New York Times Book Review,  it was Gary Zinkeler wrote a really funny review  in which he just says,  this is just a marketing stunt 100 years later  because there's nothing in here you want to read.  It's horrible.  It's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, as Arrington points out,  Mark felt deep throat.  His deal was not till I die,  though he had been coming out a little bit earlier  and the reporters went along with it.  What Ingram says is that contracts,  a lot of contracts were voided on death.  Try something different.  This is about Steve Jobs' personal life  and that's what makes it so difficult.  Imagine instead that you have some,  you have to have two sources by name.  You've got this huge story at AT&T  but you can't get a second source  and you have one source by name,  the second source is off the record,  second source dies.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Do you do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you go with it now?  That's interesting.  You know, it may be a bad...  No, it's fascinating.  It's a journalistic issue, but it's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, speaking of the King's Speech,  most of the details in that script  came from Lionel Logue's diary  which was found later  and the screenwriter,  or actually I guess it was a book,  before the information was revealed  they asked the Queen Mother  if it was okay to reveal it  which I thought was appropriate  and she said,  okay, but only after my death  because it's far too painful  and I don't want to live through it again.  So that movie couldn't be made  until the Queen Mother died.  Wow.  Which I think is fascinating.  Forever.  And she lived a long time, yeah.  Yeah.  But they respected that  and I think that's appropriate  but you're right, after somebody dies  I mean, what are they going to, fire him?  Yeah.  Can they prosecute the estate?  I don't think so.  But it does kind of,  it redounds to his reputation after death.  Well, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it kind of makes him seem like...  A jerk.  Potentially make him seem like a jerk.  Yeah, do you really want to do that  to someone who just died?  Well, it's too late now.  I thought that...  A hundred years ago, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Michaelene Maynard writing in the New York Times  as Mike points out,  it kind of hypocritically says  What?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then, and that's a tweet.  I just like everyone to know that I never divulged that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jerry York, one of my sources, is a source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically, that's what she's saying.  Anyway, it's very odd.  So what do you, what do you think?  I think it's a very odd thing.  I think it's a very odd thing.  I think it's a very odd thing.  I think it's a very odd thing.  I think it's a very odd thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what do you think about that?  I want to resist trying to speculate on Apple after jobs.  I kind of feel like if somebody told me something...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, we're not going to talk about it.  If somebody told me...  Oh, to answer this question,  then we'll talk about the job thing.  If somebody told me in confidence something,  I would basically say, OK, I'm not going to...  That person, that's confidential.  There's no point in revealing it now  that Jerry York said those things.  What's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the point is that it was a...  A director.  A director.  A good source.  Jobs and the company are not revealing anything  about the health.  It was known and the company knew things.  They weren't telling the public.  And is that right or wrong?  Which is, again, a whole other debate.  This is a very tricky debate because I completely understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that Steve does not want his health brooded about in public  because it's none of his business,  except he's the CEO of a publicly held company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Karen Swisher wrote a piece this week  or she had an argument in video with one of her people  and they debated this at D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what was her point, position?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was defending jobs and I forget who it was.  I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, OK, but it does something...  One of the reasons I am not a public...  Well, it's one of many reasons.  I'm not a publicly held company  is because as soon as you're a publicly held company,  there are all sorts of requirements  for...  Of information that you have to reveal  because you're selling pieces of your business to the public.  The public now has a right to know  some business information that's germane.  You no longer have the right to withhold information  about the health of your CEO, for instance,  if that's germane to the value of the company.  I think nobody would argue that Steve Jobs' health  is very much germane to the value of Apple.  So I think that they...  I mean, I'm sorry, Steve, you're right.  You deserve privacy,  but you should have thought about that when you went public.  Because if it was a private company,  nobody's business but Steve's.  Right? Am I wrong?  And then, of course, we're talking to the guy  who announces every possible surgery to the world.  You want to see my scar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm kind of the...  You're the Lyndon Johnson...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got that scar right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a very famous picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see the video this week about LBJ buying pants?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saw people talking about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got it, you got to do it.  Okay, let's see if we can find it real quick.  LBJ buying...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who can Google it faster?  Are these the... with a roomy crotch?  Oh, wait, this is audio, not video, right?  But there's a video version of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got the audio.  No, you want the video version because they illustrated it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I have that. Okay, here we go.  Let's...  Listen and watch.  It's on Vimeo.  LBJ...  Lyndon, for those of you who don't remember,  he was the president back in 1964 through 1968.  Here we go.  LBJ buying...  Pants.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mr. Hager?  Yes, this is Joe Hager.  Joe, is your father the one that makes clothes?  Yes, sir. We're all together.  You all made me some real light weight slacks  that he just made up on his own,  sent to me three or four months ago.  Kind of a light brown and a light green,  rather soft green and soft brown.  Now, I need about six pairs for summer wear.  I need about six pairs for around the evening  when I come in from work.  And I can send you a pair.  I want them half an inch larger in the waist  than they were before,  except I want two or three inches of stuff left back in there  so I can take them up.  I vary 10 to 15 pounds a month.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So leave me at least two or three inches of backfriar  and make these a half inch bigger in the waist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Make the pockets at least an inch long.  Money in my hand, my backfriar.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh.  Hello.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, another thing with crotch down where your nuts hang  is always a little too tight.  So when you make them up,  give me an inch that I can let out there  because they cut me.  It's just like riding a wire fence.  These are almost the best that I've had  anywhere in the United States.  But when I gain a little weight,  they cut me under there.  So leave me.  You never do have much margin there.  But see if you can't leave me about an inch  from the farthest zipper in the brown.  Yes, he bounced.  Back to my bunghole.  Okay, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was actually quite famous for being somewhat crude.  In fact, even having meetings in the White House John.  Yeah.  At those tapes,  Michael Beschloss did an amazing job some years ago  collating the LBJ tapes.  It's on audible.com.  It's well worth listening to.  I don't know where this one came from,  but he taped everything before Nixon did.  He was the original taper.  That is very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that great?  God bless the Internet.  You find that gem and somebody pulls it out  and does something.  It's the remix culture.  It's a beautiful thing.  It is not fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's absolutely LBJ.  I know his voice anywhere.  I listen to all those tapes.  I love them because it's really an insight  into the very personal presidency.  I mean, you get right in there.  Yeah, I feel like I could have probably done

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  without the invitation at the end there.  But you know, still great.  Still a great illustration.  I mean, that's a sitting president.  And a good demonstration.  Give me some of them Hager slacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, you make some...  He was such a good old boy.  Oh, my God.  So have you used your iPhone to buy coffee yet?  I did today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How was that?  It's incredibly fast.  There it is, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the Starbucks app now has the ability to buy coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  And so all you do is go to the app  and say, touch when you do it.  You scan it to the thing right there at the register  and boom, done and off you go.  Now, what I want, and I said this on Twitter,  is I want this to also have my drink order.  So that goes in.  I don't have to go through all this mess,  which was somebody's idea, my Starbucks idea  about a year and a half ago.  And on Twitter, Starbucks Twitter account said,  well, one thing at a time.  Interesting.  I also want this on Android.  And they said they're working on that too.  Can I have it delivered?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I want.  I want you to just bring me coffee, boy.  And can you leave a little more room in the crotch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So how is the payment done?  Is it done through iTunes?  You register your card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have like a gift card?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, your charge card.  Star, sorry, Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It goes way around you.  So really?  Oh, Apple makes nothing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a free app.  And I register my gift cards to my account anyway,  which I just did this weekend by chance because I found some  and I didn't know how much was on them.  You know, my mother-in-law gives me,  she had no idea what to get for me.  So she gives me a Starbucks card.  Thank you very much.  And so I have like $300 in Starbucks cards.  So you have like credits.  It's just a couple of years sitting there.  So yeah.  And so if you have cards, yeah, I mean, it's the same thing.  It's just on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you type in your order.  Does the app detect what Starbucks you're in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like, how does it submit the order?  No, no, it's just when you're in the app.  Do you have to be connected to the Wi-Fi?  You just hold it up.  That's what he wants.  Oh, I see.  You just hold up a scan.  That's it.  Gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He wants and I agree with him.  You shouldn't have to go up to the counter at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  You just hold it up.  This is the start of the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chipotle's app, of course, I can do it.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I did it today.  You go to the Chipotle app, you find the nearest one.  I have a standing order.  I put it in.  I get there and I go around the line, which of my Chipotle is incredible.  It goes outside even in the rain.  And bingo, Jeff has his bag of burrito.  I have to say when I...  Jarvis Chipotle hacks.  Awesome.  Is this on Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Android Chipotle.  Well, here's the other thing.  I like Baja Fresh because they have the salsa bar there and you can get the jalapeno slices.  And so I complained on Twitter about not having jalapeno slices and Chipotle tweets the official...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did we just call them?  Twitterilla, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Twitterilla for Chipotle said, yes, you can and you can't get the jalapeno slices.  I'm looking for that.  I'm looking for that.  I'm looking for that.  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  I'm looking.  Twitterilla for Chipotle said, yes, you can in fact ask for...  And it's diced fresh jalapenos from the back.  And by God, I tried it and they brought them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This show is so informational.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.  So useful.  I need efficient ways to get my food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would like to have food without actually speaking to or really in any way having contact  with a human.  Is that possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This should have been my tip.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say it should have been my app.  Do you go into bathrooms now and don't know what to do if you actually have to touch something?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I wave.  I stand up from the toilet.  It does it.  I wave.  It's a little weird, isn't it?  It is a little weird.  If it works...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like it.  The drink over in the house loves it.  I feel like an idiot because I'm always at the sink going like this and they never...  And it's always in the airport I encounter these and they never work.  So you're going like this and like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then you have to touch the handle of the door to open it on your way out, which negates  the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The one least clean thing in the bathroom.  And there's no paper towels to which you can...  So just bring rubber gloves from now on.  We are going to get in a moment to our tip, tool and number of the week with Jeff Jarvis  and Gina Trapani.  We are way late again.  I don't know why this happens.  If we took out all of the non-useful stuff, this should be...  Oh, three minutes.  Yeah.  Be very quick.  Minus the Chipotle Glee social network stuff.  It's over.  The inception review alone.  Just real quickly want to mention if only you could do that with your email.  You just eliminate the stuff you don't want and only get the stuff you like.  Well, that's what MailRoute does.  Think of it as MailRoute as the Chipotle Glee social network inception remover for your junk mail.  MailRoute.info is a place to go to find out more.  10% off for the life of your account if you run your own server, which I do.  If you can change the MS record.  If you're...  You know, this is a great solution and it's worked for me for years since 2004 I've been using it.  I am now sharing my email secret with you.  MailRoute.info.  10% off for the life of your account.  Let's start with Gina Trapani.  Oops, that's my hand.  Let's start with Gina Trapani and her tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So my tip this week is a shameless, shameless plug.  Plug!  And I hope you all forgive me for this.  That Android app that I started working on back in May is now ready for people to try it out.  It's called To Do Text Touch.  It's not in the Android market yet because I've got a couple...  Actually, it's not in the Android market yet because Jeff Jarvis always complains about the search button  not working correctly and until I have that working, I'm not going to submit it.  But in the meantime, you can download the APK, a beta of the APK.  It's at my website.  It's top of the website, smartaware.org.  It is a personal task manager.  It's a To Do Text manager, which you store your To Do text file in Dropbox.  So it authenticates in Dropbox.  I love that general analysis.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So go to smartaware.org and you'll see a bunch of screenshots.  Not todotodotext, but to smartware.  Not todotext.com yet.  Once I get it out there, I'll have it there.  But you can see at smartaware.org at the top there, and there's a link to download the APK  and just give it a test run and see how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you actually have a UI for Android that's not just a text editor.  That's kind of cool.  Right, right.  But then it saves it to the text file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Each line, each line, that represents one line that you do to do dot text file.  Right.  So when you update that line, if you long tap one of those items, you make it update.  It writes it back to To Do Text on your phone and then syncs to Dropbox in the background  automatically.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you're on an iPad, for instance, you could use plain text, which does access Dropbox  text files.  It's a dot TXT file, right?  Yeah, it's just a dot TXT file.  So you have full access to it.  So you could use it on your iPad.  You could use it on your iPhone, on your Android phone.  Of course, any computer is like you just open it with a text editor.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the reason why I wrote this app is because, you know, editing text on your phone is, you  know, a continuous text file.  It's just kind of a pain.  So what this app does is just separate each line into an individual task and gives you  kind of one-tap ways to prioritize, to mark things as complete, to add tags to it and  dates.  So it's just easier to deal with versus, you know, opening up text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I use this part, kind of any kind of lists, Gina, if I want to do a, you know, a guest  list for an event or something like that?  It's the same basic concept, right?  It's the same basic concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the idea is eventually we will have, it will support lots of different, you can, you  know, create any text file and then edit it line by line and this touch interface on your  phone, which is really what I wanted.  But then it syncs back to Dropbox.  So then you can edit it on any platform and any text editor that you want.  So this is, I live in to do text and this is a companion app to my command line interface  to to do text.  What do you use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you use like Quicksilver or something to command line it or are you just?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wrote, I actually wrote a bash script to do to do dot sh, which I just to do, you know,  add to do prioritize that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you'll have the terminal open and then you'll just use commands in the terminal.  Yeah, I live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so I use geek tool.  I kind of pin it to my desktop.  I use commands.  I will often open it up in a regular text editor.  I mean, I access the text file itself in lots of different ways, but the whole point is  that it's just a text file.  I can do that.  And with Dropbox, you get that syncing to it goes everywhere.  So that's what I love about it.  I mean, I literally have a thousand like three thousand line done dot text files since 2007  of like all the things that I've done, which, you know, you can really easily grep and search.  So so this this app is just sort of a companion for folks using the to do text and store in  Dropbox and and it's in beta.  There are some bugs, but I hope you give it give it a try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have an Android phone and the chat room points out, you know, the giga ohm just wrote  it up.  Oh, perfect.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you.  Right on.  Thank you.  Awesome.  Cool.  So that's that's my kind of personal plug.  My my quick tip for the week is for programmers.  I was complaining a couple of weeks ago about how Chrome OS doesn't you know, it's not easy  to edit code in Chrome OS.  Well, Google code, which is code dot Google dot com, which hosts coding projects, added  a text editor so you can you can you can edit your code with a little syntax highlighting  and you can preview the diff.  So it's kind of like the beginnings of this cloud ID happening.  I mean, of course, you can't compile.  You can't run tests, that kind of thing.  It is does does seem like sort of like the beginning.  So if you're hosting code at Google code and I say I prefer GitHub, but this is this is  good too.  I prefer GitHub myself, but Google code is coming along anyway.  This is something to check out.  So if you're hosting some code on Google code, you can you can edit there now.  So if you have a C C R 48, that might be an option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they have to have something like this if you're going to use a C R 48 for anything.  Yeah, but you can't recompile it.  So it's like, well, I got the code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you need some sort of environment, right?  So you have to deploy it somewhere and then compile it somehow.  You know, so this is just a way to start to edit, do some first steps only.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is our number of the week for Mr.  Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Number of the week is one point seven, eight million.  That's how many people are likely to die this week, this year on Facebook.  Not because of Mark's bad dressing, but as well like birds falling from the sky.  I guess, you know, Facebook people will start dropping over if you have 600 million users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some percentage of them are going to pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which raises the really interesting issue that Dave Weiner has been talking about a lot  lately is your memorialization after his father passed away.  His father had an online blog.  How do you keep your virtual life there?  How do you keep your legacy?  I was talking yesterday with this amazing woman named Elizabeth Eisenstein, who's a  professor at American University who wrote the definitive Gutenberg book, 700 pages,  just amazing that I read for my research.  And it was just a delightful conversation with someone who, you know, the viewers, I  don't know technology and all that.  But we got into the same issue of permanence and the desire for permanence is what pushes  people to write a lot.  That's what we're doing.  And she said, well, you know, your floppy disk is already useless, but the Gutenberg  Bible is still around 550 years later.  And so how do we look at this issue of permanence as people die and what is their legacy online  and what should it be online?  You know, I lost a friend a while ago who got killed in an auto accident and her page  is still there.  Facebook has a process for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You actually can as the next of kin contact Facebook and it will turn your wall into a  memorial.  There's a whole process for that.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  Well, when you get out, when you got millions of people dying, yeah, you got to do something.  Yeah.  So actually I commend Facebook for kind of thinking about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't mean to end on a downer of death today, but I found that I thought found that  notion interesting is that when you get to those numbers, you're going to deal with  1.8 million deaths.  And what do you do about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't remember what the NIC add an obituary to Facebook.  You're obituary on Facebook.  I'm trying to find the link that you would follow if somebody passes away on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know, this is what users do with walls of people who have died anyway.  Anyway, yes, they do anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Facebook has kind of formalized the process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what Dave talks about is that, you know, so I have to leave somehow a means to keep  Buzz Machine going or not.  But my ego I have going past the grave, I want to still be there.  I want to take down all the comments and spam, but I can't fight back from the grave.  But I wanted to somehow live on.  And how does that happen?  And so Dave's been thinking about that a lot.  And he's also been asking the same thing, not just for people, but for code and things.  How do you find permanent institutions in a world where things come and go and start  and die quickly?  Will universities be that place to preserve that or will they go away too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Facebook has a form reported deceased person's profile.  And by the way, they're pretty seriously strict about under penalty of perjury, you know,  and so forth.  But what will happen is the account then becomes memorialized.  Privacy is set so that only confirmed friends can see the profile or located.  The wall remains so that friends and family can leave posts in remembrance.  But you need to provide some information.  And so there is actually a page on Facebook to report a deceased person.  I think that's actually completely appropriate.  I wonder what Twitter does for something like that.  Now, our friend...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Twitter, you lose all your stuff anyway, Leo.  3500 tweets and that.  If you don't use Gina Trapani, all your tweets go up in the air anyway.  Gina is our link to eternity.  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As long as I'm around anyway.  Well, we got to think about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think this is, you know, my friend Brian Brushwood, who, of course, is one of our hosts on NSFW,  has created a page.  He was thinking about this.  He talked about it on Twitter this week called it's called Afterlife.me.  Every year on his birthday, which was the 17th, he has to ping this page.  If he does not, an AI goes into effect that basically takes over saying Brian has died.  Wow.  Because he didn't ping me.  Brian is dead.  And this is what's going to happen.  It does all this stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is that wild?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He has a mixed in dementia into this formula.  Oh, well, he's either dead or crazy.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, how does he remember to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does it remind him to ping him?  Brian doesn't know what it's like to get older.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I told him this is a brilliant startup.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The thing is, we would write about these kinds of services and Lifehacker all the time.  But my question was always like, how long is this startup going to make it?  I'm probably going to make it longer than this startup does.  Why would I trust...  Even Google, I mean, I would trust like the Library of Congress, but I wouldn't trust a startup.  And I don't even know if I would trust...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you set up the startup, you have to do all these things to make sure that no matter what,  even if the founders go away, whatever, there's an annuity to keep the thing running.  Well, you need an annuity like a graveyard, yes.  And the software continues.  I mean, graveyards do this.  If you buy a perpetual flame or whatever, perpetual care at a graveyard,  by the way, I'm about to do that.  Jennifer and I have decided on a plot.  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is death week.  What am I going to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Welcome to twig, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jennifer said to me, she said, you know, there's still some nice space in the graveyard in Petaluma.  We really ought to get that hillside plot now so that the kids will know where we are.  Oh, it's a little morbid, but I don't think it's inappropriate.  And I think the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're doing them a huge favor, Leo.  Huge favor to do that for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they don't want to do it.  Yeah, exactly.  That's called pre-planning in the mortuary business.  Now, I have to say, I think we need we definitely need somebody to put together.  You're right, Gina.  I've seen all these sites that set up this stuff are gone.  Yes.  But somebody needs to do something and somehow set it up so that it's more permanent.  At least, hey, congratulations to Facebook for addressing it and handling it.  I want to put this on my to do dot text to do list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And now I'm sitting here going, God, I really ought to do a will.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you do.  Oh, you do.  You do.  My brother-in-law died of intestate.  And boy, is that a mess.  It's a mess.  It's just awful to go through.  My wife is executor and it was just terrible to go through.  And a lot of ugly surprises await.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your intestate now that you've had your surgery, right?  I'm just joking.  Never mind.  He'll get it.  That was the previous surgery.  All right.  My tool and then we're going to get out of here.  So I'm not going to name names, but somebody that I work with, I lent her a Droid X and  she lost it.  And I said, well, you have Where's My Droid on it?  Right.  She said, What's that?  And I said, Oh, my God, I haven't told you about Where's My Droid?  Where's My Droid is an Android application.  It's absolutely free.  Now, there's a Find My iPhone, which everybody knows about.  This is the analog device.  This is the analog for that.  And it has some it's free.  It has some great features.  Ring when lost, ring for 30 seconds, ring for five minutes.  There's all sorts of useful stuff in here.  There's an attention word.  You can text to the phone that will erase the contents that will respond, turn on the  GPS and respond with the location of the phone.  This is a really lovely.  This is so if I send a text with GPS, my Droid to my lost phone, it will turn on the GPS  and then I can follow it.  I can figure out where it is.  Look, if you've got an Android phone, you really ought to have this on there.  It's called Where's My Droid?  And it is a free application you can download.  And I really think it's and I wish that this person who shall remain nameless and put that  on there because we'd have it back by now.  I think you've been calling it.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That that's no, no.  I think she left it in New York Cab and having left an iPod in a New York cab some years  ago and calling the cab company and hearing the laughter, the mirth that ensued when I  said, well, is there any chance I could get the cabby to return that?  They in fact what they said was, well, if you're lucky, maybe he turned it into the  police department.  But we got it.  Otherwise, I think you're out of luck to not leave anything in a cab if you ever want it  back.  That's for sure.  Jeff Jarvis is at Buzz Machine dot com.  That's his blog.  I must read.  He's also a professor at the City University of New York of Journalism and the author of  a great book called What Would Google Do?  Available in better bookstores everywhere.  Are you going to hold up the book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't done that in ages.  It looks just like my copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, mine's on my Kindle.  But yeah, hold up your Kindle.
