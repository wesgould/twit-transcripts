Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week and Google Jeff Jarvis is here, Matthew Ingram is here, we even get a surprise appearance from Stacey Higginbotham at CES Google Assistant everywhere on the show floor.  I think this is a big sea change for Google. We'll talk about that and Google's first time at CES and they got rained out. It's all coming up next on Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

It's time for Twig this week at Google, the show where we cover Google and Twitter and Facebook and the social world and the newspaper world and all the world of the world and always with the great Jeff Jarvis.  How far have you gotten? BuzzMachine.com. He is the professor of journalism. I've been listening to it.  You have? How is it?  It's like reading the National Enquirer.  We're talking about Fire and Fury, Michael Wolff's scathing. Well, it's interesting. I don't know how to describe it. His behind the scenes at the White House tell-all.  Crash Fire?  Yeah, that's probably a good way to describe it. Hey, that's Matthew Ingram. He is a journalist. You know how I know. He works at the Columbia Journalism Review, but he's also been, as you know, a gig home in Fortune.  It's great to have you on the show from Canada. Yes. You're just watching from the sidelines.  So do you have Howard Stern in Canada?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nice. They have Sirius.  Oh, because it's Sirius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep, he's a regular guest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel like I kind of know Howard by proxy. So you were on Stern yesterday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I called in because he was saying, no, Oprah, no, don't run, no, Oprah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I want to say that too. Haven't we had enough of celebrity presidents?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exactly what I called in. And it was interesting because he said when he ran for governor, he said he earnestly got scared that people were voting for him.  And he said, it's a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Again, I don't know whether it's true or not, but that's one of the best scenes in Fire and Fury is apparently on November 7th, everybody in the Trump campaign was preparing their resumes, getting ready for a fine post-election relaxation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No one expected to win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No one thought they would win. And then he describes like Melania bursting into tears when they won.  And not tears of joy.  And Trump saying, at first, I can't believe it. And then saying, well, good, because I'm going to be the best president ever.  And it's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Until that point, it sounded like he was perfectly happy to lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He didn't want to win. He was going to make him money and he was going to start a network because Murdoch was encouraging him to start his own broadcast network.  And he was going to do that. And we had heard those rumors.  It reminds me of what was that Robert Redford movie where he runs for president?  Oh, The Candidate.  The Candidate. And he wins. And the last line of the movie is, now what do we do?  Yeah.  And if you think about it, governing and running are very different. And skill sets and challenges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's what you want, right? You want a president who never actually thought they would win.  You want a president who actually didn't even vote for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't want that. I mean, that was part of our president's charm was that he wasn't from the traditional governing class.  That he was somebody else. Somebody different. Somebody who...  So you argued in favor of Oprah, I take it, Jeffrey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no. I was praising Howard for saying no, Oprah. Enough celebrity.  Plus, I was also arguing, the other reason I called in was that in my TV critic days, one forgets that Oprah Winfrey is the one who really opened the door to trashing time.  And she opened the door to trashing television. In her original shows.  Well, she created Dr. Phil, right?  Yeah, and she had really worse trashy stuff than that. And she went on and on. And so it led to Ricky Lake and it led to, what's his name?  He was the worst of them. People would throw chairs and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know his name. He was the son of a famous junior. Morton Downey Jr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that too. Right. So I would argue that Oprah actually opened a door that led straight to Donald Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She also pushed...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Reality TV, or Jerry Springer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As I recall, she helped promote the sort of anti-vax movement as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's been some dubious things she's had on. And actually, but then one day she saw the burning bush.  Like investors in Facebook and Google who are now suddenly seeing the light, supposedly. She did too.  And so, oh no, no, no, no, I'm not going to be virtuous Oprah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't want Deepak Chopra as the health and...  Right. Or Dr. Oz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Dr. Oz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, maybe better than the housing that we have now. So Oprah suddenly saw the light after she'd already caused the damage, after she'd already become number one, after she'd ruined Phil's format.  And they asked me to come on as a TV critic to praise Oprah.  Oh, really?  No, not to her. The PR guy was enraged kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's beloved. I feel like... And it's funny, this really is how the pendulum swings. We had kind of the ultimate policy wonk in Clinton, and then it swung the other way.  And then we had the ultimate policy wonk in Obama, and then it swung the other way. And I feel like, well, maybe let's get another policy wonk in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems like, I mean, Oprah's a lovely person, and I'm sure she has lots of fine qualities, and I'm sure she gave a great speech.  But what's she going to do when she has to determine whether to launch a drone strike on somebody or when she has to negotiate peace in the Middle East?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Matthew, Mr. News Critic, the story here to me is the idiocy of our field. She didn't, she wasn't trying for the 2020. She didn't, it really wasn't.  She didn't give a good speech. But then everybody, like Chris Matthews last night on MSNBC was practically voting for her.  One of the networks had to take down a tweet that was saying that they were for her. Media went crazy immediately because that's the way they are, and it's stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is kind of the risk of the liberal reaction to the Trump presidency is that liberals may then grasp at straws inappropriately.  Especially liberal media.  So liberal media particularly, but that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, your seven-year-old nephew could give a half-decent speech at a birthday party, and the Democrats would be like, oh!  They're just so desperate, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But remember that a young, little-known senator from Illinois named Barack Obama gave a speech at the Democratic convention in 2004 and woke everybody up,  and that was the beginning of his rapid ascendancy with very little experience to the presidency, and he turned out okay.  I mean, I have some misgivings about his eight years, but I don't know. Who knows? Who knows? It's all speculation at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Obama was... I was one of those who was not... I thought there was empty rhetoric, so I was happy.  I expected little. The people who thought he was going to be the God...  We were more disappointed, yeah.  And by the way, we've just done this opening segment just because I don't know who it was in the chat, but you promised you wouldn't do no politics, Leo,  and I wanted to ruin the fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I asked about Stern, but I didn't realize what you had called into Stern about, so...  Yes, but I thought I just enjoyed what I just did.  It's my fault. However, CES is going on, and the really interesting thing is the story of CES, besides today's brief blackout,  and the rain that preceded it, is that Google is everywhere. Google Assistant, not only the advertising is everywhere,  they wrapped the monorail, they wrapped the side of the building. You can't go anywhere apparently.  They have special Google buckets to catch the leaks in the roof.  But, hey Google, the monorail says. But...  Wow. Nice.  It is also in a lot of stuff, and I think this is kind of a one-two punch from Google, because they had announced before CES that they had a phenomenal Christmas.  I think they said six million device activation, which puts them right up there.  We don't know exactly what Amazon Echo's penetration is, but six million in a couple of weeks.  I guess it was for 2017. Pardon me. That was for the year. That's still phenomenal.  I'm surprised actually.  Yeah. And the 900% increase during the holiday season over last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought Amazon had a lead. To be honest, I thought it was going to be tough. I think I said on this show, I thought it was going to be tough for Google Home to catch up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, we always knew that Amazon had a massive lead because of the number of tasks they had.  They'd been in the market three years before Google came along, or two years before Google came along.  But what is kind of interesting, and we'd always said, well Google will have an advantage if what you're looking for is an assistant that is smart, right?  That knows more than shopping and timers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. As the world's knowledge.  Yeah.  And it knows you well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And now Google at CES is showing a lot of devices, including Google Assistant with a display.  This is from Lenovo.  Oh.  It looks, it's $200, competes head to head with Amazon's Echo Show, which by the way, remember YouTube was pulled off of on January 1st.  And it is bigger than the Echo Show at roughly the same price.  There's a nine inch version and there's an 11 inch version.  So this is a really, I think this is a very interesting.  It's not a stupid round screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Google.  It feels to me like that's the future is the sort of embedded stuff and the things that, you know, work in the car or work in.  It's not just a gizmo that sits on your desktop.  Right.  So where else that assistant shows up.  Right.  This is not a Google product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a product from Lenovo using which is Google strategy, right.  To open up the platforms, how made Android bigger.  This is going to be the same as this is good.  This is like their Apple anti Apple strategy.  I also put on the rundown.  There was a some kind of multi cooker that has Google Assistant built in a cooker.  I don't understand what it is exactly like an instant pot.  No, no, it's a what the hell was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is Canadian, by the way.  Yes.  Oh, really?  Forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  The Gormia multi cooker with Google Assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What the heck is a multi cooker?  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's that's like an instant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And and Stacey, you're going to buy it.  No, I don't like that looks at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although we saw Amazon and a lot of stuff to Kohler announced an Amazon Echo enabled bathroom.  The whole bathroom, the whole bathroom.  So you could say shower, turn on at eight thirty and have the water be at ninety eight degrees.  Like that's so hard.  It's so hard.  Well, you can't.  It's not hard.  But I mean, you're so old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's also a toilet that warms your feet.  The toilet is pretty freaky and plays music and a bathtub and a faucet of flush.  There is a certain irony to the fact that all of these devices stopped working when the power went out.  Yeah, more than a little.  I do think those voice assistants controlling your home, we've said this before, is a kind of a natural use for those.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So did you see the really ridiculous Google Assistant uniforms?  Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what do you mean?  These were for people like booth babes or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're really well known up babes.  There were guys, which is good, but there were.  Oh, shoot.  Oh, here we go.  Geekwire.com.  Oh, look, these all white Google get ups.  So that let me put it in there.  Who was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was this the booth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The people at the booth people?  I just put it in the chat.  The booth people really ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A nineteen eighties, seventies horror movie.  The booth people, the booth people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they booth hunks if they're not booth babes?  Are they booth hunks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I apologize.  Not in this outfit.  They can't be.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.  I'll have to keep looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I put it in the chat.  In the chat.  Oh, okay.  Let's see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I serve.  I live to serve.  You live to serve.  There it is.  Oh my God.  Isn't that hideous?  It looks like where's Waldo?  And he's wearing like a tuque.  That's bizarre.  Is he a Google employee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or I know that's embarrassing.  I'm so glad I'm not at CES this year.  This is from Silicon Valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's not real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like Handmaid's Tale.  Yeah, it is.  Someday all men will dress like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought you were going to say they had Google Assistant enabled clothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, actually don't they have a jacket with the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I don't think it's this.  Google says the Assistant is available now in 400 million devices.  Geez.  That's a lot.  That's because...  That includes all those phones.  Yeah, it's because 389 million of them are Android devices.  But still, that means they're getting data from 400 million devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Amazon can't ever admit that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Six million homes were sold since late October.  So I would say at this point, they are outselling the Echo.  Or very close to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they now have these interesting third-party form factors.  Yeah, good.  You know, the race is on.  There's no question about that.  And there are two horses way in the back of the field called Siri and Cortana.  And I guess you'd have to include Bixby in that.  So maybe three horses.  Bixby's not even left the gate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see that LG demo with the Smart Assistant?  No.  The one that wouldn't do anything?  Let's pull it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It sounds like more CES hilarity ensued.  Was this the robot?  Yeah, let's watch this.  Even robots have bad days.  So LG had a whole kitchen, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I laughed out loud.  Can I just say the worst name ever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  LG Cloe?  Cloe, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chloe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, pardon me.  But it's spelled C-L-O-I.  So you'll forgive me for calling it Cloe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's extra confusing.  That's what they were going for, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chloe, am I ready on my Washern cycle?  Washern?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Washern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Washern cycle.  Oh, never tried this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even robots have bad days.  So they got fired at that minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Crickets, I think, are added by editorial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Chloe is just like...  Okay, Chloe is not going to talk to me.  Chloe doesn't like me, evidently.  He's going to talk to me in about 10 minutes.  Oh, he's just a paid actor.  Oh, he's not an executive.  Chloe, are you talking to me yet?  What recipes could I make with chicken?  Buffalo chicken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Looks like he's got a Jeepo over on the left there.  I guess Chloe...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we're going to find buffalo chicken pizza.  Buffalo chicken pizza sounds good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is why you don't want a...  That's Gizmodo's video.  Never do a live demo.  Yeah, and you don't really want to...  Again, this underscores how if all your appliances are dependent on voice assistant, it's a bad...  When it doesn't work, it really is bad.  Open the refrigerator door, Hal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Dave, you're too fat.  I'm not going to let you eat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anything else to talk about with CES?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me just quickly see, because I want to get to this AMP letter.  I'm sure you have something to say about this, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Both an AMP announcement as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, AMP announcements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just thought it was hugely ironic, the power failure.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Power out at CES and nothing works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All these people in a darkened room trying to talk to assistants that don't exist.  We are creating...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, this is kind of a philosophical conversation.  We are creating kind of a dependent society.  That's for sure.  We have been all along, technology-dependent society, but it's getting...  It feels like it's a little more fragile all the time.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Chloe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's my one observation about CES.  Is this the biggest shrug we've ever had with CES?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, almost every year it's a shrug.  It's a shrug.  It's a shrug.  The world took it over, I guess.  There's stuff there, but the problem is it's such a big mishmash.  We won't really know what was important for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember 3D TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, okay, so there is some TV stuff.  There's 8K TVs, just like we all are demanding.  No.  There is a new TV technology that Samsung is showing called MicroLED  that will kind of presumably at some point replace OLED  because it doesn't have some of the drawbacks OLED has, but it's direct view.  It's using LEDs instead of organic cells that OLED uses.  Interesting.  There is going to be a MicroLED TV shipping this year, but it's 146 inches.  And if you have to ask the price, you're not Shaquille O'Neal.  But it proves the technology works and they'll have more in the years to come.  I did order something, and I don't know if this was a good idea or not,  but I ordered from Anker a $50 device that puts Amazon's Echo in your car.  It's called the ROAV, R-O-A-V Viva.  It plugs into a cigarette lighter and has two USB ports of its own.  So it's kind of like a cigarette lighter charger,  but it just happens to have a microphone  and it pairs with your Bluetooth speakers in your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It pairs with your phone?  No.  To reach.  That's interesting.  You must pair with your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It doesn't support the Spotify.  No, you plug the device into the vehicle, play it with a smartphone.  The smartphone is paired with the vehicle.  The system streams audio from the Viva to the vehicle through this link,  even if the smartphone is doing other things.  Spotify is not done, so it doesn't have Spotify.  But I see for me it would be great for audiobooks,  because I kind of live on audiobooks in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but why do you need that?  I have audiobooks in my car.  On your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  On my phone.  Yeah, you're right.  Well, just for the ability to command it by voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what about the You Know Who app on your phone?  Wouldn't that do the same thing?  That's interesting.  I guess it wouldn't be listening all the time and on all the time.  It would be listening.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's 50 bucks.  I ordered it, pre-ordered it.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You said last week, Leo, you were going to put Fuchsia on your Pixelbook, did you?  Oh, no, I didn't.  I'll do it.  I forgot.  I just forgot.  You're going to get it and you're going to say, what do I do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, now what?  I've got to remind myself.  Put Fuchsia on my Pixelbook.  What's Fuchsia?  It's a Google operating system that has no apparent purpose.  But you can put it on your Pixelbook now.  Just what you need.  Just what I've always wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you saw, by the way, that was a good example of a voice assistant being very useful.  I use a little app, but this is an iOS thing, but I use a little app on iOS.  It has a watch interface and does dictation.  So I tap a button on the face of my watch.  It's immediately listening.  I just talk and then it's done.  And it saves it.  Then I can on my iOS device later in the day process it all because it has a very nice bunch of features for putting it in a calendar, putting it in reminders, putting it in anywhere you want.  It's just another thing I won't do.  Oh, but for me, I do do it because I can.  Now, this is my personal issue, but I always agree to do stuff like put few show my Pixelbook and then forget it.  Right.  Or you say a great show I should be watching.  And I go, oh, yeah, I got to remember that.  And then I don't call Wallace and Nicole Wall.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  One PM your time.  Watch Nicole Wallace.  Simple.  And I actually what else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What else?  How else can we can we fill up the day off?  This happens all the time, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People recommend a book or a movie or whatever.  And I put it in here and then I have it set up that when I go process this app on iOS called drafts, when I go process it, one of the actions is to put this in a to read or watch list.  So that's it.  And so it means I very quickly process these.  I don't know.  I find this a really good workflow for me because I'm always forgetting stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm about to finish a book.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  First, first Matthew and then Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you use Google Keep?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I used to.  Can you can you do the same kind of thing with Google Keep?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  If you're all in on iOS, the iOS reminders app is the best one to use because it does much of the same stuff.  Keep does.  And then I use other more powerful note taking programs than keep.  The problem I don't have with Keefe is keep is everything's just kind of there on the on the page.  Yeah.  Like dumped on the page.  And I don't know.  I'm more I'm more not in my real life, but in my digital life, I'm more add a note to Google Keep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good for notes, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, can't take notes.  You can't take notes yet.  OK.  See, I think voice the idea this is an example of why voice is powerful.  There are times when you just you know, I want to just say I tap my watch and say do do do do.  And then it will be preserved in a reliable way for me when I have some time at the end of the day to go through it all and add it to my to do list or my calendar or whatever it needs.  I mean, you could dictate I can dictate a an email this way and then send it out and stuff like that.  I don't know.  It's just it feels like a new book to recommend to you.  Yes.  Let me add it to my go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Revolution song by Rushal Shorto Rushal Shorto's revolution.  Rushal Shorto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the only problem with this is dictation is imperfect imperfect.  So I have Rush Rush of short.  I was revolution song.  But I won't.  But see, I will then that'll trigger.  Oh, yeah.  That was that thing.  Jeff said it was.  What's it about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's it about?  It's about the American Revolution.  Rush Shorto wrote a magnificent book about the Dutch history of New York City.  Really?  I read that book and I loved it.  What is it?  And then he wrote another one about Amsterdam, the world's most liberal city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The island at the center of the world was that was the city history book.  Wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Great book.  I want to put up a statue to Adrian van der Donk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, what's neat is that the the the Dutch are particularly anal retentive and took notes on everything.  Yes.  And they eventually found these and he went through them and he was able to create a very good.  Oh, I want to read this revolution song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's so he has like six intermingled stories.  He has George Washington, a freed African-American slave, a woman who went back and forth, a guy who was anti-federalist, the head of the British effort to defeat us.  And they all intermingle.  He's just really good.  It's he's he's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I happen to have an audible credit right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And don't forget, I had recommended Boosh, Rinavashan.  I own that now.  You do own that.  I think you'll like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you like that a lot.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Americana.  Yeah, actually.  How is the audio version in terms of performance of Fire and Fury?  Terrible.  But doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know why?  You could tell they rush.  It's not terrible.  No, I apologize.  It's fine.  But you could tell they rushed it out because the nor there are a lot of audio typos.  You know, a guy the guy pronounces indefatigable for some reason as indefatigable.  And every time he says it, it's like and there's a few words like that where you can tell.  And I think this probably happens always when they do audio books.  Yeah.  And then that but they just didn't have time because they they they're becoming so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  better produced.  The the the we talk about this the latest John Le Carre.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I and that's also I have that on my it's really well produced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so it's more of a performance.  And so you compare that now to schmoes like me reading an audiobook.  The worst part of the audiobook is that also where I had to do the inserts and you can  tell it's the next day and the voice is different.  That's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's bad production.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then General Washington went to battle.  I do hear that.  I have to say I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know.  Oh, that was next time.  That was later that day.  Yeah.

Transcript:  OK, good.  I just got the short.  Oh, but because I do love filled up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have filled up Leo's weekend.  Well, the problem is you should see my audible list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a hundred books I haven't read yet.  So I always read.  Christopher Walken has a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I always want him to narrate a great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does he ever do audiobooks?  Because that was then I went to a would be funny.  I wonder.  Let's see.  Let's see if Christopher Walken has ever.  No, he's never narrated an audio.  He's too big time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I was.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why I was waiting for Raven evermore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like the thunder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary of a many acquaintance and curious volume of forgotten lore.  While I nodded nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping.  There's an awful lot of sad.  I just want to get a better one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The one where the wild things are read by him.  The next one down on the Google search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that would be amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's more him.  Scary little children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I read an interview with Maurice Sendak.  He was originally where the wild ponies are.  Really?  But he couldn't draw ponies.  So he ended up making something he could draw.  Goblin audio presents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, skip ahead.  Mad.  That very night in Max's room, a forest grew.  A forest grew.  And then in the picture you can see that the posts of his bed have turned into some kind of birch trees.  I assume because they're thin.  They're thin.  Like a birch wood.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am going to memorize this.  This is how you learn how to do a Christopher Walken impression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some birch trees.  Birch trees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're thin.  They're thin.  The reason that he does, there's just a little text and a lot of pictures.  So the poor guy is stuck kind of.  He's in a boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He looks pleased with himself.  He looks very happy to be there.  There's another tree out in the middle of the water.  I don't know why.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's brilliant.  I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where the wild things are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the wackiest tangent train we've ever done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was going to do an ad.  And now I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then we'll talk about why the bicycles keep disappearing from the Google campus.  But first, a word from Matthew Ingram's favorite folks up there in Toronto.  And mine too.  Fresh books.  It was in Toronto I discovered them.  I was going to Roger's one week a month doing a call for help up there.  And it was always a pain at the end of the month to send out the invoice because I had to do it in Canadian dollars.  And I had to also add all the expenses.  And it was just, I would put it off and sometimes I wouldn't bill them for months at a time.  And it was Amber, Amber MacArthur who said, there's this new startup.  This was 2004.  There's this new startup in Toronto.  Fresh books.  You've got to try this because they make it easy to do all your invoices.  It's really, it's really, and it was, it saved my life.  I got finally got to see, cause it turns out if you don't do the invoice, you don't get paid.  Now fresh books has really expanded.  They have 10 million customers.  And it really is as much if you look at the dashboard accounting, but, but, but I don't hate almost hate saying that because you don't want to do accounting.  Nobody does.  But fresh books does it for you because in the, it turns out in the process of getting your invoices together and your expenses, you've got really all the profit and loss.  All the profit and loss stuff you need to know.  For instance, are you making a profit this week?  A lot of people, a lot of small business people don't know that till the end of the year, till tax time.  With fresh books, you can send professional looking invoices in seconds.  You get paid faster because you can accept credit cards.  Those invoices have a pay me button.  As a result, you get paid an average of twice as fast.  You don't have to chase clients for payments or wait in line at the bank.  You can accept credit card payments right from the invoice.  And actually clients love this too because paying bills is no more fun than making bills.  Truth is, you'll always know which invoices have been sent, which have been paid, even which have been viewed.  So there's no more saying I didn't get your invoice, which are overdue.  They will have automatic ticklers to go out to your client that say, hey, you know, you're overdue and they can get increasingly angry if you wish.  You could create proposals now in fresh books.  Because it's an online system, they add new features almost every day.  This new proposals features is awesome.  Rich text content, images, customizable sections.  You make a proposal to a client and it automatically feeds right in.  When they say yes, it feeds right into your invoicing.  And it showcases for your prospective clients how good you look and you win more jobs.  Know what you did. Know when you did it.  Never leave money on the table again.  Fresh books does the hard work for you.  All you got to do is make those invoices.  You can track expenses with the FreshBooks app.  Take a picture of their seat, goes right into the invoice, assign services to projects, even different rates for every service.  Basically, it's putting your business on autopilot.  You do the stuff you love that you got in the business for.  Let FreshBooks do payment reminders, late fees, automated at all so you can get back to doing what you want to do.  And of course, with the FreshBooks app, you stay connected to your clients and keep tabs on your business on the road, no matter where you are with the FreshBooks app.  Make 2018 your most productive year yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  People won't stop stealing bikes.  I don't know why you would want to.  Well, they're kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I get it.  Oh, they're the coolest bikes.  I mean, the larcenous thought has passed my mind, but obviously someone would know where you got it.  Well, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's got blue tires, green fender, yellow frame, pink seat.  It's going to be so cool.  They should sell them.  That's what there is the solution.  This is according to Wall Street Journal.  Google is constantly hunting for missing bikes at any time.  There are around 1100 of them on the campus.  That's so employees because it's a big campus can go from place to place.  But each week, about 10 percent to 20 percent disappear.  Many of the local lawns, roofs of local hot spots.  Somebody spotted one of the TV commercial.  One resident who happens to work at Oracle described the bikes as a friendly gesture to the community.  Even Mountain View's mayor, that's the city that Google's in, has admitted to taking one of the movies off campus.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Local police didn't want to help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So GPS trackers have been put on the bike.  I hope they're trackers.  They should provide free bikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They should just provide free bikes for the whole community.  How much can it cost for this bike?  They can afford it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A hundred bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other thing is they have a whole staff that does nothing but rebalance the bike distribution every night.  Wow.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're testing a system that's kind of like the city bike system.  You unlock it with your smartphone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The real problem is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That feels so depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's cool, you go to Google and they're just there.  Like in front, like somebody just rode up and you just hop on it.  I always wondered though, is it OK to just hop on it and ride off or is the expectation that the employee who rode it there will be able to ride it back?  No, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been told that you just pick one and hop on and...  You can't tell them apart.  They're all the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was a little problem earlier and this may be why Google wants to lock it down with bikes being dumped into the local creek.  That looks bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's not good.  That's mean.  That's just bad.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know in Amsterdam, they dredge the canals periodically and take out thousands and thousands of bikes.  And other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bikes are all over Amsterdam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bikes are all over Amsterdam.  That's one of the things I love about Holland, Denmark's the same way, Finland's the same way.  There are bikes, more people own bikes.  It's amazing how cultural it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I was in Estonia, it's also flat right on the water.  No bikes.  Didn't see a single bike.  Really?  How one culture goes crazy with them and the one not far away doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One other CES story I didn't mention.  Huawei, which is the big Chinese, it's the number three smartphone manufacturer in the world, not in the US.  They had made a deal for the Mate 10, their brand new high end phone, to sell it through AT&T and Verizon.  So what happened?  Congress.  Yeah, do we know why?  Congress.  AT&T pulled out of the deal, we think, because right before CES, by the way, we think.  Pressure.  Yeah, because remember, Congress had written a letter like two years ago saying be careful of the Chinese owned companies like Xiaomi, Huawei.  And partly because Chinese military owns part of them.  And apparently, the CEO of Huawei, who was speaking at CES, doing the demo of the Mate 10, at the end, he like goes off script and gets furious.  And he says, hey, we worked really hard to get this phone successful around the world and now here we are.  Everybody knows without carrier deals, you can't sell a phone in the United States successfully.  And Verizon is apparently considering, here's a little bit of his...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry, this sound is too echoey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I won't play it.  This is from The Verge.  But Richard Yu, who's the CEO of the Consumer Products Division, spent, according to The Verge, Vlad Zvov writing at The Verge, an hour mumbling his way through an awkwardly scripted presentation of the Mate 10 Pro.  He stammered, he hesitated, he was obviously uncomfortable on stage.  But then at the end, he said, well, there's one thing I want to share with you.  The teleprompter stopped showing any text and he talked about the failure of the carrier deal.  Shedding the earlier hesitation of his speech, Zvov writes, he made the point that American phone buyers can't have the best and widest choice of devices if Huawei products, those are the world's third biggest phone vendor, weren't on offer.  Everybody knows in the United States market that over 90% of smartphones are sold by carrier channels.  It's a big loss for us and also for carriers, but the more big loss is for consumers because consumers don't have the best choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it supposedly a security concern or is it a trade thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, probably a bit of both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, first of all, if you're asking Congress to tell you what the security issues are in a phone, you're asking the wrong person.  But I mean, the point's taken.  We talked about don't buy Kaspersky any virus because of their...  But the phone's a little different because first of all, every phone you use is an iPhone.  It's made in China.  Made in China.  Now somebody, I tweeted that and somebody said, well, yeah, but there's a difference between having it assembled in China and having the Chinese control of firmware.  Well, yeah, maybe.  I mean, if they're assembling it at Foxconn, there's nothing to stop Foxconn from.  I think if there were something going on in the Huawei phone, I'm sure many security pros taking it apart and knocked on it and tried to figure it out.  I'm sure it's safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'm not sure I would use a Chinese-made router.  Yes, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, where are the routers?  I don't know.  Where is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can get...  Well, I use TP-Link routers, but I think that's Taiwan, not China.  Yeah.  So, I mean, look, at some point, everything's going to be made in China.  It's an interesting question.  I think a lot of it is trade policy.  And there is definitely a kind of climate in Washington, an anti-Chinese climate in Washington.  We backed out of TPP, which was a trade deal with China.  Not that I was crazy about TPP because of the IP restrictions.  But nevertheless, I think there's a strong point to be made that free trade with countries is good for peace, if not for economies.  I think it's good for both.  But a country that's making a lot of money trading with you is much less likely, I think, to attack you, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a good theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we lost negotiating ability because the main diplomatic...  Somebody on MSNBC said this two days ago.  The main diplomatic pressure we had on China was the economic pressure through trade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's dumb to unilaterally back out of it.  You negotiate. You sit down. You negotiate.  In any event, I don't know whether it's trade or security.  The Mate 10 Pro is supposed to be a very nice phone.  It has a F1.6 Leica-made camera in it.  And I think it was going to sell.  You can still buy it in the U.S.  You just can't buy it from AT&T.  And apparently there's political pressure on Verizon also to back out of that deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little disturbing that the government is going around pressuring companies like AT&T to do deals with this country, but not that country.  I guess that's not anything unusual, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's a funny kind of pressure.  It's not saying don't do it.  It's saying, you know, there are security concerns about these Chinese phones.  Huawei is apparently partially owned by the Chinese military.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's also, hey, that's a nice business you got there.  I hate for anything to happen to it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, there's a lot to be said about, you know, China's rogue nation in some respects.  Certainly intellectual property rights are not protected in China.  But again, if you walk away from the table, you can't.  There's no good way to deal with that.  And I don't think you can not deal with China.  It's a, you know, a big, big market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no.  But you got to do it in a savvy way.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  Anyway, you can still buy the Huawei Mate 10 Pro because they're going to sell it online.  But most, as you know, most consumers don't take, but people who listen to this show take the time to find out what's available.  But most people just say, what do you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And at a Best Buy, everything is carrier tied, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  The carriers wield a huge amount of power in this country.  Yeah.  All sorts of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Getting bigger.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even worse in Canada.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lon Dogg says, that's what they taught me in high school.  More trade provides economic dependency on the two countries.  And this is all part of being a global economy where every country would be tied to another country.  But what they didn't teach you, says Lon Dogg in our chat room, is that once you're dependent on this other country, you're sort of powerless to do anything against them also.  I disagree.  It's an interdependency.  It's a relationship.  Interdependency, yeah.  It's a relationship.  Right.  You don't get ever married because then your wife is going to control you.  That's not true.  It's a relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On the other hand...  I for one welcome my new master.  Speaking of which, the story that got me this week was the James Daymore.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's talk about it.  He's filing a lawsuit, a class action lawsuit against Google saying it discriminates against white male conservatives.  Daymore was the guy who wrote the very controversial memo saying that we probably should think about how we hire women because women really aren't suited to technical positions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At the time, didn't people say to you, well, Leo, did you read the whole memo?  He makes a few points.  It was straight out of this men's rights BS and showing his true colors.  Racist, misogynist, there it is.  It amazes me.  I don't think it's gotten the kind of attention that I think it should get as a follow up to what the coverage of him was at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's joined by another former Google engineer, David Goodman, who worked on a query engine there.  He left the company in 2016.  You know, I am in the lawsuit says it's a class action suit representing all employees of Google who have been discriminated against due to their perceived conservative political views by Google, their male gender by Google and their Caucasian race.  Did you look at the suit at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no.  No.  So one of the things he mentions is he's got emails that appear to indicate that Google had a blacklist of conservative or right wing people who were flagged whenever they their name was entered into the system and then escorted off the premises.  I don't know if that's true.  I don't believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we'll see.  I mean, I feel like he became a poster boy, didn't he?  And I'm sure that's I don't know if he thought this up himself or if somebody came along and said, you know, this let's let's foot this bit.  Who knows? Peter Thiel might think the latter Peter Thiel might have said, hey, got a little extra money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there was I saw somewhere that he had met with Peter Thiel.  I don't know if that's true.  But I did see a rumor to that effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Asked.  They asked, let's see, who's this?  Daymour's attorney is Harmeet Dhillon.  He's a California representative for the Republican National Committee.  He was asked who's financing the suit.  And he told TechCrunch in an email, quote, nobody but my law firm is financing the suit at this time.  We may choose to seek funding in the future.  But neither Peter Thiel, I've been asked by others or anyone else is involved besides my clients in my firm.  Well, there you go.  I wonder how a court would treat this.  You'd have to you'd really have to demonstrate that there was a persistent pattern of this.  But if you could, that wouldn't be good.  But is but is affirmative.  See, I think this is kind of the conservative point of view of affirmative action in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why every time you hire a minority, they're going to argue that it was it was discrimination against white Canada.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is certified as a class action first.  It does you have to get a court to agree that you have standing to launch a class act.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is early days.  Yeah.  Let's talk about AMP.  Yeah.  This is AMP as as you know, we've talked a lot about it, including we had the head of Google's news operation, Richard Gingras on to defend AMP because I was even from day one.  So I'm not really I'm not crazy about this idea.  AMP is designed to speed up mobile browsing by and by the way, my blog is has AMP because I'm on WordPress and it was just a plug in.  So I checked the box.  So if you load my blog on AMP, Google restricts certain image types restricts all JavaScript except for certain stuff coming from Google's servers.  They they say it's open.  You could run your own AMP server, but I don't know anybody who does.  They also point out that AMP degrades well.  So if you don't have a browser that supports AMP, you'll get still the normal page.  It's not like they're cutting you off from the rest of the world.  But here's a letter from well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I look at the names.  There's lots and lots of names on it.  I have not seen one yet.  I don't know if you have Matthew that look familiar to me from our beds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know it's mostly developers and programmers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, on behalf of the organizations, media company people, but I don't two organizations involved.  Article 19 and the Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corporation.  I don't again know who these people are.  But it's an it says we are deeply concerned about AMP because it keeps users within Google's domain,  diverts traffic away from other websites for the benefit of Google.  And at the scale of billions of users, it has the effect of further reinforcing Google's dominance of the Web.  We acknowledge the problem of pages being slow to load.  Relative to alternative proprietary technologies like Facebook's instant articles and Apple News.  Publishers have always faced long and long faced difficult choices and poor incentives,  leading to bad decisions and compromises ultimately to terrible user experiences.  The AMP format is not in itself a problem, but there are two things they do say are a problem.  One content that opts in the AMP and the associated hosting within Google's domain is.  And this is a problem I brought up too, is granted preferential search promotion.  This is where I think they're most right.  Yes, because there's a bar, right?  An AMP bar at the top of the search results.  And secondly, when a user navigates from Google to a piece of content Google has recommended,  they are unwillingly still within Google's ecosystem.  And Google's addressed that, I think, with the URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They did. Yeah, it's not really.  I'll quibble with that one.  You're not really in Google's ecosystem.  You just have a Google URL.  It's not a Google page in the sense that Google puts ads on it or claims credit for it or any of that.  But it has been a problem.  And Google did announce, maybe coincidentally with this, that they, I don't know how they're going to do it,  but they had to change browsers to do this.  Yeah.  To change so the URL will stay the publishers.  I think that's always been important.  They're right.  And the letter is, I think, has a really good point about the promotion.  And I've complained about this from the very beginning.  That it should not be, you should be promoted because you have a fast page, not because you have an AMP page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's what Google says.  When I talked to Richard about this, he specifically said the signals that Google looks at in terms of putting things at the top or in the carousel are speed.  So coincidentally enough, Google AMP pages are really fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And how else do you get such a fast page?  Right.  So they've got to have an open way to promote speed on the web, which I think is God's work.  We all agree with that.  They've got to get rid of the URL, which they say they've done.  So I think they're making improvements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His point was if you could speed up your pages yourself by using something similar but not AMP, they would also show up high.  So it wasn't just the AMP, the fact that you were using AMP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that possible, Matthew?  AMP is such a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you just had text on your pages, if it was a static text, pages should load faster than anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take out all the JavaScript.  Take out all the JavaScript.  Take out all the ads.  And it'll load really fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean...  To make the money, but yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the other...  So the other thing they don't mention in there that I have heard as a criticism is that Google, it is technically open source, but Google is effectively directing it.  And they're implementing ad requirements that effectively benefit them.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which I agree with.  You can read this letter at ampletter.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you can also read the Google response about the URL.  I just went to a CNN page, and it now is amp.cnm.  It was already implemented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a similar...  I have a similar problem with Google talking about what it's doing for the web and the things it's doing that are good.  So for example, ad blocking in Chrome.  Blocking crappy ads is good.  It's good for users.  But presumably no Google ads will be blocked.  And so to have those measures implemented by one of the world's largest ad companies seems a little like a conflict to me.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I argued some time ago that publishers should create an ad blocker and thus hold to standards.  Yeah.  But we don't do that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And let's face it.  I mean, publishers are to blame.  The reason that AMP and Instant Articles could get so much traction is because publishers' websites are terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google, in a related story, stops serving ads from a shady rehab clinic in the UK following investigative report after announcing in September a temporary ban on those ads in the United States.  So, you know, the last line of the AMP letter really is the line that matters most to me, which is the web is not Google and should not just be Google.  And we're really seeing a salt in many directions on a free and open Internet, a free and open web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know, it's not just Google.  I don't think this is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if it's that or not.  I mean, if it has the impact of that, whether it's Google's intent, you started saying, Matthew, we see it somewhere else.  Where else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was just saying it's not just Google.  It's Facebook, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, that's Facebook, Instant Articles.  Yeah.  Facebook would love you never to leave Facebook.  They don't even ever link out.  I mean, they blatantly don't link out of Facebook.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  In fact, they've spent a long time hiding links, making it difficult to see the canonical link, making it hard for people to click and move off the platform because they want to keep you within the ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, if you blame Google for doing something a little bit like that, you got to blame Facebook for doing something a lot like that.  Well, I would say both are, you know, I've been critical of both and I do think we just need to be aware of it because it's such a great the open web and the open net is such a great resource.  We need to defend it.  Obviously, we need to defend it against all attacks, whether it's from the FCC.  Did Adjit Pai give his speech at CES?  No, no, he wouldn't go because he got death threats.  But then there was some thought he might do it via Skype.  Oh, I didn't see that.  That would be pretty funny.  Especially if it's got slowed down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, especially if it got slowed down.  No, he didn't go.  He should have used the telepresence bot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the little robot coming out.  I imagine Pai.  Like a potent.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he's not only did he see.  So this kind of does put lie to the reason, you know, he said, well, I can't do it because it's not safe.  But he didn't even make an appearance via tele.  Yeah, you're right.  So what he doesn't really what's not safe is he doesn't want to talk about it.  The session was a FCC FTC super session with FTC acting chair Maureen Olhausen and Gary Shapiro of the CTA.  But nobody from the FCC there.  And of course, they talked about net neutrality.  Shapiro opened the event saying possibly no other session in CES history has gotten as much pre show attention as this one.  But he did.  He's you know, he said, I just probably faced some horrible situations involving some personal threats to his life and his kids in his home.  That's a shame.  Please, if you want to fight for neutrality, don't do it by attacking a person or even worse, their family.  The CTA's position on net neutrality.  That's tough, right?  Because the Consumer Technology Association represents Verizon, among others.  This is a very complex issue in terms of nuance under any scenarios, says Gary Shapiro.  Republicans and Democrats agree on the most fundamental basic principles of being able to get what you should get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Whatever that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The assignment here was write something as long as possible.  No one will read it. No sense.  No matter what. No idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No matter which laws evolve over time, there's the backup of the FCC, the backup of Congress, and there's the bipartisan agreement on the basic fundamental principles, which I haven't stated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But something like being able to get what you should get is the tautological fundamental principle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you should have what you have and you should see what you see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you should say what you mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. He left that one out.  Yeah, I understand. Poor Gary.  I mean, that's he's got to represent all the all the companies involved in this.  Mark Zuckerberg has a personal challenge every year.  What was it one year he was going to hunt and kill all the meat that he would eat?  And then last year, I think it was to create a AI that would run his house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he learned Mandarin. He learned Mandarin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would say arguably that was the most effective.  This year, his challenge is fixing Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good luck with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I admire him for saying there's something wrong with Facebook.  But what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But couldn't that have been his challenge last year or the year before or the year before that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Eric Melber on MSNBC has been, I think, in some ways too tough on Zuckerberg and Facebook.  But he did a good response to that. And he said, Good, Mark, good. You know, you've done this.  He said every other one of your challenges has had a goal and a metric.  We don't see that here.  What's the goal? What's the metric for success?  I think it was a fair challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you measure it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To Mark Zuckerberg and say, OK, identify what the problem is and tell us how you're going to see when you fix it.  I mean, I think that it's a it's obviously a very amorphous challenge in terms of saying, how do I get rid of bad actors better?  And how do we support better community?  That's pretty amorphous. But I think Melber has a point that that, OK, then let's start to make it tangible the way you engineers do.  And then judge your success, your progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Peter Drucker. I will invoke Peter Drucker, great management expert, who said all goals have to be smart, specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time bound.  We've got time bound. We certainly have relevance.  Don't know about the measure. Oh, now I'm going to get a free 2018 Lifeland toolkit. Thank you very much.  I don't know about measurable and achieve achievable, maybe a measurable.  How? That's the question. How? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't remember if it was Drucker. Someone said culture eats strategy for breakfast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It sounds like a Drucker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook's culture is not going to change overnight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very good point. Very good point. Yeah.  Well, look, you know, Mark's capable of taking on big challenges.  This is a big one. Yeah.  The first thing is saying what's wrong with Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think it comes around to what is Facebook's public responsibility.  That's what I would hold them to.  They are such a major force in the world now.  Then how are they being misused? How can they be better used?  How can they have a positive impact? How can he mitigate the negative impact?  They'll always be negative impact. You're never going to get rid of trolls.  You're never going to get rid of spammers.  You're never going to get rid of people who are going to exploit a system.  It's not going to be perfect.  But what are the goals for the company and how do you inculcate that?  I think it's a fair challenge. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, one thing Facebook can't get rid of, M, it's AI concierge.  Remember when they announced this? It was a big deal.  Remember when chat bots were the next big thing? Yeah.  Even I think it was even I was excited at the F8 conference where they were talking about it  and it didn't take me more than a few days to go, eww.  And I wasn't alone apparently.  Chat bots have some merit if they're done right.  I still use a couple of chat bots, but in general this is not a great user interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The interesting thing was M was mostly human beings. Right.  It wasn't actually AI at all. It was human beings pretending to be robots.  They wanted to make it AI. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think they never, yeah, that's one reason to kill it. It's probably expensive.  They're going to have M suggestions, which is a feature that benefits from all of the M conversations it's had over the last couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you ever use M? No. Did you? Never. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was it just iPhone? No, I don't think so.  I think it was any Facebook Messenger, if you got approved for it.  Here's the example from Buzzfeed. I don't know if this really is one.  M says, how's your day going so far? And you say, not bad, kind of busy and I'm hangry.  And then M gives you a button to order food. Okay.  I mean, I don't want to have that conversation, frankly. I just want to press the button that says order food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could see chat functions. Do you think chat functions will make their way into Google Assistant and Amazon Echo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  I'll tell you what I really want to see. I'm going to start actively lobbying for this.  Because right now we have this Tower of Babel where you have different assistants, different commands, different capabilities.  What I want, and I think we were talking about this on Windows Wiggly, Microsoft, or Apple, given that they've lost the race,  should pivot and say, but we're going to give you a meta assistant.  You talk to Cortana and it will figure out which assistant does the thing you want it to do.  And it will hand it off and say, do that for Leo.  I don't want to talk to them all. I don't want to remember the syntax for all of them.  Nobody does. It's too complicated. It's like speaking French, German and English all at the same time.  I want one assistant who's smart enough to figure out how to do what I want.  That's kind of what M could have been.  Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's too bad that these things are creating effectively new silos.  The same way we had with instant messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it surprising? I mean, that's what companies do. This is capitalism.  So all these companies do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I admit, I tried to use my Amazon Echo to play music through Google Play and it didn't work very well.  But using Amazon Music worked fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. And shopping.  Given what we just talked about, how Google has just taken off,  I'm wondering, maybe it would be in Google's interest to say, well,  because one of the things I like to do that Google doesn't do is listen to audiobooks from Audible.  Wouldn't it be great if Google could some, I'm obviously not going to do a deal with Amazon,  because they don't like each other.  But maybe this is a way to solve this problem is just ask Google Assistant,  could you contact Amazon and get my book and play it for me or something?  BetaWorks had a, in New York, John Bothbrook's organization,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  had an event with voice companies, which I talked about on the show probably about nine, ten months ago.  And that was discussed there.  That you're going to have the cacophony of voices.  You basically just have to ask Metta and have it go and find the right thing.  And there's work on that in essence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but that's the problem is that kind of the opposite of what these companies want.  They want the software, right?  They want lock in.  That's why I would, I would, it might be best to go to a Microsoft whose Cortana voice assistant is clearly way back and say,  here's an opportunity that you could, you know.  Yeah, I don't think Apple would do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's just not an Apple's DNA.  It is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amazon's Echo services are coming to PCs, HP, Asus, and Apple.  Asus and Acer are all going to, and I think this is with Microsoft's cooperation, add Echo to the PCs.  And Microsoft did do some sort of relationship between Cortana and Echo.  Maybe before you install an Echo, you should read this story.  Amazon coughs up record amount of info to subpoena happy US government.  Amazon received 2000 requests for information from governments in the first six months of 2017 and approved 900 in full, almost half of them.  This is from their own transparency report they do twice a year.  One thousand nine hundred thirty six of those requests came from the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Seventy five from non US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  So Apple makes a big deal of because they don't rely on advertising.  No, we don't. We don't track you.  We don't know anything.  What does Siri know about you?  What does Alexa know about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The same things.  And don't you think Apple when approached, you can't fight these.  What are you going to do?  No, you can't.  You can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, don't Amazon and Apple both say they don't store your commands?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, Amazon absolutely stores your commands.  I know Google.  Google, you can actually go to your dashboard and see them.  All of them.  All of them.  Amazon.  I'm pretty sure you can see some of them on the Amazon app.  I'm trying to remember.  I think you can listen back.  And I'm sure Siri does too, because that's how they learn.  Right.  I don't know.  Does this.  This is a good question.  Chat room.  Can you work on this for us?  Be my personal assistant.  Does what does Apple say about the stored audio from a Siri command?  What happens to that?  Wasn't there a case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't there a legal case where they were trying to get access to recordings of conversation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Apple said, we don't have it.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you're talking about the that was Amazon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they started with the hot tub.  Hot tub.  What?  It all started with the hot tub.  It was the hot tub murder.  And the guy denied that he did it.  Yeah.  And so police subpoenaed Amazon in case.  I don't know.  The victim went, Echo, the murderer is or something.  I don't know.  No, they thought there'd be stray audio, perhaps, because, you know, sometimes your Echo gets  triggered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they said they only keep the commands.  No, Amazon fought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They didn't say we don't have it.  They fought it.  Yeah.  Then they gave up because the police gave up.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought they said they don't keep the voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have the actual voices, I think, because that was the point is who was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they thought they did.  I think the police thought they did.  But I think I thought Amazon said they don't keep the ambient audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fortunately, there is a way to look back.  Look at this here.  Amazon.  If only there was a global network.  I mean, let's just point out how miraculous this is.  There's no question that can't be answered with a Google search.  Yeah.  Amazon's pushing back against Arkansas prosecutors demand for information from a murder suspect  smart speaker setting up another legal battle.  Oh, by the way, thanks to the Internet, we now have autoplay audio.  Autoplay video.  Benton County prosecuting attorney Nathan Smith hopes the voice activated Echo, which  answers blah, blah, blah, will provide information about a man came to be found dead at 31-year-old  James Bates hot tub.  The defense attorney says there's nothing useful in the vice.  Applauds Amazon for protecting privacy.  But I don't I don't think Amazon, at least not in this article, said we don't have it.  They just said we don't want to give it to you.  The battle continued.  By the way, the prosecutor also subpoenaed the water records for the house.  And I think I think the guy got convicted because there was a big use of water like  in the middle of the night.  And the presumption was he was using it to wash away the blood.  Anyway, I hope I'm not misstating that.  According to Amazon, Echo works by constantly listening for the wake word, then records  your voice, transfers it to a processor for analysis.  The recordings are streamed and stored remotely and can be reviewed or deleted over time,  presumably by the user.  So Amazon said that they do have those recordings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So wait, they handed over the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they gave they they stopped the fight because the police stopped asking for it  because they got the water records.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When was that?  When was that story from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is from December 28th, 2016.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this in March 2017?  TechCrunch says Amazon handed over data from the Echo.  Oh, because the defendant agreed to allow police to review it.  Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I remember that now.  Yes.  Suspect OKs Amazon to hand over Echo recording.  That's right.  That's what they stopped.  They stopped because the guy said, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they handed over a record, but they refused to hand over the actual audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So like a transcript?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Interesting.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It just shows you, though, between your water records, your echo.  There's a lot of data about what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Water records has nothing to do with the Internet at all.  I'll just be clear about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it does because he had a smart water meter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Not Internet, but it was smart monitoring his usage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I got into a Twitter tiff this week with Tom Peters, the Peter Principal.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Because he went on about Facebook is the worst thing on earth and he compared it to the atom  bomb.  Yes.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Come on.  Well, I think the atom bomb has killed more people in Facebook.  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I fear genetic manipulation.  I thought, Jesus, what is he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, was it was the Peter Principal the one where people rise to their level of incompetence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  No comment.  It's kind of appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, oh, my God.  December 2017, Arkansas judge drops murder charge in Amazon Echo case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm just reading that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The case was dismissed.  I can't stand in front of a jury and ask them to convict someone beyond a reasonable doubt,  said the prosecuting attorney.  He filed the he actually wasn't the judge.  It was the prosecutor who filed the motion.  If I beyond a reasonable doubt, if I have a reasonable doubt.  So Bates says I'm 100% innocent.  The charges were dropped.  I did nothing wrong.  I'm not going to hide.  So my apologies to James Bates.  Innocent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In that story, Amazon says that it listens or so it's always listening, but it's listening  for the wake word.  Right.  And only then does it.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So there's no there's not a general.  It's not like there's a bug in your house.  No, no.  Right.  Yeah.  We've said that over and over.  That's true of your phone.  That's true of all of these.  They don't you would they would use huge amounts of bandwidth if they're constantly streaming  your.  You couldn't store all that.  You couldn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You wouldn't want to do it.  And if you Google, you can look at exactly what it's kept.  What it heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you can change it.  Yeah.  No, that's true of all of these.  And actually, I think most people who are worried about the privacy concerns are merely  saying yes, but with a FISA court order or a national security letter, the FBI could  turn on the microphone in your Echo and stream everything without your knowledge.  That's what people are concerned about.  Or that Amazon could be doing it selectively or whatever.  So there you go.  A tragic accident stemming from drinking.  And that's that.  OK, so I apologize.  Now that we've gone through all the and that was just that just happened a month ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So use an Echo, but not a hot tub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well we know hot tubs are dangerous.  The atomic bomb.  No germs.  Worse.  Germs.  Germs.  Nuclear germs.  Germs.  You know, the state of California, I don't know how it is in Canada or New Jersey for  that matter, but the state of California dictates that no hot tub can be hotter than 140 degrees.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why?  So you don't cook yourself to death.  Hard boys.  Have you heard about the frogs?  I happen to like 105 degrees.  So when we got our hot tub installed, I asked the installer, can I hack this?  He said no, not with any ease.  It's built into the pit.  What?  In the state.  And I bet because it's in the state of California, it's the same everywhere because if you want  to sell hot tubs to every state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It should be your right to cook yourself at whatever temperature you desire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could, well, and if I want my bathtub to be 120 degrees, I could do that.  There's no limit on how hot my water here can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the freedom the founding fathers fought for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And 104 degrees is tepid.  It's not.  No, it's not good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not good enough.  Not good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got as high as 106.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'm not a big fan of the nanny state.  I think we should all have seat belts on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hot tubs and spas in the US, Canada and most parts of the world have been regulated.  Canada too.  Hello, Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Since when?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Strokes could be caused by water temperatures of 106 or higher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's my right to have a stroke if I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  If I want to have a stroke, I should be allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I don't want, I agree.  106 is a little hot, but 104 is a little cool.  I would like to, I usually go 105, 106.  I do.  When I was a kid, that's how we set the hot tub.  On December 31st, 1979.  Yeah, the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued an advisory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's not, like I have friends and they put it at 106 all the time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they must have a pre-1979 hot tub heater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have a hot tub time machine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Black market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got a black market.  I want it, I seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh man, that was a long route to that.  I seriously wanted to hack.  I know.  I seriously want to hack my hot tub heater to go a little, just a little hotter.  It's just not hot enough.  How many people died in hot tubs?  Really?  Of the heat.  From the heat.  Yeah, from other causes maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay Google.  How many people have died from hot tubs?  Didn't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's always fun to ask Siri these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How many hot tub deaths were there in the last 20 years?  Yeah, they're really thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can search the web for answers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's...  Okay Google.  How many hot tub deaths were there in the last 20 years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the 20 years might be messing up.  The reason I use 20 years is because it's been 22 years that we have been using processors  that could be easily hacked thanks to the meltdown and specter flaw.  Intel started using speculative execution in 1995.  This is still going on by the way, this whole issue.  I asked Paul Therotte if this was kind of a Paul on CES because even like, not just  PCs, I mean most modern processors, except for the simplest stuff like an Apple Watch  or a Raspberry Pi are vulnerable and particularly shared processors.  But he said it didn't seem to be slowing down the excitement over the processor controlled  thermostat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see Scott Hanselman's discussion on how to explain it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We talked a little bit about this yesterday on security.  I had used it a couple of times.  Scott is a programmer at Microsoft.  He's smart.  Explaining meltdown to non-technical spouse.  So he's talking to his, I guess, non-technical spouse.  You know how we finish each other's sandwiches?  No.  Sentences.  But you guessed sandwiches and it was in your mind for an instant and it was a password  and someone stole it while it was there fleeting.  Oh, that is bad.  Brilliant.  And by the way, exactly 280 characters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's simplified, but yeah, roughly true.  Roughly true.  I don't know.  I don't really know how you explain it to anybody except that there's a, you know, there's  a problem and this is going to be a hard problem to fix.  And now Intel and Microsoft are saying processors, the only processors who won't be vastly slowed  down by this are the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth generation Intel processors.  Haswell and earlier we can fix, but it will be really slow.  And I mean like really slow.  And that's bad news.  Epic Games published a graph which we showed yesterday on security now.  Let me see if I can find it.  Oh, you're fast.  Look at that.  That's from the verge.  So this is the, what you're seeing, I'll explain it is kind of the sine wave of usage.  You know, it peaks at, you know, 7 p.m.  People get home to play this game called Fortnite.  This is their Fortnite servers.  They applied the mitigation.  You see that big spike?  Wow.  They applied the mitigation where that big spike is, not the first one, but the second  one.  And from then on, processor usage was two and a half times higher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Didn't Google say that they are on their, on their CPUs, they've, they've done something  which had minor impact?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  More modern processors apparently will have less of an impact.  It is important though you do this, these shared servers have to do it because a rogue  process could see everything going on in the server.  So or a lot of what's going on in the server.  So that's a, yeah, that is bad.  That is bad.  There is the, really the bad thing is the vast majority of Android phones will never  be fixed even though they're vulnerable.  Right.  Vast majority.  The good news is it's not the easiest hack to implement.  And even if you do it, it's not one of those hacks that gives you like root access to the  smartphone or a computer.  It's one of those hacks that some information is leaked and it could contain among a lot  of other stuff, passwords and credit cards or some other stuff.  But you, you don't know what you're getting.  You're just getting a blob of data.  You have to comb through it, figure out what it is.  It's not the kind of attack I think that lends itself to a mass infection.  It's much more useful for a targeted attack.  Like if you were a bad guy or the NSA and you knew that, you know, Sony Pictures Entertainment  was up to no good, you would send them spear phishing attacks and you'd kind of have some  idea of what you're looking for in the data that you'd get back.  Anyway, it's going to be around forever.  It's not, this is not going to go away.  Although it'd be interesting because Paul Therot speculated maybe this will be a big  bump in new PC sales this year.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Warrantless phone laptop searches at the US border hit record levels.  Did we cover this last week?  No.  I don't think so.  Oh Lord.  I was thinking that it had gone down.  It has not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was a story on the rundown last week.  We didn't, we didn't talk about it.  We'll think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But yeah, it's scary.  Figures released on the first Friday of the month, which was what?  January 5th, reveal that customs and border protection officers searched 32,200 devices.  Weirdly enough, the majority of them, people going out of the US, not into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Weird.  Yeah.  Well, that's really weird because you don't go through customs when you leave the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't, well maybe I'm misunderstood.  It's a 60% increase over last year.  2,500 searches a month.  But remember 400 million people across the border.  So it's a tiny fraction of total.  And of the searches, 32,000 searches, I think four out of five were US citizens.  So we've talked a little bit about this.  The ACLU says that the policy, there's a new policy, by the way, that this border patrol  will only be able to, so they'll be able to access your phone and the contents of it,  but they can't, they can't search cloud data or copy files without all reasonable cause.  Interesting.  That's something.  That's a new, that's a new policy.  My problem is if you lose control of your device, if they actually take your device  and go in another room, you don't know what's been done to it.  What they did to it.  And so then that raises, it hasn't happened to me and you travel an awful lot, Jeff, and  I presume it hasn't happened to you.  I would know.  But then we're not Brown.  Right.  But if it did, I think the prudent thing would be to throw away the phone and the floor right  on the laptop, which I don't know.  Maybe that's the prudent thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't seem like a very good thing.  Is there anything that they could do when they do that?  Is there anything they could do that would affect your cloud stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, so I think it would be a violation of the policy, but they could just, so the policy,  well first of all, it doesn't need a warrant.  It just needs probable cause.  Right.  So only a court can decide then after the fact whether that was merited.  Right.  They take it.  Now normally what they do is they attach to a machine that just take all the data off  of it.  That apparently requires probable cause now.  So I would imagine most likely they would say, please unlock it, sir.  And you say no.  The ACLU says, say no.  And then they'll say, well, okay, but you're going to have to stay here until you do.  And then you call the number that you have in your wallet for the ACLU lawyer who comes  to spring you from airport jail.  That's how the ACLU says it should happen.  More likely what you'll do is say, oh, look, I got to get home.  Just whatever.  Unlock the phone.  They take it and they, if they take it out of your presence, they could put a Trojan  horse on it that would get everything forever.  That's the fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what I'm asking is, so let's say you throw out that phone, but you remain on Google  box.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One of the things they could have, well, if they got your Google password, you're screwed.  You should change all your passwords while you're at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, they could get your one password, right?  They could get your password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One password is great because one password has a travel setting, which eliminates everything  from your password vault until you get home and then you can re-sync it.  But if they could get into your one password, that would be very bad.  I don't know.  So good news.  Senate Democrats have put together enough co-sponsors to force a vote, 30 votes necessary  to force a vote on the net neutrality repeal at Markey, Claire McCaskill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a later number.  It's now up to 43, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Needs to be 51, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but they passed the number needed for a vote.  At least they have to put it on the floor.  Yeah.  It has to go on the floor.  Collins, and this doesn't make up for her last vote, is now in.  She's a Republican.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's a Republican, so they got a Republican.  Remember, Doug Jones replaced Luther Strange, so that's two.  So maybe it's completely, I mean, this is completely the right-  But then that's just the Senate.  Right.  And you get the House is impossible.  So never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it does, I mean, at least have the vote and protest against Ajit Pai.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Netflix, who was vacillating about net neutrality for a while, has said officially, we will  see you in court.  They tweeted, this is the new way of communicating with the world.  In 2018, the internet is united in defense of net neutrality for the FCC.  We will see you in court.  It makes it a lot easier to report these stories when it's under 140 characters.  Just read the tweet.  It took them a while though, right?  I mean-  Yeah, they even said initially, yeah, we don't have to worry about it.  We don't care about net neutrality.  We don't care.  We don't care.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We don't worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google shut down its CES booth because it's not waterproof.  There's apparently a lot of leakage.  The rain, they got more than an inch of rain in 24 hours.  That's half of the yearly rainfall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  An inch?  I know, an inch.  Big deal.  But you see all the tarps on the Google booth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Google basically just didn't plan for the idea that it could rain in Las Vegas.  No, not Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The ceiling of the convention center.  No, I thought this was an outdoor booth.  Oh, it was.  It was a two-level outdoor booth.  I'm sorry.  You're right.  It's an outdoor booth.  Not meant to withstand rain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, all those devices getting wet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All those guys in white suits having to mop it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What I didn't know is that this is the first time Google's had an exhibit at CES.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  This is one of the things that if you, I remember Microsoft doing this one year.  They built a house in the parking lot.  It was like the Wizard of Oz.  They just dropped a house in the parking lot and it was to show off tablets.  This is way back when Microsoft was, Bill Gates loved tablets in the early 2000s.  This might have been Comdex.  I don't even remember what show it was, but it was in the parking lot.  You go in the house and there was a room in each house and there was a person in the room  that represented the room.  Of course, the wife was in the kitchen.  The husband was sitting in front of the TV.  Junior was upstairs and they all had a Microsoft tablet.  So Google did the same thing.  They built a structure in the house with, among other things, a slide, a huge video  wall and now it's wet.  Oh, jeez.  Here's the slide, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This was all about Google Assistant.  They were very much there for Google Assistant.  Anything else you guys want to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see here.  Did you do your other ad?  No, you're about to do that.  Okay, hold on.  I'll do my other ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  HTC shows a new pro version of its Vive, lots more resolution, so it can make you even sicker.  The first standalone Daydream headset.  This is, you know, Daydream requires a smartphone, but Lenovo and Google are making one that  has its own computer built in.  And they have announced new VR180 consumer cameras, 180 degree consumer cameras.  I don't know if that's related.  Lenovo and Yi technology, Yi makes the cameras, I'm sure.  I have a Yi action cam.  Oh, I get it.  VR180 is the name of this.  The content is VR180.  So the headset, which is made by Lenovo, is called the Mirage Solo with Daydream.  It uses Google's WorldSense motion tracking technology to sense when a user is doing things  like crouching, dodging, leaning.  Normally, like the Vive and the Oculus, they have cameras, sensors, so they know when you  move.  Snapdragon 835, 4 gigs of RAM, so it's kind of like a smartphone in there.  Seven hours on a charge according to Lenovo.  I think, Paul Thoreau was talking about it, I think he tried it and said he liked it.  But maybe he was excited about it.  So now you, I don't, you know, I have a Daydream I don't think I've ever used it.  Ever.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Who's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, hello.  Who's that?  Hey.  Oh my God.  Stacy Higginbotham as I live and breathe.  Hello from CES.  Stacy Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or rather from my hotel room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, thank you.  We asked, I asked Carson C if we'd get you to join us.  How nice to see you.  Hi, Stacy.  Hello.  So this was an IoT CES, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is.  That was the big theme of the show.  If I'm pushing anything, it's all IoT all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like a Mike multi-cooker with the assistant built in.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's not focus on the assistant.  The big focus, everyone's like, voices everywhere.  What's really awesome about it is the fact that voices everywhere means we finally stopped  talking about standards.  We're never going to get there on standards, but we found a way around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You mean like Zigbee, Z-Wave and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All of that.  Yes.  We, and even things like device schemas, which super nerdy, but like saying things like I'm  a light bulb.  I can do the following things.  My hope was there would be like a universal protocol that does all that.  We never got there, but now because the Amazon Echo and Google Assistant and all are trying,  they're building that for us.  So it's not ideal.  I would rather have it be more open, but it's where we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, cool.  Did you tell us about some of the devices or things you saw that you thought were interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  So you guys are going to be so mad at me, but I haven't had much of a chance to walk  the show floor.  I've got a couple of things that you've been doing meetings the whole time.  I've been doing a lot of meetings.  Kevin is the guy walking the floor.  Okay.  I do have some cool stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would never, I would never call Kevin a floor walker, but okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's what he excels at that.  He walks through and he's just like talking to people.  He's a floor runner.  Exactly.  Well, that's true.  Yeah.  Kevin Toffle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Matthew, Kevin Toffle.  It's awesome.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the coolest thing.  Okay.  I'm trying to decide.  Okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  One for normal people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love the fact that both Kohler and Delta are doing faucets with not just Amazon Echo  enabled, but are doing it to add additional values.  So you can tell your faucet, dispense a cup of water and it will dispense a cup of water.  Exactly a cup.  Exactly a cup.  Or you can even train it like my spaghetti pot.  I can train it like fill the spaghetti pot and that means fill this much water.  That's cool.  And then later on I can do it.  So I love that.  I also saw some cool, this is super geeky, but Bosch was showing off a MEMS projector  that basically is this tiny 30 by 70 millimeter module.  And what it can do is it can project a small, like a small, like a small, like a small,  like a 70 millimeter module.  And what it can do is it can project a display at 480 to 720p.  It can even run video and you can actually interact with that display on any surface,  including your skin.  So your couch, your skin, your, I don't know, kitchen table, like an Amazon Echo like device  could project an image of the people walking up to your door or, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you don't need a screen.  It almost could just appear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that's exactly it.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that available this year or is it a concept or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's an actual working, it's a MEMS product.  So that's a semiconductor product.  So people will have to build that into their devices.  So you won't see that for another, I don't know, 18 months to two years.  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow, that's cool.  Low power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's relatively low power.  The most unique thing about it is its form factor is now small enough and it can project on any surface  without messing things up.  Oh, look, you found it.  Look at you finding these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's Carson.  He's the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It can do video?  It can show video.  Actually, I don't think this is actually, that's the accelerometer.  But that's okay.  I did learn about the accelerometer.  I can tell you why that's cool if you really want to know.  They use MEMS for that as well.  Yeah, MEMS are, I always explain MEMS to people.  Like MEMS are the hidden heroes of the Internet of Things because MEMS are these tiny things that take the  analog real world signals of every day and they convert it to digital for the computer to read.  So you've got the real world meets the computer in this one tiny little device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This projector uses lasers too.  It does.  Which is cool.  Lasers.  Lasers.  Lasers.  So we were talking about this Bosch bathroom because they've got a toilet, they've got a shower,  they've got a tub, they've got a faucet.  I do like the idea of it kind of, that's, you came up with it and I mentioned, well, the idea is you tell it,  you know, what temperature you like the shower to be and have it warmed up and ready for you and that kind of stuff.  But now you know that the central hall has had a complete blackout for about an hour and a half.  It's just now coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin told me that.  He's like, I had to move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What would happen to your fancy bathroom if you couldn't use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, guys, here's what happens.  It reverts back to state.  So I have a, I have a Bosch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It has a faucet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a faucet that's a capacitive touch faucet.  And when the power goes out, then I use the hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You just have to live like a.  Yeah, it's like like a savage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We actually can't use anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now we can because we have a generator, but we have well water.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if we lose power, we lose the water too.  I know.  Yeah, that's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's like when an escalator breaks, it just becomes stairs.  Yeah.  Exactly.  What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What else?  Come on.  You're our, you're our eyes and ears in Vegas.  Cool stuff.  More stuff.  More cool stuff.  You put up.  How long have you been there?  When did you get there?  Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  Go to, go to our Instagram and I'm not doing that to advertise, but I'm doing it to.  What's your Instagram?  Like it's Stacy on I it's Instagram, whatever slash Stacy and IOT.  Cause then you'll see everything that Kevin and I have seen basically.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you saw these little Sony smart speakers with Google assistant.  Nice.  Those are not exciting.  Not exciting.  Here's the Samsung smart thing refrigerator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's a really big deal in like Samsung.  Three years ago, Samsung was like, IOT is going to happen.  It's going to be open.  It's going to be awesome.  And we, it was very kumbaya and Kevin and I made total fun of it along with the rest  of the industry.  This year, they actually are making that happen and they're doing it at a higher level.  So three years ago, they talked all about like Tizen and stuff like that.  Normal people were probably like, now they're basically, they've integrated all of their  like 60 some odd apps into the smart things cloud.  They built all of their backend cloud stuff is now smart things.  So this is the new interface.  This is the TV showing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So your TV is going to be able to control all these crazy devices and it's going to  have the same interface across all Samsung products.  So it's a big freaking deal.  And it doesn't have to be just Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I see we have an Arlo camera on here.  We have an air purifier, lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have so many devices are already integrated.  Oh, there's Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin.  Believe it or not, this looks like a selfie, but no, he's looking in the mirror.  This is a smart mirror.  Oh, see, it's got the temperature.  It's got the music.  So you're in the bathroom.  You're looking at the mirror.  It can be connected to a scale and a skin sensor.  So you can see that's from higher.  That's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm getting, I'm getting a smart mirror shipped to me, I think next week.  So I'll bring it on the show either next week or the week after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love this.  I would get a smart mirror.  I want to build one.  How do you do it?  Is it like something behind the mirror that shines through?  I guess it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the screen on the mirror?  Yes.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I stayed in a hotel once that had a mirror, but when you turn on the TV, it shined through  the mirror.  It's just like one way mirror or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a Google engineer who built one with a Raspberry Pi.  I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we talked about it.  Oh yeah, yeah, right.  There, I'm sorry, Huawei, you can't use these because they're from China.  It has a bunch of sensors, cameras, motion detectors.  I'm just going through TDK sensors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's tons of sensors.  Everybody has a smart home section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know what else to say about that.  Lenovo, I'm sure we'll get there eventually, but Lenovo has a very nice Google Assistant.  It's the Echo Show for the Google Assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We talked about that and I'm excited.  They say it won't be out until the summer.  It's beautiful.  It sounds good.  It's affordable.  Oh, you heard it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got a 10 watt speaker in it.  The big one's $249, the small one's $199, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a very competitive price.  That's basically an Echo Show, which is a seven inch screen.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks good.  I do believe Google will probably win this race if you start thinking about what needs  to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're starting to pull ahead.  Here you are at the Wemo booth.  Of course, Wemo announced HomeKit compatibility across the board, which is a big deal because  Apple HomeKit has been very slow off the block.  I noticed a big, hey, Google sign in the back there.  Obviously, they also work with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm kind of down on HomeKit.  There's a lot of HomeKit compatible stuff.  As usual, Apple is not here.  I just found out that earlier this summer, I'm trying to get rid of that blue line there,  earlier this summer, Lennar had partnered with Apple for HomeKit enabled buildings like  smart new builds for homes.  They actually switched over to SmartThings now.  I was like, oh, that's no good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You saw the Jibo there.  Now, I have to say, my Jibo failed.  I have a dead Jibo, which is really the reason.  Really?  I wasn't too unhappy because I'm sure there's a way to turn this off, but I couldn't find it.  The Jibo snored.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is a totally acute thing that it would do.  What did it sound like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The first time.  It would just make little sounds every once in a while, which was disconcerting.  That's to comfort you.  It didn't comfort me.  It was creepy.  I was kind of glad when it died.  I have to contact the Jibo folks.  I don't know if I want a replacement or I might want my money back on it.  How much was the Jibo?  That was a special Indiegogo price.  I think it's more than that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are a ton of robots here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are there?  Did you see the curry that was our advertiser?  Are they there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't see the curry.  I saw, I want to say it was the Aurelius, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Curry was supposed to be out by now and I'm worried that they aren't out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hard to build a good robot.  It's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey, did you see the Chloe video?  LG?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That didn't work.  LG was trying to show their...  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes, I saw that after the fact.  The guidance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Couldn't get it to respond at all.  I was very interested.  I don't know if you saw this.  Johnson Controls has a beautiful thermostat that's a glass...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  $319 Cortana thermostat.  Yeah, GLAS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I loved it.  Did you see it?  I've seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go look for it because it's there.  Gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, it is gorgeous.  I'm hoping that technology comes down in price because that really, that changed the game  in the way Nest didn't quite in making a thermostat look like a luxury object.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's the Solace, my home Solace 250, Google Assistant or Echo enabled.  And this controls everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are everywhere.  Everything.  This is a very common category.  Yeah, panels of stuff with little tiles on them that control all your devices and have  a bajillion radios.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Fibaro, I like the name, smart plug, monitors energy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, with the USB charger.  I like that because I was going to have to rip out all of my outlets and put USB chargers  and now I can just plug those in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like a smart plug-in from Fibaro.  The Blink doorbell, battery powered front door.  So it competes with our sponsor Ring.  Looks similar.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, Amazon bought Ring.  Sorry, Amazon, sorry, Amazon bought Blink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so this is Amazon's company now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now this is like, I think it was, was it Christmas?  Like the 23rd or something is when it came.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they don't charge a monthly fee for the storage, video storage.  So that's a big problem.  I think with a lot of these devices is that they all add up.  It's the storage fees.  You get pretty soon you're spending hundreds of bucks.  Here's the Netatmo smart home bot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like Lighthouse, but without the video.  It's talk to it like a human being and then it does it.  Could you switch the lights on?  Oh, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm just going through.  Oh, the spire.  I had a spire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did too.  And I was kind of like on this, but it's actually the new one is an activity tracker.  So activity, respiration, heart rate.  Oh, I feel like something else.  And the coolest thing about this is you buy them in a pack of like eight or 10.  This is a good stick them in your underwear and they're washable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good idea.  Cause that's the problem with all of these things.  They're easy to lose.  If you wash them, that breaks them.  The one on the right is the original spire.  So they've replaced it basically with a, with a, I think this is an additional,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because the original spire didn't have all those features.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you say, did you say stick it in your underwear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, she did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is where you're supposed to stick it.  Did that excite you, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  I'm not going to do that.  I'm not going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait till you get to my age.  No, when you get to your age, the underwear sticks you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the Kevin, which is named after your cohost.  Indeed.  What does the Kevin do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  This is a Kevin picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you leave home, it automatically makes sound and eliminates randomly.  Oh, it makes, it makes, it makes people think you're home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  I have an app that does that on my Wink.  Yeah.  Who's home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin.  Or on my Phillips Hue.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We left Kevin to take care of the house.  That's why they call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it simulates arguments.  I thought I told you to take out the trash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It plays the one from last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As you point out, as we've talked about, Google is everywhere.  Google Assistant is, what is this?  A gumball machine that you say, Hey Google, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is in the sands.  It's a gumball machine.  You tell it like, Hey Google, do this and it does it.  And it's just, it's eye candy.  And then over at the Las Vegas Convention Center, they have a slide in a big, not a booth, whatever those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they had to close it because the rain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They had to close it.  Yes.  So it's a water slide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there are the people in the Google outfits that we were mocking with the little, where's Waldo hats and the white jumpsuit.  They're everywhere.  Good Lord.  Oh, it's kind of, I guess you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's, I mean, what would be creepy is if they had like random facts memorized.  And when you said, Hey Google, tell me this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If they were human Google assistants, that'd be funny.  That would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, Google totally could have done that.  They could have been an assistant using their voice kit thing.  And then when you talk to it.  Oh, you put it in their ear.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could you actually get gumballs though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if you could.  I did not stop to try to get a giant bowling ball sized gumball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's that Lenovo Google assistant speaker we were talking about.  This is cool.  This view is good because it shows you how it stands up.  It's kind of curved back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's bamboo and it's so pretty.  That's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, people hated how the Echo show looked.  And there's a million of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the other thing on this is it has a camera cover.  I think that's really important.  Oh, yeah.  I found it interesting coming from Google, which is nice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I generally make fun of camera covers, you know, because they're really.  But in that case, I absolutely agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, that Echo spot that I showed before I left the alarm clock with the camera on it.  When I got home, it was face down in the bedroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so I moved it out of the bedroom because it probably shouldn't have a camera in the bedroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's in my closet, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's not much to see in there.  It's usually dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's another Google Assistant speaker from JBL.  Eight inch link view.  Nice screen.  High res audio and video.  Video calling as well.  Does it use the does it use Duo when they do these use these?  It does.  OK.  So you call any phone that now Duo makes a little bit more sense.  Because it's the phone.  Well, who is going to use it?  Right.  But now it makes sense because you if if people have a Duo speaker, you could they could call you on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't there a report that Facebook was going to make a video screen calling device?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's those.  Here's that. Oh, this is a Delta faucet.  Do you have capacitive touch on your faucet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is I do.  And this one has Wi-Fi and talks to the Echo and dispenses and does all the magic stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm trying. I tried to convince the guys at the booth to retrofit my faucet with the Wi-Fi module.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And finally, a very cute picture of the two of you.  The TOEFL and the Higgins bottom.  The IOT podcast team in action.  The Higgins TOEFL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bye, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bye, Stacey.  Bye.  Live from CES, Stacey Higginbotham.  Stacey Higginbotham.  Stacey from iot.com and of the IoT Podcast.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  Quicken Loans.  I was reading the story of Quicken Loans the other day because I was curious, well, is  there a relationship to Intuit?  And there was for three years, very briefly.  Dan Gilbert created Quicken Loans as Rock, I think it was called Rock Mortgage.  Rocket Mortgage kind of makes sense and sold it in 99 to Quicken, but he didn't like what  Quicken was doing with it or whatever.  So three years later, he bought it back.  He bought it back.  But it kept the name Quicken Loans.  But Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans now kind of makes more sense to me because it  was Rock Investments or something like that.  In the intervening years, they've become the number one mortgage lender in the country,  number two in pure size, $92 billion in loans last year.  But number one in your hearts for eight years running, 2010 through 2017, number one in  customer satisfaction, according to JD Power.  And that's in mortgage origination.  And then from 2014 to 2017 in mortgage servicing.  And you know, they just got it again for 2017.  I'm sure they'll get it in 2018 and on and on and on because they really are customer  centric.  They want to create a mortgage approval process that's simple, transparent, modern.  And they've done it with Rocket Mortgage.  It's a client focused technological revolution.  No more going to the bank.  No more going through your banker's boxes or your basement or attic to look for paperwork.  You can do it all on your phone, your computer, your tablet.  And you could do it like in real time because all they need is you answer a few questions  to identify yourself.  And then they go out, they get because they have trusted partners with all the financial  institutions.  So it makes it easy for you to share your information with them at the touch of a button.  You don't have to go through those boxes and look for stuff.  They get what they need.  They run the numbers and based on your income, your assets and your credit, literally in  a minute, they come back and say these are the home loan options for which you qualify.  Down payment is yours to choose.  Same with the term and the rate.  You pick the loan that's right for you.  And bada boom, you got it.  In minutes you could do it at an open house.  It's that fast.  Rocket mortgage.  That's the other reason they call it rocket because it's fast and it lifts the burden  of getting a home loan.  Rocket mortgage from Quicken Loans.

Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  Did you, it's really not Google stuff but I thought it was really kind of interesting.  You read the story of Sarah Silverman's response to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the one thing I wanted to talk about.  I think it's great.  Why don't you tell the story first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Silverman sent out a tweet and a guy, you know, unknown to her as often happens on Twitter  responded with a C word which is nasty, one word.  But her response was very interesting.  She said I believe in you.  I read your timeline and I see what you're doing and your rage is thinly veiled pain  but you know what?  I know this feeling.  P.S. my back sucks too.  I'm cutting some of the bad words out.  Apparently when she read his timeline she realized he had a bad back.  P.S. my back sucks too.  See what happens when you choose love.  I see it in you.  The troll responded I can't choose love.  A man that resembles Kevin Spacey took that away when I was eight.  I can't find peace.  If I could find that guy who ripped my body, who stripped my innocence, I'd kill him.  He messed me up and I'm poor so it's hard to get help.  So she had read in his profile that he was an addict.  She said do you use heroin?  Do you want to get clean?  He said no, no.  I smoke weed and I take prescription drugs.  She says good.  Well I want to kill him too so I can't imagine your rage.  All I know is this rage and even if you could kill him it's punishing you and you don't  deserve punishment.  You deserve support.  Go to one of these support groups.  You might meet your best bros there.  I should say Sarah Silverman is a very well known comic.  Great, talented comic and a very interesting response to being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really amazing.  She ended up getting him help back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He said I'll go and she said keep me posted.  She then said hey San Antonio because that's where he's from.  Are there any kick ass back or neck care specialists willing to help my friend Jeremy?  He's several slipped discs, no insurance, can't work because of severe pain.  Let's get him back on his feet.  That's a response.  A spinal clinic in San Antonio reached out, offered help.  Air Rosti, A-I-R-R-O-S-T-I.  Just to let you know we've been in contact with Jeremy.  We're on it.  They said this was on New Year's Eve.  Just amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That really shows something that you hope for more of.  It's a moment of empathy.  It's hard.  I mentioned this to a woman I work with and she said oh great so all women have to be  moms to trolls.  I said fair point absolutely.  But as a model of how to rethink the behavior we have socially on the net, Sarah Silverman  bless you.  That's a major step for civility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way don't expect her to do it again necessarily or others to do it.  No.  It's just an amazing moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish more people on Twitter particularly would try and take a minute to think about  the person behind the tweet.  I know it's hard sometimes but sometimes there is a human being that you can reach out to.  Not always obviously but sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thanks for including that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wasn't just a drive by either as Bill Murphy is pointing out in Inc.  She took the time to find out about the guy.  She got involved.  She did something about it.  It wasn't just like I feel your pain man.  It's good for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right from one heartwarming moment to the next.  You probably all saw that amazing video of the dog pulling the sled up the hill and then  riding down.

A joke cryptocurrency that isn't even an act of development but just because Bitcoin is  so hot now anything that's cryptocurrency.  Kodak just introduced.  Kodak.  I didn't even know Kodak was around.  I thought they were long gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My favorite was Long Island Ice Tea.  They renamed the company to Long Island Blockchain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Right.  Because they were getting sued or something.  Anyway yeah.  Long Island Blockchain.  It has nothing to do with blockchain but boy it was good for business.  So if you have any dogecoin you might want to.  Sell it now.  Well I hope you didn't forget your password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's just put it there.  I made the mistake of telling my wife that I had some Bitcoin many years ago and sold  it or lost it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How many passwords have you tried now on yours?  I have hundreds.  I have a worse story, Matthew.  I have 7.85 Bitcoin in a wallet that we created.  They were donated by twit listeners.  For a while it was taking donations in Bitcoin and I can't remember the password I used  to encrypt it.  But I have it.  I have it open on my desktop and every day I try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many times are you allowed to try in a day?  There's no limit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh it doesn't cut you off.  It's a local wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh it's a local wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eventually you'll get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well yeah I think so because I didn't generate a password in LastPass and use it.  So that means I used something I know that I made up.  Like that I used.  It's a variation and so I'm just trying all the variations.  It's not good.  Well good luck.  What is it worth now?  It's a hundred and some thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was down a little bit today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I had about a hundred I think.  You had a hundred Bitcoin?  Yeah because they were worth like 35 cents at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jesus Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it was a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What does your wife say to you now?  That's Jesus Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's like a million and a half dollars worth of Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could buy a lot of canoes on the lake for that.  Lifehacker says don't get into codex cryptocurrency.  Codex coin.  No of course not.  In fact according to Jacob Kleiman at Lifehacker why codex Bitcoin scheme is a scam you should  avoid.  Oh they're selling a Bitcoin miner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't Telegram doing a big ICO?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah that's when I thought it was kind of interesting.  They're going to use it as their payment system on Telegram and that strikes me as but again  I'm not sure.  They want to do a big ICO.  A lot of money.  It's an initial coin offering for those of you who haven't been sucked in by this crazy  bubble.  And by the way the guy who invented Dribbble.  Is it Dribbble?  Ripple.  Ripple yeah.  The Ripple founder is richer than Mark Zuckerberg at least in Ripple.  Or was briefly.  Maybe not anymore.  Chris Larson was number five on the richest people in the world list.  Number five.  The problem is his 3.  I'm sorry 5.19 billion Ripple coin.  Oh I'm sorry he has 5.9 billion worth roughly 60 billion dollars on paper more than Mark  Zuckerberg but the value has tumbled and he's now no longer one of the most rich men in  the world.  He's just a billionaire.  Besos by the way now clearly it's done.  He's not going back and forth with Gates.  He's over a hundred billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually wrote about a journalism startup called Civil.  Have you heard of them yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  Are they using ICOs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're going to do an ICO.  Basically a marketplace for journalism and sort of distributed newsrooms and they're  going to payment structures can be based on their own token.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Be careful folks.  It's so tempting because there seems to be so much money involved and I just worry that  people are going to it that it's just really they're all big pyramid schemes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think after the bubble it's going to be really interesting.  Things are going to get interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But when will after the bubble be?  Soon.  Okay.  Maybe I better keep entering passwords then.  Yeah.  This must be your story because the headline that you wrote another tech executive sees  damn burning Bush.  That was me.  I know.  I know.  I know.  X Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh this is Tony Fidel.  Yeah.  I'm just sick of it.  I'm going to be wealthy and then say oh it's like Oprah.  It's like Oprah saying oh no no I'm going to be virtuous after I ruin television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're woke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fidel.  Yeah he got woke after he made billions.  He developed he invented the design the iPod then started Nest.  Yeah.

And Fire and Fury which I was going to briefly I was thinking he missed the boat.  He could have called it the worst and the dimmest.  Playing off David Halberstam is the best and the brightest.  Which apparently Steve Bannon gave everybody in the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What the best and the brightest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's not clear but I think Steve might have missed the point of the book which is  you can have the best and the brightest and still get into the quagmire called Vietnam.  But maybe he did.  Maybe that's the point he was making.  I don't know.
