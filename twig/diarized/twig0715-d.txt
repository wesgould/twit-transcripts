Transcript:  Gotta be there twit discord there or be square  Also with us Stacey Higginbotham who was prepared to begin much later today  Thank you for your patience Stacey Stacey. Oh, no, just stock up on the waffles Stacey. Oh

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I don't want waffles right now. I just  Fet does

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Temperature are you?  Sad and pathetic and then I'm gonna sniff a lot. She's got a duck like this. I'm sorry colds are the worst  No, don't like no don't like them. They're not the blood cancer. Yeah, there's much worse here, right? What am I saying?  They're just you know, they're they're annoying just mildly irritating. Yeah  No, what have I done to this show everybody on this show thinks I hate you  I  Don't you're not none of you you're all wonderful

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  We are what gets me is everybody's is like, oh boy  It's gonna be a late show and then miss Stacey is gonna get tired and need our waffles  But everybody is totally looking over the fact that you've been there at the studio just as early as myself and mr. Jammer B  Oh, yeah, you were here earlier than me punchy. I do

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I am already punchy or  You're right. Did you notice that? Yeah, I'm punchy  Actually, you know Jeff and I watched the Google event Chris Google IOs this morning we watched the Google event  And at the time I'm thinking  Google's really lost their mojo. I mean I thought that the last few Google IOs, but it just seemed disjointed  They spent an hour and 20 minutes  Basically saying nothing about a that was their AI we know no they they said AI a lot

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Really appreciated how they were like, you know what people think we suck at AI  we're gonna just show them all the ways that it has been a part of our product and  We're gonna apply to say, you know what?  Some of it was good and I actually thought of Jeff when I saw duets for work. Was it duets? Yeah for workspace

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm excited by some of it. He thought of it too. I bet I don't even  Yeah, well, but this was I was gonna finish the thought which is at the time it really felt like a disjoint  It was kind of disjointed. It was  Disproportionately devoted to a lot of hand-waving like no. No, we got AI. We got it. No, we got it. We got it  We're not gonna give it to you yet, but we got it. We've had it for a long time  Ever now are 20 minutes of that then there was it felt like an hour, but it was really only eight or nine minutes on wallpaper

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That was painful

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because you know, they're trying to show all the new features of the next Android but it's like we're there's nothing new in any phone  Almost everything they showed was catching up with look you touch the pole the poop emoji and it moves. Oh god

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Terrible

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And then they finally in the last half hour showed new products  Actually some interesting new products. They showed the the new tablet. They finally released it  it's available today for pre-order ships next month and  It's the one that has the dock that I thought was pretty cool when they showed that  Included months ago and the Doc's included in the 499 price for 128 gigs of RAM. It's a real tablet  That ends up being disappointing. Oh, you're you disappointed the price when we get there

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  No, not the price. I'm disappointed with the tablet but we can talk about that. Oh, we'll get there. We'll get there

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll get there. They also showed the folding phone and that's you know,  1700 bucks but we're gonna throw in a watch because we couldn't sell those anyway and here half one of the pixel watches  And then and then we're over bye. Bye. It was so I felt like this didn't this wasn't great  But then coming here. Yes, there's a but  Because then I'm sitting in Windows Weekly and there's press release after press release after press release and there's a ton of good stuff  Really? Yeah, and I and actually this more underscores my feeling that they just did not know how to deliver a  Decent keynote. They don't you know need to get this thing in hand because in fact, there's some very go  I forgot to mention also the 7a they which you know, I mean nothing they announced we didn't know about  but  Yeah, I you know actually like it's better than I thought

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  it seemed like the  Keynote was more about trying to appease the shareholders and the board by just saying AI  50 times an hour  Just just so the shareholders know well Google's working on AI. So my money is probably gonna be okay  That's that's what it sounded like to me. Nothing that  That us quote normal folks would really care about well

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Conference Stacey if you were developer, would you be disappointed that you spent an hour 20 minutes? Oh

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, if I was the developer I mean because it really didn't feel like it  It's not I mean Google Cloud is a developer conference. I always just they're like role  I mean they want it to be like the keynote for WWDC

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Yeah, right, right

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Microsoft's build is coming up Apple's WWC is coming up. Those are developer conferences  Google feels like  Million times that was that was Apple. Yeah. Yeah, that was a couple of three years ago. This is their equivalent with AI  Alright well, let's okay. So Stacey some of the things you saw were  Pretty cool. I'm the keynote start with the keynote

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So the keynote I thought was I guess  Probably cuz I was doing other things while I was watching it. I actually thought it was pretty

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I wish I had been I should have brought a cross. Yeah, like

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  It's good. No, I was I was writing up my podcast post and editing some stuff  I mean, I was just working, you know, just had it on kind of some dar talking about whatever but like, you know  I thought I thought it was important for them to emphasize that they've been doing AI for a while  And they did a good job. I thought of that. I know we don't care about that, but it's important  I liked the the fact that you could pull your photos. I thought of you and like being able to generate  auto-generate  Basically tools. Yeah, I think that was like really nice. It was really good

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find it. They showed a picture of a kid with some balloons  Except as shot the balloons are off, you know, partly off-camera and the kids not centered which by the way

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Happens all the time is what you want most of the time. But you also

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  nobody wants I  Mean artistically you don't want to put people in the middle of the picture  Anyway, he wasn't in the middle and the cool part  So they stretch they stretch they move the kid over and the bench and the balloons are

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Auto-generated stretched out that it fills it in that was pretty cool. Yeah, they cut and and I thought it was really cool  They were like you can change the sky  And the lighting effect will change and I'm I want to see this in real life  I want to get ants opinion on it once we've got it in our hands  But like that's the kind of practical stuff people love  I don't know how they're gonna charge for it. And I actually thought it was super  compelling how they were pulling all of these integrations  I

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Have to point out that  This is not this is plenty of apps on Android that'll do this

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Yes, right. Am I wrong?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  That was native though, but now it's native and presumably it'll be better  You don't have to sit through ads or pay for it  But the other thing is the fume of fusion will put in any sky you want

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I prefer not to do that because it becomes pretty obvious that you faked the sky, but okay, I guess in a snapshot. That's okay

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  That's what Google's saying. It'll make it less obvious that you're fake in the sky  And also my grandma is not gonna be like, right?  But the integrations with other Google stuff was really compelling and I actually I've been playing with Bard  Maybe I've just not  Like being able to export stuff into Google Sheets was  The sidekick stuff was amazing  I really want to play with that. I can't wait. I'm like and I loved how they emphasized I  understand why they did this but it as a  Like a Kickstarter they called it. What do they call it? A jumpstart?  They use the word jumpstart so many times the idea being that it jump starts or kick starts your creativity

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, they showed us how which I think is important what I interpret that as is please don't use this for your content. I

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Know I know why they did it  But I also think it's important that you see people like showing you how to to make this additive, right?  Like especially for people who aren't gonna like if you're a school teacher, dude  You're not gonna be playing with this in your spare time necessarily. You're tired  right, but if you can  If something like this comes along it is like here let me help you show your students how to use this in a more responsible

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Way, that's really important. Here's Sundar Pichai demonstrating this new  technique

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You always want your kid at the center of it all and it looks like the balloons got cut off in this one  So you can go ahead and reposition the birthday boy  magic editor  Automatically recreates parts of the bench and balloons fake news. Isn't that wild now I

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Know and you're you're gonna pixel peep this and you're gonna say well actually right now

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Dude, the color is off just a touch. Yeah, that can be fixed over time and the bench

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of smeared and but you know grandma ain't gonna notice grandma's gonna go. Wow, it's cute

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I  Think they did a fine job with that for something to do it right there on the phone for  Anybody to be able to do it and I should not just people that are used to opening up  Content aware field inside of Photoshop and I have to say

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  credit to them for  Doing sewing something that people really would want and use as opposed to you know  Just some you know  Look how I can take your table setting and put it in a spreadsheet or whatever it was they were doing or or talking about

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  classes and inheritance and

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a developer  Developers like that kind of thing  You know, I think we know that you and I just got a person out of the bed  It appears no cuz look at this present a presenter who couldn't but managed to stand up  so they  For her arms because she was so tired that she had a lean

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  On the power when you brought that up

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Maybe she has other issues maybe okay fine. You're right. I mean it was the one with issues here

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have floppy hands, maybe she has

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  She could be like  Like having you know long co vid who knows? Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've been a TV long enough to know that a director  She did it without the box and the director is going crazy because the phones moving around and the camera can't hold and they  Could get her an apple box and put her elbows on it. And so they have a solid she's probably nervous  Then she was in fact several presenters and this was the other thing and I have to give them some  slack for  Remember, this is the first one where they're really coming back from co fit after three years of like we're gonna present this at a  Coffee table in our living room and everybody and everybody's gonna be in their bare feet  Which they literally did with one of their pixel announcements  So at least two of them said oh, it's tough being in front of this such a big crowd  Like they haven't been out in public in a while  So, okay, I'll cut him some slack in Google

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I mean, I know if you're gonna be an executive you do have to have presentation skills  But like Google sometimes pulls up some really deep deep cuts on the executive team and you know, they're also  Pretty anyway, I like for me people slack. Yes. He's all positive

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She's a nice person and she's you know  I in a way I want to agree with you because he after I saw the press releases Google had a lot to talk about  I think the only complaint I have is that the present that the keynote as a whole  Wasn't very well thought for instance one of the demos. They've not polished. It wasn't very polished

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What you're saying to Leo is it didn't have a strategic thread that went through it mostly. It's that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Forgive polish. There's a lot of unpolished keynotes. That's normal  You know Apple's raised the bar, but most companies are you know, but I wanted to see  This and this is where I think a failure of leadership  There should be a vision and a through thread through the whole thing  This is who we are and and what you said you stand for responsible AI

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly, we will do it right you can trust us something like that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That was the message they were trying to get but I don't think they came up with it didn't come through. Oh

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I thought I thought they did some I

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Thought the ideas that they had were pretty strong  They uttered like if I had been there and you know, you could interrupt a keynote to ask a question  I would have been like, I'm sorry  How are you gonna ask other people to showcase their metadata or make sure they put their fake watermarking in there?  They talked about detecting fake watermarking I would have loved to see that demo  They have a lot of things where I feel like I really felt like Google's like, oh crap  Say I stuff. I know we're not doing evil anymore  Or we're not we're okay with evil, but we probably want to do this  like I really thought that that came through in a way, but also it underscored how  How little they can do without any sort of big overarching federal legislation or like

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Also, how are they have in this industry? I've heard this tune before from Google year after year  They show stuff and they sing their praises and never release it or release it many years later  Watered down. I mean  I'm not they didn't convince me now  There was one thing and I will say this was really the strong suit  They did bring out somebody they've appointed as the senior vice president  Who reports directly to Sundar Pichai?  essentially for AI  Responsibility and ethics. Yeah, that was a good segment James man. Yika and he is  Real heavy. He's been he's worked in the Obama administration worked for the UN  He's a was a partner McKinsey. I mean he is a real heavyweight and presumably  Has the ear of Pichai and is brought in really to think about the impacts on society of AI  So his presentation was pretty good. I thought that was kind of what can we stay on that for one second?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sure, I think it's I think it is really important  I think that could have been the thread that went through. Yes, and what he presented was stuff that disinformation people  I asked for myself. I've been at Google news guys and every year we say a session that I started  what should Google do because he got it as a plug for my book and  Every year I say give us the provenance of images  Let us know the first time you saw this image so we can know whether it's really new really old where it came from

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And so on let me show you that and let me show you the clip because this is exactly what he was talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you have his audio you'll be able to see important information such as

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When and where similar image let me jump back so we get the audio

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now I've lost it shoot I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apologize here we go one area that is top of mind for us is  misinformation  Generative AI makes it easier than ever to create new content  But it also raises additional questions about his trustworthiness  That's why we're developing and providing people with tools to evaluate online information  for example  Have you come across a photo on a website or one shared by a friend with very little context?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Like this one of the moon landing so this is of the staged moon landing  They've got the lunar lander and they've got an astronaut  But then they have you know in a fake lunar landscape and a bunch of directors and producers and camera people

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who are faking it right and found yourself wondering is this reliable I?  Have and I'm sure many of you have as well  In the coming months, we're adding two new ways for people to evaluate images  first without about this image tool in Google search you'll be able to see important information such as  When and where similar images may have first appeared?  Where else the image has been seen online?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Including news fact-checking and social sites and what you learn of course is that that image is a mid-journey AI  Generated image  And and there's enough you know background material to show that now. Here's the drawback  You had to do a Google image search to find that out right well, but but but there's a few things one is it also shows

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You when you ask about an image using lens they're gonna use it can tell you this thing was generated by and so on so forth  So so they're gonna add it to lens. Yeah  It's it's firstly it's it's for I  Think one level it's not for everybody  It's for researchers and journalists to be able to say to fact-check and say this is where this came from we know we have  A new tool yeah, but it can be for everybody too  And I argue that we're all gonna have more responsibility for figuring out what's true and what's false out there  And this is another tool to do that the other part of this too is that they also talked about he also talked about  Water marking  Images and I presume at some point text too so we can have more sense of the provenance of where this stuff comes from  Is everybody screaming about oh my god. There's gonna be all this information  Manufactured by the machine yes there will be but this was a moment of great responsibility that Google was finally responding to  what information we this information researchers have wanted and  The underlying message is we're gonna try to do AI right we're gonna try to do it responsibly  What do we succeed, but this is how we're trying to do it  I think that was just by far the best part of it. Sorry Stacey

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  No, that's right, and they actually even when they like talked about bar doing code  They actually if you do code if you have it generate code for you  It's like it actually annotates the code and says hey this was generated by  by barred, but whatever and again you can strip that out, but those are the kind of things that  We need to be looking for and yes, it'd be great if the whole industry does it  But it's also kind of cool like you know how we people associate Apple with privacy  Google might have a chance to come in here and we search Google to make sure our information is accurate and that's they could be like snoops

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Again, wouldn't that be wonderful wouldn't that be amazing?  You know the other thing too is that is that they're finally talking about about AI and search and I've been arguing that Microsoft is doing this  Terribly irresponsibly and Google by trying to chase Microsoft as being irresponsible  Word assembly machines are not good at facts  But the way that Google showed AI and search and I want to play with it a lot more and learn a lot more about it  But it was rather than saying it did say here's a paragraph  But then it showed here's where we got the information each of those paragraphs and it was more  Interative and saying okay you search for this now you probably want this then you're gonna want a list of that and that's a clever  Use of AI then simply let me regurgitate words back to you  If you're again, they didn't present it very well

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're interested, yeah, it was very disjointed and you know, we have to work to boil it down to find those nuggets in the dross  There's a lot of dross this by the way, if you want to try all of these things  There many of them are gonna be in the labs g.co  Slash labs and address Sundar got wrong by the way g.co slash labs and then you can you'll have to have the appropriate app on your phone  And all of that but some of this stuff you can use right away including it was pretty funny this project tailwind which they even admitted  Yeah, we got a bunch of guys together and they put this they cobbled this together in five days  It's like you weren't do you knew that the I okina was kind of a weird thing to do  It's like you weren't do you knew that the I okina was coming right but five days ago they got some guys leadership five days or five people  I couldn't there was five days he said days he said five days

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  That's Google that's part of that like I don't know. Let's get some engineers. Let's see what happens. Yeah, no, it's Google

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  That's exactly what I'm saying. Why is that acceptable? That's my problem  Because they're trying their Google is an engineering they don't team right Google's known like Apple is the polished

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  They Apple would Apple would never oh god. Yeah, they haven't announced anything yet

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They Apple would never oh god. Yeah, they haven't announced anything yet

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, that's really true. Really true. We're your goofy engineering buddies. We're just gonna see what happens

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and that's how they sold it forever. Like look how amazing these tools are. We were able to get this together in five days  And actually this was one of the things that Jeff and I both thought oh that's actually pretty cool  Project tailwind will take one of the things they said is look the AI is better if it's in a you know, a kind of a limited  knowledge area  So is an example project tailwind takes your Google Docs  like Jeff's notes for all of his books and then assembles them into a notebook where you can ask questions of  Your own research and that kind of does make sense I guess  It's kind of it's taking off on a very popular idea called Zettelkasten  In fact, you'll notice if you look at the project tailwind animated GIF you can do on your research a reading quiz  Which means they expect students to use this right to to take notes and then and then test their knowledge on the notes for the final  And new ideas now, this is the one I have some questions about one of the reasons you'll do Zettelkasten or some sort of note-taking  Methodology is because when you have all these disparate notes and you start making connections you get new ideas  But if you let the machine do it for you a it ain't gonna be a very interesting new idea and B  You're not doing it. So I don't know how valuable that's gonna be  But Jeff you think you thought this would be kind of cool for your notes say on the on the Gutenberg book

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think well, I've already written that book part of the internet book  I desperately need I got I got files and files and files and files

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a challenge you do all these interviews and all this research. How do you tie it all into a

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I think that there's a lot there to play with that's really interesting and  What I also liked about it is that it's concentrating on limited sets of data  that rather than and this is what to met guru Gebru and  Margaret Mitchell and company in the stochastic parents paper said  Margaret Mitchell's been very big on the and Emily the vendor has been very big on this saying stop boys with trying to get  Size matters when it comes to your learning set  It's it's it's unproductive. It's harder to monitor. It doesn't really work  What you've got to go for is limited sets of data  That the system can learn on and be reliable and learning on it and you know where it came from then you can monitor it  And audit it and you can verify things and that's a much better way to go  so when you get down to the tiniest of the tiny and  It's going on just the data in your phone or just the data in your Google Docs or just the data in your company  that becomes a much more interesting use of the capabilities of  LLMs  To me and this we have all the knowledge of the world and it's gonna destroy humanity BS

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah as a journalist  Like I love like project tailwind to me is like  It is basically a better Google brain  I always joke that I would search my articles and like my brain is either in my inbox or my brain is in my  It's in my I call it the morgue, but it's not really more because it's an online thing  it's not a place where my old clips are but  Having being able to put all of my notes  I would feel weird about just because some of its under embargo or secret like that that gets a little dicey  I  Like it stayed on your machine if you knew it stayed on my machine, but it's connected to the internet. So you're still nervous  I mean, I don't really get national security stories, but you know, that's a legitimate concern

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's one of the things they kind of tried to address  Early on is privacy, but again, I think they could have made a more coherent  Statement of their commitment to keeping your data private on device  Making it safe for somebody like you to use

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  But yeah, just to be able to say like oh  How did I define peering? How did I do this or can to have some sum up? Here's my question

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can you trust it?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  If it's only on my data, yeah, because I've written that and fact-checked it already and you could fact it you could check your own

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Data again, you can look it up

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So I love that idea. It would be yeah, cuz I get it half of my job  When I'm writing something new especially about the news  It's just summarizing the stuff like these six years of everything that has happened before  so

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's kind of neat, you know again  As always with Google I oh I look at this stuff some of this stuff you could do right now  Some of this stuff you can do later some of the stuff you may never be able to do and it's not always clear  What's what so it's it? So I always think of everything we see as a demo and  And maybe it's a good idea, but you won't really know till you try it  Maybe maybe you'll get some insights. Maybe you won't though  I mean, maybe I mean the problem with AI it's just confidently wrong  It's so confident  Just I don't know if it's gonna be that useful

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well trained on your data then I mean it kind of depends on what you're asking

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a better it's a better it's not a large language model, it's a Stacy language model

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, and I trust Stacy language, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's Sundar talking about some of the features in Gmail this they say is real  Seven years into our journey as an AI first company we are an exciting by the way see we've been doing this for seven years  We've been

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We were here before that an opportunity to make AI

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even more helpful. That's true. There are people for businesses for communities for everyone  We've been applying AI to make our products radically more helpful for a while because I thought that was generated AI  Kind of taking the next step  With the bold all our core products including search you will hear more later in the keynote  Let me start with few examples of how generative AI is helping to evolve our products  starting with Gmail in

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  2017 we launched smart reply. Do you use smart replies Stacy? I  Do yeah, I've used I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they're appropriate, yeah, I use them

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sounded like me. They're more useful in texting to me than they are in mail  But I use them on Apple messages  Yes on the phone and on my watch sometimes I'll get a message and it suggests because I'm not gonna do a lot of typing  I watch but it'll suggest right and I'll use that  Sometimes it makes me sound a little robotic

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's this is as polite or as nor as firm as mr. Proulx. So this is a step exactly. This is a step farther

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Watch this watch this short responses. You could select with just one click  next came smart compose  Which offered writing seditions as you type  Smart compose led to more advanced right? So this all exists now by AI  I always hate when it's proposing a cliche that I was going to run 180 billion times in the past year alone  And now with a much more powerful generated model. We are taking the next step in Gmail with help me, right?  Let's say you got this email interesting that your flight was canceled  The airliner sent a voucher, but what you really want is a full refund  You can reply and use help me, right?  just type in the prompt of what you want and  As for a full refund for this cancel create and a full draft appears  Okay, but this is the first as you can see it conveniently pulled in flight details from the previous email  And it looks pretty close to what you want to send

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Understand you're offering a voucher as a gesture of goodwill, but I'd be prefer to be reimbursed for the cost of my ticket

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I appreciate your understanding. Maybe you wanted to find it further in this case a more elaborate email  Might increase the chances of getting the refund

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  However, I am very disappointed with the way my recent flight was handled this caused me a great deal of inconvenience  I believe a full refund is the only fair way it's this is good at writing an angry letter, right?  Until until the airline gets a hundred of these. Yeah  Well, but they won't all be the same. That's one thing at least  Generative AI is good at is not repeating itself so much, right?  Maybe maybe maybe if you sent out a thousand that only cover story you cancel that many flights you might

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  You would end up with that with people anyway. Yeah, it's pretty believable. Go ahead Jeff

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I filed a freedom of information request some years ago with the Federal Communications Commission because they they  Imposed what was then the largest fine in their history to Fox  entertainment for illegal use of whipped cream I'll spare you the details and  There were thousands what's an illegal use of whipped cream?  I was somehow sexual whipped cream in primetime and it was gonna corrupt America. Okay, so supposedly there were thousands of responses  Why the FCC had to act and had to do the most the biggest fine ever in history until Howard Stern later and  I got all of the other responses all of them and it turned out that all but two were from the same  Where's the parents are counsel? Yeah, right. Yeah, so that meant that only three Americans had taken the time to actually write a letter  Complaining but it didn't matter because there were thousands of the FCC used it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  The FCC now puts those when you make the comment there online and you can see you can actually see yeah, it's because of me  Okay, cuz yeah neutrality you're like, yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And by the way, we now have a show title and the illegal use of whipped cream. So thank you for that

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Always love it when what I what comes out of my mouth my accident ends up with a show title  I don't know. It just makes me very happy  Feels like a little bit of posterity

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right, let's go on with Sundar Pichai  So he's written a really nasty note

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The next example is maps  since the early days of Street View

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  We've actually seen but you know what was really cool  Okay, I don't care about that. You can stop that. Yeah, you said what was really cool  When they were talking about like listing colleges and then this was part of the kind of export to other Google things  So they're like show me on a map because when I'm like, oh shoot  I need the following like as long as those colleges are real  Okay, Leo, I get that you think  No question the reality of the college, okay  This again is the jumpstart. That's why they emphasized the jumpstart  That's all this is and you know what you have to do this and it's a much easier way to if I could spend  10% of my time on the early phase of any research project as opposed to spending a quarter of my time and then validating  Why wouldn't I do that? Okay

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Validation is always a step. I'm not an expert in this. So it's  Maybe you have to release it to the public and let them bang on it  But maybe you could also write something that instead of having absolutely no care for the for the  factuality of what it's writing  also had a step of saying let's make sure this is real and we're not making up stuff and  Neither Microsoft nor Google with Bard seems to have yet figured out a way to say this should be  Factual and I think that that's gonna be problematic  About

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So he taught Sundar Pichai talked about training the models initially on  Mathematical and physics data to give it a basis in like logic and facts  You can't when you when you train something from the internet  You're gonna get wacky things just like I was taught by a crazy 7th grade teacher  And I have in my head a whole year's worth  Of  Weird stuff from this it's all 7th grade good point  I mean  You're you're gonna encounter wrong information in your search

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well fine  Then that's my question again, I'm not an expert in this but is that necessary or yes, nothing is authoritative

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  No  Well from alpha does not make mistakes  Well from alpha is a math engine

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Okay, but math is like which is Sundar said they're starting with math. They're there emphasize  They're there he emphasized. I gotta point out either chat GBT or Bard does math correctly

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So they're not even doing this, you know base of this. Yeah. Yeah, but there so maybe they should have  Well, I know the core function has nothing to do with accuracy however  Maybe it should  Especially if you're gonna give people information about what colleges are out there with these courses if you've paid no attention to them the actual  Veracity the material it seems like that's a bad  Idea is if that's the case. That's that's why they're like you're like saying we got a bill art. We got a build  you know, we got to build cars that  Emit poisonous gas first to see if it kills people and then we can put out cars that aren't well  No, no one's doing that

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So what they're like as a journalist, you're sort of a journalist. So we'll use this I  Have it. I have a story. I'm gonna come up with something  I'm gonna start with the simple Google search before I talk to any experts  I'm just gonna try to wrap my head around what I'm trying to figure out. So let's say it's 6g. I'm to be like, okay  6g, what is it? What does it look like? Okay, and I'm gonna go through my searches and some of them are gonna look authoritative  And some of them aren't and then I'm gonna call people who know and then I'm gonna report something that's factual to me  What they're doing with like the college search or any of this jumpstart stuff is simply the same thing  I would do anyway on Google. It's just a little bit better and it's gonna be better organized for my  consumption right Timnick  point was

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because it's coming out of the mouth of this computer  People give it more import and trust it and say it's accurate and that's very

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Across I know we have to do that across all not just in information  We have to do that in terms of like our politics when we talk about things being data driven. That's stupid  We still have it like data could it's the same thing  We're always learning as people which is data can lie experts can lie we have to validate for ourselves and

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo to your point about the car  Yeah, you're gonna start driving cars before you realize the impact of parking lots and pollution and all that and in essence  We've sped up and so the other two announcements today that were that were critical here  is that  I think that's  Chat GPT open AI says they're building a system to understand how their system operates, right?  because it kind of got away from them and  Anthropic is building the Constitution for their AI and they're doing that and and I think that that's  important  That they are trying to reverse engineer back in sense and ethics and things. Is it too late?  Should they stop for six months? No, that's ridiculous. But is there a chance to learn as you go? Yeah, I think so I  Just saw a fascinating paper that came across from a Kurt Gray a UNC professor just just on Twitter  That that looked at the moral judgments. They got out of chat GPT  3.5 and they put all kinds of questions to them versus there's data on what people judged in these things and it was 95%  The same which is to say the chat GPT spits back what we think and  So obviously we got to blame ourselves a lot. I

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mean, you know, I guess I like Wikipedia a lot and there's plenty of  Contrafactual stuff in Wikipedia  It just seems much  Enough that if you  Enough that if you if you  Quoted it without checking you you might quote me risky. Yeah, that's risky  Yeah, but you should never quote but you shouldn't I mean, yeah any one thing that but there is a difference  I think when you're doing search results versus  You know, right, I mean don't we trust search results?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  No, God with the spamming and the manipulation of search results, please know when there's also the larger concern that these

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Engines these tools make it possible to create massive amounts of misinformation very rapidly. So  We've kind of weaponized misinformation  In the same way that we weaponized social media and now we're gonna have 10 X 100 X the amount of misinformation  You know, it's it's manageable when it's Wikipedia and you can check  How manageable is it if if all of a sudden this stuff is spewing forth everywhere?  I think this was a reasonable concern that

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Tim it is a reasonable concern but to push back and make that your if that is your primary concern  We need to say okay. Well, how do we deal with this?  Just throwing out the baby with the battle. Oh, no, I'm saying that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What I'm saying is no no what I'm so there are people saying  Oh, you're gonna stop this because it's gonna be Skynet take over the world and that's completely missing the point  The real danger of this is not that the real danger of this is it's just gonna flood the zone with crap and  I think it's not inappropriate for companies like Microsoft and Google and open AI and throw up pick and the rest to  To kind of think about that consider that and maybe instead of just pushing out something that is so bad at  At creating factual material they should maybe have  Gone the extra step to make it more reliable. I don't how hard is that to do?  Maybe it's this is where I don't know. Maybe it's not possible. Maybe you can't well in which case

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  that's where you look at the open a open a I mean the opening a story and  You got Sam saying how incredibly difficult it is. Well, they're looking at literally as neurons  When the word dollar is  Recommended it looks at what other things flash up and what's action? It doesn't know context. It doesn't know what it does  It is so they don't even know how that operates there  They're learning things about how their own machine operates want to slow down a little bit then I  Mean it won't stop for six months. You want to agree with me?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't I don't like the six-month hold but I wish these companies had been a little bit more and I you know  I thought Google was gonna be a little bit more circumspect

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  And maybe we're saying that being circumspect there's I think they're being circumspect around things that make sense which is annotation  Being able to watermark what they can do  I think that they should be also making advocating for like a big federal push for this or no

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, I don't want the feds to come in  In fact, that's that's the argument for them doing it themselves because if they don't then then there's the risk the feds are gonna

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Come in and they're gonna miss handle it. There's definitely rules. Like I think there's rules for auditing  I think there's rules for making sure because they're always gonna be crappy people in companies and  Governmental organizations who don't have budget to throw people out of the loop on important AI-based decisions and that's gonna cause a lot of problems  Do you think having a AI?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Search will be better than having just plain old Google page rank based search

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So I am really intrigued by this as a person who's running a media company  Kevin and I were talking about SEO and what this means because it kind of changes the nature of the content that I would produce  For some search terms like we get a lot of search terms because we wrote very early on about shutting  With mesh routers, you've got five gigahertz Wi-Fi and 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi, but a lot of smart home devices only have 2.4  So if you've got a mesh system, sometimes it's like your device freaks out  So we wrote an article explaining that and then talking about how to avoid that in some routers  And that's like one of our most search for things  There would be a benefit for us to actually keep that more up-to-date because  we're gonna  Over time it's become you know  There are routers that are no longer relevant, right? It was like Euro fives  And so there's a benefit for us to if we want to have authority to keep our content  Continuously fresh on hot topics and to add more keywords over time  That you know, we're not doing today  I don't know if we're ever gonna do that, but it's something to think about and AI is better for that than Google's

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Page-rank. Yeah

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I mean if you're searching for if you search for that today in Google like why doesn't my you know  Whatever my 2.4 gigahertz iot device not connect. I don't know if my article come up there or not, but  You know you get a lot of like stupid you get my site might come up and I feel like it's authoritative  And it's not scammy with ads or you get like wiki how

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Are you gonna see a lot of wiki how out there that earth sort of well?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And look what seen it was doing generating in fact red ventures with all of their  Properties like bank rate is doing they're generating link bait  Because with a eyes today do it really quickly and cheaply

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  12% Reno study 12% of all ads online are going to AI manufactured made for advertising sites  So we're already there even before chat. He really takes off. There's a lot of stuff. That's just purely generated  Multiply that by 10. Well, and that's what you know what bothered me the most about today's presentation  Was the PowerPoint stuff the sheets stuff is?  that  You know powerpoint already ruined human thinking enough and turn it into simple stupid little thoughts right and now  The machine is gonna make the PowerPoint and all the illustrations on it and the talking notes on it  And so nothing's real right right of my name Matthew Kershian bound from the University of Maryland wrote a piece for the Atlantic a few  Weeks ago about the text apocalypse  What he's saying is there's gonna be so much text text becomes absolutely meaningless and

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  devalued and I think it's true. Let's watch real briefly. Let's watch. Yeah the Google Sheets

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Presentation most popular use cases is the trustee job description  Every business big or small wait Google sheets or slides a good job. This might make all the difference  This is how Doc's has been helping  Say you run a fashion boutique and need to hire a textile designer

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is to get started. Let me yeah, this is sheets not slides. Let me find the there is the slides  It's the cheesy fondue pizza

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Fondue pizza that was horrible. Yeah, I don't know. I was like, why am I not dipping my pizza in cheese? Thanks AI

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sheets I said on the show today there'll be there'll be tick tocks with recipes by tonight

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is the mystery of mermaid Cove, I don't want to do that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not that again, yeah, I'm sorry, I hope you held your thoughts Stacy cuz why don't you go ahead and I will try to find

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  This okay. So I'm gonna counter like as someone who writes speeches. I actually thought this was super helpful because when I'm  Preparing I hate preparing slides. I would rather just get up and talk to people but everyone wants some sort of slide  Yeah, I love the fact that my slides are super usually really text heaven. They act almost as my notes like oh, this is the bullet point  I want to make it then I keep going so  I love the fact that I could actually come up with better illustrations for things that are pretty esoteric  So that's cool for me and I never make speaker notes

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's kind of like it was auto generating speaker notes. That was kind of cool. Yeah

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was like, oh I will read I am very excited to be here

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, well, no, I don't so I don't read I  Mean my speaking style is very like hey everybody what's up?  And then I'm kind of but I am glancing at my slides to make sure that I'm staying on target right point  But I and I like slides. They help me think I am NOT a very like  It helps me organize my thinking in ways that make it accessible to people like not everybody's gonna sit down and read like  Montaigne right, but you might read a PowerPoint of his points and feel like god that's depressing  I think the core features that people are striving for like when they they talk about things like that. I  Think I don't want to read anything. Just give me the highlights so I can sound so don't be an elitist people  Want to feel like they've bought it for themselves and they can get there and they don't have to read that and spend that to

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Get there. Yeah, I mean spend no time thinking that's the last thing you want to do. They are thinking

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  They're just thinking in bullet points casual. Yes  They're thinking for conversation. I haven't read my 15th century  It's beautiful, but it's also a lot. There's a lot

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a lot of Montaigne. I haven't read

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  valuable. Yeah, here's the here's the here's how you're want to use your  Google Sheets in the future

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in a slide deck  Everyone does their bit

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Happy 50th anniversary have more pizzazz

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's pick one of the slides and use the poem on there as a prompt for image generation  Mom loves her pizza mom loves her pizza cheesy and true while dad's favorite treat is a warm pot of fondue  Let's hit create and see what it comes up with a better poem  I hope behind the scenes that quote is sent as an input to our text-to-image models and we know it's unlikely that the user  Will be happy with just one option  So we generate about six to eight images so that you have the ability to choose and refine

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  most of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now this styles a little too cartoony for me, so I'm gonna ask it to try again  Let's change the style to photography and give it a whirl

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's more than a whirl

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, I don't know what they're applauding it's lukewarm, but it is pictures of pizza

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Being dipped into fondue. Meanwhile the discord Stacey. I have pizza dipped in fondue  In the disk party tick-tock from tick-tock the discord. I put it to the discord. There's a cheese cheese

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You found you found it act because you said this is gonna be a tick-tock

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Did I put it the wrong one?  No, you put it in tweet news put it in Twitter news because I was over this afternoon  Okay, it's now in this week and here it is this we got it now

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We gotta watch this and then I'm gonna take a break

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Cuz I'm already nauseated. Here we go pizza. That doesn't work. You gotta go to the lake  Because of yeah  No, not okay. That's me. That's right  You can jump forward a little bit or a lot

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If it plays we'll take a break because I'm I'm really not that much try I try to  Try

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's pretty disgusting when you get when he actually does it tuck fail

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What a surprise. Let's take a break and we've got a lot more still to come  What Google is talking about? You know what? I have to say Stacey. You're right. I  This is all gonna be useful. I'm sure  I just I feel like  we're rushing headlong into this and I'm just I feel like we did this before with Twitter and

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Facebook and and a lot of stuff and we did and we are and we always will that's what we're doing

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what capitalism is one argue for I don't know some thought I guess you're right it's not gonna work

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  If we are thinking I mean, but you also  The best way to experience like to think fully about something is to experience it now  Should we apply it and I'm sure I wouldn't have any of these I would not have any of these

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Cavailles if I hadn't

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Try it  Yeah, and the other thing is it's iterative it's not like a physical piece of hardware that we're buying  It's not like it's now this should not be part of like infrastructure yet, but I don't think it's going to be  Yeah, like well, that's not true. I think some people will  Like those PE firms buying hospitals, they're probably like oh med palm. I need to hire that today. Yeah, Google what?  Oh, yeah, have we tested that who cares?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Excuse me can we can we talk about one of our sponsors and then get back to the conversation Stacy about them Stacy on  IOT comm and the IOT podcast with Kevin Toffle now with link bait  So me oh, it's too mean I'm sorry Jeff Jarvis  Professor at large buzz machine comm catches new book the Gutenberg parenthesis at a bookstore near you  bookstore near you  soon and  From high on zone photography our club twit community manager. Mr. Ant Pruitt with TV slash hop  Great to have all three of you. I will try to be less cranky. I'm gonna be less cranky

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm gonna be much more positive. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. You're as you're as you're as credible as chat GPT  What a kind word

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Less your heart our our episode today brought to you by Melissa the address  experts address verification that's hot right now, right because well you may have regulatory  Compliance issues that you have to you know, you're know your customer rules things like that. It's also important for business success  What can accurate addresses do to help your business? Well about 63% of shopping journeys  Begin online 63% 20% of shipping addresses  Contains spelling mistakes incorrect postal codes or house numbers  formatting errors  That means all those nice shopping journeys begun online may end up in tears  Having solutions like an address autocomplete service can ensure new and returning customers always get their packages on time and in the right place  And autocomplete service helps lower cart abandonment always a problem  I'm not shopping sites because it speeds up the buying process for the customer  You've experienced that on nice sites. You start entering your house number and it says oh you mean this yes  The average large-size East Commerce site can gain a 35% increase in conversion rates just by improving checkout design  And we know you know when your customer service reps are entering data or your customers are any data  They're gonna there's gonna be typos  There's gonna be mistakes having that auto fill just you know gets the correct address in first time every time  At the core of quick accurate delivery reliable clean data  It's important to your customers 41% of consumers say fast  Delivery is the most critical aspect of their online shopping experience. I tell you I I ordered a product I wanted a  Walking stick to get before our trip and it didn't get to me. I don't know where it ended up  It wasn't mine, and you know yeah, I got a refund for it  So the they merchant lost the sale, but also I was unhappy because I didn't get the thing I wanted before my trip  Not just fast, but accurate delivery and guess what 56% of shoppers say they will not purchase from the same store again  If they're unsatisfied with their shipping experience when I called for the refund they said  Well, you want us just to send you one and I said no I want my money back  Verified addresses help with marketing campaigns and shortened sales cycles retailers rely on default address verification built into their platforms  It's not always accurate. It's not always intuitive  Having inline validation corrects addresses as they are entered  I've talked about this before I  There are a couple of companies that I get multiple copies of the same catalog to the same name and address  That's just a waste of their money and a waste of my time  It's estimated about 20 to 40 percent of customer records in a single marketing campaign or duplicates  That's 20 to 40 percent of your spend  wasted  Carriers can charge 10 to 15 dollars per parcel for address correction  So it's actually got a real financial consequence  Having an address verification solution lowers unnecessary waste so illuminates those  Unnecessary costs and leaves you with happier customers  Melissa's address verification tools leverage their 38 years of address  Verification expertise it's flexible. It'll fit in any business model on-prem in the cloud as a SAS  Application they've even got a very nice API so you build it into your own software and Melissa's global service can verify addresses for  240 countries and  Counting I think that's all of them to ensure only valid billing and shipping addresses ever enter your system  Don't worry your data is safe to Melissa is sock to HIPAA and GDPR compliant and they undergo continuous  Third-party verification to make sure that's the case so you know your data is always in the best hands  Make sure your customer contact date is up to date get started today 1000 records clean for free  Melissa comm slash tweet that's Melissa  Comm slash tweet we thank them so much for their support this week in Google  There are so many different things to talk about that Google announced we are gonna get to the hardware in just a little bit  But is there anything more?  You all well, okay. I'm gonna show one that I thought was pretty cool the Google barred image recognition demo  Do you remember that where they took a picture of two dogs one looking kind of goofy?  One kind of serious and proposed captions in  Fact funny captions a bunch of them one of them was really good  When you're trying to figure out which one of you is the good boy  Pretty funny  I'm always impressed with an AI can have it has a good sense of humor right?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  That's what scared Jeff Hinton did you read the Wired article about why he left? Yes one of the reasons  Was it it came up with the area he didn't have to explain a joke I was like, oh, yeah

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but but you know if you listen to Seinfeld a  Humor is highly structured and  And Seinfeld talks about the structure of a joke and and he he dissects it in a way that AI could understand

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know that explains a lot his jokes sound like an AI generated him  They're very mechanistic  Have you ever wondered about airline peanuts, I mean it's very mechanistic it is not surprised works makes me laugh  Yeah, you're right. He had the most popular TV show for a decade. I guess it's like Ronnie DeGio

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I remember seeing him in San Francisco thinking totally like a laugh at this and I laughed my head off

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz totally for itself. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. Okay, maybe maybe understanding and making a joke isn't joke is not a big deal

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I thought sense of humor was hard, but maybe not what no writing what jokes are there about dogs?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Who's a good boy, right? It was a good dog. Yeah, right. Yeah, pretty easy. I do I did feel like Jeffrey Hinton's

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Fears were very much like Blake Lemoine's  Fears that they were a little mystical a little like oh

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's it's thinking it's coming alive

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  he's an example of somebody who's really worried about this Skynet problem and  Not thinking about I think the much more immediate and realistic problems that Margaret Mitchell and Timnit Gabru proposed in stochastic parrots  You know the really real issues like face recognition that puts more black men in jail for crimes

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They didn't come in. Well, that's the use it's always the use of the data and the use of the technology the technology itself  You know is not doing but by the way  Have you seen a scenario that explains how these people think that AI is going to destroy humanity?  I've never seen it actually taken through I just said it could destroy anyway watch out

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's really is there any so you take they don't want to say they don't want to say this  Silent part, which is I saw it in a movie once

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  There are what I think I think you know the amount of disinformation that could be  Cheaply that is real and that's that is that is what they're thinking. I mean those are things  How does that destroy all mankind? Oh, yeah, I you just select the wrong person

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we do that on our own without AI. I don't have to have a head. No, but that's what Timnit Gabru and that's what stochastic parrots was saying  More more kind of these more proximate effects. I feel like okay, maybe not Hinton. I  Feel like though that there's this thing is like it's gonna be smart and it's gonna wake up and it's gonna say I don't  Need all these people

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  That level that's that's ridiculous. Yeah, that's yeah, there's there's some of that but there's also like putting AI and weapons systems

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, well, that's true. You know, you're right. No, yeah, that is a that is a movie situation

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  But it's also a movie situation that I'm like would it be evil or would it just hallucinate something?  It doesn't matter if he's you know gonna bomb a capital or something, right?  Yeah, we talked about Juergen Schmidhuber

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Who can forget Schmidhuber?  Is  Whereas Hinton is seen as the godfather of AI  Schmidhuber is sometimes accredited as the father of AI and he's in the Guardian Edge put in the discord saying basically calm down  that's  You should be doing with a hat the Guardian Link I put in has been with it with a jaunty hat. Oh jaunty hat  Well, is it a fedora? It's a flat hat. It's a flat hat. Yes  Oh what it is, but it somehow looks and works with a half beard. It kind of all works together

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He looks you know, if anybody looked like a

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Juergen Schmidhuber, it'd be him. He doesn't know he looks more like an Irish fisherman

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hey, he looks like a Juergen O'Malley. I'm a Juergen O'Malley. I'll tell you what this AI it's gonna be dangerous

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He says is it's inevitable. It shouldn't be feared  Get on with it. Just just figure out how to use it

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, but he's also saying it's gonna surpass human intelligence. I think he's not worried about that. I mean listen a calculator

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  surpasses my intelligence. Okay in certain regards  Yeah

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  This thing we talked to it like the biological intelligence like we have intelligence about lots of things  But we also tend to ignore the intelligence inherent and other species like yes, you know  So I'm just saying if we take an even larger worldview  It might surpass our intelligence in some ways, but probably not in all ways. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What else do we see that we are interested in? Let me see what's in labs  New ways of working with AI supercharged learning and ideation with AI  Oh, how about using AI to turn your words into music describe?  This is this is this is talked about this before. Yeah, this is not this didn't even talk about it today

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want to get on the wait list for that one

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right, anyway  Anything else that you saw out of this stuff go ahead. I think a lot of this stuff in the keynote today is

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  We as a society have  We've seen a lot. So it's hard to really impress us because of what we've  Experienced over the years, you know back when true left the first  Personal computer came and how big that was and did not the personal computer got better and better over time  And it finally hit a point where you know  four gigahertz processors just  Four gigahertz processor, you know  And I think we're seeing that with pretty much everything on the tech side and this is a bit of a challenge to wow us today  granted now  AI could still  Come up with some wild stuff, but I don't know. I'm just not necessarily wild  So Google stock closed up 4% after the event

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Ah market must felt like that's who the message is. I'm wowed. I  Think the things that they're doing are hard at a technical level

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  In our like the underlying infrastructure is so she and I think they're going to actually be really helpful for a lot of people  And they just touched on some things like like I actually thought the college jumpstart was really interesting  They talked about things like the  I actually thought the college jumpstart was really interesting  They talked about things like Instacart being one of the apps there like they showed that Adobe Firefly app  Yeah, and if you imagine like imagine looking at a bunch of recipes like hey, you know, New York Times  What should I cook this week? They give you a list you refine it. You're like, oh, I hate chicken blah blah blah  You know whatever you need and then you send it generates a list to you and they're  And then sends that to Instacart  I mean you have just planned a meal and sent it off to be shopped for you in like maybe ten minutes  We spent like an hour on you know playing epic curious. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google said AI the word AI or the phrase AI over a hundred times

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  In the house somebody counted. Yeah, I said 50 times an hour. Yeah

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It probably just read the transcript in the chat GPT or  Fifteen minutes, huh? You get I didn't get to wet. I didn't understand to it. I zoned out. Oh

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Duet that was the workspace one where it was helping

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the spreadsheet one, okay fine  By the way, I was

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I was just thinking and I would love to hear from actual developers on this  I'm thinking about like what you need from an API now because if you're starting to incorporate like an  AI into it and it's gonna you want to copy those results into something else like when I saw duets  I was like man. I want to ask for like a garden plan, right?  I want a garden plan that works in Seattle that is  Relaxed not like and Xerox gave to write it for a full Sun yard  And I'm like that's a little too hard for it to generate now  But like no, maybe not if you could pull in those results via an API  Like what plants do well in zone eight and then have someone with gardening expertise or that aesthetic, right?  They could build an app that combines that AI and like tweaks it for you and then generates that for you  like I'm just thinking about how  How you need to build that underlying infrastructure because we're gonna have a lot more data in different formats shared  across applications  So I don't want it to be super proprietary so but just like chat GPT

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google Bart has an API chat GPT's is open  To subscribers you can get a key and you can incorporate into your app and there are very very many apps  Hundreds it seems a week that use chat GPT bards  To this time at this date is limited to you have to apply there's a waitlist  In almost it up. Yeah, I can't use it at all because guess why yeah, you can use the guard Google Bart API to  Create a variety of applications including chat bots that can hold conversations with users. We have a Leo AI in our  Discord that is using another company's chat bot, but the same idea  Generators that can create content for websites and social media. Oh great  Translators that could translate text from one language to another that's useful  And answer is it can answer a question about a variety of topics  I think both API's work roughly the same and you could talk to Kevin about this because I'm sure  You know, he's a big Python Python Easter  Almost always they're now restful API's which means you in effect  request with a get  Request, you know pass along the key and the prompt and then you'll get back a JSON file with the content with the results that  You can parse and then use it's not hard to do  It's a couple of lines of code  And I'm sure if you wanted Kevin could write you something  But you'd have to get on the wait list do it  Huh

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  But what he it's like but what and this is this is what's so fun, I guess yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, I'm any of the tools that I use have chat GPT built into them obsidian  One of the note-taking apps I use has a jet GPT built in one of the other ones the one I'm really using most often  Now log seek  Actually, it's quite controversial their developers say yeah  We're gonna add chat GPT and a number of people said I know that I'm not gonna use it because I use this for privacy  These are my notes and the developers say no no, no, it'll be optional. You can opt out  lot of tools notion uses I can use now in my notion I can say  Fill this, you know fill this in in fact, you know  I did do this when we were in we had a surprise visit to Genoa on our cruise  We were supposed to go to Porta Fina, but the waves are too high. So we went to Genoa and I didn't have any  Plans in general. I didn't know what to do in general. So I asked chat GPT for  A three-hour walking tour that began where the shuttle bus would drop us off and it was quite good

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was actually what's your what's your prompt again for the garden?  I'm in Bard now finally after trying five different Google accounts to get in. Oh, I was I was thinking about I

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Want to plan a garden for?  My house like basically for my backyard could be a little more than that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you'd want to tell it what the what the climate?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Either zone eight or Bay Bridge Island son, it's a full Sun

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, and you could say native or non-native. Yeah native  Okay  And you know, I bet this is something that probably be pretty good at

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  But like that's a lot of research that like even getting that list of plants like could take me a few hours

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oregon grape nut carol fricking hate Oregon  Heart dear firm Western sword and Oregon Columbine Douglas fir Western red cedar Western hemlock

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Sitka spruce. Yeah. Okay. Those are like ginormous trees

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Too small and I want to eat it

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  No, I don't want to eat it. I just wanted to be attractive. I don't want them to be native actually you we had a native

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, never mind native. No  The native plants are they grow so well here I have a smaller yard, please try again  In survey says I'm grumpy today because I have a cold so be nice to me  Now I just wanted to know what generic I didn't know what to do and you know  It was our plants that live for one year here is our plants that here is a here is what notion

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did here's some small native plant options for Bainbridge  Salal kinnekinic  Oregon stone crop that doesn't sound good red flowering current sword fern. Why are they all so angry?  evergreen huckleberry  Douglas aster Pacific bleeding heart and yellow wood violet

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Okay, so three of those plants are new to me and I would like to see them  So I would go click on those and be like, which give me one of them  Which one the leading heart would aster in the bleeding heart. All right, let's do a pacific bleeding heart

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Slah ask AI to write  Tell me  I just know what's neat is this is in notion. So it's in a notebook now  We'll see. I don't know if tell me more. Well, oh  available

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Does it doesn't like Sun? I mean, oh I didn't say son

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow, that's giving me a detailed it's in array for a cruise from Lisbon to Rome. Oh  It summarized the document look at that that was cool. Oh, let's see here  I'm gonna I want to know more about this. I don't know exactly how to do this  Ask the AI to write

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  How about see more?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oops, yeah, it's writing. No, I already know that wait a minute. No, no, stop stop stop  Okay. Anyway, you get the idea. I mean that's embedded in a notebook, which is kind of cool  you could have a  Notion page devoted to your research and that would give you a starting point  So I you know, that's I think that's some that's fairly useful. Yeah

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  And then I would like it to generate a picture of the plants in my yard using AR and

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Mid-journey. Well, you could do that. I think with the new Google thing you can have it

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, that's that's why I think this is compared. I know y'all are like, oh, this is stupid. But no  I think a lot of this is yeah, that was that was a terrible summary  I just I  I think a lot of it we take for granted because if you have the right person in the room is super easy  but we don't often have the right person or the right knowledge in the room and being able to  To get all of this context not just the limited context we've gotten through like traditional search and like pulling that together  That's really helpful. That's like why people hire personal assistants

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I know I agree. I maybe was being a little contrarian. I

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Am so I'm so not country

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Used it  I  Think really the key is to understand its limitations and to use it appropriately  That's the grand experiment, isn't it? And we'll see we had a couple of Sundays ago  Alex Stamos Jeff was there on twit Alex of course that  Director really at Stanford Internet Observatory where they studied this information and his real concern was that we're gonna see a flood of garbage  And not unlike the trucks that come to your house during twig every week and every day  The flood of garbage as we approach the election he was really concerned about the 2024 election

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I think that's legitimate as well. There's no responsibility on every citizen to figure out what's real and what's not  And we deputized media institutions to do that and this is not gonna be the case  We're gonna go back to kind of a pre-media world where we've got to decide for ourselves

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I do have to say though that that was the one thing that Google we just talked about showed  That was impressive is is the ability to look at something and say that's disinformation  More of that, please. That would be very useful

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  By the way, the buzzing sound you heard during I oh, you know, yeah was a plane buzzing the oh  What did it have a message?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Privacy privacy. Yeah, I was like was that Apple?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What happens at Google I oh  By the way, we are right now recording a show in in Mountain View at Google show us again show us  Oh, this is really exciting. Jason Howell is there with Wintoudao and Ron Richards from our all-about Android team  Here's a shot of it. They just completed an interview with Dave Burke and Samir Samat the two people who presented about Android  On stage about wallpaper

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He seems like a really nice guy but oh my god the wall yeah, he was it was his mark

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He was his marching orders. I'm sure  Anyway, that is that is an ongoing  Interview they're gonna do I think they have at least four people from Google that they're gonna talk to  Today as they're down there, we're recording it and we'll edit it and put it out as a Twitter special  So if you want to know more like in-depth stuff as if you were a developer at Google I oh, this is a great opportunity  That'll be going out on our newsfeed  Probably, you know, we're gonna get the files and edit them maybe tomorrow, right soon ish. Yes. Say again, John. Oh  We already have the files are being edited now and it'll come out tonight  That's just part one though, right  Ah and the rest will be during all about Android on Tuesdays  They're gonna use them as a little little bits on all that. That's great. Nice. Thank you guys. Good job  To our team down there including Anthony Nielsen and Burke McQuinn who did all the engineering for that  And it was quite an adventure. They gave us a little teeny weeny conference room

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We managed that's that's that's important real estate down there man a conference room is I know I know Google and Facebook

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And by the way, I got to thank our Club twit folks for making that possible. This is where your money goes  So, you know people think I'm asking I'm not a preacher saying give me money  So I can so I can spend it on a fancy house and fine fine wine  when you pony up that seven bucks for Club twit, you're really supporting production and  Making stuff like that. You do get some benefits all of the shows that we do ad free  Including some shows we do only for the club like Hands on Macintosh with Micah Sargent Paul Thurotte does Hands on Windows  We have home theater geeks. Yes, we brought it back  Thanks to the club with Scott Wilkinson if you're all about AV and home theaters  You'll love that show the untitled Linux show with Jonathan Bennett. Stacy does her book club  In fact, I saw you doing the new Anna Lee knew its book. That's exciting. Oh  Terraformers is so good. Oh, I can't wait. That's in a couple of months  And you're gonna be interviewing our good friend Alex Wilhelm tomorrow 9 a.m  Yep, members of the club get that and there's a twit plus feed which not only has those shows  But also bits and pieces  Lying around on the cutting room floor outtakes and the like  It is we try to give you some value for your dollar, but your dollar makes a big difference to us  Advertising is really shrinking and you know, it's a very competitive environment for podcasts right now  And almost everybody who survives does it because they've got a core group of people like you  Joined their you know patreon or their club  Club twit is at twit.tv slash club twit and pru. It's a community manager. There's  $7 a month the basic plan. There's family plans. There's corporate plans  There's a yearly membership as well and I thank you so much all of our we even get people that

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  donate more than the seven dollars a month because you know if you want to get the full club at seven dollars a month, but the option to  Do another dollar another two dollars you could do that to in there are people that pay more than the seven dollars just  For additional support and we really do appreciate that. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Certainly, there's no requirement that you do it. Thank you for doing it. We're very happy to get the seven bucks  If I you know if we could just get  5% of our audience to met be members of the club it would pay for everything that we do just as generous as a public radio

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Station. Yeah a kind of crappy public radio station. Yeah is there there?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  kind of crappy  Weird nice we just don't have the variety

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We got a pretty good variety. We got about 15 shows something like that. I think there's a variety  We produce a lot of stuff  Also, I didn't even mention you get the access to the the discord which is this court really a great community all the gifts  You can watch yeah, I have but there's more than that  I updated our we have a let's play area where we have a variety of servers and stuff  I updated our Minecraft server today to 1.9 point 4. There's a really challenging  Survival Minecraft server on those on there for club to it members. Okay, scroll past the pump the pony, please  Are you sick of the pony with the ball? Yeah, I'm getting how about how about a little  The Minecraft is cool because we have

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  All out do each oh dear

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is really fun it's a discord challenge

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In the coding a section, although the Leo AI is in there too, and he is very annoying extremely extremely annoying  Cranky no. No, he's annoying in the way. He's you know, he's in the way only AI can be you know, just  confidently wrong

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Does it let let's ask him about the learning curve because oh he'll be confidently right. Oh, yeah, I really lost

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That one

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  By the way, I just got into bard with my my buzz machine. Oh good. Okay, I authorized myself good good  I said do you trust yourself? Yes, I think I do. Okay behave that let myself in

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right. Let me see if AI Leo knows anything about the learning curve

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  If it's wrong in the same way you are I'm like this is the best day

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If a learning curve is steep  Does that we'll see mean it's something is  Easy to learn or

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wait to give you our should I give you bars response first? Yeah women. Let's go ahead and let's see what Bard says a  Steep learning curve is a term used to describe a situation where there is a lot to learn in a short period of time  I think that's an answer but wait the next sentence says this can be either harder or easier depending on your perspective

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She's okay. Here's what AI Leo says well chief to it  I'm glad you asked as a highly advanced AI construct with an infinite knowledge base. I find all learning curves  Quite easy  But for mere mortals like yourself a steep learning curve typically means something is difficult to learn  Don't worry though with my help. You'll be a tech expert in no time

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Started out so promisingly

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Anyway, what platform is are you is that I can't remember Anthony Ilson set it up  Do we know what he did with that? I don't remember anyway, that's another benefit of club to it  You can get confidently wrong answers from me from a I leave a better case. Yeah, Patrick says Patrick worked on it  I just signed up for something called acapella  I'm very curious about this. This is yet another place that says if you if you give us  voice samples, we will generate a  Voice for you  acapella-group  Dot-com and they do this for free, but I had to read 215 samples  me all morning  and then a  lot of them were think I'm worried about it because a lot of more things like  I'm typing this so please give me some time to give you my answer and help I've fallen. Can you help me up?  So I'm a little worried about what they're gonna use this for  Actually the it says here users about to lose the ability to speak can now recreate their voice synthetically  That's actually really cool to keep this essential part of their identity  So you can also add some phrases of your own like, you know, I love you, honey  Thank you for being a great spouse and can you change my diaper now and things like that? So  Customize those in your voice  Oh  It's already been used by many patients in many countries 21 languages  Ten minutes of recording and they're allowing you to do that for free  Although I imagine if you were gonna use it with a speech device that there you'd probably have to to buy it  But they do have a three-month free trial. So when I get that back  We can play with that  Be interesting 99 euros or dollars a year

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We won't see we won't see you in this weekend Google anymore you'll just be like I'm gonna have my voice voted in  They see can you change my diaper and

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That'll be fun. All right  Moving right along shall we let's talk hardware  All right, Stacy  time for a game  Do you think Leo ordered any of these products?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yes, which but you were probably cranky about the folding phone

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what I think you ordered you think I ordered the folding phone, but was cranky about it. I was so cranky  I said no way. I'm spending seventeen hundred F and dollars on that folding phone  Yes, so you're right. I did not order it though. I was cranky. Oh, I was very excited about  The tablet yeah, surprisingly excited about including the doc and they're throwing the dock in so the tablets for now  $499 120 gigs of ram  128 gigs of ram 100 bucks more you get more ram 256  But I love it that I was relieved frankly they're throwing in the dock because I think this is a good idea  It's a normal, you know Android tablet. It's 11 inches, but with the dock  You know you it becomes like a nest hub, right but it doesn't okay. Tell me I was disappointed

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  What I did wrong so no you didn't do it right like I am super confused as to who this tablets for I think that  it's an I like I love the doc idea, but I think Google just took it halfway and  It doesn't make sense to me because I think that it doesn't solve that big of a problem

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's always like, you know, they made up the problem that you have a tablet  But you always forget it put it in the door and then it's not charged or anything

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So I don't think that's that was a problem like when we all got tablets like ten years ago  But we all figured out that we just have charging stations. Yeah, I keep my head charged. I absolutely do

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have two iPads and I keep it charged  But I also I have to say I have three Google Nest hubs

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Two big ones and two little ones and this will not replace them if value in your Google Nest hub is  I

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can't say hey hub set a timer for 12 minutes for green beans I can't do that

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  If the tablet is there you can oh good, but and I know it does turn off the lights because I use it for that  But if someone has your tablet then that's gone. Well, nobody's gonna take my damn  It  So it has hub mode but it only has hub mode when it is it only behaves as a smart home device when it's docked  Well, that's not at least it does that  At well at least but I already have a nest device that does that and it doesn't have a thread radio  Oh the dock itself doesn't have any microphones  So it doesn't do anything like without the tablet is nothing  Right and it doesn't have like it does have ultra wideband  But it's not using solely or anything for like presence detection is just doing kind of range stuff  like I just  To me. I wanted this to be like a full value smart home device and a tablet because for five hundred dollars  it's a lot and

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  For the main thing it doesn't look if you the main thing it does not do is  Is

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Act as a smart home device all the time when it's detached

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't know why it wouldn't why it couldn't. It turns into a tablet

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's just to me. It's like yeah, yeah and that dock becomes completely useless  Like it'd be cool if that dock had a microphone so you could keep issuing voice commands to the dock  Right or it had a thread radio. So it's a border router. Yeah, in fact, I don't see why it couldn't

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I don't see why the tablet shouldn't be able to you know work. That's what doesn't I don't

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  That's why I'm disappointed with so so that's where I and when I asked Google because I was on the briefings for these  I was like, is this how does this relate to the nest display products?  He's like we don't you know, it it does not compete with that. It's a completely

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Remember politics the nests are running fuchsia. This is running Android  This is more expensive the you know, the nest hub max  Which is admittedly only a seven inch screen is 229 and I have so I've nest hub to to the bigger one max  The max it used to be that big speaker. I don't mean the big speaker. I mean the bigger screen. Okay, sorry  I'm like no the nest of max by the names are terrible and I can never oh god. I know I hate it

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I think it's the second-gen nest displays. I think that's a little one that doesn't have a camera

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's in the bedroom and the gym because I don't want anybody see me

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Lifting weights. Yeah. Oh, no, there is a nice charge for that. You're right as a

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, the nest hub max so that's the one that's closest but it's still only a seven inch screen  I do you know  I do things like say because I have YouTube TV so I can say play YouTube TV on it  But having an 11 inch should be a little bit nicer, but it's only 229 and you can't detach it  It's not a tablet and then I have the little ones the nest second-gen nest hub that you were talking about  That's as I said, that's in the bedroom of the gym because it doesn't have a camera  Right. I you know, this will be this this will be this will replace a next nest hub max in the kitchen  Because it'll know no

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  What is someone's streaming movies and has your tablet while you're trying to cook then you're gonna not be able to set up your timer

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm gonna get tablets and TV. They have plenty of ways to watch TV  Person but I do I do think having it there like if I wanted to you know  I'm gonna watch TV. I might want to take it and bring it with me so I can I don't know do stuff. I

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Don't know

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right. It's probably I mean honestly, I wouldn't have bought it except I want to review it so  And I just couldn't myself to buy the I have a 7 so 7 Pro  I and I feel like I needed a 7a but the 7a is gonna be nice  By the way, this is be fine 6a now is dropped in price at 120 bucks  So if you were in the market for a 6a now, it's even more affordable the 7a is pretty much  Who was it was saying?  Today that the 7a is getting closer and closer to the 7 Pro. Mr. Howell said that in our discord  Yeah, yeah that the capabilities are now, you know pretty close to a 7 Pro and it is half the price and the prices are yeah  So and it comes in what they call coral, but I thought I'd ask you Stacy. What color is that?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Just I would call that coral. Okay, it's like a pinky red. It's an orange pinky red salmon

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Looks like a fish to me  It's not sockeye  salmon see  Charcoal or snow I  Hate that coral color. Yeah, cuz it's neither it's either this nor that it's cantaloupe

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But it's also salmon. This is a commentary on why there's really nothing new with phones when you drive a tunnel  huge  Wheelboards above it all around. Yeah all Apple saying we have yellow phones yellow phones. Yeah, what else?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Even when I got when I was in Portugal, it was like all the ads are for yellow iPhones  It is it's sad. Yes  And and when they spend seven minutes on the fact that you can generate emoji wallpaper who the hell cares I  Don't care. Now. This is meanwhile line 60 Leo is

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google's  hip video for the foldable

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Stacy you have the flip you like foldables I think right I

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Mean, I probably I don't know if I'd get another foldable and I oh interesting. Why not?  Well, cuz the price difference  I mean, I'm using it because you gave it to me for free and I wanted to play with it, but the price differential is  huge on those and  I'm also not a phone snob. I don't really care about my phone. I just used to work

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I'm not a good man ask I don't I honestly don't think I don't really like the big foldable  I thought the little foldable had some merit because you can it's small enough. You can put it a little appealing  It's appealing the big one's just too big and I don't need a seven point two inch  Screen was it the NBA watch party that you want? Yes. Yes, watch that. Okay.

Oh, they're going to they're going to they're gonna unfold them  Oh, yeah, there we go  It's not that big wait no, you know, first of all bad choice for a basketball player because what are basketball players known for?  Big hands. Yeah, so you makes your phone look small  Because they got massive hands. Yeah  You know so that might have been a tactic that may be what they're they're trying to do there

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I mean cuz like when I see a big phone, I'm like, nope. Oh, maybe they're trying to hide it that it's a big

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, oh, this is manageable  Yeah  Eight I think 1700 bucks is all is the  1800 is

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  1799 right? Oh, you're right  17 that's ridiculous. This is how Leo buys things. Oh, thank you. Yeah. That's why they charge. That's why they make it

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  17999 because Leo's gonna say 1700 bucks. It's $1800 minus a penny  Yeah  It really looks a lot like a Z  Actually, this was a good piece from the verge because they showed the Z fold now those Z fold has a thigh gap  And I didn't I don't like that. Mm-hmm, but I put mine in a case so you can't see the thigh gap

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Google to their credit. We please not call it a thigh gap just for so many reasons  It's gross  And it's also a little offensive yeah, okay, yeah no thank you what what do you propose a butthole

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Speaking of buttholes by the way, I told you punchy. No. No, this is a I think a reasonable

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Commentary on the new logo for Google Assistant  Have you seen it? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't recall I don't like where this is going at all

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Get the punchy thing ready

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find it because they they've changed the light the logo, let me see  Maybe if I search for it Google logo butthole it'll come right up and it does  They may oh it's the authenticator sorry, so the original authenticator nice it looks like a safe right it's got bolts  The new one I  Guess you think so like it looks it's  Sphincter ish it also does

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Astrix man  That's a reach come on

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Yes, it's an asterix

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know what this is why I shouldn't get my infer my my material from Twitter. Yeah

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, that's becoming even more dangerous. That was my error. Yeah, apologies everyone

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, let's see. What else the fold  You know to their credit the pixel is  Doesn't have a gap of any kind. It looks nice  And they say it's thinner in fact than the fold

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  It's funny talking to hardhead this morning about it  He says that phone looks nice, but man, that's thick and I had to explain to him  I said dude you not played with phones long enough  That's actually pretty much what phones used to be like anyway far as that thickness goes and that's not very thick  But yeah, when I show it to us on the the

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Whatever it was the press briefing it was  Real impressive like I was like  Yeah  So you handle it  No, no, no, it was a virtual. It was like a zoom press briefing  It is a higher screen resolution slightly 2208 by 1840. That's a little higher than the z-fold for

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How much does it weigh?  It weighs  Floppy wrist contingent wants to know about 10 ounces, which is not super heavy  It's a little more it is more than the galaxy fold also bigger battery, which is good  And and it has you know, it's funny because Apple gets so much  Material so much mileage out of the fact they make their own processors in the you know  We got our a4 a15 and we've got the m1  Google's been making their own processors in the since the pixel 7 right and it's the tensor g2  Which is I think a pretty good chip, but they don't get the they don't get the love for it 12 gigs of RAM  in  running

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Desktop computers and laptops the way Apple is doing it with all of their stuff, right?  But I think it's as calm as as as as powerful. I don't know. I think it is

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Camera, you know, it's a Google camera. So it's probably pretty good probably comparable to the Samsung  The fold camera is very good. I think  The fold camera is very good I think  Does not have 8k video recording fold does  It's got a fingerprint scanner in the power button. I like that. That was a good choice  It does have face ID with your face unlock, which the fold does not  millimeter wave and sub 6 gigahertz Stacey says thumbs up right Wi-Fi 6e  That's good  No stylus for a phone, yeah, and both of the both 1799 99

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Does the Samsung have a stylist? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The same side is basically tablet didn't have a stylus. Oh

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  It doesn't they didn't mention a stylist did they know it actually doesn't someone asked and interesting or it just feels like a half-assed

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Tablet yeah, which is what every Android tablet. Well, certainly every pixel tablet has felt like  I guess people like the Samsung Galaxy Note tablet  Anyway pixel fold. Oh, when did you get your briefing? You were all up on this already May 1st  May 1st Wow, I was still in Italy

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Share with us. Yeah  You were in Italy

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Trust Stacey with your secrets, I presume you were you were in da don't know I

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Only do embargoes. I don't do it days, but I was under embargo. So you could

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You could have told us  Yeah, you could have worn it once

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Also, I try to keep my word I mean

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Embargo and an NDA bar go just means you can't write about it on midnight Tuesday or whatever, right?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, an NDA is like legally. Yeah an embargo. My go is

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Like a promise. Yeah. I might into for instance an embargo you could intimate. Yeah, I've seen it  I'll have an article on Tuesday, right?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  That wouldn't you you are allowed to say you're under but like I even said it last week  I said I was under embargo for some of the stuff did she I missed that. Oh, well, I

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Would have pressed you. You don't listen to me. I would have pressed you hard  One of the things Google mentioned is that and this is I think gonna be interesting  I wish I could go to Ohio to do it Wendy's is gonna use  Google's  Bard as an order taker. They're gonna try it out first  Yeah, and a Columbus Wendy's  They say it's gonna shorten the lines it's gonna make them longer  Good god, it's not I have you ever met a  Have you ever met a chat that is not loquacious

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Maybe it'll be trained on short people like our people who are

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It'll be very people this is alright, I'll just tell you what the Wall Street Journal wrote mr. Penegor  Whoever he is says it'll be very conversational  No, you won't know you're talking to anybody but an employee. In fact, Wendy's mistakenly said it's smarter than our employees

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh  With no ice. Yes, the lemonade is very nice. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, cuz they're doing a customized language model that understands. There's cars. There's noise. There's kids in the backseat  They're gonna filter all the tic tocs of Wendy's. Oh, I can't wait. Oh man tic tocs  Converge on Columbus. We need to see this  They Wendy's customized language includes unique phrases  Wendy's customers apparently use now. I've been to a Wendy's  I've never called it a JBC. Oh my gosh for a junior bacon cheeseburger

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I've actually heard some of those. Have you think about it? You know what a biggie bag is JB. Yeah, I've heard I've heard those phrases  Teenager three running around so I actually like Wendy's the hamburgers are square. Yes. Give me baconator all day

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, Wendy's no spicy grilled cheese sandwich or spiky spicy  Yeah chicken sandwich, that's my go-to

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Much better chicken sandwich. Yeah

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  For chicken

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When he's causes milkshakes frosties, but the chat has to understand milkshake and frosty. Oh, no  You may  Thomas curry and CEO of Google Cloud  You may think driving by and speaking into a drive-thru is an easy problem for AI  But it's actually one of the hardest I believe that a lot of challenges noise  Oh and they have the upsell built in  The upsell is built in kids. Oh, no, of course they do. Was that a super large?  Yeah, would you like a milkshake with a sorry frosty? How about a biggie bag?  It says least this is the this is Wendy's CIO  Kevin Vasconi says it's as least as good as our best customer service representative and it's probably on average better

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, he must he must actually eat at Wendy's I don't know 80% of food orders at Wendy's are made in the drive-thru

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Have you ever been in a Wendy's?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Now, you know, yes, but my kids were little. Yeah, that's one of you know, is it that would be variety for me instead of Burger King

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Honestly, I typically go inside of these places because it's usually faster than it is

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and that's the whole problem. They're trying to solve is they want it it says the order grows correctly to the chef

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Say it was straight face say it was straight face read that again

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we'll find out it'll be in Columbus, Ohio in June, please tick tockers fill us in  All right other in other is there anything else from IO we mentioned the 7a we mentioned the  Set for my own. That's it  By the way, if you get that 1799 99 phone you'll get a free pixel watch in with

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  That's not a pixel watch on your wrist, yeah, no, you're right. This is the good one. Yeah  Hey, you said the 6a was marked down. What was it marked down to I?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Thought I saw for 99. No 49 is the 7a I think I saw six a I wanted to say 329  I saw but look I can do it for you. I'm a member  Took a I'm not only a hair  I'm not only the president of the hair club be 49. I'm also a client  349 okay  Then I think is a good price for a great phone. Yep. That's probably the sweet spot to be honest

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh, you can buy you can buy a 6a at Best Buy for three or two 99, but it's only 128 gigs

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's subsidized. That's all I would need you have to probably have to sign up with a to know Best Buy's is unlocked

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh nice. Okay  Now we're talking, you know, maybe maybe it's the color. Oh  Yeah, cuz don't oh  No, you can get charcoal. It doesn't have to be sage green. Is this for Queen Pruitt or you know, I'm considering another phone  But it's only 128 gigs. Is that okay for you? Yeah, that's what the photo man. Do you I'll tell you this right now

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I don't keep all of my photos  Right now so you he's crazy people do all we need thousand on your phone

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All we need is a hundred people to join club to it right now in ampruik and have a pixel fold ladies and gentlemen  All right 100 people sign on 100 people sign up before the end of this show  And Pruitt gets a new phone. How about that? How about that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Other people are still listening this far in that's the miracle. Oh, please

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We've only been going for an hour 48 you want to get to your catcher pepe. All right quickly

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, no, no, no somewhat somewhat related to Google and all that. It's not part of I own you may just blow me off and that's okay  but  You have the secret sauce memo and then related to that is Google a story of the Washington Post about how Google was sharing  Its AI knowledge with the world until chat GPT came along the furor and how it's kind of locking down  It's not as open as it was. Yeah  And and is Google so special that memo was really interested. It was a leaked  That memo but late post on internal under little discussion the one that says we have no sauce here

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We have no moat but neither does open AI that one. Yeah. Yeah, that was interesting. Yeah  They're worried we knew they were worried that open AI would outcompete Google  But the document actually said the real fear the real threat is not Microsoft or  Anthropic it's open source  And if you think about it look at stable diffusion and how quickly stable diffusion went from 0 to 60 in a couple of weeks  It was open source because everybody could run it on their own machine, right? Right?  So I think that's an interesting point sooner per child did make the point that we're you know  They had a bunch of names for their there was Imogen Cody mature  Gecko  Yeah  There were a bunch of animals, right? They the animals were like well, we can put a model on your phone. That was the gecko  right, you know the and the

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Unicorn was the biggest right?  Well, I don't think unicorns are generally big

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I think unicorns are hard to get to and maybe that's it takes a virgin to sit in a way that they were magical  They're magical and unbelievable  Not real  UFO hunters have built this is all the this week in AI actually, let's do it  Unicorn I'm sorry UFO hunters might as well be unicorn hunters are doing an open source AI  System to scan the skies perfect example, right sky 360 is a worldwide network of automated cameras  See, there's so many cameras now out there  watching for  UFOs  Because they don't think they don't believe the Air Force and the federal government  That you know, they think they're sitting on this. So  They're good they said we're gonna do our own research and we're gonna see if we can find some UFO wonder how many of those those

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Cameras return  Skylink was what Starlink Skylink whatever it is. Oh, yeah. Yeah, one of it how many times that pops up in the results  Yeah, it's just another 30,000

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  astronomy the astronomy subreddit on reddit  One of the moderators said we need some automation so that every time somebody posts. What was that weird link of listen?  60 straight line  Lights up there. That's a UFO. No, no, it's Starlink. They need an automate that one because it happens every time  The sky 360 stations if you want to get involved  Consist of an all-sky cam and has a wide-angle fish eye lens with pan tilt focus and  the fish eye registers all movement under one lying software performs initial rough analysis of  Whatever is going on decides whether to activate the other sense  Sensors and then the pan tilt focus zooms in on the object attracts it further analyzes it  So there's a lot of computer vision  Involved in the awesome. Yeah, and then they have a discord server  So far 20 people have set up stations from the US to Canada to the Azores to the middle of the Atlantic  They'd like to get many many more  Yeah, I think this is awesome, what are they gonna find out well

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Chinese balloons

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But here's a map actually they've got quite a few out there  Once enough of the sky 360 stations have been deployed the next step is to work toward  Real-time monitoring drawing all the data together and analyzing it  30 volunteer developers working on the software. It's open source  So that's yeah, I think that's cool  That's a good use of AI  Spotify says making music's a bad use of AI. They have ejected thousands of AI made songs  They're purging fake streams and purging record labels like boomy  Which are designed to upload AI you can make a lot of money if you can you know get the right SEO  Some people might like it. Why don't they take it down a boomy has uploaded the equivalent of tens of thousands of songs  That's a lot for them to store. Yeah  You know, nobody's doing it  It's gotta be automatic boomy says oh no our users have done this they've created more than 14 million  songs

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Get ready. It's like  I'm gonna get people mad at me this but AI could make techno as easy as pie

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, techno is it sounds like AI made. Yeah humans have to dumb themselves down to make EDM  I'm sorry. We sound like old men don't wait you like it  It's fun to chance to stop dancing to that synthetic music you young people need to listen to rock and roll

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  All right, let's let's get you going here cuz um, you're just getting

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Parsons, you know Parsons School of Design  That's where price of runway started right Tim Gunn and all that. Well, it's known for other things of that but go ahead  It's a well-known fashion institute, right? Yes it is they have a class now they're doing it in  partnership with Roblox  To do an avatar clothing design course is called collab Roblox

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they say everything's a collab these days our students our students want to design

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  not clothes for Gucci and Lauren and  Burberry but for Roblox actually  Gucci Ralph Lauren and Burberry all have Roblox versions of their clothing  So maybe there's a big business prices range from 50 Robux

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  But did they mention NFTs in this because I want to say that was a part of the hustle

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Discussion last year year before now we've moved on to AI avatar design  I don't know. Anyway, it's a three-hour weekly course for credit  But there is a catch Roblox gets 30% of every every  Catch  You gotta be careful apps  Business is business not can't be sexy because we got kids on here  One student tried to make a digital corset for an avatar got a road warning from Roblox  Warning from Roblox we do not permit sexual content of any kind corset is

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Corsets are there is a the corset sweatshirt is like one of the most like like I don't know  High fashion designs or street fashion designs right now corsets aren't sexy. How about they can be sexy

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think you might like this Stacey a bubblegum pink crop top with a heart cut out across the front and a gravity defying  puffy sleeves  Okay  Seinfeld Parson student Lea Melendez designed that  Digital fashion has taken way more seriously now in real life the sleeves had fall down the arms  But in Roblox, you don't have to worry about that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's a lot of stories let me run through these here I got more too I got a few more

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Defcon this year will be will have you know in the past they had for instance the the  digital election machine  Alley or village I guess they call it where hackers could try to hack election machines this year  They're gonna have an AI village where hackers will be invited. I do this last week. I know sir. No. Oh, I did it on Twitter  That's why  They're gonna hack large language models built by open AI Google and throw pick. There's an throw pick again  They got a good PR company. I don't know  That'll be August 10th through 13th and they expect her anthropic  Well in the ancient Greek it's a takeoff of the word anthropos  Socrates was a man all men are Socrates therefore, I don't know  Fortnite is now an Olympic eSports  What  Olympics are adding or looking at any way eSports. Oh, you're kidding me no fix. Well, it won't be  In the official Olympics yet  Those are gonna be in Paris next year this year  The 12 top players from the fortnight championship series will go to Singapore  23rd to 25th of June  To join players in other sports archery baseball cycling sailing taekwondo and tennis also chess but not real  Online right the dance event will be just dance the racing event will be Gran Turismo  Archery will be replicated by a smartphone game called tic-tac-bow  Which combines the traditional classic pen and paper game knots and crosses with archery so that's gotta be fun  but the weird thing is for the longest time the IOC said no no shooters, but  They say fortnight's. Okay. It's a family-friendly shooter. They have by athletes man  Yeah  Anyway, so we'll watch watch for that Olympic event. It's not yet officially  You're not gonna get a gold medal or anything, but you know what in four more years, who knows?  You get you get a fake virtual gold medal. Yeah virtual gold medal  Kind of bad news, but we'll see maybe they'll you know, the other shoe will drop but a judge has dismissed the FTC lawsuit  against Corte Chava  Or coach Chava, which is a data broker

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They were selling location information from smartphones. The FTC is not getting a great track record here in court

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is bad news. The company collects more than 90 location data points a day from about  35 million active mobile device users  The location coordinates can reveal where each mobile device has been approximately every 15 minutes  the FTC filed a complaint last August  Saying that the sale of geo location data on tens of millions of smartphones could be used to track people's visits  to private locations like churches synagogues mosques  abortion clinics domestic violence shelters medical centers and homeless shelters the judge didn't completely  Throw it out. It was the United States  District Court for Idaho  The judge said the agency's claim that Coach Chava's sale of location data was a severe intrusion on customers privacy  And that amounted to injury the judge said no no injury here  Yeah  But  Kind of gave the FTC a way forward  The FTC a way forward  By saying you got to show  Where there's where there's harm?

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So privacy harms are really hard to prove. This is one of the big issues. I have a real yeah anyway, yeah  Keep going

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Keep going moving right along and uh, I thought this was very weird Microsoft  Has signed a deal to use fusion energy to power its operations by 2028  The reason I think that's weird  Is there's no such thing as fusion energy right now somebody sold them on it  Yeah, the bridge too or this could be kind of a way a kind of say look we're good  We're planning on being carbon neutral. It's just this fusion thing. They got to figure this out  The they have signed a deal with fusion energy company helium energy  To purchase electricity from their first ever fusion power plant  The company says the fusion plant is slated to begin producing 50 megawatts of clean energy starting in five years  distributed by energy company constellation  Only some you know a little small  Issue is you know, they haven't figured out how to create fusion energy without spending more energy to generate it than it generates  But there have been a couple experiments lately that have that have maybe shown that possible  So they're doing magneto inertial fusion

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How is that an ai story?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I finished the ai segment. Yeah, that's long ago, sir. Where you been?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm doing i'm trying to run through because I want to get out of here  I'm trying to run through the the rest of the stories here. You saw the amp story. They quoted richard gingras  They said and me too and you how to google tried to fix the web by taking it over  The story titled speed trap appeared in the verge  Google promised to create a better faster web for media companies with a new standard called amp  In the end it ruined the trust publishers had in the internet giant. I'm sure you'd disagree with that premise

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  well, I have a I have a thread on line 69 about this and um  No, the publishers are can be jerks too  But I think google made some fundamental mistakes when this came up in finland the quotes be being finland raising this and the need for  What was a a portable newspaper where newspaper content could travel with this business model attached, which is the original idea I had  um  The one google executive who was at the news guys in finland said, you know, nobody's gonna trust google to do this  That's pretty much what came out and google I think messed up in in three critical  quick ways  one  They cached it themselves. Everybody thought they were building a walled garden and they did the cash for speed and they shouldn't have done it themselves  Two they didn't pass it off to  Be truly open source with open source governance soon enough  And I forget where the third word was  Um, but they just made some fundamental mistakes. I think a lot. Oh, I know and that they  They said oh if you're if you're if your page is as fast as amp not necessarily amp but fast as amp  Then you'll get into the news carousel, but everybody saw that as bribery to use amp  so it pissed off publishers who are an easy lot to piss off anyway, and  They kind of ruined it  The truth remains the reason this came up the reason that google did it the reason that dave besperas built it  Is because publishers have screwed up the web  We've made it slow and ugly and filled with promotions and filled with crap and that's still the case which is too bad

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's funny because they blame you  The verge says in may 2015 at the first newsgeist europe  Jarvis  Spent time at the conference arguing for someone presumably google to build a better alternative to instant articles  Which you said was facebook's thing. Yeah, it was a useful technical prototype with all the wrong attributes an open version essentially of instant articles  So yours got the story, right? He got the sequence very right here besperas said, okay, let's work on that  I did not I did not know when I argued with you about amp and what a bad idea was that  It can't that you had kind of we had gingers on though. Yeah, we did. Yeah good at the time to defend it. Um  Yeah, I I had the same  I think qualms that the publishers ended up having that it really wasn't  Really open  That it was really google. I mean it is now

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  um, and and there's a guy named dave garrion who I like quite a bit and I had him respond to me in the thread and he  says  It's still around and it's still being used and and publishers are still using it to get extra money  And he's got a company that does that and you know, it's not dead  It's just it's just google's not pushing it as much as they were. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Um  Good news the earth could soon be more detectable by aliens  This is uh, it's a weird story, you know, it's a non-story motherboard

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis

Transcript:  Tucker carlson going to twitter  All the all the best people are on twitter now. Yeah. Yes the best people best people  Americans are smuggling fruit roll-ups into israel. This must be one of yours jeff

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is indeed  Uh because you can blame tiktok and that's why it's there because there's a tiktok thing if you put ice cream inside of fruit roll-up  It gets kind of crunchy and everybody loves it in israel, but there's they're so short there that they cost a fortune  So people are smuggling in huge amounts of fruit roll-ups and they're getting arrested for it at the border

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I was confused why they were arrested. I guess you can't smuggle in that's right. Okay. Yeah, I was like

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's fruit roll-up smuggling against the law

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Is it because it's a food or is it just I mean, I I don't like maybe you don't declare it

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Maybe you're only allowed so many fruit roll-ups. It is really good. I guess they're just not kosher. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right, let's take a break and then your picks of the week we're not going to do a change log this week  We don't need to  The whole show was about that stupid thing

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, the change log was to fix the fact that we don't do google, but we did google. So yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah, so we don't need to that's our excuse  We've made good i'm sticking with it  I want to put in a pitch because we don't have an ad in this position  This is a normal ad position position  But I want to put in a pitch to people who are watching the show who might have a business who might doing be doing marketing  Uh for a business, uh who are looking?  For a way to promote their business or service and I just want to put in a pitch for what we do  Here at twit. Let me tell you what our mission statement is because and this is important  It will help you understand why you should be advertising on twitter our mission statement. It's right here on the wall  We are dedicated to building a highly engaged community  of tech enthusiasts  By offering them the knowledge they need to understand and use technology in today's world. I think we do that  I think we do that really well  And I think one of the ways from you know, the in the very beginning  We realized in order to do this we need to you know, do what we've done which is build a studio hire people hire talented  uh hosts and co-hosts  And we needed advertising to do this and it's worked because I think we have a really great audience half of our listeners  Are in management positions or above?  65 are involved in their company's decision making particularly with it  When you advertise on twit  You're they're all host read ads, right?  This is one thing we do that other podcasts other advertising media do not do they you know, they have pre-recorded ads  They inject into the content we do the ads I do the ads and you've heard me do the ads and I and I am  the way I think about this is  We turn away some advertisers because we want to make sure that we're talking about something we know and can recommend  And I feel like i'm taking  You know using my integrity to introduce a product or service to our qualified audience. It's an introduction  It's not the kind of ad where say, you know, you've got bad breath and you better get scope  It's the kind of ad where we say here's the features. Here's the benefits  Here's why you should take a look at something like this and it really really works  Look, just look at some of the testimonials tim broom who was the founder of it pro tv. We put them on the map  They've been with our network since day one since they started he says quote. We would not be where we are today without the twit network  And I I think that's true. We're very proud of that work. We've done for them mark mccrary ceo of authentic  He's been partnering with us for 16 years  He brought us our first ads  He said the feedback from many advertisers over those 16 years across a range of product categories  Is that if ads and podcasts are ever going to work for a brand?  They're going to work on twitch shows we produce results  That's why many of our advertisers come back year after year after year  There's another thing we do that nobody else does and i'm very proud of it. We have built a great team  Lisa, of course leads the team  Ryan and max are salespeople. Those are the people you'll talk to  Our continuity department with debbie and viva and sebastian  We've built a great team to create the gold standard in podcast advertising. We provide all the services you need  Because you know, especially in the early days  They never advertised on podcasts. In fact, many of our early advertisers like it pro had never advertised anywhere  By the way with it pro it works so well. They didn't need to advertise anywhere else  You'll get a full service continuity team supporting everything from copywriting to graphic design. You'll get embedded ads  Not you know, they're part of the content, right just like this and they're unique every single time  We do new ads every fresh every single time we always over deliver on impressions. That's our promise to you  We'll give you all the onboarding services. You need ad tech with pod sites. We give that free to our direct clients  You get lots of reporting  Uh, you get courtesy commercials, you know the commercials that I do and  And uh jason and mica and and do they're shareable across social media and landing pages  We'll give you a lot of freebies like mentions in our weekly newsletter that goes to thousands of fans you get bonus ads  Social media promotion and because we know you know, it's times are a little tough for everybody  We we go the extra mile to make sure every single ad we do is  Is going to work for you and is going to help your product or business take off  Look if you're ready to elevate your business reach out to us  Max or ryan or lisa will respond when you email advertise at twit.tv  tv  You'll be uh, you'll be pitching to a world-class audience. We love our audience. They're smart. They're educated  They're high income and they're decision makers in in their businesses for the most part  And uh, and you'll get a great ad. I promise you that's that's my promise to you advertise at twit.tv  TV thank I thank you for your time. I appreciate it lisa has all the demographics from the survey

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, you've seen haven't seen we've got the demographics all that information. Yeah  and  I think the other important thing is the unaided recall of a podcast ad here is tremendous

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  People know the advertisers here, you know, i'm I can't i've seen  Research I can't you know people pay for research to find out  And i've seen it. I can't say who or I can't give you any details  It's well over 90% unaided recall in many cases. That's unprecedented  You know ask somebody what's the recall? Oh, you saw that ad where the guy gets in a car wreck  And uh, because he's doing a tick tock dance. What's the product?  Nobody got it. Yeah. Oh, nobody can remember but our ads really work. So yeah, I I appreciate taking your time on that but

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  It's comparable to that 1968 bayer ad that we were talking about that you  Have a time. What's up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why 1963. That's why that's why

Speaker: Leo Laporte

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So  It spells up ai panic which means that ant has to get a new panic slide here  So not just moral panic but also a impact. So it's a is ai hype and critic hype  I is inducing simplistic binary thinking p is packed journalism a is anthropomorphizing ai  N is a narrow focus on the edges of the debate i is interchanging question marks  Less exclamation points and c is conversing converting I think sci-fi scenarios as credible predictions

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hey, you know what that reminds me we should get dr tech lash on the show soon  The next time somebody's not here  um  I can't tell jason because he's busy at google doing stuff, but somebody i got you you got me ant  You got me he she would be like a hey ant we haven't had her in a while and I think this  You know, I want to know what she means right now

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, because tristan harris who went all crazy about you know social media now  He's basically making another villain which all he does is erase the word social media and put ai in  So he's the exact same panic. Yep, and so the same moral entrepreneurs are going after ai

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the panic is even bigger. The funny thing is she put this on twitter where all of the crypto bros  Taking the same exact tweets and this is at changed crypto for ai. It's a non-stop fest of ai bs  ai hype which is what the number one problem talks about the opposite overconfident techies bragging about their ai systems or  Overconfident doomsayers accusing those ai systems of atrocities exactly  Uh, yeah good. There's a good media article explaining it all uh and do get her book tech lash and we will get her on  Soon because she's great  and pruett  What you got for us and

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Was wrong, which is why I had to clarify

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  On your own without like pressing up for the floor  Like if you can't get up without using your hands, you should work on that too. Oh, yep
