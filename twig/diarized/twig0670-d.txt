Transcript:  It's time for twig  This week in Google I know I'm not Leo. I'm Jeff Jarvis  I apologize for that all the time, but you're with us and it's gonna be a good time because I am here  While Leo is off doing whatever Leo is doing. I'm quite confused to what he's doing, but we'll get to that later with  Stacey Higginbotham the queen of IOT. Hi Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello, Jeff. So glad to be here and I'm glad you're here, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As opposed to some weeks when you just disappear on us, but you have good good excuses next week  You're going to Paris, but I'm glad you're here for my week this week  I'm very very happy and there is ant Pruitt the camp counselor for all of  Twit the guy who keeps all of our club members happy and respects them and loves them and they him and we're glad you're here  Hello, and hello, mr. Jarvis. How you be and you succeed and I'm driving them crazy because we're actually doing this  After the show, but I'm doing it before the show because I messed up before  So that's the fun of this if you were a member of the club. I'll bet you get to see all the ways I screw up  So now let's get into our news this week. We are going to be democratic  This is not like the normal show because Leo is not here and we're gonna use democracy because Leo keeps saying it's not a democracy  Well this week Leo it is and so I'm asking my co-hosts to mark the stories  They want to do and Stacey's gonna pick the first one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's let's kick it off with I think our big story this week. Jeff. I I'm just gonna actually I'm gonna say  It's the big story this week. It is I think in the wake of  The the just is the jobs decision that makes Roe versus Wade

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  obsolete and you call this when the when the Stacey when the  Decision was leaked and you called the angles here and I thought about it going into today's show and I thought you know  There's this thing about about newspapers have the local angle, right?  You know America lands on moon local company makes screws and rocket, right?  And I don't want to go so far as to find tech angles to everything but this story was not hard to find a lot  Of stories this has many many tech angles about what the companies are doing about what they're saying about privacy about technology  encryption all kinds of things so Stacey  Where do you want to start? I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  want to start first by like I  Guess it's not explaining. This is stuff  We all know but I think it's really important to reiterate in the wake of this decision  So the big macro story that everyone's talking about we're like, holy cow  Some states are going to outlaw abortion and as part of that  When a woman is pregnant  They the data that they might look for an abortion and they are going to both have data  Collected by many companies not just tech companies  But many companies they collect data and they're very interested in knowing if someone's pregnant and they're interested in knowing that because  Being pregnant means you're about to spend a heck of a lot of money, right?  Like yeah all kinds of stuff. So this is not nefarious like tech companies are like, oh my gosh  You're pregnant because I want to get all in your business. They're like, oh my gosh, you're pregnant  You're gonna spend a ton of money and advertisers really want a part piece of that  and so  They have a vested interest in keeping this data collecting this data and reselling this data and they always have and it's it's retailers  It's retailers it's your grocery store your phone so we're seeing a lot of stories about like  delete your period trackers or  You know turn off your phone if you're gonna go get an abortion. I it's a lot  It's a lot broader than that. It's  the whole world wants to know when you're pregnant and  They have access to that data and can infer from that  So then the question becomes  What do states do to if you're gonna prosecute someone for going over state lines for an abortion or maybe you just miscarry?  Maybe you didn't even realize you were pregnant and if they want to prosecute that they could and so  that's and they can ask tech companies or financial services firms or target for  for this data and  Use that in a prosecution is kind of the worries and the big focus is on things like location data  Period trackers I would argue things like, you know, I've got a Fitbit on when that  When someone's pregnant you might get an elevated heart rate for which you can infer that someone's pregnant  So there's a lot of data already being gathered that can infer someone is pregnant  So that's kind of the big picture story and we can talk about individual things tech companies are and aren't doing or could and couldn't do so  I'll stop talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you say it's it's bigger than the abortion you're basically saying because there's other things that can be construed from  Construed from the amount of data that's available. Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm saying it's bigger than the abortion issue because there's so there's so much of a financial interest on behalf of  Everyone if someone is pregnant, they're like there are about four or five stages of life when you're about to spend a lot of money  Pregnancy is one moving into a new home is another getting married is usually one. Yeah, so  Those companies are not gonna stop collecting that data. I know people are like they should stop collecting this data  They're not gonna stop trying to make these inferences because it's too lucrative

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even if it's not pregnancy Stacy if it's just if it's just location data and you went to you know  You went out of state  And and weeks after having announced you were pregnant or or other things  It's gonna be a lot that goes on I'm interested in two angles on this  First what consumers should smartly do what women should do? But first what what should we expect the companies to do?  For the users they're also doing things for their employees and these will get to that in a few minutes  But for the users a highly responsible tech company should now do what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is tough because legally they're obligated to share this data  When you agree to the terms and services even if you don't read them, they're like hey if I've got a subpoena and if your state  issues if your if your state  DA or who are prosecutor issues the subpoena for that data they have to give it up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so so what data should they should there be certain data that they  give you a ability to erase or that they should erase on a regular schedule or I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  think asking the tech companies to do anything here is  Silly it's it's how we're trained to think as Americans because we tend to think the answer lies with private enterprise  But the answer actually unfortunately lies with high quality regulation  You could do it either by making a federal law to make abortion legal  That solves this particular issue or you could do a federal privacy law that prevents and lays out parameters  That could address the disparity in the state's  Laws here about when and how they can when and what and how they can give up data

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and they get what data they give up and how but but we have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Non-functioning democracy in many ways these things that should be done  I agree at a federal level aren't going to get done either on privacy or on abortion  And so if you are an executive of a tech company saying hmm  What's what can I do? What should I do?  Is there any guidance at all for them? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think they're trying to do what they can they're in a really crappy position in the sense like they're they're saying things like hey  We will fund your abortion  We will fund travel out of state so you can go get one and I mean that's a nice but what makes that a position for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What what makes that a crappy position for the tech companies because I  Want to say I heard it from you and I totally agreed at the time when you were saying or someone said that  These tech companies are put in all of these  different  Advertisements and post up about being for the cause and you know, we support yada yada yada  But yet at the same time and all it was was just that post  They didn't put their money where their mouth is if you know what I mean  And here is an instance where they are actually putting their money where their mouth is  So what makes it if you know what you say this is the prosecutor or the law enforcement off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if the law enforcement officers go to your company's HR and they say hey we want these records  Mm-hmm, if your state if you're if your company there, there's a couple issues one  I'm not sure that they would feel comfortable and even legally protected if they refused to give  That information away, but two  It requires you to have a job to be  Able to get access to what is really health care and we already have that system here. So that's not super unusual  Yeah, think about like think about a teenager who wants to get an abortion  Yeah, they can't  right so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about from the user consumer perspective

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if you lived in if you lived in and pick a state  Who was the first one Missouri?  Texas  Yep. Well, yeah, yeah, you know, Texas  What different digital hygiene would you take on if you were thinking of getting pregnant?  I  Don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think I I think the things people are suggesting are helpful  I don't think they can cover everything  Nope  And I and I say that because  Like I don't know if y'all remember probably this was one of the first big data stories  It came in on like 2013 or something and it was target  Realizing some kid was pregnant before they did and sent a notice to the a mailer to the house in the data  It was very big. Ha ha  It's not just tech companies that know this  And so like I don't think you can actually  Protect yourself. You could you could pay cash for everything  You could only surf the internet through you know, tor you could do everything as encrypted as possible  You could not have a phone  Perhaps  Yeah, you could not have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Phone without how do you how do you work smart days without without how do you how do you you don't call your doctor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you stay in touch with your family?  Yeah, it doesn't have a smartphone get a get a feature phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's you know doesn't have all of the smarts and connectivity. Well, you would have to have it not have gps

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, there's that too  Ah, yeah, there's that too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they could still subpoena the uh, the cell phone records, right?  That's true actually they could call you would just have to revert back to a landline  And an answer mission and they can subpoena your what numbers you called

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess they can yes, but you probably I mean I guess you could get a burner phone

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Use it not in if you were going to use a burner phone  You would never want to use it from your house. You would want to make sure you're I mean like i'm not a spy  I'm not trained in  Sure, nor should we have to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what a spy is supposed to say mr. Jars

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is my cover

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, I think I think stacey's outfit today does look rather like  European dashing spy doesn't it? Yeah, my jaunty airline part to save the world. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and I am going to paris next week. So oh you are see here. Oh my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I mean I want to tell people  I I just feel like  We have to understand the scope of the problem and the scope of the problem is everybody has a vested interest in knowing if you're pregnant  in this society  So and there are no legal protections for companies that are like, oh crap. I don't want to give this data up  Um, how far do I think attorneys gender the the attorneys in the state who would prosecute this would go?  I don't know  And I also think that if we leave this as it is we're just going to get  years of legal cases why this is figured out in the court system like  Interstate commerce rules, you know, you're like, oh my my state that i'm in now has already said  Companies shall not give their data away to companies or to to prosecutors seeking location data on people who come to our state to have  An abortion. I don't know how that works. Do you like walk into washington and you're like i'm here for an abortion  And do you tell google so?  Like is google going to create separate?  Servers for each state based on their abortion rules so they can make sure they enforce these laws. I mean, it's a freaking nightmare

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and and duck duck go doesn't do it and incognito mode doesn't do it. No, you would have to use tour  You'd have to use tour. You'd have to be encrypted and dense  Yeah  Syllabilians don't do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't even do it. I'm a freaking journalist who sometimes report something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's a pain in the butt. I was like the last time I used tour was like a decade ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know one person that actually uses it for work  Related stuff and that's it and it's are they a spy else who just talks about it  They're not a spy, but they're they're doing journalism. So they have to protect their sources and stuff like that. So

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what about the companies?  I we already mentioned this ant the the the company google sent a letter to its employees saying that that they can just relocate without  An explanation to a state  And and I think that makes a lot of sense  Uh companies are changing their hr policies again. This is just the tech industry and we cover the tech industry  But I would imagine this needs to happen in every damn industry out there  But some companies you can't some jobs you can't move, you know, I work for luigi's pizza  on main street in  North cali cac whatever leo says your town is  Um kakalaki kakalaki. Thank you. Uh, you know, there isn't a branch of leo's in seattle  These are leo's pizza minutes  And so  You know, it's it's another statement of privilege the people who work for companies large enough with policies generous enough and the jobs that allow them  To move that's that's a small portion of of of people I think privilege  Yep. Yeah, so there's there's the letter from  google which says that that um  You know that it's it's an important statement to make  Uh the the head of hr or whatever they call it people or whatever  Uh, so that equity is extraordinarily important to us as a company  We share concerns about the impact of this really level of people's health lives and careers  To support googleers and their dependents our u.s  Benefits plan and health insurance covers out-of-state medical procedures that are not available where an employee lives and works  Googlers can also apply for relocation without justification. That is to say  Don't say why you're moving because it'll get subpoenaed  And those overseeing this process will be aware of the situation which is to say say yes when they ask it  if you need additional support connect one-on-one, which is to say not in a  Subpoenaable way with the people consultants capital key p capital c  uh via  Link redacted so that's what one company is doing. I salute them. I think it's good  But it affects only their employees and only as you say in that position of privilege

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And as you say the policy that says you just go out of state for any medical procedures and some companies are like hey  any medical procedure that opens up things like for uh,  gendered  gender reassignment gender non-conforming  words  um  So it opens up, you know the opportunity for lots of other things and does make it, you know  You can just say hey, I have to go for a medical procedure to someplace else and no one knows  So that's that is a nice way of doing it or a safe way of doing it. It's just that  We can't  I don't have the data right now on the percentage of people. I don't even know if we have the data on the  The types of jobs that people who tend to get abortions have I mean rich  Well-off people have always even when abortions were legal they were able to get them they would drive down to mexico  so  But you can't I mean  Having a baby is a lot of freaking  Work and it's expensive and you can't leave people  With that is there like no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you know, so again, I just like no it's awful

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This this is this is a good effort from the tech companies  um  But I believe more can be done  How about these same tech companies that are making a gazillion dollars do something with the lobbyists that are in place  I mean no one ever really brings that up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could you could google say you know what?  It's no longer like I would love to see google be like, you know  What it is so not worth it to have operations in these states because no one wants to work there anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Except I saw that going on I saw people talking about having  Academic conferences or tech conferences should not occur in these half of the states people immediately came on and said whoa  Your and I don't have two minds about this  You have the people who lack the privilege and lack the money and have those kinds of jobs where they can't move  And are often people of color work in those states and live in those states  And if you cut them off if you cut those states off you cut off their economic bases  And I don't know which way to go on that because because you know after after some of the laws the past on  on gender  My university said we were not allowed to travel to certain states no matter who paid for it. We couldn't go there  And I supported that  Uh, but I also understand the argument the contrary argument here that says, you know, you cut off the half of america  Where people need the other the other question is people are saying i'm going to move and I think people actually will move  Then any effort to make texas more purple  Gets set back  So in terms of cutting off these places there are unintended consequences which I think are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well there's I mean there's going to be a lot of unintended consequences from  What's happening right now?  just in general, um  I  I don't I mean, I think it's fine if companies say hey  It's no longer worth it to have operations here because no one wants to work there  I I do think there's a lot of push there and you can see companies like caterpillar moving its headquarters to texas  Just a few weeks ago. They did it because they were frustrated with illinois's tax laws and the way that those were  Affecting them and they announced it happens all the time  Yeah, that happens all the time. I mean

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Know when tesla moved to texas they moved  Yeah in protest of california, right?  Mm-hmm. So right. So who's gonna move this?  Yeah, so it doesn't make I don't think it's  Terrible. I think most states recognize when that happens. They will recognize that that is a problem  and  What they'll probably do is fund gift corporations more money as opposed to actually backtrack on their laws, which then just  Further  Tilts the scale towards us relying more and more on private enterprise for basic rights, which is terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So speaking of that now we have we do have some alternatives out there like plan b  And there was a story this week that at first  Facebook and instagram were cutting off  ads for and searches for  Mailed abortion pills, then they updated and said it was incorrect enforcement and they put it back up  But it illustrates the point you just made stacy is that is that we end up  beholden to corporations  for these critical things if we can't if you can't go to the to the nearby rex all if rex hospital exists and  Um  And by the pill because it's outlawed in your state and you and you order it through the mail  Well, will you be able to see an ad for it on facebook? Will you be able to order it on amazon?  We'll get to that in a second  um  If you order it through fedex, uh, because it's not the u.s postal service. Will that be vulnerable to search by local authorities?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ah, I mean  Yeah, like right now if I try to send weed to texas weed is legal in the u.s. It's  There sorry weed is legal in washington. It's not yet in the u.s. Illegally  Yeah, illegal in texas. I mean texas confiscates weed in the mail regularly  I don't know this for i'm not trying to bail weed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One way to keep your parents happy again the spy talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. Um  Well in

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't mean to pry but you have family back  in  That part of the country, uh is a discussion in the family at all or among friends or no, it's  It is what it is. You gotta understand that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most of my family and a few people in my circle  We just sort of  We try to just stay away from all of it because quite honestly  We don't feel like anything is going to be done  Or anything that's going to ever matter there's going to be a lot of disappointment one way  or another in  the stuff that's going on with the women's rights is just  It's just the tip of the iceberg for us. We're concerned  Most of us feel like it's only going to get worse regardless of who we vote for on top of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, which is the bigger issue this is not I mean like this is not a tech issue this is just an issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Democracy issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And tech companies and technology is not going to help us with this. Um, it can push us over, you know  I think we've seen how it's  Affected our democracy  Which I know you love talking about jeff, but I mean  I this is this is people have to get out on the ground and do something. I mean you have to  We have to stop being so complacent and that means people like us too, I mean it means more than just protesting it  It actually means  Doing the work in terms of like local activism and I don't think many of us are prepared to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No  Well, I think it goes one way that I said  You know, it's it's an all we  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I don't know if it's on we it's just and I I think some people will feel it more than others  I think like  Look, I I feel like I saw this coming in 2016 when donald trump was elected like and I I warned people and everyone around  He's like no. No, don't be silly  um  Of course it could have gone. I mean it didn't have to go this way, but it did  um  And I feel that there are still people like my husband he he is not i'm like ready to move

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just ready to go. Yeah, I see what's happening here and i'm like, oh no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  But he's like no, it's not that bad  So there's always going to be people who are going who are ready to be complacent because it's easy  And I think people who are in the groups that are going to be most affected  women

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know the thing is I I totally see where?  Mr. Andy's coming from um  Because there are times where I think to myself, you know what there are  thousands and thousands of people that are  Fleeing to get here  And there's a reason for that  You know, so I always sort of think twice about  a lot of the bad bull crap that's happening  In our government and say, you know, it could be a lot worse because there's still people that are literally dying  To get into these different borders

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those people are dying to get here a lot of a lot of them are dying to get here from central america  In mexico where it is admittedly so much less  Like so much less safe  You don't see as many people coming here like the number of people applying for us universities is down  So you don't see  Immigration and you see the same level of like migrants in europe coming from parts of africa and places that are  affected right now by climate change and poverty, so  I appreciate that argument, but i'm also like  Yeah, they're dying to get here because yeah  This is still better than like being murdered by a drug cartel and having your body dumped in a desert

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  but I think answer point too before was that the  It's it's politically you got to be motivated  And you're going to be motivated if you think there's a chance for change if you don't think it's a chance for change  Then people aren't going to be out there and and between this and january 6th, which also has its tech angles, too  Uh, you know, we don't know where this is going to turn out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I I can sit here and  Tell you about my voting experience, especially like this most recent voting experience here in state of california  No, i'm not going to divulge who I filled in the bubbles for but I spent that whole time filling out that ballot thinking  Not going to matter  They're just going to rob me too. Uh, he's this person's not going to fix it, but might as well give it a try  That was my thought the whole dag gum time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's sad. Well, thank you for voting. Anyway, unrealistic. Yes. Thank you for voting  Wear your little sticker proudly  Let me go back to to another tech topic on this just to just to round it out here, which is um  Um two things tied together at a higher level what the supreme court talked about and what thomas particularly is going after is privacy  Privacy is not we discussed in the show before privacy is not enshrined in the constitution  It came out of decisions like griswold. It came out of these decisions  and it was a  Crafted right that the supreme court at one level just took away and they could take away others  And privacy is a topic we talk about constantly on this show and it's it's it's key to  Uh technology is key to the internet as we move forward. So I I wonder whether  Just at a higher level than abortion. I think I think what you both said is stacey you said  Well, there's not much we can do about technology. It is what it is and and you said well politically  There's not much we can do it is what it is  Stipulated your honors  Let's go up a level and say in terms of the architecture of the net in terms of things like an encryption in terms of  Statements of rates about about what we should expect from tech companies at a higher level about privacy  Uh, I think this brings it home and i'm one of those i've said, you know on the show many times  Privacy is important, but so is publicness and I I kind of talked about the other side of that  Privacy is important and it's more important now than ever  Are there any things you would like to see from technology companies different from what we've seen in the last 10 years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I would like to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean and i've talked about this I think you need limited data  Limited. Yeah. What is the word gosh covid y'all has really broke my brain. Um  You should only keep data for like six months. We need to limit the amount of data that people can keep  We need to redefine pii  We need to  Yeah  We need to be transparent when we buy devices or sign up for things  You know thing that  What is tracking people what is being tracked and where that data is going to not written in legalese?  So things like you know, they but they put it in legalese for a reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I know, but they're going to change that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I think there are user-friendly ways to disclose that information. So there are  nutritional data for like  What data is being collected and shared?  I think what apple and google did with their apps in the app store when you download an app and you see the permissions  I think that's a good way to do that  Yeah, I should also point out if you're unaware  uh the beginning of june  Uh, there is a bipartisan privacy bill a federal privacy bill a draft of it was released  It is epic the the  I read it when it came out. There is a 64 page like overview of it and the bill itself is  mammoth  but  It it apply it basically changes the way that we think about privacy here in the us and way we've historically  Regulated it so  They're basically they modeled the laws off of the state laws. So not gdpr  So it doesn't have this like whole enshrining a right to privacy instead. It really focuses on the data  Says there's certain types of data that will be private. Uh, it's basically trying to say like pii  And data that can help  Point back to a person so think of like location data where you go to your house every night  It's pretty easy to figure out who you are from that  um  It does exclude de-identified data. So it doesn't  It actually doesn't solve the location data problem, i'm sorry  Um, and then they talk about things like data minimization. So don't collect as much data. Uh, they say that you  Can't do certain types of data processing such as like transferring biometric and genetic information without getting positive consent  um  You need to do privacy by design in your policies and procedures  They have categories of sensitive data  They have they actually bring children's data they make it private until the age of 17  um  They actually I think that's great. I've been wanting that for a while  They need data brokers will have to register with the ftc and they have to provide like audit logs and share that data  Um, there's a lot of stuff about data security. There's classification of companies as like large data handlers  And that's based on how much data you have and how much money you make on it  And it puts the enforcement at the federal and the state attorney's general level  Um, there's a lot of stuff that isn't in there, but it's just a draft and we don't know if that'll happen  But I just wanted y'all to know that that's out there and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So politically, what are you hearing about about right versus left and tech versus  media  We haven't heard a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because things kind of blew up when it came out on a friday and then the week after that  I feel like something big happened and I mean it feels like something big's happening all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we haven't I I don't see a lot of people  Talking about it  yet  Oh, but I can stick the little draft in the here. No, yeah do thank you. Thank you for that that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've read it more than I have so i'm actually glad to have gotten that that little pressy there  That's great. All right. One more question then we'll then we'll go to leo doing a commercial  And then encryption tor is a pain. We just we just all said shrugged and so we don't do it  Yeah, some message applications are encrypted  Is there but but I don't think we have a lot of faith in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um  We don't have I don't think I have faith in the messaging apps with the encryption because of they're just not mainstream enough  It's just right a reason to get people to but it install it could be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's my question is what would it take to make encryption?  More demanded both on the company side and on the client side on our other on the consumer side

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think this is no different in  And  I'm not trying to be funny or anything, but I don't think that argument or question is no different from  Or why not get people to move from facebook to this new social media platform?  because it's got this bell and whistle and blah blah blah blah and it's because of  The barrier to entry is it's just it's too much for people people don't  They don't want to change they'll talk about it, but they're not going to go  You telling me I need to install this new app just so it can be encrypted to talk to my mother  Uh, that's okay. I'll take my chances. That's exactly what they'll say  That's exactly what they'll say. They won't install

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey like what if gen z so the teenage girls start installing it  And then if you want to talk to a teenage girl, which means teenage boys will start installing it  The parents may install it to protect their kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So maybe you don't get my parents might get freaked about it, too if parents can't read it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so  Well, yeah, because there's always going to be people who are like, oh my god, it's end to end encryption  I mean, it's not like we've settled this in this this country that end to end encryption is great because  I mean it's hard enough to get people to just use vpn on anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this has been a cheery beginning to the show yeah way to go mr. Jarvis  All right. All right, so i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna do one other thing here  I don't see any initials in here yet  But when we do the commercial you can start looking through  I'll give you one story for a cheery moment lines 70  Taco bell has announced a tostada on a giant  Cheez-it  18 times the size of a regular cheese it now.

Yeah  16 times larger you could also get it made into one of their crunchy things with its wrapped in 53 layers of more fat  As well, but I think I think the simplicity of this is nice the cheese it  Tostada is a major advance in american consumerism and technology. What does it take to make a giant cheese it?  I mean, that's not gonna that's not easy, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know what's what's most significant about it is actually that it means that taco bell is going to bring  one more ingredient inside its production lines because taco bell is famous for only having  X number of ingredients and they from that they assemble everything but this is a new one  So that's worth celebrating

Transcript:  Oh  I'm very confused. I'm very confused. Don't don't just city leo just just just leaves me. All right  All right  So this is a democracy  So there are other big stories to get which we probably should get to but it'd be democracy  And the fact that i've already used up my free bloomberg articles for the month  I put this one in there in the rundown as stacey bait hoping she would explain it to me because I can't read it  Because i've gone over my allocation. So adt in google stacey stacey explain what's going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we actually talked about this on my show. So tomorrow you can skip you can skip the section of my show tomorrow if you listen  Um, but this is this is actually a delightful article as a journalist. I have to say the article starts out with  We're in where are we palmetto bay florida underneath a thomas concave painting  with an installer for adt  And I just like I know exactly what kind of home this is and who it's for in the audience, right?  I'm like, i'm like, all right. So this is talking back in august 2020  Google purchased a 6.6 percent stake in adt the security company  Um, I think it was 450 million dollars and this is basically  Saying two years later what has come of this and the answer for google is yeah, maybe not that much  but for adt it's been huge and  It talks about you know adt is  bundling some of google's  smart home hardware  like the nest doorbells cameras  displays  Thermostats all that in with adt's other sensors and alarm things and they're trying to build  solutions for  Customers what google gets out of this is basically they sell more nest devices they get access to this huge base of installers  And this is so important because the smart home is such a pain in the butt to install good lord  And most people don't want to do it and it also puts it in like old people's homes  I shouldn't say old people but older people who may not be smart home aficionados, right? These are not the people who buy adt  Um, and the other thing is google's gonna get that data from them  We're all about that data  So it gets that demographic data, um and adt gets to appear  Like with it hip and with the times and addresses because they really had clunky old yucky equipment that nobody really cares for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um without a deal like this would adt have gone out of business eventually because it just was so old and clunky

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, well maybe but adt the stat in the story was like 80 percent of its revenue is recurring revenue from people  So they really had no reason to care  they're just like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does adt lean more on the enterprise side of things?  No, no, they're very consumer, you know those little home. No, no, they're super consumer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I wasn't sure those stickers uh grandma's house, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you see those everywhere  But I think i'm seeing more and more of the the rings and whys the all the other security cams

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what in adt was like nowadays. They saw I mean they saw this coming adt actually in 2013  Invested in a company called sawing off to help like make it smarter and get into that space and they failed  um  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what the sad thing is though?  with with that said  That ain't stopping people  People are still walking up. They see your camera and like hey, i'm gonna just check and see what's in your car right now  And literally wave at your camera, you know, it's  It's like does that even matter anymore the sign used to deter people back in the 90s

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you recommend for security these days ms iot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It depends on who you are. I mean I  Shouldn't say this. I don't have a security system because I don't think they're really worth the money  um  I think it I also live in a pretty safe place. That's the other thing. Yeah, I  If you've got like porch pirates, yeah, I recommend a doorbell camera tied to an alarm  All right, I really and there's some really cool things like vivint actually just introduced  I think this is actually really cool and this is all ai based basically, uh, they have a doorbell camera that's linked to  An alarm system and a light and they'll see if someone is at your door and it's not someone it recognizes  And they linger there for more than x number of seconds and you can set this up  Your doorbell will start going beep beep. It's like the car alarm effect, but  It's possibly a little bit more now that way. Wait, so so it's using facial recognition number one, right?  It is it's using image recognition on your face locally. So it only stores  Your family's faces locally and if it's not one of those  um  It actually may not this sounds mighty

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  unhospitable

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if someone gets up and brings your doorbell it's not gonna beep at them  But it's like if if I come up and I like try to take your package it will yell at me  Or if I like voider

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if you're and you don't have to turn that was on dropping the package off

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it that that person's dropping and going so it knows why I see so it's a matter of time. Oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That makes sense  Algorithm so my my 96 year old father if he tried to very slowly get up the stairs  It's gonna yell at him and give him a heart attack. Very nice. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have to turn it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi  And do you believe in sick? I don't want to make you reveal anything about your whole believe in security

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm sort of like what miss Stacy says I think there are a bit of a waste and let's um  Because most of the time by the time they go off it's too late  You know, they've already done the damage if you will  But it's nice to be able to try to minimize the damage. So there's that  but yeah for me, I definitely have the cameras around here just to keep an eye out on things because  There's a lot of homeless people that roam around and they've been quite curious  I've seen it with my own eyes and I've seen it on camera and um  Fortunately, it it hasn't been a bunch of times but it was enough times for me to you know notice it  We used to have a neighbor dog named kylo  Yeah, that helps that helps

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think a dog is probably more effective than a home security system

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, a cat however, it doesn't do jack

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That goes right out of the bed  That goes right out of the bed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but then well, I must give biscuit some credit too biscuit is the tiny one of the bunch but  A biscuit hears anything and he's barking which can be annoying  But at three in the morning when I hear him barking, it's usually for a reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because he he protects you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he stole my  Adirondack chairs off of my porch in one of my houses  Like an old house not not I don't have more than one house but like older house  And my dog slept through the whole thing. I walked out on the front porch and I was like  What happened and then I was like, oh it must be this is this is my brain I was like  Oh, it must have been my dad. I was expecting him my parents to show up this morning  They must have gotten here early and he moved it to prank me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I walked around the house looking for the chairs because I was like surely they're here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's what the dog was thinking too. Oh, they're pulling that prank. All right, i'm just gonna sleep  Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, so we so we on big stories  Let's let's just take democracy to this level here you guys pick which one we want to talk about  We should probably talk about a few big stories here. We got  the elon report of the week  miscellaneous elon news  We've got uh trump and truth social and the problems there related  we have google and  Some controversy interesting controversy around  Uh whether political emails go to span  We have a little bit on january 6 and how that's been kind of made for the internet and we have instagram  Looking at young people's faces to figure out how old they are with technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which one of them man, they should not do that. This is where audits come from. Let's talk. I'm like i'm ready on instagram  Okay, fine. Go go go  This is an example of like  You know how I said like you could infer someone's pregnant they're inferring someone's age based on data and  When you're dealing with inference and that's really all I mean when people say ai they're basically saying yeah  We're gonna infer some we're gonna infer something about something based on what my computer thinks  and  Those things can be biased they can be wrong  Which is why we need audits as part of all of this and for a company. I mean for a company. It's less problematic. I mean  it just means that  You won't get on instagram, I guess but  Basically, these are stupid and you have to prove they work and right now  We do the opposite we throw them out into the world and you have to prove they don't work and that's not right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's I have I have asian friends particularly who constantly get told. Oh you you look so young  And get mistaken and get carted and so on more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yeah, there's that phrase black don't crack sir  I'll go ahead and say well, there's there's there's that too. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wasn't going there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and is only 21 and look at the career. He's already had it's amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, queen peru gets carded all the time really?  Yeah, she carded all the time and  Thinking instagram would get that right. No, no shot. No, no, especially not. No, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so yeah, did this did this trip your creepy alarms?  So I guess we should do a little more of the story. So instagram is contracted with a company  Uh, where is it now here? Oh christ I can't get it up  Uh, I forget this part of leo's job is to actually talk about the story. He's ready to get a few facts  Yeah, oh silly me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You gotta orient all of us because they not everyone reads the stories. Yeah, I know. I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Yeah, well fire me just fire me right now. You can take it. It's a it's already an anarchy  What are you can take over and it's fine. Wait, I we're not gonna fire you. It sounds like you're trying to abdicate

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will not be king so the company is called yoti y-o-t-i  It finds that it is less accurate for female faces and yes people with darker skin  And then for under 24s its estimates can be off by two and a half years  However, if the tool is making broad guess about a user's age its accuracy improves  One 2020 analysis of yoga v system by a third party nonprofit found that it was in 98.8 9% reliable and gets people's age  All right. So the point of this is larger. It's  And it goes to what you said earlier stacey, but but but the federal privacy regulations  Instagram says you have to be 13 to be on Instagram. What the hell could they do about it now?  We get pissed off. The kids are on social media. We get  Legislation regulation aimed at saying you're you're you're going after children and you're addicted them  So do they need to do desperate things like this is this is this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Instagram can't win in this. No, we're gonna get on a bitch and moan about them  Not having these types of measures in place. But yet when they're saying hey, we need to try to address this  There's not gonna be a  Proper way for them to do this. I don't I don't think there is  Because anybody can go in there and just put in the wrong information which is what all teenagers do anyway, which they do of course  Yeah, so it's I mean they're damned if they do damage. They don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, Stacey as a parent  Would you welcome this when your daughter was 12? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Know she um, I would not let my 12 year old be on Instagram

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's what I'm saying, would you would you have welcome this? Yeah, no her from being on Instagram. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Feel like with a 12 year old you probably have enough control over their devices still to not have to  Rely on something like this at 15 or so it becomes a little bit more problematic. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  concur

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really tough like I  Mean I want to say that people probably should be slightly more active parents at that age, but oh, oh, oh, wait a minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go step on some toes there miss Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm like is that fair because there are some devious children running around out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree with you 100% but every time I've met I've said that same statement people have come at me hard  I know you're a better parent and I'm like, no, I'm not thinking I'm the better parent, but I'm thinking most parents  Especially people in my age group are pretty crap-tastic parents and we just don't do a good job of managing and handling our

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  kids, you know, I  Think I think we have to be more proactive with technology. I won't say you're a crap parent  I'll just say I think as parents we have to be more proactive. Yeah with technology and that's hard and it sucks, but  We kind of have to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's awesome that  That are these kids are quote-unquote smarter these days and can figure out a lot of the tech that's available to them, but  At the same time they're a little bit too smart for their own good  And that's when the parents have to step in and like you said be more proactive on this stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Back to our top story I can imagine  As zealous prosecutor demanding data on people under the age of 18 searching on abortion  Who or talking about or things like that? I can imagine, you know lots of ways without proper  care  This could use also look at the UK. They're gonna require age verification  to look at porn  You got to go to the pub and get certified that you're old enough. Oh, isn't that a bad enough?  You used to go to the Walgreens and say where are the count condoms?  You know now you gotta go to the pub and say well, I want to look at porn  Can you verify me?  So you can see how this is gonna get used elsewhere another way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think you could actually use something like that to normalize going to the pub to get age  Verified to be on the internet, which means then you could also look at porn  But you wouldn't be stigmatized because you'd be looking at Instagram as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if you look at it so Instagram could verify you to get look at porn I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm well now what I'm saying is you go someplace and you say hey  I'm gonna get a verification of my age from someplace. Maybe it's my  DMV so if your site requires me to be 16  So if more sites require someone to be a certain age to collect data on them, for example  Then you could say this person is 16 and here's the verification data that says that and then as they age up  Then they've already become verified and then they can become they can look at porn whenever it's appropriate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean the other the other issue here is for for like  Kids who are non-binary who are looking for a place?  it's you know the anonymity Jeff Kosseth who wrote the the key book on on  Section 230 also wrote the United States of anonymity, which is a new book, which is very good  And and you know as we often point out it's the it's the vulnerable in society  You need to be able to use anonymity and age verification  Cuts that right because you're verifying who you are and how old you are in one fell swoop

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that is true. All right. We'll put it on the blockchain and that'll solve everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, and you you mark one of the stories here in democracy day for Netflix I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not an I'm not an adage subscriber, but I was curious because we talked about Netflix  Couple months ago  Noticing how their numbers are sliding from the subscription side of things and then they mentioned. Okay. Well, maybe there should be an ad version of it  With them speaking with Google allegedly is this just to say hey Google. What are you doing?  Can we get a little bit of your secret sauce and put this into our platform or I?  Again, I'm not subscribed to adage that that's like this either. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should have found a different different link  But yeah, so they're talking to Netflix is talking to two companies and I forget who the other one is right now  But but primarily Google's of most interest as to whether Google can just get us in the ad business overnight  And so Netflix could say to Google you sell our ads you take all the stuff. What kind of revenue can you give us?  What kind of data can we give you about entertainment? It's a really interesting potential lash up there  Do you do you subscribe to Netflix Stacey? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do subscribe to Netflix and I actually subscribe to a bunch of places and I subscribe and pay more like on Hulu to avoid ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you wouldn't you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if I would just spend more money to avoid ads to avoid the ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You would but then there's also the other  Five people or so that are asking to use your username and password  Which is still not helping Netflix, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but Netflix is  Chomping down on those. What is the word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is just gonna be an exercise and translating Stacey's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lapse here. Do you really feel do you really feel a different Stacey? Do you really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought I was having a heart attack on Monday  I did a workout on Sunday and I was so sick afterwards and my  Doctor was like, okay, you should stop and now I'm I'm trying to be better. But my brain is totally  I'm having a lot of hard a lot of hard time with words. Oh god  You may be grateful that I'm not on the show for two weeks, but yeah, so I'm a Netflix subscriber  What did you ask?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're a subscriber and would you pay more in yeah, which is why and you're not a Netflix subscriber

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's why I am

Transcript:  But I'm thinking about it from the standpoint of  I'm thinking about it from the standpoint of YouTube because I'm a YouTube premium subscriber as well  Because you don't get ads on Netflix right now  So it doesn't cross my mind, but I think about every time that my card has expired on  YouTube and I go to and watch YouTube in these really annoying ads pop up and it really freaks me out  It's totally worth that extra  However much I pay a month. I don't even know how much I pay but it's totally worth that extra  Couple bucks to get rid of those ads all at the same time while making sure the creators are still being supported  I just wonder you know  Do people even think about it that way from the Netflix side of things because they never really saw ads to begin with  You know other than it was just their own house content that they were promoting

Ha ha ha I'm not following you. It was you know that kind of stuff for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  All right different story here. So I'm gonna pick this one. I'm fascinated by Google  and  campaign messages in spam  so a bunch of conservatives went after Google saying  that  Your your your  discriminating against us because we're right-wing you're putting our stuff in spam and God bless Mike Masnick the magnificent Mike  did a great story about this looking into it further and  finding that it was victory the same company that  Facebook hired to go after a tick-tock  And what Mike says is basically they're really bad at email and they tried to make an issue out of  Not being  Get their mail getting through for their client their Republican clients  So they made it into an issue because they like to complain that Silicon Valley is not fair to them  And so they went after that so then Google comes back and says oh, okay. We're gonna propose a policy  To keep campaign messages out of spam  Okay, then what happens then the Democrats say whoa if  If the other side sends a whole bunch of spam crap, they should be in spam and you just yeah  Kneel to them far too soon. You should hold on more  It's another example of they can't win

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing. Where do you draw the line on this?  Because I was a gym was the name Jim Norman Jim whatever his name  What's the guy Jim Jordan Jim Jordan?  I remember him seeing him on the screen fussing about this stuff and at the time I was thinking to myself  Well, maybe your email is just bad  But then again, this is this is a problem this could be a problem for everybody  Not just the Republicans in the right. This could be a problem. They should listen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They should listen to the users like right I mark  I can't tell you like I love Beto, but dear God his campaign sold my email to everybody  And their freaking dog or maybe was that blue? I don't know. Yeah  I they're now all spam all spam and if Google tries to take them out of spam, I will be pissed  Yeah, yeah, I think that's what so well, but I'll have you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I just received an invitation to the American people  Invitation to the official 2022 Republican Advisory Board  Sure, they want to hear the advice I have for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is definitely they're they're bringing you in to do something bad to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All I have to do is take a survey take the official survey  Yeah, I'm getting it from all over some somebody some some wag sign me up for Trump email long ago  Right and and thank goodness for Google it puts it into it doesn't put it in spam or there may be more in Spain  But it puts it in my what do you call it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Promotions or something other yeah, so I moved everything  Yeah, oh no, so my promotions are great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But at the same time there are some people that support those campaigns that wants to see  That can be well. I actively mark mine as spam

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, don't I mean so I feel like that's does it disappear then?  Well it goes into spam  I don't open my spam for you I said well obviously right well well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But when they go around when they go to the next  Trick or the next email address or the next candidate or the next whatever are you regularly marking things for spam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no really took a while  I don't say I've won yet, but yeah, I think so oh  Wow, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about you and do you get political spam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not as much as I used to thank goodness  Thank goodness oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get tons and you're right Stacey. I get it from candidates who have nothing to do with in places far far away  You know I've got to give to my own  Congressman's campaign which I haven't done yet, which I will do tonight. I don't remember do that tonight Tom Malinowski is a good guy  but  I'm getting from like, Nebraska. Why would I give their head in Nebraska?  You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Act blue is kind of if you ever donate through act blue. I think that's an issue  I'll be honest. How did you track it down? Did you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like this is what I do for a lot of stuff that I sign up for  If I'm signing up for service and it's asking for the email address because I have my domain I  Will call the email address service at antpruitt.com  And so when I see that pop up later on in spam, I just got check  Okay, this came to what email address? Okay, so service just sold my information and then I usually cut ties with them or whatever  Is that how you figured it out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  um  Like yeah signing up as Stacey plus blah blah blah plus, you know act blue edge email. Yeah. Yeah  So yes, basically creating a custom like an alias if you will  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's more details in the story. Go ahead Stacey. Oh you first go to God  No, I'm just gonna go into the details of the story. I want to hear the details

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if that change you know, I like details before I comment. I want to know what I'm talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is this is anarchy. We're reversing everything. It's upside down day. We do the blather first then the facts  So Google's plan which was first reported by Axios  Says the verge would allow candidates political party committees and leadership political action committees to apply for a special pilot program  That would make their messages exempt from Google's spam detection system  What's what's that's pretty much about this it is and the idea was proposed to the Federal Election Commission  In a June 21st filing asking for their approval. I don't know why they would have to approve this Google could make it a policy  I'm not sure  So the Google is making their quest to the FEC  Greg's doyb st. Eubee Republican, Florida. I have no idea pronounce his name  Was the first Republican to suggest the GOP campaign emails were wrongly flagged as spam  My parents have a Gmail account aren't getting my campaign emails. He told  Sundar Pichai during a high-level executive meeting  This is just raised once again  Exactly  After a North Carolina University study found that Gmail was more likely to mark Republican emails as spam  Well because they send out 20 times more  That's why oh  I will be based on what I get it's they're just  Constantly especially Trump the Trump stuff is just funny. You were getting the Eric Trump stuff  It was it was hilarious for a while there you've been selected  You could go to a golf around a golf with dad  There's only five right now. I wanted to by the way, I wanted on Twitter. I wanted to go  This is a quick January 6th moment I wanted to get there believe it or not there are Heinz adult ketchup costumes I  Wanted to get a ketchup costume and and go march in front of Trump's golf course, which is five miles away from me  I thought that would be amusing  Wouldn't be one of my proudest moments in life  But be in a ketchup costume  Do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you'd have a Halloween costume my professor

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Drove yeah, yeah, no, but I like the idea. It was funny. So anyway, so then the Democrats are saying no Google  You're buying them hit the hook line and sicker. They're just whining you're doing this. You shouldn't do this  So Stacey what I'm hearing from you is if you end up getting the spam you've you've got rid of back in your email  You're gonna be pissed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Super pissed. I worked really hard to mark a lot of stuff a spam

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's where that story stands alright and or Stacy knows Stacy's turn so  You can pick another one of what you've already marked or I can pick one of the ones you've marked it's up to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I really feel like I don't know what anyone was thinking when they thought this would be a good idea, but sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so like  From an AI perspective saying you give me a minute of someone's voice and I'll get the pro is it prosody  Is that prosody prosody the word?  Prosody the intonation and all of that correct and be able to like figure that out just based on a minute long segment is pretty  Freaking cool. So I get why they were like, oh, this is exciting. We could make Samuel L. Jackson in only a minute  But the idea of having your dead relative speak to you is kind of  Everyone was like and I wrote about this because I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Exactly. It's brendon car. It's brendon car strikes again  Um one and mike bastix go on berserk on it  Um wants to tell google and face and apple to remove tiktok because it's addictive to children

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's addictive to adults

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it is on plus plus data. No, I thought it was data. No, no, you're right. Yeah, I was like data practices. That's a different story  Okay, I I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought he was doing it because of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the the the talk there was the perfect it was a bus feed did the story about  Listening to 80 hours of tiktok executives talking about data gathering  Yes  So that was that was the complaint is that tiktok's actually  Gathering all this data, but facebook and google are also gathering all this data. They just happen to be us companies. So and you know  I'm i'm shrugging on that if it were because it was addictive to children then i'd say sure go ahead. Let's let's talk about how  Let's do a big conversation about dark patterns on the web  but  I don't think that's what we're about to do. So  So that was a different story and it would be the ftc not the fcc. He has no jurisdiction on this. That's true. That's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the story I confused is that california  Uh is talking about this is this is line 104 which you already had on as if we talked about it  Um  They could face civil liability of held to addict children in california meta and tiktok

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you define?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eggs addiction. How do you find? Yeah addiction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, and what if they read books all the time are they addicted to books?  This was the fear. I you know, I got a gutenberg moment. I gotta have one. It's my show today. Um  I'll find a few uh  Shwerp  um  so  People feared that children were going to be addicted to books  The women were going to be addicted to fiction that was going to ruin their morals  It's sorry is get ready get ready. Get by your button. Get ready. It is a classic  moral panic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well done. Well done. Well, you were warned. I am addicted to fiction and books. Yeah, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, it's a choice we make  um  And so it's it's the demonizing of it  So so to step in and say that you're gonna sue the companies because they're addicting children is just using children to me  It just strikes me that way. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again if we want to talk about dark patterns and things that help get children addicted let's do it but  I I don't see that happening in  Everything else is just stupid politics stupid politics

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, it is it is well speaking of stupid politics i'm going to go down i'm going to steal one of my numbers for myself  um  All the way down in my numbers. Uh, jimmy b you'll see uh a story about offcom which is the british regulator that is soon going to be  regulating based on  the uk's  Harmful content law which is going to be enforced by the end of the year and offcom regularly does  Surveys of the world of online and so they did one and I dug into it at some length and what was fascinating to me  um  So they asked people about 20 potential harms encountered in the past four weeks. So number one 27 percent  Scams fraud and phishing. Yes. I also get that on my phone. I get the mail. I get that everywhere  Then number two is misinformation. Well, should we try to define that?  What do you call misinformation number three was offensive or bad language  bad language  I could I could get jammer be nervous right now by using a few words, but I won't  You know that's that's seen as a harm  uh using  the s word, uh  Or bs is a harm  I forgot what the s word was weren't you? I've tried to remember my child what's came home and said that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were probably like six years old and they're like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said the s word at school today. I was like, holy cow. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Holy yes, they said survey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said stupid and I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's bad. That's bad. Yeah  Um unwelcome fellow friend requests you ignore them. What's the harm?  So then it does things that are harmful in fact or another one is content as content encouraging gambling  Um, that's legal in the uk and every single most major newspapers make money off of it by encouraging gambling  Now there's things that are serious here, right? Trolling  hateful discriminatory content against against groups depicting violence. Well, that's entertainment, um,  Uh content that objectifies to means or otherwise negatively portrays women  So I'm not saying there's not serious stuff here  But you're getting when you get down to that you're getting down to eight percent of the people said that was a problem  So then you look and say well how many people complained 15 percent were really bothered  Then you say  Then i've come to its credit  Asked people  About the positive end of the internet. I was I was impressed with that, right?  So the statement being online has a overall positive effect on my mental health  only 14 percent disagreed with that  so the fast half  British those people are doom scrolling in the afternoon, but they're not they're saying it's it's it's it's most people say yes  It has a positive effect on my mental health then. How about this? Well, how about addiction?  We just talked about people on twitter  Well, actually there is part of that in the survey, but I don't have that in my post answer  You gotta ask the question. I don't have the answer to thanks a lot. Thanks a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good job, aunt. But I mean look 14 percent. I know a lot of people this is  Yeah, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For only 14 percent disagree the rest say it has a positive effect on my mental health  Then how about the statement people that's fine with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And again if I open twitter right now, which i've i've had to slow down a bit on it the last week and a half  Or so there's so much  anger and hate rightfully so  There's no way I would have assumed  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  80 86 percent was like yeah my mental health's great right now. Well, it's actually about half half here  It's so small. I can't see 40 strong. It's uh  Max nix doesn't matter  but  uh 33 plus 10 43 percent said  Yes  It has a positive effect on my mental health. Next one is the statement  I feel I have a good balance between my online and offline life. Oh, yeah people just cannot get rid of this stuff, right?  74 said yes, I have a fine balance. Thank you very much  They're liars

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh aunt I have a good balance between my online and offline life. They are lying too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can share opinions and have a voice  44 agree with that. I feel more free to be myself online a third agree almost a fifth disagree  um  All right, many people self online jeff  I feel  I feel free to be myself online

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, what else do I do? Geez aunt? Do you feel free to be yourself online? Oh, yeah, I definitely feel free

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh people don't agree with it, but I definitely feel stacy. We don't know the real you then

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know a I mean, you know an accurate and authentic version of me, but you do not know  Me me I would never I would never bring my whole self to the internet  Okay, aunt aunt you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's a spy  I  The covid is making her admit it again and again and again, but she's a spy she's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a fake stacy. We see  If miss stacy is saying, you know  I share a lot but i'm not going to share everything then yeah, that's me  You know, i'm not telling the whole internet my whole private life. No, but for the most part  Well, they're they're definitely standpoint you get me, you know from a personality standpoint, you're going to get ant prud

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So then  The question is do people feel like they're they're they're overwhelmed by the internet  How much confidence do they have as an internet user?  Right, so they were asked do you do you have conf overall confidence as an internet user?  79 call themselves very or fairly confident as internet users only eight percent said not so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about um advertising guy every saturday and sunday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they are leo's audience and let's not make fun of them  um  So then all about online advertising. Are you confident you can recognize online advertising 78 percent said yes, seven percent said no  Well data data is a problem, right?  Surely they feel they've lost control of that a majority 58 percent said they are confident managing their data  18 said no  Uh news  Um, do you feel confident judging the truthfulness of online information 69 percent said yes nine percent said feel otherwise

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So then we get my father doesn't believe in the election that that biden actually won the election  But he's also confident his ability to he's confident that he's got it right. Yeah exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um  So but here's the interesting thing to me  Then it comes around all that is asking about you uk citizen  How do you feel about you or the internet people feel pretty good about themselves the internet?  It's useful they feel in control. They're confident then they asked about the others  um  Agreement with the statement that internet users must be protected from seeing inappropriate or offensive content  Well there the third person effect comes in because most people say oh, yeah, they need help. I'm fine  But they need help which is the third person effect which is i'm okay  But but surely we've got to regulate for others what this says basically is this becomes the basis for  regulation  Is well i'm okay  But well you we got to do something about everybody else and I was fascinated by this because the off-comers data and i'm right  And i'm i'm reading it in a snarky way because that's me  Because I feel okay to be myself online and I am snarky  Saying that there isn't this crying demand from the citizen who's saying i'm overwhelmed  We're being screwed up. You've got to do something. You've got to regulate the internet for us. Most people said, yeah, i'm fine. I'm fine. Okay  I found that fascinating but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is again  But what i'm seeing is my view of the internet and I have to forget that you know  The the internet is fast. I have to remember that the internet is fast. It's not just my view

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So true everybody sees a different internet. Absolutely. Everybody sees a different internet  All right, we should go back to our friend leo  Over to you leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, I just want to interrupt briefly to tell you about something. I'm very familiar with hacker rank now  I'm not looking for work. Although a lot of people looking a lot of coders looking for work go to hacker rank  Employers looking for the best technical talent go to hacker rank  I just like hacker rank because I like I take the puzzles and get ranked and all that stuff and that's a lot of fun  Let me tell you if you're doing technical interviews, especially nowadays  With remote work work from home a lot of those interviews  Uh are over the phone over a conference call, right? You're gonna love hacker ranks new  IDE for technical interviews  It's yes. It's an integrated development environment  Designed to take all the fuss out of a technical interview. In fact, you might like it so much  You just do them all this way from now on no more in-person interviews. It comes with 2,500 questions  Premade for every possible skill and skill level so you don't have to think up new problems to give your your  interviewees you can use their custom  Library, there's a code playback feature  Sometimes, you know you you give them a code problem and they're fast and they're talking fast this way  You can slow it down. You can play it back. You can see how they they're approached  You can score them on the skill levels as you're watching. There's also a whiteboard  That's one thing that's missing now whether we're doing these remotely  But now you have a shared whiteboard so you can problem solve together and you can see how how your candidate solves problems  This is so much better  Than the old way of doing this. I don't think you're gonna do in-person interviews anymore  Reboot your technical interview process with hacker rank click  Interview done you could start using hacker rank free right now  See how much better a technical interview can be  Reboot your technical interviews with hacker ranks easy to use tools again the pre-made question library. That's a boom  That's fantastic and they're always adding new questions to it. So it stays fresh. You've got code playback  So, you know, it's like instant replay if you're watching somebody go. What did he just do there?  You can instant replay it the built-in whiteboard for collaboration. You'll be conducting better technical interviews  Instantly identifying the right talent the best talent is already there at hacker rank  This is a this is just a no-brainer hacker rank comm  Twig to start a better tech interview for free today hacker rank dot-com  Slash twig we thank him so much for supporting this week in Google hacker rank comm slash twig and now back to twig

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Leo, and I'm still worried that Leo doesn't know where he is. Do we know where Leo is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That dude he knows his schedule. Remember how you remember last week?  He thought it was Tuesday while we were doing the show. He's never done twig on a Tuesday. So why would he expect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why would we all right? I know but he said he's a nobody said he's on the boat. I don't know. That's Leo was confused

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you seen the monkey? I guess it does look like a boat cabin on the inside, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So at you mark the story that I found interesting to Google looks to reduce pushback bias in developers software code review  I didn't  I'm not a coder. I didn't really understand that there's anonymous or there's there's there's software review where people judge your stuff and  that they're finding that  When people know it's black Latinx Asian women face more code pushback  Than white male engineers and as a result it costs more money to go back and  And deal with all of these reviews. So there's thinking of switching to anonymous review  I found that  Interesting to say the least I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Saw that and I guess I was a bit naive. I  Assume that a code review was was code review  You know, I've been in at what is what is it called the s DLC software development lifecycle  Where the developers they put their code in place and so forth and they have to test it out  and then it goes through a code review from one of their peers and  Well, not one of the peers a group of their peers to make sure things are right  And there's a lot of back and forth on that  so I just assumed that it's the situation where everybody's on the same team and has the same goal of we want to get this this  product out and  Successful and bug free. Of course, it's never going to be bug free, but everything is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, everything is politics. Everything's politics the numbers of the story. I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Had no idea that it was like that and I totally  Commit sense when you know it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so the numbers are this they found that at Google  Women face 21% higher odds of pushback than the men during code review black developers  54% higher than white developers Latin X 15% higher  Asian 42% higher given a high  population of Asian developers  This is shocking  I'm not surprised once I know it  It's everywhere it's everywhere I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was totally naive I would have never guessed it  But but again, that's me looking at looking at the world to my own view because of the situations  I've been in and in those in those  Different offices and departments it was it was a legit team effort. Just like if I were playing you didn't feel you saw

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not gonna want to say see what about it from editing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From editing. I definitely feel you got treated differently  Yes, sometimes. I mean it depends on the editor. But yeah, sure  yeah, I mean and I also got treated differently when I was editing someone and  How they would react to my edits, oh yeah, yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what Google's thinking of doing is switching to an anonymous system and I'm not really an academic right? I'm opposed to Europe a faker  I'm just a journalism professor  But my new book coming out good more parenthesis is being put up by an academic press  So it was sent out for review and I was nervous as hell what was gonna happen and it was sent out to I didn't  Know who was sent back to I got a note back which was which was helpful  it was it was supportive but also critical in some areas and I deserve the criticism in those areas and I've  Changed the book as a result and then interestingly the reviewer decided to out himself  and somebody I respect her greatly I knew of and  He did that I thought was a very generous act because then that allowed me to have a conversation with him about the book and  ask questions and greater detail and  And so but if I always hear the academe you always hear the joke about reviewer number two the reviewer number two basically  Is going to tell you that you didn't cite my book  So I'm gonna you know, but I'm not saying it's my book because I'm anonymous  But I'm gonna tear you over the coals because you didn't take my book  and so anonymity has its political issues too  But I think this makes perfect sense given the data here that jeez they should switch to anonymous Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's possible depending I mean like as an editor like or as a writer and as an editor really knowing whose work  I was editing or whose work I was who was editing my work. I  Could I mean I'm not gonna lie when I was at fortune  Some of my editors had no freaking clue about what I was writing about and you know  I tried to explain it and I would always try to take their like oh  I clearly did not explain this well  But you know, there were some things that I was just like oh god, you don't know what you're talking about  Okay. Yeah  and I would I I could easily figure that out based on who was  Editing me I and I don't know if that's good or not now that I think about it  I'm like maybe might would have been a better writer if I had just said clearly I'm not making my point across to everyone  But can you I don't know I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have become editorially feral  Blogging did it to me, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't I don't want to imagine when you were not feral when you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, in fact, I'm nervous about the book because I almost wish there were another reviewer because I because it's a big project  And I don't want to screw up and so I want that that that backup  But yeah when it comes to just basic I have pulled magazine pieces because they butchered them and I said no  I'm not doing it. Just not doing it. I'm too old now  Bye  I'm then I go meow under a porch somewhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I've I've are I'll argue with people  But I'm typically like I love editing. I love my editors  I think they're the best people on the planet most of the time so but you've had some better tell me you've had some bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  editors  Go you know but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But looking at code review versus you all in your yeah writing  That code is either gonna run or it ain't and if it does run can it run more efficiently if you have  Specific calls and stuff like that  That's why I was so that's why I was so naive to all of this because I figure you know when the  Review comes in and the reviewer reviewing team says you know what?  Maybe you should look at this function or maybe you should look at this call whatever  I figure that's just for the better of the of the team. I would have never assumed this was gosh this  Woman doesn't know what she's talking about. Look at this. She doesn't understand inheritance and whatever you know  I would have never thought that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But would you would it matter if like someone was in expert in go versus?  Erlang or Java or you know like that's when the who might matter in a code review  But I don't really know if you're just saying hey does it work or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't yeah, I don't know maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello experts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which we are not any well exactly  Leo as a coder would be able to say better  Yeah, I guess one of the issues does it run or not is key  Is it efficient and elegant or not efficient or not as a key if the issue elegance is a whole nother thing  Yeah, right. Oh, that's bad. That's better code  documentation  Yeah, I think I  Sympathize with you aunt that would seem to be these are more  Rational things which is why again the data bias is never surprising but bias in this area at that level  is kind of surprising just because  It's people going after people, you know technologies of anything when I worked at time Inc. We  Had fights over what what editorial systems to buy and I was in the middle of those fights  And I was I was always amazed how people could could could  Spend political capital over something so boring as what computer we wrote on  But people just get they use any opportunity to to be over somebody else  And use power in that way and it comes out in all kinds of weird ways like technology  so  Stacy you mentioned a story earlier that you then ood and decided to do a different story  But I'm I'm I'm curious about this one this story about  Google telling you how much  Carbon footprint you have in your workspace. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is if this is basically more of you remember how Google was like hey world  we're gonna show you the most efficient way like in Maps or  Give you when you do when you Google for flight information will show you the most carbon  Neutral carbon efficient the one that uses the least amount that emits the least amount of carbon dioxide into the air  We'll show you those and rank those for you  They're starting to take that to cloud computing workloads  So you can actually in workspace if you have a Google account and a Google Cloud account  You can build your jobs in assess how carbon neutral or carbon  How much carbon they emit that's really what they're doing. So here's my question about this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead. No, go ahead. You give your examples first. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was it could be things like hey, where is this located?  Where where is the data center located? How efficient are the servers in that data center?  It I don't know if it looks at your code or not. I thought it might  So so those are the kind of things that's looking for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here's what got me about this if isn't that really a matter of Google rather than the user in other words if Google  used 100%  Renewable energy then this wouldn't be an issue. It's an issue because Google doesn't yet use 100% renewable energy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, go go can't use a hundred percent renewable energy everywhere  Because we don't have that so even in its most renewable friendly places  It's still like if you're computing something if it's a workload that's happening in the middle of the night  And there's no solar power then it's not running on renewables  So and then there's always  Decisions on so it may be like what time can this workload run only during the day maybe  you know, so it's basically just trying to make a lot of that more transparent and  This is a little bit greenwashing. I'll be honest, but we're also seeing  With the ESG goals of companies being reported to the SEC just more attention on this overall  The entire accountability industry we're starting to see a lot of things happen around that and it's really fascinating  So this is an effort from Google will probably see similar efforts from other cloud providers and we're seeing it all over the place  and I think it's  Kind of cool because we're starting to  Externalize some of the costs associated with things that are not just based on like ROI. So not just  Like the cash outlays and inlays, right? We're starting to think about how this affects  The environment so it's kind of positive. It's greenwashing, but it's also a little bit positive  Okay, but it should but but but at some level the big decisions here are not the users the big decisions are Google's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're gonna have the most impact but if Google can tempt you to do a more like more efficient code

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They should like a power company. You're right. Okay  Yeah, or hey, what if you ran this over here, it's a much cleaner data center, I mean some places they have  not great data centers because  They don't have like that's the closest they can get and that's what they could get, you know, like  You can't just pop a date  It's not easy to build a whole new data center somewhere because they consume a ton of power. They require lots of water and resources  So sometimes you just got to work with what you have  Oh, here's a whole thing on Google's  Let's see. Oh, they say they have a hundred percent renewable energy for all cloud regions. Look at that. Well, that's what I thought  So how I don't understand  I'm confused again. I don't believe them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, maybe that's what it is  I don't believe you Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, maybe that's what it is I don't believe you Google let's see  Do you find anything in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it's oh this could just be a sales tool like don't host it yourself work with us. You'll save this much in carbon. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, I see. I thought it was much more well, never mind that I just gave them free publicity  Speaking of which it's a vote  Do we do a change log or not?  I like the change log do it is still google do all right. Let's hear the trumpets

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The google change log

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a confession I have  During the change log. I don't get any waffles, but I do kind of take a breath  I figure leo is going to go through it. He's going to explain it all to us and I don't pay a lot of attention  I don't I read everything most everything else in the rundown. I don't really pay attention to the change log  But today I have to pay attention to the damn change log and you just made me do it because it's a democracy  Okay. Sorry Jeff. I didn't know this was gonna hurt you  It does it does so good this one. I put this one in here  So I find this interesting so i'll start here google is paying the wikimedia foundation for better access to information  What the story is really about is wikimedia has created a an enterprise?  Version of itself that yes, you can scrape wikimedia. Yes, it's it's the license allows anybody to take it  You can make books out of it if you want you can do whatever you want  But now wikimedia is doing a premium version for companies if you want to get better access to their data  Then you can use this and it's a way for google to then say well, we don't pay for content  We're paying for the executive plan which and I think everybody wins here wikimedia something we love  Wikipedia something we love and they're getting  More resources as a result for being used even though it's free and you can use it for free you don't have to pay  But we're giving you a way you can if you want to which I think is smart  That's that way so that's the problem with the change log there's not really a lot of discussions kind of okay  Hangout sends in November. I am sad. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please just please continue. That's all you can do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You jumped ahead of the change log Stacey. You jumped ahead here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You jumped ahead here. Oh, we don't ever cover all the stories or go in order

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never don't that's true  Actually, you know what? I screwed up that one wasn't even in the change log. That was it wasn't in the change log, but it is now  I was like it's right there. It's mine 152. I was looking at the google section. All right  No now now chromebooks. Well, I care about this one too chromebooks in the new os 103  Which I tried to get today and I didn't I have all kinds of new neat features  Which because chromebook people even smarter than we already were  One screencasting officially arrives in chrome os 103  I didn't know it wasn't there before but that's fine. That's a nice thing to have  to  Use nearby share to get a chromebook  online  What does that mean? I don't even know  not sure  This is one for android users because it's not supported by ios. I think you could use it for your phone. Okay  Um recent phone photos appear on your chromebook  um  Which if you have the way my phone is set up my phone photos appear in google photos  Anyway, so they do appear on the chromebooks. I'm confused there but fine  Zip file extraction works as it does on other operating systems good, but nobody should use zip anymore  Why does anybody use it anymore? I hate zip

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not use it? So that's yeah, why not use it? Is it just because you hate it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just because I hate it because we're just some of the files i'll pick the files  I've got to break it up into the files and i gotta figure out where they are and all that just some of the files  This sounds like a biased code review

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm like what is happening here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I don't I don't like zip zip is zip is so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can't do you don't want to talk about fuchsia being on the nest hub max after all the time we spent speculating on fuchsia

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it actually exists as a as an operating system talk about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we knew it was I mean we knew they were making it and we knew it was kind of for things is what we figured out  It's for running on all kinds of things a wide variety of computing platforms, which is important for iot  And now they're making it available for people on the nest hub max if you want to use it  So  people had  You your first gen nest hub is probably running on fuchsia today  and now  You can now put it on your nest hub max if you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What will it enable you to do that you wouldn't otherwise have been able to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No one knows  It's an operating system so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the use for future going to be why are they doing it?  Does this so you can build easily so you can build software?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So an operating system sits on your hardware and ties your software. That's like your applications  It lets them it's an abstraction layer. So all kinds of applications can run on the hardware, right?  And make use of the hardware resources a computer has available to you. So fuchsia is  Normally you build uh  An operating system for like phones only right?  that's or computers only is what historically what we've done or  Weird embedded devices only and so what's happening is you want things to run on a phone or on a computer or on a thermostat?  or on a display  Or on a smart tv and so fuchsia is designed to be an operating system that can span all of those things  So you could build an app that could run on all of those things without you having to do like an android app or a  nest home hub app or  Chromecast app

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did that help yes, yes, thank you  So queen of iot  Uh, you're probably gonna say oh, this is this is stupid jeff. Why did you put this in here?  It's so passe. It's so mean this but i'm curious what you say about the finger bot on line 166

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But like if you have a popular use case would be like  A coffee machine so being able to set a timer for your coffee machine because a lot of people have coffee machines that you know  Even if you turn it on you have to press a button for it to actually go  So that would be useful for those people  Okay, they look stupid though for things like light switches. Oh my god  If you're going to do that, just pay the money and just install a connected light switch  But you know if you like your coffee machine or if you have like a cool bespoke kind of device then yeah, these make sense  All right.

I've had them. I had them in san francisco. I think they're fine  But I think that when I see veggie burger on a menu I want a black bean burger  I don't want a burger that thinks it's meat when it's not  If it says a veggie burger, I want to be a veggie burger

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they sell it. They're brave. They're like  No, they they tell you it's a black bean burger or they say it's an impossible burger or  They don't you you don't just no one puts a veggie burger and gives you like an impossible burger. It's hard to find

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well played  Um, so this is related to another story, which I found amusing. Uh,  The times called them accidental media critics of youtube, which is basically people saying that they're using youtube to criticize  They're not accidental. They're not media. They're just people on saying what they can say because he can now but the funny thing is they're going after  Uh, yes after gary vaynerchuk  Uh, because he's an easy target. He makes himself such an easy and I I know gary I like gary  But yeah, he's an easy target for criticism  because he's made himself into such a  Um  Bored ape character himself, right? It's just he's he's he's he's kind of a made-up human nft at this point  Um, so people are spending a whole hour  critiquing  Gary v online, which I i've got to watch now. I haven't watched it, but uh, I found that amusing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or again it's they have the platform with youtube it's free to do um, you got your voice  You can clearly have at it. That's the beauty and the sometimes sad part of the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They call vaynerchuk the youth pastor of capitalism, which is pretty funny too, I think oh that is hilarious, isn't it? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How come that's not on the insult table?  I respect um vaynerchuk. I can never say his last name. I respect that's why i never really  Totally signed off on the whole  Hustle don't sleep narrative, but I do believe in hustle. I do believe in putting in the work and grinding  I just hate the fact that  he seemed to be the person that originated the the message of  All of you people out there wanting to be be entrepreneurs need to work 80 hours a week  And don't sleep and end up having serious mental health problems because things aren't going the way you  You thought they would go and you know, it's I don't think that was right  and I don't know if he ever really changed that narrative about  hustle don't sleep, but  I couldn't totally sign off on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's other people  Before we got to youtube there there are all these people write sales books how to sell  And it's and it's and they just come up with those lines and you write down those lines  I think your life is changing i'm gonna be rich now and yeah, that's it's it's it's a genre of human beings  I loved this line in the new york times story because I want to make fun of it  Even in a world with no gatekeepers and limited moderation a certain savvy will assert itself  Like oh, yes, even if you don't work for the new york times, you can be savvy  All right, i'm getting grumpy now, I think it's probably time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you I think it's time for a cat showy pet babe. What do you think stacy stacy?  Right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, we're gonna do that but I think i'm we're heading into anything else here. I think we've done it all  We've done it all  Come back wherever you are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, I don't know we've been we've been doing this for two and a half hours  So it's you're not this is not like a sad show. We're not shirking. We're not shirking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have plowed through a lot of stories, sir. I mean, I think we've actually covered more stories than we would with leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We all did it together. Um, this is this is uh,  All right, so we're gonna and i'm gonna start with you  For your thing for the pic whatever of the week. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. Well, my first one is uh aero cart aero quartet this  Past weekend. Yeah, I think it was this weekend  I shot some video and went to pull it off of the the the ssd to put it on a computer so I could do  Processing and whatnot and the very last file on the card was corrupt  um  Just totally bizarre. I could see it when I dragged it to the computer. It showed that this thing was, you know  Umpteen gigs in size as it should have been but it would not play and I put it on my camera  And it would play on my camera. So i'm like something's really odd with this and I couldn't figure out  what to do and  The twit it guy gave me several suggestions to try. Mr. Burke gave me several suggestions to try  But I ended up stumbling upon this service aero quartet.com  And I think it's called treasure something other and they have this utility that allows you to to see if they can recover your  busted video files  Uh, you you upload it and if they can fix it they tell you yep  We can fix it if they can't they tell you they can't and they'll give you a quote to fix it and it was  I ended up having another solution  right after I  Found that but it was um, but I thought it was brilliant and I was like, oh this is great because a lot of those things  You'll buy the software and then end up  Uh, it still didn't work, you know because it was another problem. Did they give you a price?  Pardon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did they give you a price? What would the price have been? Yeah, they gave me a quote and for mine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would have been like 70 dollars something like that, which was totally worth it for what it for what the footage was  Um, but for example our very own. Mr. Steve gipson. He has that utility spin, right?  After speaking with him spin, right wouldn't have worked for me  It was just I would have paid for it and it wouldn't have done me any good  I still wouldn't have been able to get to my data  But this one here it was it was totally worth it and I didn't have to pay anything but  It's nice to know that they were like, hey if we can fix it  Yeah, we got you but if not, here's if we here's your quote and if not  You go on about your day. So I like that  And my next pick is Nikon. They announced a new camera  bright  Bright and early over there, but it was actually more like last night here  Uh, it's a new mirrorless camera an apsc crop sensor  Uh, it's the z30 or z30 depending on where you live. This is budget friendly  You can get it you can get the body and a kit lens I think is a 16 to 55 millimeter kit lens for  846 bucks. They're trying to push this towards the bloggers  Um, it's a guy I believe it's got a 20 megapixel  Sensor for still shoot 11 frames per second if you want to do somewhat high speed  Uh, but video you get up to 4k at 30 frames per second  So again because this budget you're not going to be able to get 4k 60 or 4k 120  But you can get hd in 120 frames per second if you want to do slow mo, so that's my other pick  good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  stacy

We can go back to the sandwich guy we did last week  All right, so here's my number  Google and meta are losing their dominant position in the digital ad market  The two companies will account for 50.5 percent of digital ad spending this year, which is huge  That will slip to 48.7 percent by 2023 and 47.7 by 2024  Because it has all kinds of new competitors  tiktok amazon walmart apple  They're all taking ad share. So it's not an oligopoly a duopoly anymore. Well, it is right now  But the track is down now mind you the ad business is going up  It's a 13.2 percent increase three hundred fifty nine nine billion dollars  Um, and I would think the ad market would be going down because people can have direct relationships through all these other platforms  And there's so much competition  Nonetheless, it's going up but the market share for the big guys is going down  And i'm thinking of doing this for dinner tonight, so there was a little local story  Uh guy fieri guy fieri  right diner is
