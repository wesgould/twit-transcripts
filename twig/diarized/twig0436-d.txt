Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I should I suppose I should do a partial disclosure here because we haven't announced anything yet  But it's very likely that news integrity initiative, which I started with money from Facebook Craig Newmark and the Ford Foundation full disclosure  is very likely to be working with data and society and Joan and  So Jonah I were at the same conference at Penn last week and in the bars  We'd have we've got everybody in the bar and had a few too many. She said I want to be on twig

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Come on Jarvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So a fan is here  Actually, she wants to be on twit but she's taking this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the first step. It's one. It's a few letters different. That's all one letter different and  This shows more fun. I think so Stacey Higginbotham's here from Stacey on iot.com  You've rearranged your your room or something something's different

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am in a completely different room in a completely different city. I am so observant

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What city are you in I am in Houston, Texas  With your as your parents. I am at my parents and Stacey. Would you like to do a Facebook disclaimer, too?  I don't use it  On  What was it was it on twit on Sunday we had Dan Gilmore who also did the Facebook disclosure  I'm starting to think everybody who's on this show is now working for the Facebook research

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I can I start for just a few words here, Mr. J  So and I thought I just did what I was about to apologize for because Stacey was about to say something  So last week, I just wanted to say I left the show upset because I was trying very very hard not to interrupt Stacey  I respect Stacey. I want to make sure I'm not you know an obnoxious man  I'm trying to do that and and I was doing like four times. I saw that I didn't know a poor technician  Blames his technology. It's not easy on this lag stuff, but I  Excuses aside I I did it. I apologize people came back to me on Twitter  They were right to do so and and I'm sorry and the repartee in the back and forth  I get caught up with it and and I wanted to make sure that that Stacey you knew that I apologized and that the audience  Did too it's never intentional  So I just want to start off with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Jeff, I was curious how many times did I interrupt you because I'm pretty sure we both got pretty excited

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We did we did and you know Stacey. That's the other thing about this. No, no, no, you're not, you know  You know darn it. I'm the one who could be sorry. Oh stop it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sorry because I'm supposed to prevent those things from happening. Let me say one thing before you go before you continue  Throwing yourself on the sword and grinding it in  That we just did a show where with Paul throughout Mary Jo Foley and the CMO of Microsoft and Paul and Mary Jo were so  careful not to  Jump in there where there's all these long pauses that made Chris very it was like  You what do you think?  Chris started to have to pick up the keep the conversation going I  We and you can ignore Twitter on this because I'll get I get for my whole career. I've gotten  Tweets from people saying you're interrupting you're interrupting  We trying to produce a show that's dynamic exciting engaging and it is not a politeness festival  It's a vigorous conversation. So as long as everybody feels heard  That would be my only desire  Now everybody's gonna be polite you see you ruined it Jeff. I won't be polite

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh  I've been on enough conference calls in my life to know that you  first

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I think everybody weep the people we have on the shows are strong enough personalities that I can count on them  I think I hope to assert themselves now. It's always  tricky with with somebody who's never been on before like jump you've listened enough, but  It's it is you Jeff's absolutely right. It's hard with Skype because there is lag. I don't mean to blame Skype

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hard and Stacy was was very gracious and I was very grateful. I needed your slap. I needed that on on Twitter  You know we get we're in the wrapper in the back and forth, you know, I gotta say this too I'm  I'm probably  Exasperated at being in the position of being the guy who defends the big evil company. You should be Jeff  So I get a little exasperated you should be chagrined  You should be nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jeff at some point today's not gonna be different from yesterday in that respect

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Watch it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's he knows he's on the hook for  defending some of some of this stuff and it's it's you know  It's a hard position to be in because I think we all I keep telling people I love the internet  But there are things that need to change and that doesn't mean that I'm not you know  Thinking about all of the different ways and means of communicating  it's just that we've kind of grind to ground ourselves into a into a halt here and are looking around and I think it's important to  reevaluate tech when we need to  in service of society, but it's also kind of cool to have cool things that are new and exciting and  Sometimes, you know, we got to figure out what the features are and what that what what matters about them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Jeff's I like Jeff's point of view because it is important that we not  be Luddites or or  indulgent techno panic, but I think Jeff we also understands that you know, sometimes you have to call out a technology  I mean not not all technology is benign. No, I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but  On like last week you were you were throwing Facebook completely over and calling it absolutely worthless and horrible  And so I'm in the position of saying well actually no, it's not it has some benefits  And so that's that's the dynamic which I think we played out a million times on the show, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  yeah, I've gotten more strident in this though because I'll be honest I  Increasingly aware of the real dangers that Facebook  poses our republic and  Our us as individuals and it's more than just you know  Revealing our the state of our bowels or our kidneys. It's it's really there's there's something going on here  Don't you think that is a little bit? I?  Think there's a risk. This is a see as Google and Facebook get more powerful  I think we have to really hold them to high standards. I have always been hard on Google, you know, because it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Confused content with search. I think we have to help them with those standards rather than just  Throwing them over the overboard. That's what I was trying to say last week  Is that I think that it's up it's incumbent upon us to be specific about the expectations of them rather than just say no  worthless well some things are worthless

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do we want to actually instead of general generalizing?  Do we want to argue and talk about specifics because I thought I actually thought of you Jeff with  Facebook's both the unfriending stuff, but you're not unfriending  Sorry muting and then the facial recognition stuff that they announced this week  So, I don't know. I don't know if we want to get into talking about specifics yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, let's start with the snooze button. Is that what you're talking about? The SNE is one of the things  Yep, so I actually like this you can mute anybody for 30 days  It's really we need better tools than I mean the problem is all of the tools Twitter and Facebook offers so far are sledgehammers  This is a little bit more subtle than just ignoring somebody forever  Didn't Twitter Twitter's got a snooze button, right?  Is it a snooze? I thought that's the problem. There are people I've

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Muted long since and I've long forgotten about them and they're probably still complaining about me

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know remember that like when CES is going on or you know, like Apple events

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can mute the tech community or Davos

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But do you do that by keyword Stacy? I can't remember how you do that, you know as a journalist

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never mute ongoing topics because it's my job. So I don't actually know right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I do feel like that's something Twitter has had and now Facebook has it but it's individual based  So you can say enough for that person for 30 days you like this  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cooling off period good

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I it's it's an interesting move. I think about it as something during the holidays  it's sometimes pretty hard to  Hear the same things over and over again or maybe there's a very new baby  you know, maybe I'm speaking like someone who's a little tired of certain kinds and types of posters, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's halfway to unfollow you don't want to unfollow them you say until they get used to having a baby

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can we just Joan Joan? Are you are you saying you don't like babies? Is that what you just said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Obviously, I would prefer cats

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm you the cat  Am you the babies? I meet the cats. I mean them all yeah human children. I it's okay, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  you know some people are a  Little too expressive and then also I think maybe snooze might also have something to do with people posting during  for instance like  political events or  You know  Maybe you've got someone in your timeline that's really into the Grammys and you see over and over and over again  Maybe it's good for spoiler alerts if you want to oh  snooze some people that are Jedi stories  Topics and not just people just people just people but you kind of if you know those people you kind of know who some of them are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know they are  Topics would be hard to do sure people are easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Engineering I don't know would it be hard you say here's anything with a keyword the last Jedi  Or Star Wars or Jedi. Yeah, I don't mind not seeing any Jedi posts. What is the hardship there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You might miss a cute Halloween costume

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I I would defend by the way myself and saying I don't think anybody needs Facebook  And I don't I think that they're whatever lasting benefit Facebook offers can be gotten in other ways  I don't think we have I don't think Facebook is a if if Facebook did not exist. We would not be compelled. You don't need poetry  Facebook is not poetry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but I'm sorry, but it serves it serves a purpose for some people just like poetry serves a purpose for some people, okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now let's talk about facial recognition

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Guys this is and we talked about this on Kevin and I did a segment on our show  So you know you're just gonna be bored if you hear I'm here my show tomorrow

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'll tell you the news is and this is Kurt Kurt Wagner and the recode the news is that  And this always been a problem people uploading pictures of you without tagging you and you don't know it's there  You might not like it  Facebook is now going to recognize the faces and uploads and let you know that somebody's uploaded a picture of you whether or not  They tag you is that that's that's it, right?  Yes, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and that's really exciting like as someone who like  If you were stalked for example  And you could get your picture off Facebook, even if your friends don't tag you that's gonna be great  But it does mean now that Facebook is very confident that it knows what most people look like  Even if they're not posting a lot, so I saw this and unfortunately right before it  I also read the USA Today story about  Surveillance the surveillance state and image recognition used in  By China in the areas to tamp down on the Uyghur  Rebellion and I don't know if you saw that story, but it was crazy scary. Yeah how and  And I thought you know if Facebook has this information and awesome image recognition  China is apparently developing this  what's to say that Facebook won't give this to people and they probably wouldn't but  We're just giving all of this data away and so many  Companies states are starting to have access to it and it's pretty freaking scary

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't have to assume though that face was gonna give it to a government to not like this idea  I mean Facebook now already  Facebook collects information about everything you put on Facebook and adds to that big database  But face recognition means they're gonna recognize everything about you from every source possible  But and here's the other thing that is actually even a big or late it back to you correlate back to you, right?  So this is without your participate I could leave Facebook  But now they know enough about what I look like that I'd still be dumping information into Facebook via other people they'd be putting my

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but you you know, the thing is this this capability is there no matter what they're just coming out with it  Yes, number two. So I got I got a drawing with somebody on on Facebook. I respect immensely  Roger Neruzetti who was a major media executive and he was  Decrying this you know as the creepy personality personality and I said no I said now you can know when someone's putting up a photo  Of yourself that you don't know this is good  And but it was I was in the exact same debate like we had last week is oh no Facebook bad  And I said imagine a different company did this and are you still gonna presume?  That it's bad and and and I don't think it is listen the technology can be misused. Yeah  Absolutely, but but that doesn't mean that it will be here. That doesn't mean that the use is bad. Here's my here's my problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeff  Facebook I don't trust Facebook and I've seen them do stuff in the past without letting us know by accident  Apologizing later. They have proven themselves in my opinion untrustworthy in this area, by the way when they ask now  Okay, in order for this to work. We have to grant Facebook permission to use facial recognition  They don't say specifically for this purpose. They say broadly across the service  You're giving them now  In order to enable this is it opt-in  Facebook changing its settings to make it easier for the company to add more facial recognition features down the line instead of ask  This is again Kurt instead of asking is it opt-in or opt-out?  Instead of asking users to give Facebook permission to use facial recognition for tagging purposes  Which is what the company has for now users will now be asked to grant Facebook  Permission to use facial recognition broadly across the service. That's what the end their excuse will be but we have to do that  Otherwise, we won't be able to see people post pictures of you  But they now will have permission to use it in many ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and so we're thinking of this with my sort of hat on here thinking about it  It's almost the signal that it's more  Accurate in in a much larger database and perhaps much more sinister in the sense that it's more accurate than  The current FBI database facial recognition software  And so I can see  Where we can hope for the best but also I imagine that in  The science fiction to come right the the future that's already here  They're not  Entirely, you know beholden to holding on to that data or not selling that data

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't even care because I don't trust Facebook with that data

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You Leo you don't have to fight me we're gonna fight  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, you don't but I'm just saying you don't have to presume that they're gonna give it to the government as I said

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Before the fact that Facebook has is bad enough. Well, this is what I'm trying to say is that they're not  It's not always that the data is going to be improperly used. It's that the data is there and there are lots and lots of people  Different different governments in a competitive space that are looking for this kind of data and looking for this kind of technology and  one thing that makes databases both  Hard to do is that you can't get the actual data into them. So we have force-fed this machine  So so many terabytes of data that it's it's very very powerful at this point  And we've put no restrictions on as a society as a country on what that could look like in terms of  selling mining  Federating data with other databases  I mean what makes data really interesting to me as a researcher is when we can link it up to other other forms of data  And so I wonder then if we're headed for a kind of circle situation, right?  Where it's so powerful that these are the things these end up being the tools we use to verify  Census or to verify identity with voting and and so when we build something so loud large and so powerful  And leave it in the hands of a corporation with no rules and restrictions  We are sort of setting ourselves up for some kind of a failure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Totally agree and I would add  That one of the challenges with facial recognition is there are cameras everywhere  this is passive data collection that you may or may not be aware of as a person and granted in Facebook it looks like you can  Opt in to have this but  Having such high quality facial recognition  software and  Being able to tie that back into a database forever and then correlate it with other things is  Basically giving someone a  an itinerary of where you've been forever and  You don't know who has access to it. You don't know what can be done with that. And if bad things happen, you have no recourse  so if you're if your employer suddenly decides  they want to you know get access to this data and it's the other thing to realize is  Facebook is really good at it  But it publishes a lot of papers explaining how it got really good at it and really what's standing between other  Companies and this type of facial recognition is just the ability to collect data  which just means access to cameras and so  We're entering a place where this is going to be  Technology available for everyone and we don't have any rules around how to use it much like what Joe missing. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we also need to account for the good things that can occur example I've used on the show often was the former head of  Consumer protection in Germany said that facial recognition and geotechnology was henceforth and her word taboo  Doesn't account for finding missing children for finding Alzheimer's patients for finding criminals and terrorists  There are other ways to do that without facial recognition  But but there is a way it is a way and it is a good use and so we have to be careful about not cutting off  The good use is because we fear a bad use and I don't think it's a this is the territory that we have done over a  million times on this show, but we're going to go back to the rabbit hole a  Counter example that's maybe a little bit closer to home. I call in sick to work and I go to a baseball game

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And someone in the crowd takes a picture of themselves, but I'm sitting behind them enjoying, you know  some popcorn or some peanuts and and  You know and then that kind of a picture ends up circulating online with my name tag to it and whatever rules that are on there  Now doesn't necessarily mean that I don't you know, maybe I forget three months out that I you know hadn't logged into Facebook  Oh, this is a funny picture  And then you know, there are all these other people looking as well, especially when you did something wrong  But it doesn't mean my boss. Oh my god  See if you don't do anything wrong, what do you have to fear?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is it, you know, they're the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Surprised  I'm surprised

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is it, you know, they're the  surprise  Freight in serious is protest policing. Yes, which is you have massive people that go out there is a better example. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They just walk from it's already happening. I mean the Trump administration is looking into people who protested his inauguration

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and something that we have to be cognizant of because also one of the Russian Facebook events  That was tied to those Russian accounts was a not my president protest that was target marketed to  people within 10 miles of New York and they collected a bucket of  Facebook profiles that was about 33,000 people. Yeah, right. So if you can imagine layering that also on to  Facial recognition you have a very powerful powerful tool for suppression. So then I would ask

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeff  Which is that more important that that we could have an Arab Spring with the help of Facebook by the way would have happened  Anyway, or that an Arab Spring could be suppressed with the help of Facebook  I would it I would submit that the grist much greater risk is I don't think it's binary

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think it's by the way, let me just let me just answer the question this way as  In privacy the far greater threat is not the company it is government  Well, it's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Individual corporations, I think we've already shown that there's a porous membrane between the two anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know and it's whoever has the power but I would say Jeff  instead of  Yes, technology is a tool and we can use it however we want for good or for ill  But we need to say we do need to have this discussion about where the risks are and it feels like you are  You are saying ah  Techno panic whenever we start discussing risks and offering up some good cases. I would say look at it like  Look at it like thalidomide. So the harms there were so great that they put so in in the benefits  Where they existed but they were very small  So they put a lot of rules and regulations around prescribing that particular drug  And I think facial recognition is something very similar in its potential to harm with maybe  fewer  benefits so I  Think how and we have the time and space to have those nuanced conversations. So I think we totally should I do think

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, go ahead I just think it's ironic that we're having that we're  Go ahead go ahead Jeff. I I don't want to interrupt because you have a nice flow going and then I'll bring up the irony

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  After you know after you Stacy we're agreeing what I'm hearing from the two of you is from SLEO last week  It was throw out Facebook, right and that's what I'm objecting to  And and and I fear and you didn't say this today, but I've heard this from others is basically my god facial recognition bad  Stop it. No, it's good. Do we need discussion about the dangers? Absolutely  Do we also need discussions about the opportunities to protecting them? Yes. Do we need a sane discussion about?  Standards and or regulations. Yes, I'm fine with that. What I hear too often is to throw out the technology and  That's what I'm decrying. That's it. So we're green

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would say throughout the technology  Whole hog. I'm sorry. Yeah Facebook. I would throw I'm starting to become very concerned seriously concerned about Facebook's motives and abilities and  The dangers of Facebook and the irony I think here is that Facebook is proposing well  We'll do this face recognition to solve a problem that Facebook created  Which is the ability for strangers to upload pictures of you to Facebook and then we're all  Hailing this is oh good. Now you could stop that  But Facebook created the problem in the first place

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, don't forget what Google can do with your photos Google can find you through the ages and find your kids and we say  Oh, that's cool  It's not just Facebook it's it's listen you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Facebook it's yeah, it's China. It's Russia Russia, by the way, you got to include in that group is absolutely using face recognition to suppress its people  But I I don't think  It's like saying well, you know, we got baby Ruth candy bars. Aren't they great?  Yeah, but they're gonna kill you if you keep eating them. Yeah, but they're great. I  Don't I think Facebook is in that level of  Amusement and entertaining. I don't think it is a very valuable

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Policy really I'll quote I'll put Jonah  Unfair position and quote her boss and probably wrongly but but Facebook aside  the fact that people can find each other and  Realize they're not alone in the world and do things has value. It depends on how you use it  Obviously, of course every tool does it's disconnecting. No, it's not natural ways. We do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh who says that's tribal local society. That's natural. That is natural. That's how it's been forever  It's in creating this new digital pseudo connection

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well how it was forever is that everybody knew your business everybody knew your business. Yes notion of privacy is very

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree. I'm not it's not the privacy thing. I'm worried about is the very  I don't want to use evil but it's the very malignant  Power that Facebook has and has and I can't I have to say has used and this year has been a very good example  Of how Facebook has been misused and I don't think that the benefit we get from Facebook this pseudo connection is  In any way worth it. I don't you all people are connected  Well people have always connected that and if anything Facebook's turning us off to the benign  Valuable real-world connections for these pseudo connections. I don't like my neighbors

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the people on Facebook my rest my case my neighbors aren't very nice actually rest my summer tomorrow

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  None of those people on Facebook are nice either. You just don't it's a you don't have a real connection with oh  You don't have to share a fence with them. No  No, I agree with you privacy I'm not I'm not arguing about privacy I'm arguing about them  About the danger yeah, maybe I mean but you like you I'm very open. I'm not that private  I'm worried much more about about how would it put a power tool Facebook can be and I don't trust them  I really don't trust them. That's really the bottom line

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, but without all this wonderful technology  You couldn't have Google double reverse  Christmas carols

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He said changing the damning subject, let's take a break and we'll come back with more. Hey Joe  We're glad to have you here and jump in  It's our it's kind of funny that Jeff brought reinforcements in in our attack on him. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think my microphone might be having some trouble. I hear you good. Yeah  Yeah, no, um, yeah. No, you should take a break. You might have been muted earlier, but you're okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, you know Joan Donovan is here. She is a researcher  at is it safe to say Dana Boyd's data in society or

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's usually just data in society. It's actually a pretty big wheelhouse  so Dana is the founder but she has built quite a large network of researchers that span the globe at this point and so  There's about 50 of us that work in-house and then we've got  you know quite a web of affiliates and  yeah, and so she's she's put together quite a motley crew of people that are very very committed to doing research and are  either academics alt academics or have had careers as technologists and so there's  It's a quite an interdisciplinary

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Research Institute. Well, and it's one of the reasons we're having the conversation we're having right now  This is right as you said in your wheelhouse  We're so glad that we can have her. She's a Joan  Donovan is a media manipulation research lead  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all the fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis professor of journalism, you know Jeff City University, New York guy. No, no, he's he's not change  You're red. Get minute  He's our red from buzz machine calm at Jeff.

We thank rocket mortgage by quicken loans for their support rocket mortgage  comm slash  Twig alright, let's change the subject. We're getting Jeff down. I don't want to get Jeff down. Did you see this great article?  Google Maps moat  This is from Justin oh  Baby, is that his real name? I don't know  This is the  Justin obey me this is a comparison  But of Google Maps and Apple Maps, but also ways and other maps and it's very obvious in this first  Animated image Apple Maps has no building information Google seems to have the outlines of all the buildings  It's even better than that. It's not just in big cities  It's in that ways doesn't have it Bing doesn't have it here doesn't have it Tom Tom doesn't have it open street map Mac box  None of them have it. You know why?  Google's got all that great satellite information  That tells them and that's what they're doing. They're using again machine learning  To figure out where things are this is I love the animated Gipsy puts in this article  Look at here's parks. They actually have the park shelters in the park. They have trailers and you can see that they're trailers  They if you look at this 3d outline on Google Maps of a church you can actually see the steps  Not just the building. It's the front steps  You could see the cupola the cupola on a post office  Can't you also buy satellite data like this? Yeah, I don't know why Apple doesn't have it. That's really interesting  It's not is it necessary is it Google just showing off what we know does it have it's Google certainly has the computational ability to do this  Yeah, and one of the things Justin obey me is pointing out is I hope that's his name is boys of  OBE I are in the URL shoot Oh burn or beer. I was I was leading the R&D M hoping it was  Obey me I guess it's over  No, it wasn't a joke I really got it accidentally leading the RNN to make an M  But it's even small towns he says even my tiny little town here's a town of 100 they have  Smitty's bar it goes farther than that. No, I think some of this is just really good AI. I mean Google's really willing to apply their AI  To stuff, you know, so they're using the satellite images, but then they're also figuring out as we scroll down  Where the commerce corridors are where the interesting neighborhoods are they're actually because they have so so much information about  the businesses in an area  They and apparently he says he thinks it's bars  Restaurants, they're looking at the kinds of businesses and saying oh, this is a neighborhood  This is a you know an area of interest they can even say look they could see the bay windows they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, is that what well for school four square is the company that has?  Really interesting data on a B2B level here because they know what what doors you've gone into right?  And how long you spent there and things like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think though that Google especially with Google places and you know, the business information they're getting seems to be doing  You know a pretty good job and he shows how they're they're taking the satellite imagery and basically turning it into  These three demand even Google says that's exactly what we're doing. But I but I find that  This is a really interesting study this is  Rachel and a Chino and Yosheng Chen in their master's thesis visualizing mental maps of San Francisco  They asked San Fransciscans and Jeff you lived here for a long time  You'll kind of recognize this to draw sketch a map of the same memory and you see all the the neighborhoods Chinatown  Presidio lands and Hayes Street Pacific Heights  These are all these are they call them main drags in many cities commercial corridors that attracts people  Google knows them  Using zoning maps information within the interviews and a Chino and Chang identified 27 commercial corridors within San Francisco

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if you imagine if you could also take this on top of  Jerry Mandarin and put true communities together

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there you go really works together there you go Facebook could tell you where all the Republicans are in San Francisco

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there was actually there's data on that. Yes the car data. I was just saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they own more pickups

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, I have to find the thing but what I think is actually really powerful here rifle rack. You're a Republican is that it? Yeah  Democrats you tend to own Subarus. That is something  So it's it's a study that shows the Subaru to f-150 ratio

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, basically the Prius to f-150. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I found it here. Stacy. I'll put it in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rundown. Oh excellent. Well, no what I was gonna say is right  There you go. What Google is showing us in this maps mode that I think is maybe underappreciated is that this data now is  Relatively cheap right you have satellite data  You're we're gonna have all this data coming in from many different sources  What's going to set different businesses apart is actually how they bring the data together and apply it to deliver useful products and insights  And that is what Google is doing here. So maps is a great case study. Another is Google Photos  So it's not enough to be like I got the data  everyone's like data is the new oil and I'm kind of like  Maybe it's the new crude but you got to understand how to refine it and I think that's where Google really  Metaphor gone bad. That was a great metaphor. I love it. I'm like I'm in Houston if I can make an oil metaphor  I'm gonna do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's seeping into her brain. I think too. I mean is there is there a question here about  businesses that are left off the map or  Because I'm often wondering, you know how much of a city is actually in the cloud  so I do a lot of traveling and I don't always have time to  Ask people that have been to the city before what restaurants they recommend or places they would go see and I'm wondering too  You know, is there something to be said for having ways of inputting that are different than?  the kind of data that they're collecting from satellites or the kind of data that they're pulling from  From just business addresses, you know, because I'm especially in smaller towns  There's lots and lots of things that never end up datafied in the same way  And so I'm thinking about does it strategically give certain businesses at advantage?  You know, and of course, there's a metrics game here too, which is how do you how do you make sure that you're in the map?  Is there is there a way to make sure that you're in the map and accurately described one of the things that's funny about  When people look for data in society, for instance  Is they get some some fairly funny photos of what the building is or who's affiliated with it? And so  Yeah, so I'm wondering, you know, is there is this sort of the future of the yellow pages in a way and then also  What's left off the map that we we can't see we were very careful when we moved for instance

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know did a Google Places thing on Google Maps and made sure that  Twits old location was deprecated and our new location was shown  Which is right here and it has and I provided the business information  So I know that that's accurate all of that pictures of the old place not the not the new place but  It is you make an interesting point because in this area. I know for instance  I  Know that for instance  CA is right next to us, but I don't see them showing up on this map  And you know, that's a computer company. Maybe they don't want to be on the map the restaurant some of the restaurants  I are but some aren't and is that just because I have an advantage because I'm I know to make sure that I appear

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the map and these other guys don't I guess so, right?  What you're doing there is self identifying your business which you know  If you own a business and you're in a location sure you should do but Google's not just grabbing satellite and Street View data  They're gathering data from any Android user that pops in ensures their location  They also have business Wi-Fi data from like oh god. What was that company? So they have all that  Yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, can you do me a favor unplug and replug your headset it seems to be breaking up  Did we never send Stacy? Oh, she's at her parents. That's right. It's gonna say didn't we send you a good setup?  She's better. Yeah, these headsets after about an hour. They kind of get weird. They poop out. You're right. Google has more data  Than anybody right they can collect it all well Apple could have this data

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The challenge is Apple is very much more privacy focused. Right? So again disadvantage, right?  Well, it depends on how you look at it. Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's but I wouldn't argue that that's  Out of principle it's because Apple decided not to go into the ad business  Right, so they don't use and need the data the same way the other companies do right?  Although Apple is trying to market their privacy. Oh, they've turned it into a feature. Yes, but I think it was a bug

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to say now that I look at this you could totally see what kind of cars are in the parking lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you saying that that could tell you well reason we go back to that story. Oh, sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's enough information

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you don't read on scroll on down on either side of the photos so among the findings  It's right there on the screen bottom of the screen. There you go  Nope go up a little bit. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope that paragraph. Whoa

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me let me do it on my this is from City Lab  I'll do it on my computer cuz I had that's Karsten driving. He's got other things to do here. So so  Black neighborhoods more strongly associated with Buick Oldsmobile and Chrysler vehicles vehicles  The presence of pickup trucks Volkswagen's and Aston Martins and indicate mostly white neighborhoods  Toyota and Honda strongly associated with Asian neighborhoods. We've known this for years though  We've known this for years though  I remember people could a guy who came in once on my radio show 20 years ago and said  Tell me your zip code. I could tell you what magazines you and your neighbors subscribe to what kind of cars you buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, this is but this is this is computer  This is computer vision generated, which means it is now scalable in a way that right  And then searchable and it's saved and is this nefarious?  I don't know, but it's much easier to get and cheaper to get which is changes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thanks in Gilbert, Arizona  Using the proportion of pickup trucks to sedans  The model correctly identified the voting patterns of 58 out of 60 precincts  97 accuracy  The model indicated a city with more sedans has an 88 chance of voting for a democrat in the next election  Those with more pickup trucks 82 more likely to vote republican. You're right. I mean this data  Google has this data  Google knows this stat. I don't know what it's doing with it  You know who doesn't have that data is facebook, right? They don't have street view data like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and and if you want to target political ads or if you wanted to target maybe you know, joan  if you wanted to target manipulation to look for cells of  People in certain beliefs that kind of data would be helpful wouldn't it? Well, but facebook may know a lot more facebook's pretty good at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but you wouldn't  necessarily like I mean  It's like hard right because there's even even the incentive to let to like on facebook a honda  Page or things. I mean you have to be a pretty big fan, right?  To signal in certain ways to facebook, but they might in their photos also be able to recognize brands and then have  Ways and means of correlating that data. Here's the difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's the difference  So this city lab  Somebody came up with a hypothesis and then city lab analyzed it and then said oh, yeah  There's a correlation pick up trucks and sedans. That's what I would have guessed facebook doesn't work that way at all. It's a black box  They just have tons of data  It may turn out that people who buy cheerios are more likely to vote republican  It may turn out that it's somebody who buys cheerios and likes the honda page is is a bernie sanders democrat  And it doesn't matter it's not something you hypothesize google just has I mean facebook has all the data

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So there's also you know, I mean think about  Neighborhoods and car ownership over time if you're dealing with small towns  Maybe there is only a honda dealership or maybe there's only a toyota dealership facebook has a better much better data much more useful  Yeah, and so the idea though would be if you were if you were to want to target  Uh different groups of people to influence voter behavior  You'd be looking to nudge them in a particular for a kind of emotional response  And so maybe the question is do you serve them?  Uh fake news articles about how all pickup owners are, you know  X y and z bad actors, right?  And so you try to influence them by saying people who own pickups are republican or are democrat and  Therefore you should think this way about them  which are just  Stereotypes that we've always had and I know that  You know in california cars don't rust and so I i've seen quite a few hondas driven by  All manner of people so it doesn't seem to even hold across  A place and so that signifies to me that voting data is more useful than any correlation that may or may not be  Associated with car type. Yes. In fact, what kinds of correlations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  unexpected correlations  Do you find to?  extreme political behavior

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Uh, that's a really good question. So, um  Um  Yeah  unidentified correlations that would be that'd be a really good one because one of the things that we've been trying to understand is  what is what are the the the things we're not looking for in terms of manipulation around these nudges and  so  um one of the things that we've found in looking at the  small amount of data that we've gotten from the senate intelligence hearings is that  The russian pages were influencing social movements  And so even if you're just looking for certain bits of information  about say what's happening in  activism around  Black lives matter for instance, you might have been exposed to russian  Propaganda and so when we're trying to understand this this large body of of what is and what isn't  Correlated to certain fringe groups. It's been really hard to look at  that without getting mixed signals from  places that we uh,  you know  We would expect obviously that certain people are looking for information about social movements and things  Would be maybe predisposed to certain kind of fringe ideas or would be motivated to act in a certain way  But one of the things that we didn't expect I think was that uh other governments would be posing as not just citizens or sock  puppet accounts, but posing as  actual groups and movements and so  Yeah, so there's the data is very hard for us to parse at this point because it's really hard to see  who are people and who are organizations and what their  Intentions and motivations really are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this leads this leads to a whole other  Question  I'm not going to go back to the facebook rabbit hole, please but but in trying to look at the standards and principles and practices  Fake accounts and bots  uh  There are there are benign bots. There are good bots. There are service bots, you know, tell me when the when the train's not working  Okay, that's fine  But but generally how could you imagine?  uh crafting a principle around  Uh the bad use of fake accounts and bots so that you know facebook said for example that one of the things they're doing now  Is if somebody comes and harasses you and you block them facebook now is going to stop them from doing it again when they create  A new account. Well, hello if you're creating new accounts for the purposes of harassing people  That should be what you're going after  Uh, not that you come after me particularly so so fake accounts and bots. What's that? What's what's an ethical?  principle, uh  That the the the platform should be following around that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's yeah, it's really hard because one of the things that I think  We all think and maybe leo has an opinion on this is that when we friend something on facebook or follow something on twitter  That it's transparent in the sense that we know what we're looking at  right, and because these things are  So shrouded in mystery and we don't have access to the social graph in the way that these companies do  We are often not questioning  That we're talking to a real person or that we're not talking to  uh state-sponsored troll army  And the problem with bots I think is that we've just kind of crammed a bunch of miscellaneous stuff that the internet has always done  into  These automated accounts that amplify information  good bad or indifferent and  So it's been hard  In terms of thinking about what is the proper protocol?  I think or the ethical use of things one thing that I think we all can agree on is that  um  That there needs to be more oversight and more clarity around at least the stuff that we're not choosing to see which is advertising online  Uh, and how that stuff gets put into feeds?  Uh in particular and especially even the you know, I know google's experimented with  Placing the ads at the top and then putting them off to the side and putting them in shadow boxes  And I still think there's lots of clarity around  How we are supposed to interact with and look at these things and know what they are  um, and that's been a hard  sell for these companies that are  Really struggling I think to operate at the scale that they want to  with also being able to support the amount of staff and  people that it takes to run a platform such as you know, those big three  and so um  Yeah, and so one of the things about automation is though that I I welcome  in many respects certain forms of automation, but  um, especially when it comes to notifications around  simple things like  When if the trains are going to be late, but at the same time if we're automating news in the same way  We have to be very careful that we're not  Inserting levers for other people to you know, hack democracy or hack the markets

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Would you I mean we we would agree in fact the chat room's even saying this is the same old propaganda  It's the same old  There's nothing new and you were reading that book jeff about the history of  Fake news, there's nothing new here  But we've would you agree is this or is this a loaded term that we've weaponized delivery in such a way that makes it more dangerous  Is that what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  well the broadcast question is I think what we're talking about when we talk about bots and when we talk about amplification because  instead of seeing um  for instance a  The way that a telephone or a radio signal broadcast would come out from a tower  And then you know, you have an expected radius you have an expected distribution  You have an expected amount of people and then in the back end in terms of serving content you have a  a whole network and industry  Concerned with quality contents  authenticity  And with the internet all of those things fall apart and you have this nodal distribution of content  That's also masquerading as authentic content  And that can be very confusing, right? I mean we have all of these rules about  automated dialers and not allowing robo calling and um, you know people need to be able to opt into  services by telephone  but we've done something different with the internet and we haven't inserted the levers to prevent any kind of  Meshing a reality with advertising or with adversarial attacks  And so I think the question of scale and automation and amplification are really important  And you know, we also question  In my research group in any event, you know, what is what is the danger of amplification?  But what are the benefits of it? Right? And I think jeff leans towards  Where I am in some respects, which is that um  When we talk about amplifying things we're generally fairly happy with the content that we choose to consume online  What are the benefits of amplification? Okay, so think about um all during um, 2011  arab spring occupy not what was happening on facebook in particular but the ability  For people to broadcast and use live stream and youtube, okay  to get images  To do citizen media and citizen media is really I think one of the things that we talk about when we talk about  The benefits of these platforms and the ability to do anything at any time. Could you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could net neutrality the the fight for net neutrality fall under kind of the benefits of amplification?  I  Know I know they repealed it but you know getting people passionate about it and actually to call their  I would say anything that gets you to call your senators in  either way really

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mm-hmm would probably also fall into that. We've definitely got a galvanized electorate at least in that and many other  uh  Issues all of a sudden that would you know was essentially passive a few years ago  But but I don't I mean isn't all media amplification. Isn't that what mass media is is amplification?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but now I have to choose it in my living so it's the democratization of the amplification  In this in this is where we get hemmed up. I think in thinking about techno utopias without thinking about  social and cultural norms of society that have kept us from  um, we used to know broadcasting  everything  but you know, um  It's been it's it's a hard it's a hard thing because the benefits of amplification also  There's this strata that we're starting to notice where if you do insert a little, you know some capital  you can  constrain other people's right to amplification or other people's access to amplification by being  simply more present or  You know, so this is where bots come in right because if I am  50 000 accounts on twitter instead of just boston jones, then I have  increased my magnitude by orders of  You know of amplification and also  Probably spread myself out around many many more neck networks and been  Multi- you know much more powerful and effective communicator compared to abc nvc and cbs now you have

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thousands of people and also it sinks in a little bit more  It has a different kind of an impact than walter cronkite saying we're going to lose the war in vietnam  Because you when it's human nature when you hear the same thing from dozens of people  You just assume all must be true

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's I think one of the things that people are studying around the cognitive aspects of this is how many times?  Do you have to hear something to believe before you think it's true? Yeah, and how many times?  do you  See something on  Uh an account where you think it's legitimate because they have 50 000 or 500 000 followers  And you assume that someone somewhere must have met them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They must the platform assumes it too

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And the platform does assume it too and they you know, they check market in some cases  And so this has been what's hard, but I mean the history of computers though is rife with phishing scams  Rife with social engineering rife with  This kind of both play and cyber warfare. We can't get those are both parts of the computer science

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you guys study the game theory of this because what it strikes me is that these really ultimately what's happened is  It's not merely amplification mass media amplified, but you couldn't game mass media particularly. Well, but you can game this  And uh, it it strikes me that it's like the prisoner's dilemma  in a way if you  If you know the other guy is going to cheat  Then then there's not a problem, you know if you already, you know, so  Having multiple voices and being able to martial multiple voices is a very different kind of amplification  Than merely having a bully pulpit

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And this is where maybe even facebook gets implicated in a sense that we've also lowered the cost of coordination  Right. So one of the things that we thought about coordinating  2010 2011 is look at all this organic coordination that's happening. This is fantastic. I can't believe i've met these people  I've never i've never had this much interest in you know getting money out of politics  Let's all move forward together and the assumption built into the platforms that it's one person one account  And that the groups that you then build upon those one person one account are authentic  I think where we where we get led astray in some aspects of it is when people are operating outside the platform and co  And doing what facebook has called coordinated inauthentic participation  Which is you know your click farms and your and your like farms and your

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Troll internet research association whatever that russian troll. Yeah, but then but then there's also people like milo yanopolis  By himself was not harmful. It was the bot or the army whatever they were  They were they were people I guess that he could marshal that was the strength that he had it wasn't his single voice  It was the coordination that twitter allowed him

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And one of the things that he would do is he would on his website post someone's  Uh twitter handle and information or phone number or address  And he would encourage but it was a no known that if this information were to get out that one of your  um, you know one of the ways that you participate in media making is that you  Valorize the host and you and you do what other people in?  You know those media circles do and so you actually become part of the story when you're part of a coordinated harassment campaign

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you're studying all of this kind of thing  Oh, yeah fascinating. What would you do? I'm gonna ask all three of you  If you uh, if you were gonna run for president in 2020  Or dogcatcher, but let's use president because it's a nice big national scale  What tools would you use where what would you do to let me ask you jeff? What would you do to be?  I'm gonna hear stacey first. Okay, stacey starts  Okay, the the least social among us, um, yeah, because you're not even on facebook. Did you say you're not on facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I i'm on facebook. I just don't you don't participate ever. I I yeah, my last post was like  Three months ago. Um  So I would probably create in my persona much like I did with my media stuff  accounts at all the major social media platforms  I don't know this this like presupposes a big strategy. So i'm like, oh man i'm just saying, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, maybe you could say in nixon's era  You would have a media buy  You would do debates  Okay, so I wouldn't stickers and posters and maybe years later you'd start direct mail  Direct mail, but nowadays I think it's the jeff isn't the landscape hugely different

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think I think god help me for saying what i'm about to say  But I think there's a lesson to be learned from donald trump  And and it's this no not god help you. It's clear. I mean he was very effective at doing and well  And and so it wasn't it wasn't  Uh my candidate hillary clinton turned it all try to turn into a machine  Cl-trump was a human being of sorts himself. That's it. He used that he was the master  Right, wasn't he could someone who is no, not really but but but could someone who is  Uh, I don't say myself here but intelligent, uh, well-meaning reasoned informed  um  Use social media to come off that way to gain trust to gain respect to uh,  Show people that they're that they're  Transparent so the question is how you use it's not the tool  So, I mean every campaign has been using twitter and facebook and so on but they've been using it in manipulative ways  What trump did was he just got around all of that and around media and just said i'm gonna say whatever the heck  I want to say people are gonna rally behind that people loved it. They still do

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, well, you know, this is some of the stuff that we've been studying is that there's um,  There's this idea of mimetic warfare  And that the trump memes and the and you know, the story isn't here the hillary memes that the the meme story here is  The battle between trump and bernie sanders  And bernie had quite a meme  Factory running on facebook full of dedicated people that were making memes every day  Interesting I didn't know that different groups of people all of the memes that you've seen related to bernie and the bird falling on him  And all of these things are coordinated within  Facebook groups a lot of times they'll start working on a meme and they'll get a  Uh, you know a picture and they'll start working on a theme together and then the meme will develop in conversation  And then they will take and then after workshopping it they'll take it and they'll move it to other spaces like on to reddit  for instance, there was a lot of  strategic meme drops within the donald reddit and then from that  Community then people are then asked to go spread it out onto twitter and onto  uh facebook for broadcast and  And so there's quite a few  Ways that this would happen and I and I  My fear with the use of technology, but it's coming and i'm not the one that came up with this strategy is essentially  You can either pay a super pack to do sophisticated marketing  Uh for the candidate that you like or you can pay facebook  10 bucks and circulate the meme that you made  and it you can select the ad targeted buckets of people and what we know is that  Memes aren't just meant to get people to like something. They can also be used in an offensive manner. That is to  trigger other communities of people into  Disliking something or to get distracted or upset about the wrong thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you think there are wizards at this who are carefully plotting this or it was kind of accidental?  I think it's throwing spaghetti at the wall and hoping something is cooked. But don't you think it's so cheap for the next couple of years?  Of years to throw to the wall now. Yeah, well for the next couple of years. There's people who yeah  It's cheap to throw spaghetti  But there's also people who are looking very carefully right now what spaghetti stuck and and and refining it I would presume  Yes, no, this may not be cambridge analytical. That seems to they had a meme of their own

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's interesting. So so jone and I were still at a conference where everyone  I think virtually everyone in the room right jone just poop who's the cambridge analytical did anything of note?  What's what's your take on that jone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's hard to tell right because we're not going to know I mean the the idea that you could use  psychometrics and nudge people  I would say that the only way that you're going to guarantee that they saw the content that you were using to nudge is  Using ad tech at this point and we know that donald trump was circulating  um on peak days  Uh create pieces of creative  And so that's uh, oh  messages online  Per day and so when people have the conversation about honest ads and  What does it mean to monitor political campaigns?  I start to wonder at the scope of things, you know, this is this is a how many people do you need to monitor?  One person's campaign if you were to compare hillary clinton's campaign and don trump's campaign hillary

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was a little bit more old school was big television media buys  and uh trump channeled a smaller amount of money into  This new media stuff and it was very very very effective  Also, perhaps because candidate trump was made for that medium  Uh in a way that hillary clinton was not um

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can't discount the um  The kind of fandom that goes on online fandom is an important aspect of how people participate in online cultures

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so fandom was how bernie got from zero to contender, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly exactly  So one of the things that we have to be careful of is of course  We don't want to hand over and say oh they're master puppeteers. Look their strategy work  But we also have to understand that he had a digital mark trump had a digital marketing strategy  And hillary had movement people and when you have movement people and you have political strategists. They're thinking in a very um  Coordinated way, but they're thinking about you know votes in the street and people on the ground and then they have a digital strategy that  Reflects the agenda of the party  But you can imagine when you go back and look at all of the things that were circulated that were pro trump  And I don't even want to say pro republican, uh, because he was definitely running a side

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's become clear. He's his own party now. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, he he was he was speaking in multiple registers and there were so many different groups that were motivated to create  Content on his behalf, right? This is stuff that's not he's the first main president  I would say yeah, I would so because even uh, we have uh, amelia. Acker is a amazing researcher at ut austin and she's been looking at  the um, she's the  Steward of the social media  Archive from the white house under obama and and there's just a remarkable difference in the amount in the  You know just in the in the sheer amount and volume  of  Social media that's attached to the trump administration that just wasn't present during the obama administration

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's interesting because obama really reinvented presidential campaigning himself and and galvanized, uh  Groups that were not traditionally  Uh democrat stalwarts. I mean this it's almost as if we've had two presidents in a row that broke the mold

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And maybe now we'll see that yeah one going forward because obama  2008 was a year after the iphone, right? So he was campaigning

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As we were embracing mobile as it strikes me and i'm not a historian of uh elections, but it strikes me that  his on the ground  Organization and the coalitions he was able to to form and the people he's able to get off their ass to vote  Were unique to him and I don't think it had to do with technology. I think it was much more retail

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They used but it was like howard dean used retail howard dean used a tool. So stacy. What what difference did you think that?  What what did the technology set in motion then for him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he did a lot of like small time small time  Campaign donations, so he got people to donate he spent a lot of time on the web all the platforms were  Very well disseminated. I think also  more so in 2012 he did use twitter and facebook  not the way that trump did but  You know to to build a coalition and to activate his voting base  I think that was a pretty good job right there and to reach youngsters and youngsters. Did I really just say that I did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you did you're the youngster on this show, but okay  Wow  Well joni's now too

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah  No, I wish I wish that were the case one of the things that I think also that we have to measure with technological development is that  people get more agile and more used to using these tools as  We become more familiar with them. And so it isn't just that new things get introduced  We get better at using the old things  and so  Another thing that's been widely overlooked is the use of  sms  Messaging in mobilizing people to vote and reminding people to vote did that very effectively?  Yes, and but this was weaponized during the the 2016 election where there was a massive disinformation  Campaign to convince people that they could vote by text. Oh my god, you're kidding circulating through twitter  where different hashtags and different people were being targeted with  Memes and pictures one very famous one of a mocked fake meme of a season. Sorry  showing people how to how to vote and get involved by text and so  there's uh more to come I think in terms of  Impersonating and in phishing campaigns that we're going to have to be much more aware of and I think we're going to have to adopt  a very adversarial approach to understanding political media  In the midterm elections, there's a group called first draft right now that is doing  very good work getting  A kind of collaboration in place  Where the people are going to be actively looking for these disinformation campaigns and not just influence ops from  Other governments but looking at what's in the meme space. What is coming through these  these  Pipes that we're not equipped for in order to tell the public that that's not true

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to see whatsapp and and similar platforms being used a lot more in columbia and brazil  Uh, they've been major forces in election disinformation

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So so we're going to see stuff. We don't we can't find anymore. This is the most interesting conversation. We've had in a while  I really think  So 2018 is a lot sooner than the presidential election and 2018 is many different  smaller elections, this is where uh  This is where this could really start to show its strength and i'm going to i'm willing to bet steve bannon's already indicated  He's really wants to use 2018  Uh to marshal an army i'm gonna i'm willing to bet that he's one of the geniuses behind  Getting uh, these these meme factories working. I mean that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He had that it wasn't just it wasn't just the right. I mean, uh occupied democrats on the left occupied  It was a force for bernie. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  um, yeah, and and even in in that I think there's a natural inclination in online participatory culture to  want to do something and one of the things that you can do is be  Uh a creative person that that makes media political content  podcasts  but it's that active moment where people think if I could just  You know convince them not to vote or convince them or or you know  These disinformation campaigns that suggest that you're pulling places somewhere that it's not  or that uh voting's been canceled  These are the things that we have to worry about especially if they look and sound as if they're coming from official  accounts  Um, and so it's really going to be up to these platform companies to get their verification  um, you know  papers in order so that people can see the right signals  from accounts and and know that it's coming from a city council or know that it's coming from a  account run by  a police department

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Rather than hoping that I despair of the general american public being able to figure that sucker out

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's why there's many uh verification  Groups in play that are trying to think about what are the appropriate signals to send  More than just a blue check mark to let people know that they're engaging with something that has been verified  As you would if you were to flip to the municipality section of your what used to be the the white pages, right?  Stacey go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was just saying what will be also interesting is how corporate interests how this plays out with them  And I bring this up because in austin for example a couple years ago. We had  a big city council vote over  Basically, it was a referendum on uber and lift in the city  And uber pulled out all the stops including offering people rides to the polls. They sent me texts  They use their app to galvanize people  and I just saw actually  Um a press release from comcast that says in light of the tax bill passing and the repeal of net neutrality  That brian roberts the ceo of comcast is giving  $1,000 bonuses to his employees and pledging to  Invest 50 billion in investment over the next five years and in their networks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey if I may just just just add on that work. I don't know i'm interrupting you but for information point of information  point of information  At&t did that first  And it turns out the thousand dollar bonuses were mandated a couple weeks ago by the union a b guess what at&t wants to do next  So this is a thank you gift for net neutrality. Sorry. Go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, and I was about to say now the carriers have long played these kind of games  but what you're seeing now is  They usually have played this with politicians. So a lot of our broadband investment from  The initial run into fiber was kind of  It was it was highly politicized and the politicians, you know were they they would donate money and then get  Promises to subsidize some investments that never then actually happened  So what's interesting here though is that they're starting to talk about this and give this out to the world at large  And there's no no checks on this and so that then becomes  There are checks in the form of the media actually reporting this but  You may not see what the media reports, especially if you're only listening to certain channels, right and so it just  The weaponization is not just from foreign states  It's also from corporate interests and we should be and I think that's a little bit more nefarious and it's a little harder to go after  Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's uh, take a little break  Because you wanted to see rebel wilson sing google translated christmas songs, right jeff I do I do  This is uh, jimmy fowl and so I guess this is a regular bit for jimmy  They they take traditional christmas carols and they let google translate.

Transcript:  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google applies machine learning to planet hunting and has discovered  Exoplanet two new exoplanets  So yeah, you can't deny this is valuable using a data set of more than 15 000 kepler signals  Kepler is the space telescope nasa launched eight years ago  Uh, they created a tensor flow model to distinguish planets from non-planets  To do this it had to recognize patterns caused by actual planets versus patterns caused by other objects like star spots and binary stars  Then the system said all right, we got the planets  Uh 96 accuracy rate  Then they used the system to hunt for new planets. So how do they know it's a exoplanet which is an earth-like planet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Say say again definition of an exoplanet. I didn't know what the definition of it was just some other planet

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh exo means just out of our solar system. Never mind. All right with 200

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I I was hoping it was earth-like exoplanets, but no with 200 000 stars in the database  They looked at 670 stars that had two or more previously discovered exoplanets  And by doing that they learned what an exoplanet was better than I did anyway  And discovered two two new ones kepler adg and kepler 90i  Now that's computer intelligence  Huh two new planets, thank you. Thank you google. Thank you google ai

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we've discovered a lot of new planets though. Like yeah. Yeah thousands. It was a big it's but but recently

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the funny thing is we didn't even know there were planets outside our solar system  We assumed there must be but we didn't know until relatively new tools are the best thing for science science  Science. All right. Google has said no more project tango. Uh, this arc core stuff good enough  AR core good enough  Tango was the very very advanced hardware based  Augmented reality that required, you know a special camera and special phone  Uh ar core is just like apple's ar kit. In fact was announced curiously close to the announcement of ar kit  and uh  Well, we've seen already what ar core can do because those stickers those new stickers on the pixel camera

Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, you know if you were to make a uh, uh  A ufo land in the middle of times square, you know, it could be a problem or a porg on my desk  Yes, happy little it's cool. I think started talking about this actually when  Pokemon go came out and the idea was  You know, I mean most of the stories were about you know  People are falling off of sidewalks because they're not looking at the ground but there is a you know, there are many many concerns  Among people about  Televisual and audio hacking and the inability to distinguish truth from reality  And this is you know long-term standing concerns that people had when the you know photograph got introduced  And what does it mean to freeze someone in time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

I don't remember we had 50 or 60  But the beauty part is you can record it  And the recorded on-demand version continues, you know as long as you want and it's just as interactive as the original  You know you can as you're doing a go to webinar you can have 20 polls each with 20 questions  You won't use that many but as many as uh, which is nice  You set up questions at the beginning like for instance. I had a poll at the beginning  Asking people who they were what they're what they were interested in that helps me do a better job as a presenter  You could do questions on the fly too though if something comes to you and you go, you know  Like we do on the show how you know if you were going to run for president  How would you do it something like that?  You can have polls like that and the thing is even in the on-demand version later people are watching the replay all those polls  Are live and active so it is just as interactive that engages your audience  It keeps them awake makes it more fun and it's even better for you  With go to webinar, it's easy to start a webinar you they have custom email invitations  confirmation emails reminder emails  Automated email templates so you don't even need to do that. You just let them handle it  They can always have your company logo and custom image on all the webinar materials  It's also mobile friendly so you can do all of this schedule webinar even edit a session or track performance from your ios or android  device go to webinar and I love the analytics  The real-time analytics give you an idea of how you're doing so you can do better next time  You can also get qualified leads other metrics end to end 128 bit aes encryption  So it's secure number one and customer satisfaction. I want you to try it go to webinar.com  Podcast turn your next presentation  into a conversation with go to webinar for more information go to webinar.com  Podcast  Joan donovan is a researcher at data and society. She researches media manipulation  And you had a very interesting book you were talking about before the show you want to make that your pick of the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Um, yeah, so one of my favorite books and i'm revisiting it  More uh more and more is phil lapsley's exploding the phone  And one of the reasons why I love this book is it's rife with a first-person accounts from phone freakers  About the different kinds of exploits the different kinds of  Infrastructural hacks that they've encountered and you know, there's stories that are a little bit more  In the vein of social engineering  Really the birth of social engineering haps happens  with people trying to hack telephone infrastructures in order to convince, um,  You know operators to give them free calls. Um, and so there's lots of  young  You know experimentation going on and then there's also some  foreshadowing of  surveillance state type  You know, uh, there's this there's this alliance where  At&t is trying to understand if people are stealing phone calls. So they start just recording the first  90 seconds of any phone call without really thinking about the implications of what that might be and so  um  So phil lapsley's book really takes a deep dive into history, but also helps us think about  well, what are the problems that we've always known were here with technology and  misuse  or  In some cases innovative use  There's some great stories about technology that was built. Uh, the the blue box, of course, uh tone dialers  that were used to  Um, well make free phone calls, but this is the selling of blue boxes is infamously tied to the birth of the  apple computer and getting  people involved in homebrew and  micro computing  um, you know, uh, I don't want to call them hobbyists because they became so  So much more than that  um, but yeah, so it's a really great history told from  Um a very  particular set of people that were doing early hacking  Um, and they were known as phone freaks, which some of the people in your audience might know about and some of them are

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, i'm sure i've known my show  I remember was telling me about how he used to listen in to satellites phone calls on the satellites was never stopped  What people thought all was and jobs cleaned up their act?  Uh after they found an apple maybe steve jobs did but was did not and was his stories are legend

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Legend, yeah, there was nothing more exciting even as a teenager  Accidentally picking up your wireless phone and hearing the conversation of a neighbor, right?  They ended up crossing frequencies  And so there's you know, and there's there's really great stories about discovery of you know  Captain crunch of course and discovering that you can use whistles and joy bubbles is a is a young  Blind teenager that discovers that he can whistle the tones because he has perfect pitch and so  It's really um, you know at the intersection of bodies and technology and it's really great account of  a history of computing that I think is um would have been lost if lapsley hadn't really  Taken the time to do such an admirable job surfacing that history. Yeah, i'm glad he wrote this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm gonna have to get it. This is really interesting  And I guess well just another time i'll tell you about how I wrestled with john draper. That's a story for another day  Joan donovan, thank you so much. It's really nice to meet you. We will have you back  Very nice to have you on the show. I look forward to it.
