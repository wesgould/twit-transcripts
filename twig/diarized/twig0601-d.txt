Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And thank you Noreen welcome to the show it's nice to have you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Glad to be here. Thank you for having me. So I'm gonna I want to break down

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your thesis here by starting first with what is the tech lash? What's what? What do you what do you what's going on?  Like the definition. Yeah, I mean, what are we talking about here the tech lash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the tech lash is  Summary of the past few years where we have this really strong and widespread  negative reaction to the growing power and influence of big tech  specifically, you know the large companies here in Silicon Valley and  You know, we have  Specific sectors that are more backlash like social media and companies that are more backlash like Facebook as you can guess  but it's basically  Being much more critical to the tech industry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Than before and you specifically focus on tech journalism and the way tech  Journalists have been covering technology  Which I'm very interested in I've been a tech journalist now for several decades. I  Don't actually  Stacey says I'm not a journalist right? I'm a tech

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Easy easy. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Time  Well starts. Okay, you really want to know since the 70s? Yeah, so I  Started writing for bite magazine and info world and it was downhill from then before or after the Apple 2  After the Apple 2 my I started writing for Atari magazines, believe it or not  Oh wow, 70s and my first piece in bite was in the 1984  Macintosh release issue. I reviewed some Macintosh software  Oh, wow, and then in for info world, I think I was also doing Mac software at the time writing about Mac software at the time  No, you don't need to ask me I'm just curious what so you did interview a lot of people including for some reason Jeff Jarvis  All the all the best what so what was your conclusion what has tech journalism changed you call it the evolution of tech journalism  How has it changed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It changed a lot so the book and you're gonna love this a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chapter pre-tech Lashara. It's how I call it. That's me prehistory. You might as well just say ancient times. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so it's actually starting from the 80s till now to show the difference in the  power relations between the tech giants and the media and the you know pure practices and how tech journalists used to work and  Also, of course the state of mind that was more utopian than dystopian  And then in the tech clash which you asked about is the roots of the change and the characteristics of the coverage

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah, we to actually talk about that a lot on this show because I  Was certainly tech utopian. I was not I took great pride and pains not to be a flack for

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The tech companies. Yeah. Yeah, you were never a fanboy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I always consider myself representing the user and often that was in the face of you know  Complete mistreatment by the tech industry, but but at the same time and I think you were kind of the same way to Jeff  I was pretty optimistic. You might still be about

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Especially the internet I still am but I but I the difference is I think I I confess  The problem with the optimism is that it left us vulnerable to the manipulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you're probably right and of course I always I paired up initially with the John C Devorak whose whole schtick was  Tech cynicism. Yeah like cranky. This will never work. That's not in fact  He got a lot of heat very famously when the Macintosh came out for saying nobody needs a mouse. What's that up? That's stupid  But but what I learned but working with John is generally he was right, you know about 80% of the time any new innovation  Really was stupid  In the long run  So I learned to temper my my wide-eyed  You know, I guess Pollyanna ish look at technology with us. There was a shift in what's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cynicism. Yeah, what's fascinating about?  Nirrits research is that she pegs I'll let her talk about this brush. She pegs a moment when it changed  Oh, that's what fascinated me. I didn't really get that there there was a moment over to you. You're it. When did the honeymoon end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm November 2016 do you have a date?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  2016 I have to check my calendar what happened in November 2016?  Okay  So the election shift there the election of Trump in November of 2016  How did that but how would that affect our coverage of as tech press of technology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so  First let's say the technology became much more politicized but we put that aside  The tech people whether they were journalists or workers in the companies  they were all in the state of reckoning with their influence and asking how did we get here and  Then everybody started to blame the tech platforms for the whites better  things like that and then  It all became more critical

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I have you did content analysis, right you did you did analysis of the actual coverage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I want to share something with you Neri and if you had interviewed me for this book  I would have shared this with you. I wrote this and sent this as a memo to our staff  The memo is called twit after the election. Oh  I never knew this. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think I sent it to you  I think I sent it to our on-air hosts and so forth and  In other words  I said I've been spending a lot of time talking with family co-workers friends and fans about last Tuesday's election  And how it might affect what we do and say at twit. I'm curious Nereed if this is consonant with your theory  In other words, what is our responsibility as broadcasters at this time?  So I reiterated our mission statement twit exists to serve and engage a global community of tech enthusiasts by giving them the information  They need to use tech to make their lives better. I  Say we have a global smart diverse audience some in our community are thrilled with the results of the election many or not  I don't think we serve anyone by complaining about how it turned out or looking for fault or blame  So I didn't want us to say oh, it's the fault of big tech for the result  Politics per se is not our beat and not why our community comes to us  I  Suggest we try to stick to tech as much as possible  Then I a lot of this was do we do how do we?  Do how do we incorporate our political feelings and beliefs into what we talk about as tech journalists?  And how do we keep Jarvis from getting rid of all of our listeners? Well, I should have sent this to you Jeff  I propose we address politics only when there is a technology angle and it's appropriate to the show  Does Facebook have an obliq this is 2016 does Facebook have an obligation to block fake news?  What was the role of Twitter in Trump's election our Trump's policy is good or bad for Silicon Valley?  Twig and twit will inevitably broach these subjects  We did during Obama's administration will continue to do so now  and  Then I also addressed  Conspiracy theory even at this time  There's one particularly thorny area where you answers are not always so easily distinguishing fact from fiction from faith  So we talked about climate  We have an audience and a voice we do have a responsibility not to maintain a false neutrality in one case  There's a clear bright line, which we can never cross and I said racism discrimination  sexual preference gender choice and all of those things  So I you know this to to I guess agree with what you are saying Nareed is I did see the election as  Something that we had to consider as a tech journalistic entity  journalistic entity

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So more than that and more than the content analysis that Jeff mentioned what I've done  I'm a big data analytics kind of a girl  so I looked at the companies and their pics during the year and I analyzed those pics of covers like the main the  biggest stories they have during the years and  in the what I call pre tech lash most of them were  Innovation journalism or product journalism and by that I mean  Product launches either you know software or how do I do a lot of that? Yep? Yep. Yep, and a lot of business reporting  So of course all the IPOs and you know M&A's and things like that. So that was the normal  Big headlines in the tech news, but when I analyzed 2017  Most peaks were negative  Tech scandals and most of them were like  fake news after the Las Vegas shooting which involves Twitter Google and  Facebook and  We had the Russian interference and all the investigations starting  In Congress, so all those headlines were not there before right?  So we had investigations and fines and privacy issues and all of them were in the tech coverage all the year all the time  But they were less visible right because there was less coverage of those issues and the shift that I'm showing in the book is  That since 2017 those are the salient  You know the major stories in the tech coverage. I think that's fair. I'm looking at our rundowns

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From late 2016 and early 2017. I have a record of every show we've done and I think that's actually fair that  it did somewhat change our kind of a  focus I  But in my defense, I always felt a little guilty about just talking about shiny things  and I think that happened earlier for me because I started to become aware of the  climate consequences of filling landfills with you know, two-year-old smartphones  And so I think we kind of tried to downplay that I certainly addressed those issues in the years before that  But I think you're exactly right. I think that we did  We did shift our coverage became less about what's the next new thing and what's the big IPO and  More about how tech influences society and and I think you're right often  Negative negatively and Jeff's always yelling me for that, right Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where do you think it goes near it do you think it do you think it changes again or do you think this is  The path we're gonna be on for the foreseeable future

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the theme of the book is pendulum swings and I'm showing how in the pre-tech  We had several of them like think about the positive coverage in the dot-com  Bubble and then after that how with the coverage after the burst  I mean the tech CEOs were God and then there became dog, right?  So we had that before but what I'm showing  Since the tech question up is that even with the pandemic and we had this very short second honeymoon  I'm so yeah great  Yeah  It was so short and all the techless  Subjects and issues resurfaced again very quickly. So  Actually, the techless is here to stay so we went from one extreme to the other but this extreme is here  How do you measure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you measure do you do content analysis, how do you since you sit your data driven?  What is what are the data points for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so I collected  the tech coverage of the big tech companies from both traditional media and tech blogs and  Then I'm after as I said the yearly timeline  After that, I looked and it's like really big story and analyzed their response  So I took the press releases  You know  Spokesperson statement to journalists and everything that I could use about how they reacted to everything that's happening and how then  Responses back pushed as well because I'm also showing the coverage of how the journalists look at those responses and said it's BS and  So it's back and forth between how the tech companies  Present the stories and how the media does it?  So it's not just a big that the big data shows me the big stories  But then the content analysis go deeper into the actual content

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Jeff knows I eliminated the Google change log right about that time. I didn't want to talk about that anymore  But he made me bring it back. So I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me ask you two questions there near it. I'm curious from that one is  From the two perspectives you just mentioned on the journalist side  Did they feel?  Guilty and had to overcompensate for their for their utopianism  Once tech became a whipping boy on on the tech side. Did the tech people understand?  the the problem they had with their hubris and attitude and  The people shouldn't like them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, so  Let me answer that in a few ways. There are many factors at play here  So first there's the the power relations between the two groups  so when we were in the phase of innovation journalism and everything is shiny and cool and  Innovations are basically good for society  then the tech companies had this power and  We all know they're in famous secrecy and limited access and the tech journalists just want to be you know  as I said closer to God and  That made some of the tension that we have today  I think and then when it's moved to tech is you know negative and ruin society face  Tech are more defensive and they need always to react about their new scandal of the week, right?  So the tech journalist saw that when they dig up and find  More harm and have real impact in the world  It's actually good journalism and more journalists joined the effort. So now the relationship  much  different

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm curious to I never asked you how so you went from being tech journalists to  Tech communications and then she was able to go into the academic. She started in the dark side. She started in PR  Went to the light side and then went to the ivory tower  What made you decide to do research on this?  How did you end up choosing the academic?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I covered the tech ecosystem in Israel that was in the early 2000s  We were in the innovation journalism phase and everything was exciting and he's raised the startup nation  and all the coverage was about all the cool things coming out of Israel and  When I write about that time  I finished my MA in communication and political science and when I looked for academic studies about  You know my occupation my passion tech journalism  I found this depressing void of almost nothing about  This field and I was like, why does nobody focusing on the tech media agenda and  The interplay there between all the forces  So basically I decided to do it myself and that resulted with my PhD in communication  Researching the tech media, but that was tough a decade ago  Because all my colleagues and professors are in political communication  So one of the reviewers actually wrote who cares about tech news  They are not important  They are not important  Well, I think actually, you know, I understand why they think that I think tech news is often viewed in the same way that you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  automobile food news or food news is where it's  You know car and driver is not considered a journalistic entity as much as a you know  An arm of the big three automakers, but that's why I've from day one  And I think maybe I'm a little bit of a maverick in this business  Very consciously decided not to do that to kind of  Renovate or use your metaphor to use your analogy if if autos had been covered as a societal

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  phenomenon with their impact  On cities and on life in America and on pollution and such would have been a big difference  But they weren't yeah, I think once podcasting happened at blogs to there were people who are not mainstream tech journalists

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who absolutely?  Had an adversarial relationship. I don't know you probably don't know this. I don't talk to PR people ever  I make a point of it. We don't do loners for the most part  And sometimes we have to but we really I really endeavor to keep us at arms-length  From the tech companies and from public relations firms. I have a strong antipathy towards them. So  Yeah, well now it's probably a little bit more common but but  For 40 years. I've been making a point of that because I always made sure it was in clear in my mind  You heard about a mission statement that I was a ombudsman for the user not for the tech company  Mission statement that I was a ombudsman for the user not for the tech industry  But I can see why your professor would have looked at this and said oh, yeah  is there a name for that Jeff genre publishing or  Niche publishing the service journalism is what we service journalism. That's it and I think for now

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now I have a very different view. I think journalism should be a service as a whole  So I think that's a that's a who do they serve is the question

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know speak truth to power right and you know, what is it?  What is the role of the journalist is to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Discomfort the comfortable. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, all of that and I think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Perhaps service journalism is never viewed as that's never been viewed as its role its role  Just like Beltway journalism in Washington DC. Its role is  Access and you can't risk access  By speaking truth to power. It doesn't work. Go ahead. I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead is anyone even discussing the idea that these big  Journalistic companies have shareholders to answer to and regardless of how great these writers are  It still comes down to any click. So editors are gonna have to make things  Clickable and sometimes put in something out there. That's just a little bit  Off the wall is is what's going to get those clicks  Are you finding stuff like that in your in your day in your research?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think you're touching the  How well tech journalists blame the tech platforms for their change in business models and how they do things and some  blame  The media for going to all these clickbytes due to technology but  That's not actually I think a huge part of the story if you ask me

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. I think that that that  we  Feed off of conflict, which is what I think ants point really is and if you can and so an editor looks and said  Oh good. There's an enemy. There's a bad guy. There's a victim  And we can portray it that way then I  I'll agree with that but I think that that becomes  It doesn't matter what the fight is. Oh good. There's a fight. Let's promote it  Is that what you're kind of saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I totally agree that if there is any bias in the media is that it's pro-conflict

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I think it's conflict. We're absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why Leo and I fight so much it's just for that reason just we do it for the clout  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When it works  It's really it's  ruined all journalism if you ask me and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To also that's this point. This is why we have articles such as the evilist listing the third most  dangerous evil companies in tech because that's like the headline to put on such so that's doubly bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a listicle and it's the evil list  every possible  Let me take a little break. Hold on second Jeff's hold that question. Hold that thought  I want to take a little break our guest. This is great. I'm really thrilled to have her even though  I'm breaking my heart  Dr. Neeraat Weisblatt is the author of the tech lash and the tech crisis communication  Tech lash book calm it comes out March 24th, but you can pre-order it on Amazon  Right now it's great to have you near eight and we will be back with more in just a second, but it's time  For a little word from our sponsor in this case, it's Melissa  Did you know?

Thank you Melissa for  Supporting this week in Google. Thank you dear listener for supporting us by using that address Melissa comm slash  twit  Sorry Jeff didn't mean to interrupt  Continue do you remember your question? Did I hope I didn't knock it out of your head?  Turn him up turn him up

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My fault my fault, okay. Okay now I can  Yeah, no problem. I'm just curious if you were a if you were in charge of calm at a tech company today  Pick your tech company in there  Is there any way out for them? What would what would you do? Is there a new kind of of honesty and transparency?  Will they never be believed and trusted

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I  Won't be  Difficult in the world right now  But yeah, so as you remember from the book what I found is they usually put out the same playbook  What I call the tech PR template for crisis  They always do the same responses and one of the books messages  I think is that it's of course not enough because I documented that it's backlash heavily  So how should they react is a brilliant question? I think one of the best quotes in the books are yours actually  touching that  We look at tech as black boxes producing black boxes  so yes transparency and they need to educate more about the complexity of the nuances issues they're dealing with and  Showing the humanity inside and  Things of that nature  But also I think at that time when we see all the wars between them  it's also they need to be more united because like there are problems that are dealing with it's the whole sector that is dealing with and  If they won't deal with them together

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's gonna be more damage are there any examples you can you can remember call the mind of of  a  Crisis response done well by a tech company. I'm trying to think myself. I can't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a no win here because they are doing what the crisis communication 101 tells them to do they're  Specifying what they've done, you know the good intentions  They've built something good and they have previous good deeds with which they always specify and great policies in place  You know, but our product or plucking was manipulated and misused by bad malicious actors  so we always have this victim villain framing of we were good and  Versus, you know the outside  malicious entities  Then the other thing is that they always do those apology tours, which I called pseudo apologies

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because you know, they say what Andrew Cuomo is doing right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is he apologizing apologizing or just denying

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I tweeted today that if your apology begins with an if clause, maybe I should shut if I did that I I  Don't remember doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If in any way that was a yeah, that's not the word  You know the big opportunity for companies these days is data breaches and once every company has to announce  Oh gee, I'm sorry your customer records have been  Given up to hackers. I mean clearly Equifax is the exact wrong way to handle that. I'm trying to think of  Because Equifax actually maybe not Equifax's way of handling it was making more money by offering  So wrong depends on who you're talking to if you're a stakeholder you're pretty happy about it  Yeah, I can't you know, I can't think of  Yeah, that's true it hurts the reputation doesn't it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you know you look at and I don't want to get ahead of us but  The the Google story today well actually it's funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was I was gonna I was gonna actually go into that because that's a perfect example fits right in with yeah  Yeah, so Google announced and it's in the Wall Street Journal of all places. I don't know. Is that Wall Street Journal?  Crowing a little bit because Google's gonna have to stop selling ads  Based on your specific web browsing Paul Thurotte was skeptical earlier on Windows Weekly  apparently Google and this is  It's one of those things. Yeah, I'm gonna give up smoking next year  Google it's March plans next year. It's March that you could do it this year

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's more like it's more like next year. I have the cure for cancer and you don't yeah, so Wednesday  You know, I could give it up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can Google said it plans to stop next year using or investing in we're gonna continue through  2021 but next year will stop investing in tracking technologies that  Uniquely identify web users as they move from site to site across the internet  I mean clearly this is one of the many things  Google and many many others do with tracking cookies and we fact that  Highly recommend Steve Gibson show yesterday  He called it DNS collusion. It turns out that of  The the top thousand websites 10% of them are using a DNS  trick in the CNAME  Field to follow you around not using I mean, it's it's really appalling what they're doing  It's very sneaky. It's pretty technical. So let Steve explain it in the security now  But the point I guess is Google may say well, we've decided  Not to use tracking cookies, but I've always thought Google probably has other means of doing the same  Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google's 52% but they also have the tool to get there they have and they have they have the first-party data and  And they don't need third party. No. Yeah, right pretty big because they know where you as a user of gone point one point two  Evidently they're gonna have your your local browser is gonna kind of type you so you're in more control of that  Which I've actually argued for for years  When I try to get Google to share kind of types with publishers  But now Google is gonna say we can do that kind of on our own  So it's perfect example of regulatory capture where everybody screamed  Cookies are evil third-party duty is evil. We're gonna get you Google. We're gonna demonize all that stuff and Google said, okay  No cookies and then the publishers say but but we don't have any first-party data. That's not fair

Transcript:  Google has already responded what I was just talking about  reading on in the article the company  Last year said they would stop using third-party cookies in 2022. But now the company's saying  Neither will it build alternative tracking technologies or use those right or yeah, right or use those being developed by other entities  Like I would imagine the scene inclusion which is offered by  Adobe Oracle  and  Salesforce  Among others to replace third-party cookies for it said on ad buying tools Google says its ad buying tools will use  New technologies it has been developing  With others in what it calls a privacy sandbox  They've been working with publishers on this is regulatory capture right here last  Yeah, six or eight months to target ads without collecting information about individuals from multiple websites  As an example one such technology analyzes users browsing habits on their own devices  And in other words, so it's doing on-device  Analysis locally and then allows advertisers to target aggregated groups of users with similar interests  They call them cohorts rather than individual  Here's a jock here's a nerd this is what Facebook does Facebook never says here's what Leo Laporte wants to know  They say here are a thousand people likely a report that you could target because they all have the same interest. So  There's a story now we're gonna ask Nureet  There's the story you can see already  Where the tech journalists are going? Yeah. Yeah, well sure Google or its regulatory capture  Google's pulling up the ladder because it's already won. How could Google have handled this better? And how should we handle this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think it says similar to all banned political advertising at all  Yes  So it always goes back to we ask them to do one thing and then just like Jeff said, but I think a step back  The whole tech was thing started because micro targeting became this evil force of you know  The source of evil in the world, right?  And it was because of things like the Russian interference. So back then they everybody looked at  Microtargeting as the worst thing on the internet, but now we have Facebook  changing the conversations showing okay if we don't have  Targeted things how small businesses are going to reach their audience  So you see also Facebook going out with other messages  Trying at least to change the framing of it's not that evil. It's actually very helpful  specific allowing the pandemic where  Small companies are hurt and so that's it is a thing that I think they're doing well actually now  of course Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple  precipitated all this by changing its ID for advertisers and  Using its ATT technology and that's the one that Facebook's really saying. Oh, it's not just us. You heard Apple  It's all the small businesses in all the world  Google  Google put its finger to the wind and said hmm  Well, I have to say I remain skeptical  Google by the way says its announcement does not cover its ad tools and unique identifiers for mobile apps  just for websites  Wall Street Journal has decided to take this as a good sign  This is the quote but its plan is the latest sign that the tide might be turning on user tracking  More broadly and I might say it's just going underground and and and and  We use that term regulatory capture, but that's essentially saying the big incumbents who are already making billions of dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can handle this kind of thing. They're fine. They can handle they're fine and everybody else leo  So we've been talking to about the devices the more that happens locally on your device all the intelligence is now going into your phone  Yeah, it can analyze it can wreck them. It can do a lot of ad targeting  logic  Logically and to just say oh, that's the choice for ads. Give them this one. Yeah  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  related story

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One sentence is that when the media is attacking the actual  You know fundamentals of your business like the business model you have pr can't fix it  PR can help because  You're not going to change the fundamentals of your business because you don't have any incentives to do so  So no matter, you know messaging you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Without it's not going to help. So really what you're saying. It's interesting after the tech lashes not only has  tech journalism redefined itself  But it's made it harder for tech  Companies and pr companies to frame the conversation  They need to rethink how they do their job

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even when they did specify they they're you know, corrective actions  So these are the steps we're going to do to improve the issue and moving forward  Those are the future steps we're going to do even those corrective actions. Uh, as I said backlash and got uh, criticism

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting it's because it's adversarial now  But isn't that a good thing shouldn't shouldn't journalists be adversarial to the  Field they cover

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know jeff's everybody on the set when you write and I asked them of course they will say that's our job  We're just doing our job, right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're not we're not here to but no  Your attitude is the right attitude leo, even though you screw it up and mess it up all the time  But speaking for the user  Speaking for the user is a better way, right? It's not between the journalist and the company

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not out to get apple or google or facebook  I'm out to represent the interests of the people which is why I like so much near its analysis

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which he started talking to us today is that it's a power analysis and if you look at the power of interesting media v  technology, yeah  Uh, that doesn't include the public and the users and the impact and that's where we should be starting  And the problem is that if it's constantly  hostile  That doesn't help much either. I saw a newspaper somewhere in the us today said well  We're going to stop doing restaurant reviews because we don't want to hurt the restaurants  Well, okay, but you could do the best takeout things in cincinnati, whatever the city was I forget, right?  There's other ways you could do that that would serve both the eater and the restaurant  This attitude of well, i'm going to be tough all the time  That's how I show myself. Um  No, the utopian stuff was was the fanboy stuff was bad the dystopian moral panic is bad  Neither serves the public in the end is is why I so much liked the analysis that near it did

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What gets me is it seems like a lot of journalism? Uh, if it comes off as happy go like you feeling, you know warm and stuff  it's false, but if it comes off as  Uh, i'm against this. I didn't like this yada yada yada. You're too aggressive and  I don't  Is that just a societal thing or where is that because if I could speak out about a  A camera that I used and said that I didn't like it  People are going to say hey, he's against that camera  Camera manufacturer for whatever reason when the fact of the matter is that the tech just isn't there  But if I gush about the camera, they're gonna call me a panic win  Right. It's like you can't win. Yeah, you know, even though in both instances  I'm being truthful on both sides of it and I see that a lot with journalism and  Makes me wonder, you know, what's going through those editors mind and what's going through the people that are putting the content out?  What's going through their minds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so I think we need to uh make a difference between uh  Products reviews which is one type of journalism in tech and all the other coverage that is more into the big tech companies  power and influence which is a different type of  Journalism so in the product company that's still powered

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's still a product depending on the tech company when you start talking about google  Search is their product advertising is their product, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but when you're talking about a camera, for example  That's what I meant that it's a different type of you can either like the specs and their usage or not and it's different from  Uh hearing about antitrust monopoly power or content moderation. So those are different type of uh issues there  And one of the reasons that we have the tactics is because of the companies that the big tech  Bigness so they're so big and they have such, you know  Huge scale is that they're at a place of getting scrutiny if nothing else  It's because of how big and powerful they are  And it's not like they're getting less powerful the best big so the focus on them is because of uh,  They're growing power and that's the tech journalists saying we need to hold power to account and speak truth to power  And that's exactly why we're doing it now and not when they were this small startup in a garage or something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's another dynamic at play that's really playing out dramatically, which is it also has to do with power it used to be  There's there's tech journalism and there's tech companies but tech journalism like every other form of journalism has been completely  Dismantled  by uh  Kind of a more democrat. I mean there's is marquez brownlee a traditional tech journalist. I'd say no there a lot of youtube  tech  Quote people who are covering tech let's put it that way and they're not very much not in the corporate  Mold of a tech journalist of even five years ago, let alone the zd net  Ziff davis hero or the or the or tech dirt. I think does some of the best work out there  Yeah blogs are a good example podcast blogs and youtube  Uh, there are a lot more people covering tech than ever before the standards they operate with  Which this is my personal pet peeve the ethical standards. They operate with are very widely and are never really fully revealed  um  I think it's it's a different world. It's not a monolithic. You can't say there's tech journalism anymore  Uh, everybody covers tech

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't agree more the book touches the difference between tech bloggers and tech journalists a lot even though I get  Criticism for doing that i'm showing why i'm keeping the divide between tech journalists and tech bloggers in some cases  Uh, and i'm showing how I appreciate that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you appreciate that because it it's a it's  Two different worlds and two different, uh disciplines if you will going into it that  a tech commentator or a tech  Pundit just may not understand in my opinion

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the way i'm looking at it is again i'm a communication researcher is uh through the lens of agenda setting  So when i'm looking at the agenda  When it comes to product launches and the first row when we had events live  Those were the tech bloggers, right because he wanted them to the hands-on review  So they were the agenda setters when it comes to new products  But when it comes to I don't know the congress investigation about the russian interference  It will be the new york times washington post and all the traditional media outlets that have tech coverage  So that's the difference and they have as leo said different, uh  ethical  framework to work because those subjects are uh  Their importance is different or their impact is different

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's uh, it's changing so rapidly it's funny because uh  I've always it's another hot button for me. This is a very hot button topic for me neary i'm sorry  uh  the another hot topic for me is  The relationship between tech companies and their pr arms and tech journalists  Very much has been impacted by the growth of tech journalism  You know when I was uh on tv  Or writing for magazines. I was treated as a tech journalist as soon as I started doing it on podcasts  Uh, it was like  Who are you? Where I want to see some tear sheets. Do you have some there's no freaking tear sheets from a podcast  uh, it got it it really uh  I have to say tech pr is  Forgive me horrible. These people are idiots  Okay, i'm gonna stop now  Honestly, I know they're well-meaning and mostly very nice people  You don't get into pr if you're if you don't like people and you're not nice  but I don't think that they  whether they're in-house or uh  An agency, I don't think they do a very good job at all. That's one of the reasons I don't ever want to talk to them again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what the book shows is that two journalists, uh reflected on their relationship with tech pr  The other side the dark side the enemy side as you said and they said okay  So back then in the glorious days we had computer magazines and we had press releases and then you knew who was the power  Yeah, and they mainly dictated we've done a lot of copy paste. We're, uh, sorry for that time  You know professional life, but yeah, most of the coverage was promotional from those press releases and what they wanted to present  uh, but the problem is that as  They're you know them  Everybody wanted more tech information because tech became more integrated in everything in our lives  and then what's happening the power shift here is that  The companies became more secretive with limited access and then they can choose which journalists they invite for a conversation and whether it will be  You know  And then the journalist complained well if you speak critically  You're just not entering the door. You can't go there. They won't invite you to anything  And that was a lot of frustration that was like building up for years  and  Now they're glad that they uh can be both critical and have an interview  But then what happened is if it's not on background and you're inside  the ceo just gives you the you know  Pr talking points and they're not really saying anything that he wanted never they didn't want to reveal. Oh, I never interview ceos

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was offered bill gates once during a comdex and they said okay, what are your questions?  I said, I don't submit questions ahead of time. They said well you have to if you want to talk to bill I said well  Thanks for nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo hasn't been invited to apple in how many years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  2010 10 11 years  I hate these companies  I love technologists. I love geeks. I love engineers. I love technology and I love technologists. I really hate the marketing  uh  Shell around them. Uh, I just it's not i'm not a fan. So this is  I'll i'll die. I'll let you uh handle this conversation jeff because my my

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Antipathy is showing. Yeah, and I want to just want to bring up something else. So dear it was interesting lately  There was uh when the facebook oversight board released its first opinions  They um offered them on embargo, which is something leo won't do partly because he can't keep a secret  No, I make that joke about that, but I refuse to do embargoes or d or ndas

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Again, there's just there's a pattern here  I don't play this game  Leo don't play that game

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A couple of researchers, uh, and I was offered it too, but I just didn't have time. So I said don't care  um  But but one important researcher got the material the night before so she was able to write a really good report  uh for a legal blog  and  And this is fairly normal in our world, right?  but the  Anti-tech research community went berserk on her  and tore apart  uh because uh  she got uh  You know early access to the information. She still wrote a tough report. She's very tough on them  But it was fascinating to see this clash of these cultures all coming in together as everybody's now gathering around tech in a different way  Nobody the rules of all the rules we used to have don't apply anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um  I don't remember the specifics of the story, uh, but yeah, i'm trying to leave people out of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it improper for a researcher to get to get access

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so specifically if it's her  Expertise the thing is that I think you're touching is that it wasn't in the narrative what she wrote and that's where it's backlash, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the problem with something out of the narrative is that it's uh, you know problematic because you again said something important in the book  Is that the media works as a herd right? So it's this pack mentality that if the specific  Stories are the newsworthy stories and the framing is a specific framing by which we work with uh  all the other stories or framings are uh  Kind of out of the picture specifically in the main, you know prestigious outlets  That dictate what it means and what's the framing of the news?  So if you're out of  That's the problem. I think i'm touching

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I I had it back to you leo we can move on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will take a break momentarily and then we'll come back with uh more with our guest. It's really a  Fascinating conversation I have to say  Dr. Nurett Weisblad is the author of the tech lash which will be available for pre-order now and available  On your book stand march 24th tech lash book  If you want to know more on our twitter handle, which I love is dr tech lash  So if you don't mind i'm gonna say dr tech lash is with us  also anteprote jeff jarvis who is dr moral panic and  We will have more  In a moment our show guttenberg dr. Guttenberg. Yeah  Our show today brought to you by uber but a special part of uber uber for  Business, this is something that kind of speaks to me. We always want to reward our employees, you know yesterday everybody came in early at  You know eight in the morning. Thank you aunt. Thank you john.

It's not not in your beat  I know just to watch a little tiny bit. I don't know. It was so bizarre. Yeah. What do you think? I never asked you you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You left before I got the chance to ask you it it was one of those things of where I was asking myself why why?  Because it's it's nice to know that this technology was is out there but  Vr has just sort of died down in my opinion. Yes, I'm a vr skeptic. I really am yeah  And I get the potential for it. But yet at the same time, I don't see it being implemented anywhere that  Regular people are going to dive in and just start spending money on it. So that's why I just said why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have this yeah microsoft announced at their ignite conference, which is a conference for developers and  It people they announced  Really? It's not a new technology  It's a basket. This is what microsoft does lately is they take a bunch of stuff and put it in a basket. They're calling mesh  Um, but the thing that you'll most easily recognize is the hollow lens and they've augmented reality and the meetings  That some people are in  The space but some people are joining you holographically virtually  I think maybe it wasn't the best keynote because it kind of implied that all of this would be done underwater and that's  I don't think that's the case  The whole  The whole thing was kind of like what with whales swimming around and stuff  It was a little a little bit strange. Isn't microsoft always about five years behind everything else, you know, you know  No  They actually have a very active rnd  Division

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but they discovered search. I know I know I know they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bill gates didn't think the internet was going anywhere. I know  Um, they had this hollow lens this really was this is five-year-old technology  I think that's why I was mostly disappointed. Uh, hollow lens was invented almost exactly released almost exactly five years ago  Two years ago the last update  And nothing since then see this is exactly what nureet's talking about. I am a skeptic. This was a great thing five years ago  Now just more big tech more big tech implementation  Don't need some type of nice implementation. Well, it's the case nureet that a lot of tech companies  um  This is one thing that has changed and it's not just donald trump's election or whatever the  The seminal events were it is the case that when technology was young  There were a lot of green fields and a lot of uh, easy fruit to pick  But now here we are in a mature time and the phone is pretty mature and you know  What we do is pretty mature and I think tech companies  Don't have the luxury of saying oh, well, that's an obvious next thing to do  They're they're they have to work harder and and we as customers are not being very helpful in telling them what we want  So they're I think they're throwing  We have an expression in the u.s. I don't know what you say in israel. We throw spaghetti against the wall  You might throw hummus against the wall and you see  Hummus always sticks so that's not good. Yeah  So you throw spaghetti against the wall and you see what sticks I feel like tech companies and this is a really good example  um  This is out of nowhere. They're going what's the next big thing?  What's the next big thing and a number of them have come up with this idea that it's augmented reality slash virtual reality  And a lot of us users are going really?  Do you think that's let me ask nureet this because I want to get her opinion. Do you think that's something that's  uh  Also the reason for this tech lash. I mean, it's not as easy as it used to be sure sure so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The back specifies the book specifies that it's not only the you know  Reckoning from trump election or the bigness that I mentioned  It's the accumulation of many issues at once that created this tech lash  So, uh, it was also as you said data breaches and sexual harassment and discrimination. So we had that issues happening  but also and you touched it now is  Uh, it's not the innovation journalism we used to have because  We used to be really enthusiastic, but everything that is new  and exciting and now we're  You can see it in your episodes of uh this week in technology and google and all the other  Things that you read the news and you say  That's not that big of a deal. It's not exciting and it's so what's new  It's not as exciting. It used to be because those are like small  Uh changes to things that you already uh used to and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were so excited. We were so excited to go to an apple event  Uh in 2007 steve jobs announces the iphone and it's like  I mean as journalists were supposed to be sitting on our hands the whole time  And it was everything I could do and I think I failed not to leap to my feet and cheer  Uh in 2010 apples announces the ipad. Uh, you can think of these important  And so there was a reason we were cheer-leadering these were really big innovations. It was innovation. They were break

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh break things those are groundbreaking breakers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so let me try another theory then  Even when facebook just started it was this small startup doing something really really good connecting people  Yes, and when netflix started we stopped with the envelope and moved to streaming  So those are all new  Big huge thing that shifted our usage of technology, but now it's just  Got used to it and we take it for granted now. It's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  tiktok and then snapchat no beard filter is the hot thing  What he's got no beard  Oh, well, he has a little beard down at the bottom. That's disgusting  And that's how it's hard to get excited about that neri, I mean it really is hard  You can only get so excited about c shannis we do a pretty good job around here, but go ahead i'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tik tok musical that's another matter. That's a different matter. Yeah, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was watching windows weekly earlier and and I liked your point about timing, you know  Had this been announced last year with the whole mesh?  Would it would it have made a difference because of where we were as a nation and everybody's just trying to get used to this whole being  shut, you know sheltering in place and locked down and not able to get out and see people and  You know the same way zoom took advantage of it. You know, do you think it would have been better? I think it would have yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean you also have the problem that this stuff takes a while to develop. I don't  It's hard to know what's going on inside these big companies. That's I think another thing  I don't know if you covered this at all neri, but the challenge I always have  Is uh, you you tend to personify companies like apple and microsoft and google?  uh you you you because we don't see into  What's really going on and we don't for me because I don't get to know the people  behind this intentionally  We we kind of anthropomorphize these corporations we ascribe motives to them that really aren't  Corporate motives. They're human motives. We you know, we say apple's trustworthy, you know, uh google's shifty  Facebook's evil those aren't really  accurate  and so it's hard it's  Do you consider that at all and one of the problems that tech journalism faces is  We're we're mostly not business journalists  So we don't really know how to think about these companies and as a hangover from the old days when we were cheerleading  We still have this notion that apple's is  I confront this every time we do mac very quickly that apple's somehow this magical company that will take whatever field it decides to do  The next big thing and and will revolutionize cars. Yeah  And that's not true. It's not it's it's a it's a it's a terrible expectation to put on a company and it also  Hurts your ability to interpret what they're up to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So most of it was on the shoulders of the founders and ceos  So the cult of personality was mainly about  those geniuses doing those new innovations and uh  Make the world a better place right? That was the narrative  of the years and  now  I would say that the tech journalists when they look at those uh tech ceos  They want to take them down from those. It's a good problem  Right because we don't want to be this problem exciting everything  So now we're gonna say that you're evil and you have all those other uh incentives

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like we're like jilted lovers  We got our hearts broken  We're in the divorce phase  You know because I think a lot of people still think  apple steve jobs  Microsoft bill gates facebook mark zuckerberg google larry and serguei there. That's the personification  I don't know if that was even true back in the day  Because microsoft's a company with tens of thousands of employees  And many many managers and and many executives becomes a company no matter what a company is a company

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's all pretty little company do yeah, I have another theory here. I want to play this off near it  Pendulum I buy and I think that's right. But as you say the pendulum doesn't go back into it all in one way  I i'm in as i'm as i'm dealing with gutenberg  Um, sorry, that's a drinking game everybody drinks gutenberg  We go from the early day of the technology where wow look at all the things it can do right and then we go to  Uh-oh look at all the things it can do we got to control that and then the next phase I think is  Where we're starting to head into I don't know how long it will take is. Oh, that's boring  And then then what happens is oh what can I make with this?  All right  Well, you know it struck me that I said this on the show many times that it took 150 years after the invention of printing to  Event the newspaper  That was that was creation not in the technology of printing but with printing because printing by then was everybody knew how to do it  It was boring. There was no big deal. You know, the 30 years war was over  Now innovations on top of it started to come and I think we're a long way from that, but I wonder if it's not  joy  To horror to control to boredom to invention that's not a different cycle

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So one cycle that I think uh, uh  Analyze the things that way you did now is a gartner  Cycle when they're talking about the threat of disillusionment that first you are really enthusiastic about something and then  Oh, no, look at all the unintended consequences and how it's bad and then after the up and down  It's kind of get to a middle ground that yeah, we handle it now and we use it and forget about it  so, uh different technologies go through this  Cycles and I think social media now is in the oh no  What it does to society face and I think you're looking at the escape  Of having more middle ground and good luck with that. I just want to mention real quickly the uh, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Launch is going on right now  For uh, elon musk's star, what is it his starship go ahead and show it john the rocket that will be going  Uh, you can show it john. Do you have it?  There we go. It's just launched and in about four minutes now remember it's done this several times successfully  But in four minutes, it's going to do the turnaround  An attempt to land and the last couple of times it's exploded on landing  Which spacex was quick to point out. It's not a failure. It's not a failure. It just blew up  Uh, so we'll watch with the interest to see it looks like such a such a different, um

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  focused spurt of the  Of the fire at the bottom you think there's a noticeable difference  Yeah, I think it usually is kind of it's much more condensed. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, and of course the fins on this are  The fins in this are the significance of it. Uh, we don't know they haven't said anything  The fins are designed to help it do the flip and landing  Procedure but this is the vehicle that will bring humans to mars  Uh, it probably tomorrow. I think elon said it'll happen. No thursday  Uh friday it no that although elon has said he's going to build a hundred of these vehicles this year  So he's really planning an exodus  to mars  So, I don't know. Should we stick with this for a little bit john? I want to see the flip

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The flip is imminent at some point in the show today leo. I have an assignment for you. Yes  I want you to explain nfts to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I do want to in fact, uh, and we'll mention this as we're waiting for the flip and landing  Um my friend explain it to me too. Yeah  So the story with nfts which stands for non fungible

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tokens so a dollar bill is fun. That just rolls off the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It makes sense if you think about it dollar bill is fungible, right?  It's infinitely fungible one dollar bill is exactly like any other and it can be exchanged for any other  It's completely fungible non fungible tokens are one of a kind. They cannot be exchanged for anything else. The idea is  Well, if you go to nba top shot.com you're buying an nba highlight  Which have sold for hundreds even thousands of dollars and you have the one and only  Not copy I get I don't know rights to it  artworks been sold that way elon musk's, uh,  I don't know what to call her  Baby mama, is that okay the mother of his children?  child  Uh, it's a fact partner partner fine, but I don't know if they're still partners to be honest with you  The only thing we know for sure is they had a child together  Anyway grimes. She's a kind of um outrageous, uh,  Perform rock star performer sold  Uh  An unbelievable five point eight million dollars worth of her artwork as digital digital versions as nfts  um in 28 minutes  So that's awesome. So she made now what you know  I've been mentioning this story a couple of times and shows what I didn't think of is well  Who spent three hundred thousand dollars for grimes digital artwork and then I realized I wonder if she knows anybody with a lot of money  Me  Who can move markets move markets, I mean to elon musk  Five point eight million dollars is nothing that's cigarette money. Okay, the rocket is uh smoking  So I think it's either is this good john the smoking?  That's fine. Okay  It looks like the cigar I smoked last year anyway the  These nfts are all the rage whether it's artwork nba top shots nba  Highlights, uh, you may remember remember we talked about crypto kitties a year or two ago  These were digital cats that could interbreed and people were spending millions to buy this is pure speculation  That's I think the bottom line. So trey rackliffe my one of my friends and a great photographer  Today in fact, I tried to get him on the show. I haven't heard from me. He's in new zealand. He may be asleep  Said I will send you let me see if I can find his email. He said I will send you  One of my of artworks is an nft  I said  Oh, it's coming down. It's coming down. It's flipped. It's flipped. Let's see what's going on here  So it's got to flip over obviously so that it can land

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This feels like we're watching camera work buck rogers. Yeah, exactly. It's flash cordon. Yeah, it's what Gordon in the 21st century

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huh ha ha  You save every one of us. Anyway  We'll keep watching this while I talk that's fine. No, no, no this time don't lose the password, huh  So he said I wanted to offer you one of my burning man photo nfts as a gift for being an awesome dude  Thank you trey. You can do whatever you want with it  One idea is to auction it off for a charity if you like, but hey, it will be a little blockchain gift for my friend  And I said I promise not to resell it. I I don't know what I can do with it because do I print it?  Well, I mean what can I do with it, but I do promise not to resell it  but what i'd like to get do is get trey on and explain this because obviously  He's got a handle on whatever. This is this nft

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thing non-fungible tokens. They're the opposite of dollar bills. What struck me about it. I was trying to get my head around it  You know, you know, I learned that at the beginning of copyright  The argument was this is good for authors  But what it really did was the the bookseller is one of the authors to be able to own it so they could sell it  To the booksellers and then it made creativity into a tradable asset  Yeah, although so I wonder in this case

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh look at this. It's come. Oh, this is so buck rodgers. I cannot believe this. Oh, I see now. Jesus  Oh my god. So this is where of course is it gonna do it failed in the past  But you know elon he's gonna figure it out  They gotta land exactly upright. Otherwise, it won't stand and I think it succeeded  ladies and gentlemen  Starship  Has landed six minutes and 27 seconds into its flight. It's still burning at the bottom. I don't know  No, that's just I think it's dust. You know a lot of the clouds. I didn't know this until I  learned something  Uh our water vapor in on these launches. They use water vapor to cool the launching pad  And uh, so a lot of what you think is smoke something's burning down there still standing something's burning  That's you know, that's the the the jet little jet the little jet as long as it doesn't get bigger it's getting bigger

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're gonna see uh, you know, i'm going out there with a bird

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As nutty as he is he's really amazing too at the same time. Yes  I don't know. It's he's as confusing as non-fungible  tokens

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still look at that and just marvel at just the  The brains behind making that happen yet you go downtown pedal and people can't parallel park

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually if you had a tesla it would parallel park for you  peta mula  Should I play that is that too that's just inside baseball really  Um, so  The story behind this one is that the city of the town the little town we live in of petaluma  Banned gas stations first gun town in the in the country to ban gas stations  um because uh, well part of the reason for doing that besides the fact that  Uh, I do believe that um  Um  I'm looking for the uh, the clip here it is up here, right? Is this it? No  No foreign fans allowed at tokyo olympics. Oh, that's komo. Yeah. Yeah, so um, let me open this up  So just as the setup, uh,  Of course electric vehicles are big in california and they're taking off  And california has said that will only allow electric vehicles in the coming decades  But also here in petaluma we have a number of areas in downtown that  And you don't even know this but there's a big area in the downtown that can't be used because it was a gas station  When I moved here it was a chevron station and the tanks leaked as all gas station tanks do and it can't be  Remediated except for millions of dollars so nobody can use that plot of land  There are three or four of those in petaluma old gas stations that are gone, but the land is useless  Yeah, you told that yeah, I think it's a good thing  So this is the story, uh from komo news because our city council which had a two-year moratorium on building gas stations  Finally said, you know, we have enough. We don't need any more no more gas stations at petaluma. Here's the story

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One west coast city is banning the construction of new gas stations city leaders in the northern california town  Petenula believe this is the first span of its kind in the u.s. What?  What

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, that's where we live in petemula  All right. That was just inside baseball. There was no reason to do that. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. All right  We'll get back to the we'll get back to the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We do here do you have it's irrelevant we do it do you have a take on these nfts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is just wild

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had just one thought really stupid crazy one when you talked about uh, elon musk may be fun than it  Uh, i'm binge watching, uh breaking bad  So there is a period where walter white to launder his money  Uh using sol goodman to have a site  That his son actually, um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Made for a donation to walter white. That's right for his cancer treatment, which he doesn't have right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He doesn't have right is his money with uh, actually a russian bot  That's right  Normal people in the u.s. Paying for his cancer treatment, but it was actually walter white and his money using sol goodman  So that's the only thought I had

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lindsay lohan sold an nft for 59 000  Mark cuban says you rich richer you got to invest in nfts  This is a grimes art piece death of the old this sold for 400 000  You know, but somebody pointed out we were talking about this on twitter on sunday and there was lance unonoff pointed out  You know, this has been going on for years in the fine art world  In the art business is a basquiat. I don't think basquiat's paintings are that gorgeous, but they sell for  tens of millions of dollars because it's speculation

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's it's uh, but yeah, so the problem is that it's it may it may to me  It's the last gasp of the property metaphor that copyright started  That acts as if as if creativity is is a tangible thing as opposed to an act  And and if you look at pardon me and ratatouille the musical  There were many contributions  I'm gonna bring this in every time I can and i'm gonna get us a new drinking game

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's in the drinking game like and yeah, you have to drink if he says it  Don't do it. Don't do it and can't stand. Um musicals. So that's why um

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So so but but there was a string of creativity there  Where everyone got to contribute to it?  Disney for once didn't stop it because they recognized as I said in my tweet that value redounded to their rat  Uh, they they created value because no one owned it  Instead everyone contributed and everyone benefited according to their desires  Maybe it was just attention. Maybe it was making the musical happen. Maybe it was it was feeling smart with your friends  Whatever it was. It was a different structure. Whereas nfts seem to me go the exact opposite where they make everything into a tradable property  I have it you can't yeah. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here is a painting i'm going to show you a painting  This is a basquiat  You like it? Yeah  How much how much you think it's worth  Uh, I would have coined that that doesn't include the person walking by it by the way just the painting  That's 110 million dollars  110 million dollars sold at auction at christy's a couple years ago. Wow just to give you an idea  Selling my daughter's paintings. She's five and a half. I bet you can make a lot of money near it

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Looks like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She says yeah, it looks like  So line 78, um  Elise swaps is someone actually i'm trying to get her on on hands-on photography. I met her a couple years ago. She's an  Instagram influencer and I know she doesn't really care to hear that but she is  She has an nft and it just sold a couple hours ago for about 17 grand  You know, she just  Uses her iphone because she doesn't like to use her camera  She uses her iphone to snap photos and to edit photos and make them all  Mystical and funny. Oh, they're beautiful really cool. I love this. She's a super talented creator and  She decided to jump on this and sold her first one today  And i'm looking at that and it makes me happy to see that a creator is able to i'm a little nervous

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some money for the art, but this is a cinema graph right ant where there's a still picture, but some of it's in motion  correct and um  So that's problem number one. You can't put that on the wall  It's it's uh, you can't even can't even print it. It has to be digital  For it to be perceived  so what nfts have solved in at least this respect is  Using blockchain you can be the unique one and only owner of this  Document it may be infinitely  Reproducible because it's digital. It could be perfectly reproduced infinitely, but only you own it  And so it's up to you whether to reproduce it. I guess  But blockchain allows that because ownership brings rights. Yeah under the copyright rule. Yeah, so block blockchain allows that that's all  NFTs all use blockchain to prove ownership as far as I know  I don't know. I don't  Uh, and this is another problem to read in tech journalism when you get to my age  You've seen it all it stops making sense  It's like I don't I don't understand this at all and I kind of understand how older people felt  Back in you know, 1984 when the magentash came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And stuff like that. So what's happening here is that the pixel is actually  Uh adding features for dive case  Connector, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bit network, I think it was developed specifically for when you're on a low bandwidth connection like changing  Life and what you just saw and heard in action was it compressing the sound of my voice in real time?  To the point that it could run at three kilobits per second and still sound like me  This means it could even work on an old dial-up modem operating over a landline  last year so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of a of a deep the best I saw you know that that that old lady who who restored the painting horribly

It's not their heritage  Uh, they're a profitable uh company. Let's let's people test your dnd their dna and then track their family lineage actually  Okay, so it's just like ancestry.com. They're they actually have 62 million users  Uh, this is the second big selling a sale of a dna company though  Of course 23 and me did a spack merger with uh, richard branson's richard branson's  virgin group  um, so  I think this is also a little clarion call that there are the companies are starting to buy up your dna  Just a little word of note  Did you see the 17th century letters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That were I was good. I'm glad you brought this up. I watched an entire hour-long presentation today from the the scientists who did this  So these are letters there's a stock of 3 000 of them that didn't get delivered and you could not  Really buy envelopes pre-made until the 1830s  So what people do is they folded the letters up in an origami way and then tucked it in or sealed it with wax  And so they have these letters and if they open it up they ruin it  So they they used phenomenal they had scientists from around the world working on this project  they had an origami expert from mit who supervised the  Algorithmic I didn't know that scientists who work with him always fascinating. So cool. They had three  Three people who understand early handwriting  Um, they had two it was it was a special scanner that normally done for dental work  And so they managed to take this little thing and scan every layer of it understand what the order was of the turns  Because it can all be different because in other words, they're trying to read this without without opening it because as you say opening  It's just right. They read the text  Wow, so so I was just I was I was mesmerized today watching these these scientists and humanists talk about this  Academics just like near it. They're the greatest people, right?  They actually do real work and real research unlike us who blather  um, so so they they did all this so you can unfold this now then then  As I said, there's about three thousand of them because there were there were two places that had the same name  One at the hague and one in france and things got misdelivered and so they just sat there for years and years and years and years  A whole bucket of them  Then there's other stuff like when ships would get captured by the british navy  They would have the bag of mail from the captured ships  Some of those are still have been untouched not even taken out of the bags  In all these years, so now this allows  Uh research to go into all these artifacts  And without ruining them understand every layer understand the order and read the text on them in the ink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anything uh, any stories, uh, I missed  Um  There's quite a few. Oh, I thought you would be interested because you live in near new york. You work in new york  this is  from dna info.com  nicole levy who is uh  Uh the writer but is is writing about the research of a guy named gabor zell  Who is uh, no, i'm sorry  Craig neville manning. I'm sorry. I apologize. I give credit where credits do gobb or zell tweeted it but craig  greg neville manning  as the chief technology officer at google's sidewalk labs  He takes the uh  Four or five train normally in new york city, but he took the six train and he noticed something very interesting about the streets  Uh on the stops  they mirrored  The conversion from fahrenheit to celsius  If you follow if you know the 10 minus 10 degrees celsius is 14 degrees  fahrenheit then follow the new york city  six train uptown  the  23rd street is  Minus five degrees 32nd street zero third street 32nd close enough, right? Okay. Okay  Oh, you actually know the streets 41st 42nd. Oh, yeah, you do grand central station, right? 51st street  Well, it's close. It's 50th 5010 degrees 59th street's accurate. Yeah  68th street, that's where hunter college college. That's 20 degrees 77th street  It's 25 degrees send it 70 grade celsius  And the 86th street where you can by the way  Change to the four five train is 30 degrees celsius  I don't know if there's any meaning to that at all  I don't think we're we're assuming that the subway new york subway planners knew that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, so I got one more question for nirit if I may yes, i'm eager to hear her thoughts about  Facebook and australia

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and who came out cover that yet. Yeah, there's some evidence that in fact  For the few days that facebook was not referring people to australian news products  There was a 24 drop in traffic to those australian news sites, wow  Imagine that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a classical case of them. If they do them if they don't which I know jack use this sentence a lot  Because we saw the different reaction google versus facebook, which again is because they have different business model in relationship with publishers  Um  The way it covered was of course everything facebook do is is wrong  So no matter what they would choose to do. Uh, that was the framing and what I think that is  interesting here is that  When I spoke with tech journalists about their dependence  on the tech platform  they said  well, it's not like  If you're looking for it being the reason why we're tough on them because we are blaming them and we are dependent on them  No, that's not the case  We are actually in some ways grateful because they give us a lot of traffic  So google actually pays our salaries and like half of our traffic comes from google  So it's not like that. We're mad at google because of that  So when they were honest, they were actually saying no, their relationship is really beneficial for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So but rupert murdoch's not so honest, obviously he doesn't want to he doesn't want to hear that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, when you know when they're when they're attacking the tech platforms, they're also attacking their competition

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right wall street journal doesn't like google  Uh murdoch doesn't like facebook. Yeah  They're there that's that's taking money out of their mouth. Not anymore though

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think I think you're damn if they do damn if they don't analysis is right. It's pretty accurate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
