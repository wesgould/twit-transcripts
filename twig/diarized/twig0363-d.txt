Transcript:  The Bond Buyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're bringing that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey Stacey, great to see you.  We did not post nor allow anyone to make a ringtone out of your expostulations last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I sort of appreciate it.  Sorry I encouraged someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I felt bad actually in hindsight.  I thought, oh, probably this, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You didn't hurt my feelings.  I was just like, oh man.  It's going to haunt you.  This is the first thing that comes up for the rest of my life.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to be like, dang.  No.  So it's not, it's dead.  I've asked many times for a copy and I have declined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tell, I will still get excited about things on the air, you guys.  I promise.  Oh, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the only thing I was worried about.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's unallayed enthusiasm.  That's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I like about you.  You're enthusiastic in the face of these old, a couple old guys who are seen it all and  are bored by everything.  Yeah, that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll rename your show here, Leo.  Watch out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are those two old guys in the Muppet show?  All right.  Bernie Sanders and Jeff Jarvis is also here, president of journalism at the city university  New York blogger at buzz machine.com.  The author of many a great book, including geeks bearing gifts and public parts.  And what would Google do?  Hello, Jeff.  So I don't know what to start with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You got Russian hackers.  You got Apple earnings.  You got just all kinds of news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard to know where to begin.  Twitter, Twitter did well, but not in the stock market.  They didn't have much growth.  Only three million new users, about 1% growth over the last quarter.  That's not making the stock market happy.  They made money, but they scared the stock market by saying it's getting it's harder  to sell ads than we thought it would be.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see their commercial?  You want to see it?  It's helping people understand Twitter, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was trying to, I was a mixed thought about it.  I don't know if it is really the thing people experience in Twitter.  Did you see it, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't.  I don't have television.  Oh, you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not it.  It's, it's a, that's it.  Isn't it?  Well, I'm, I can't, I gotta scroll down.  This happens every time I play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the, that's the animated gift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a flaw in the next webs website.  I can't, you, you had the same problem, Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  You can't scroll down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's because they have this lame anime.  You can't either?  Somebody ought to tell them the next web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's really inconvenient for Leo show.  Is it convenient for everybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're trying to watch.  There's some, there's supposed to be some ad that's like two or three sites where that happens to me.  Boy, but the web is really broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I'm going to be in favor of AMP.  AMP, yep.  They shouldn't really use AMP.  The web is broken.  Anyway, so the idea is Twitter is where it happens, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is what's happening in the world.  You know what's happening in the world.  That's right.  Is that why?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's happening?  And then showing tweets in many languages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's happening in the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Versus the Olympics.  What's everyone talking about?  Trump and Clinton.  Game of Thrones.  What's trending?  Hamilton.  Means they had to go to Spokane.  How did it start?  Black Lives Matter.  Well, this is true, right?  Yeah.  Didn't Del Rey Mckesson say that Black Lives Matter started at Twitter, started with Twitter?  Is this going to drive people to Twitter?  Love, not hate.  See what's happening in the world.  Well, you know, it ties into, too, of course.  They're now doing Major League Baseball, NBA, basketball, NFL football.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what I'm thinking?  I think Twitter is the new Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's a curse.  Maybe Marissa could go over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we're going to see stories.  You know, what is Twitter?  Just like we saw stories about what is Yahoo?  I love Twitter in a lot of ways.  I don't in other ways, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Twitter is really interesting and I think in many ways it mirrors the Internet.  It is simultaneously the best and the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's hard to monetize as an open ecosystem.  It mirrors the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I rest my case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that commercial, like Twitter is, it's great for journalism.  It's great for if you really legitimately want to know what's happening.  But I don't think that many people in the world, like a huge swath of the population,  they're looking to the Internet still for entertainment.  And how do you monetize news?  No one knows.  I mean, that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're right, Stacey.  A lot of people, what they do on Twitter is they look for stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That didn't really do that.  And yeah, so like show me a Taylor Swift's latest beef with Petey Perry.  And then I'd be like, hot day.  They're not going to show you that.  But that's like Instagram and even Snapchat.  Look at what Kim Kardashian did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but this is where Twitter is at a disadvantage because unlike Snapchat and Instagram,  it's many, many things.  So there's black Twitter, right?  They didn't.  I mean, they mentioned Black Lives Matter, but they don't talk about the cultural phenomenon that is black Twitter,  which is much more than Black Lives Matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the thing that Mark Zuckerberg, he said, I think he said it to me years ago.  No two people on Earth see the same Facebook because you see your community, your language,  and they kind of make the point with the languages.  But it's your own world and you can make it what you want to be.  But that means you got to work at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, first of all, you can't make an ad, especially a 30 second ad that's going to show all the things that Twitter is.  I think this ad has one single purpose, which is to say Twitter is.  And I think this is absolutely one of its greatest values.  The place to go to see what the culture is doing right now, what's happening right now or a slice of the culture.  Let's be honest.  Well, many slices.  The problem is you don't see all the slices, right?  But if you look at Facebook, ever done an ad?  Oh, yeah.  Remember the chair?  Facebook is a chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, if you want a bad ad or an inscrutable ad, that's it.  At least this you can't say this is wrong.  This is what part of what it's just it's just a part of what Twitter is.  But it's one of them.  It's one of the best parts.  You know, there's actually a whole bunch of people upset at Twitter because of the DNC leaks slash DNC leak hashtag.  I don't know.  Put this in air quotes scandal.  A number of people tweeted me and said DNC leaks was trending and Twitter pushed it off the trends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've heard this one so often.  People say, surely this is trending.  Surely this is trending.  And we haven't heard that in a while.  But but again, trending does not mean most popular.  Trending is a is a mysterious formula.  Isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's specific to is it specific to the people you follow in you?  I've always wondered that kids.  Well, it depends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have their settings.  Market.  Yeah.  OK.  So you can have global.  You can have us.  You can have it.  They used to be able to have local.  It's geographic, which would be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's trending among your friends?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the evidence that people use and by the way, the chat room is convinced that Twitter pulled it down.  How did it go from the top of worldwide trends to nowhere like that?  Does that happen ever with other trends?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember this is a I remember this.  By the way, it was replaced by a DNC leak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And some say, well, that was to down to reduce it.  They split it or something.  I don't know.  I did.  This is this is similar to the argument that Facebook is is creating the the feed to promote an agenda.  And the latest one that broke this morning is that Google has when if you Google presidential candidates that they fixed it.  You can't you can't do it anymore.  But if you this morning, if you Google presidential candidates, you would only get three out of the five.  You wouldn't get Trump and you wouldn't get Gary Johnson, the libertarian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's because those those elections were already done.  So they were still in primary mode until the convention was over.  The way the algorithm works, it was wrong.  But there was a reason behind it.  They fixed it.  Well, the original the original one had Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you did this, if you did the search for presidential candidates, Trump, Clinton, Sanders, Johnson and Stein, who are all the major party and a couple of smaller party candidates.  And then this morning it was just the three Clinton, Sanders and Stein actually say, why is Trump first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, yeah.  Why is Trump first?  Not by party, not by my last name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because we have two Democrats.  I don't know.  This is this is a land this is landmine.  This is a mine for any of these companies.  And I would guess that Twitter, Facebook and Google bend over backwards to try to make it nonpartisan.  But it's very hard.  And algorithms being algorithms are unruly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I just wanted to so that if you looked at most popular pictures of Donald Trump, it would probably be his huge face in that with that with that, you know, odd Orwellian huge face behind him.  How do they end up choosing the pictures for things like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you always see that.  No magazines do that.  Right.  We've seen that in the past.  Remember the Sarah Sarah Palin cover.  Was it a time or Newsweek that was very unflattering?  And these are flattering.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'm saying is if you just went to the most popular pictures to research, I'll bet wouldn't be flattering.  Maybe they go through the campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe the campaign websites is where they get it from, because that's a slight like trusted source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is a flattering picture of Donald Trump?  I'm sorry.  Well, he loves any picture of him is probably good for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'm just saying that because he is a very has a very expressive face in his and almost all the pictures of him are grimacing or shouting or he's very expressive.  It all comes out in his face.  So you don't have any kind of posed unless there's a big eagle.  Opposed pictures of of him.  None of the magazine pictures make it because they're copyright.  Maybe I don't know.  I don't want I'm not an apologist.  I just I think that it's tempting to see a trend where none exists.  That's the human brain is designed to do that.  And you'd be crazy if your Facebook, Twitter or Google and under all this scrutiny to ever attempt something like that.  Or would you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, what's happening?  What's happening?  I wouldn't even trust an algorithm at this point to do a lot of this stuff.  I mean, because would you trust a human?  Well, yes, it depends on the human.  But yeah, you'd have to have some really you know how journalists used to be objective and we used to like not vote and all of these things.  Just going to be like you'd have to have someone who kind of subscribes to that set of beliefs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I agree with you, Stacey.  I think that there has to be I've argued to Facebook.  I would argue with all these companies.  And this sounds so professionally egotistical that they need a journalist there.  But my point is they need someone who makes decisions based on principles to serve the public, almost a public editor, editor.  They shouldn't edit, shouldn't select things, shouldn't try to organize it.  But when there is a choice, somebody sits back and says, what's the best thing for the public here?  As opposed to at the same table, somebody is going to say, what's the best thing for our brand, which they should.  They'll be there.  Somebody else has to say, no, you miss serve the public.  That's a bad thing.  And they need that discussion, which I don't think they're having.  There's like three stories in this was rundown about Facebook taking things down.  What about the leak email issues?  I don't really understand the story.  One about news footage from child torture and one about a diverse lingerie model.  Nothing revealing, but for some reason, they took it down.  And I want to know what is their sense of principles behind this?  Why are they taking down what?  And I don't and is it to serve the public or is it to just dodge as many controversies as they can?  Which I understand.  I understand.  But now that they're in a role of distributing news and informing people, you know, if you take down pictures of transgender models, you're saying something about transgender models and you've got to face up to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is yeah, that's the question is who's who's your public when you're an international social media that has a billion people with many viewpoints.  And I don't know.  I wouldn't want to be them.  I wouldn't want to have.  But maybe they need like a public.  Maybe they need Margaret Sullivan.  Leave the Washington Post.  They do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what they needed.  Yeah.  An ombudsman, a public editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's also someone who actually as opposed to a Margaret Sullivan or now Liz Spade, her replacement, who from a distance criticizes the New York Times.  Instead, what they need is somebody inside who explains the principles of journalism and the business of journalism to Facebook and in turn and explains Facebook to the news industry, which they need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if that's do you think that's going to make Facebook money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think that's I mean, well, that's what people accuse both Facebook and Google of.  They say that their agenda is not is only what makes them the most money.  I don't think it's what makes them the most money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can say that of any company including a newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's always true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Always true.  But I think, Stacey, I would argue that in the long run, if people start to depend upon them for information, then being more credible and trustworthy and predictable about that information is a good thing for the brand and ultimately the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I feel like generationally, we no longer trust our I think the era of trusting in a news source is probably gone.  Does that make sense?  So like you don't even look at your websites or start your actual newspapers free of bias anymore.  You just have to suss out what they are.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. So that's a transparency.  So I think we're saying the same thing in the long run.  I don't think that Facebook or anybody has to say that we are the new objective.  They're transparent.  And they just as Facebook a few weeks ago put forward its principles behind the newsfeed and said this is how we decide what goes in the newsfeed in a very general terms.  But it was a good start.  Similarly, and they do have standards.  They do say no naked breasts period up except for breastfeeding, except for post surgery.  So they've you know, they put that out there.  They don't care.  These are the rules are.  Well, they've got to do a good job of being transparent about those principles and their enforcement of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's tough.  Once you become an arbiter, it's so tough and you're always going to make you're going to piss somebody off because whatever guidelines you use are going to it's going to be upsetting to somebody.  So that's why, you know, really, Twitter, I'm sure would like to be completely not participant in any of this and just say they censor the least.  Wouldn't you say?  I mean, you get breast.  No problem on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was the discussion last week about Nero.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was why it was such a shock that they banned Nero because I can't remember them banning anybody before.  How about this one?  Google getting a lot of criticism.  This is an article in The New Yorker for deleting a literary blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We got criticism last week for not bringing this up, but the story had just happened.  It just seemed to me that we just didn't know enough.  But now I agree.  It's definitely a story because I don't hear any good reason.  I mean, Google also believes in the in the in the portability of your data wide for some reason they didn't want it there.  A again, transparency.  Why not?  And then B, let the guy export all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Dennis Cooper is a writer.  He has a blog.  It's a Google blog called The Weeklings.  It's got a lot of fiction on it.  Some of it is challenging.  There's sadism.  There's self-destruction as homosexuality.  It warns you before you go in as as all blogger blogs do if there's adult content in there.  And he's been writing there for a long time.  In fact, it's been his and this is why it's significant.  His chief form of publishing for a lot of this stuff.  Now, of course, Cooper should have kept backups of everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nevertheless, I don't do I don't have backups.  What I put on medium.  I don't I haven't backed up Jeff.  I didn't back up what I did years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you make a backup of your content, Jeff?  On medium.  You don't know how many times we have to tell you you don't own it if it's on some other site.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I got to Kevin Marx would spank you right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, Kevin Marx would be up.  And this is like everything Kevin Marx stands for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I Kevin might just simply say, well, but yeah, we've been saying that.  Of course, if you're posting on Facebook or Twitter or Google or anywhere, it's not your site.  Now, a blog is a little different.  Yeah.  And that's why it's interesting.  I got my blog.  Yeah.  Because this was his blog.  Now, admittedly, it's run by Google and it's a free service from Google.  But you always think even if your blog is hosted by somebody else, it's my content, my blog.  Google not only deleted the blog in its contents, but killed his Gmail account.  So they actually deleted the account.  So he has no way of going to Google Takeout and getting the content back.  That's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Google's lack of transparency.  The press, I mean, New Yorkers write about this and they can't get an answer to Google.  This is a failed Google.  There may be some reason.  But be transparent about your process and allow someone to export.  Those are principles that you've espoused before and you're failing on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And a blog is a little different because people assume that's my blog.  My blog's on Squarespace.  Now, admittedly, it used to be on SoftLayer.  It's on somebody else's computer.  Are you backing that up?  Of course.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you have everything set up now for?  I have everything backed up now.  NPI.  I've always had everything backed up.  But still, you think that's my blog.  That's different than putting a post on Facebook, which you know could be taken down.  Anyway, Google doesn't have much of an answer.  They speculate that it was because he violated terms of service, but Google doesn't even know.  And she talked to Dennis Cooper and he doesn't want to say it's censorship.  He thinks it probably was due to violation of terms of service, but he was not told.  And he doesn't know why they deleted his Google account because that's not part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's when there needs to be some kind of due process as a legal term, not a service-oriented term.  But you want to know that if you go over the line, you've got some chance to rectify or leave or whatever.  Some form of justice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  According to this, Google hasn't really talked to him officially.  And his lawyer. He hired a lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's what the New Yorker got.  Regarding your inquiry, this is from Google's press team, we're aware of this matter and not able to comment on specific user accounts. Thanks.  So the reporter, Krasinski, also emailed the same Google employee who tried to help Cooper.  And she advised, she'd been advised by Google to refer all press requests to the press department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you speculate on any legal world where they would be forced to do this?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, maybe if Cooper was going to sue them, like once Cooper got a lawyer, maybe Google was like, oh, shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, now they're going to, yeah, maybe now they had to clean them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, yeah, this whole thing, if it was a mistake, it's a mistake that's gone too far.  And now they're like scrambling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It kind of reminds, all of these are of a piece. You know, all these stories are of a piece.  These companies are huge and they wield kind of a lot of power.  The other side of that, flip side of that Twitter ad is you're also now the Journal of Record.  So with great power comes great responsibility.  And I don't blame them because we're in a new world.  And nobody's ever had a billion and a half customers before.  You know, it's just, it's a new world.  And I understand why this is difficult.  Let's take a break.  Jeff Jarvis is here from CUNY.  He teaches professionalism.  What's professionalism?  He teaches journalism, professional journalism, or I call it projournalism.  And what's happening with .NYC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm doing kind of a rethink of it.  And just today I sat down with Andy, our producer, and we're going to try some different forms over the next three weeks.  We're going to experiment with some different forms and figure out what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How can people find out when you're going to do a show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're going to do it on Wednesday noonish.  And follow my Twitter feed and I'll promote it.  And then we'll have a .NYC show Twitter handle and a .NYC show Facebook.  .NYC on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Show.  Show.  .NYC show.  I think so.  At Jeff Jarvis.  And noon Eastern on Wednesday.  Good.  And you do it on YouTube live and Facebook live or just Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're going to try Facebook live for a while and see what that works out.  At this point we are experimenting.  We're going to try two or three different forms because I think as we discussed, we haven't found our niche yet.  It's hard.  We're going to work on that first.  It is very, it's much harder than I thought.  I have just been extremely lucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you're talented.  When we launched this show we just we picked the right people and the right time to do it.  And it just did very well out of the box.  You know though Jeff that we've canceled more shows than we've.  Oh yeah.  Than we do.  It's kind of normal.  You know you try stuff.  No one has the formula.  So you just try stuff.  Stacey Higginbotham is also here.  She is, what were you assembling earlier?  Some sort of Bluetooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a, this is a Silicon Labs Thunderboard React, which is a tiny little Bluetooth thing that's got an accelerometer, some LEDs and I'm going to stick it on a, what's this?  It's a model car kit.  Oh fun.  So this is what my daughter and I are going to do this afternoon after the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh man, you are the best mom.  Oh.  This is better than the boxcar Derby.  Yeah.  Do you do any IOT stuff with your Tesla?  Not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tried out the Eve stuff that we talked last week.  Yeah.  We talked about last week.  But other than that it's not very easy.  The Tesla is not easy to connect to things and I don't really want to hack my car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah and I don't think they encourage it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, Elon gets pretty testy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't even get to it on the TV on the browser.  No, I mean that's not a real browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You shouldn't be browsing.  Who started the wind while you were driving?  You should be browsing while you're driving.  True that.  Hey, let me tell you, this autopilot thing has really hurt Tesla owners.  You know, we're trying to get, we have car insurance for it, but they initially the deductible  was 3000, they've raised it to 6000 and then our agent today said, you're not going to  use autopilot, are you?  And we said, yeah.  And she said, oh, that's going to be a problem.  They see that it not as a positive, which I think it is.  It makes you a better driver, a safer driver.  It saves you.  It saves lives.  They see it as a negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, because the first trials, the first cases will be legal hell for whatever insurance  company gets a loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think you could make, strongly make the case that driver assist is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree with you, but you know how that's going to get challenged in court.  If you're the first insurance company that goes down in this case, I don't know.  The expense you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And well, have you priced it out in other places?  The other thing is we noticed when we told our insurance company that we were getting  a Tesla, he calculated as a P 85.  So the performance version and I just have the normal 85.  And that actually dropped my costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, because you don't have insane mode.  But but I think this is new is what I'm saying.  I think because of that big story and the number of stories about autopilot failure,  failures, yes, all of a sudden this is becoming an issue.  And I think it's a $3000 deductible was now $6000.  No, you don't have a choice.  It's now $6000.  And I don't know what they're going to come back to us, but I don't know if they're going  to refuse us insurance because we say we're going to use autopilot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Autopilot is the pit bull of auto insurance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's going to be it's going to be I mean, I think Tesla is going to have a problem if  they keep people can't get insurance because of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who's your who's your person?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all around.  We do it.  Well, so it's a it's a it's a corporate lease.  The company owns a car.  And so it's our it's a company that we've been using for all of our company insurance  all this time.  And we use an agent.  So they'll shop it.  I'm sure if they can't get but I think it was the agent who said, oh, we're going to  have a problem here.  And I and you can't lie and say, no, I'm not going to use autopilot because because if  you do, Elon knows and you have all the liability.  Santa knows.  Yeah, right.  I never lie to insurance companies because that's a great way for them to deny you coverage  after the fact when you need it most.  Right.  Oh, unbelievable.  Wow.  We live in an interesting times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think it was Volvo and maybe you're the chair.  I'm saying Audi also did this, but they claimed that they would do they would keep the liability  or pay for liability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I suspect that's what Tesla will have to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does that fit with Elon's big plan?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He wants to.  It's vertical integration of everything.  The leasing is through Tesla.  So actually, which is also was also the case for Volkswagen, Audi.  They have their own finance and GM does to GM AC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would bet that Tesla drivers as a group are they're older, they're richer.  You don't want to crash a hundred thousand dollar car.  Exactly.  I'll bet they're actually a decent risk.  You're you're older and richer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you're younger and richer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I also bought my news, so I'm not even when you said you graduated from college in 2000,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I went, oh, wow.  Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.  Well, you're the you just brought down the demo.  Stacy Jeff and I are going to 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's when I bought this shirt.  Yeah, I'm not going to come.  You don't like my Gecko shirt.  I like Geckos.  OK, that's close.  That's a start.  I'll take that.  Our show.  Hey, speaking of Internet of Things, our show today is brought brought to you by my  Internet connected doorbell.  You might say, why connect a doorbell to the Internet?  Oh, I'll tell you why, because this doorbell has a camera and a microphone and a speaker.  And when I installed the ring video doorbell, man, it changed the way I think about.  It's not it's a I don't you know, I literally if I didn't have this now, I would feel like  I'm in the dark.  I now know when anybody comes and goes because you doesn't have to just ring the doorbell,  just the motion sensor.  So somebody comes up my my steps.  I know it.  I have video of it and I get a notice on my phone.  When somebody rings the doorbell, I can I can talk to them.  Actually, even when they're caught, the steps I can talk to them.  I can say, is that package for me?  Leave it right there.  Our Russell RIT guy was saying he uses his because he gets deliveries every day and he  just tells the delivery guy the passcode.  You know, you can see they're in a uniform.  You can see the truck.  So he knows it's real.  He tells them the passcode.  Just open the door and leave it in there.  The ring video doorbell is awesome.  Not just making your house safer, but just giving you the it's the quantified front door,  giving you the information that is so valuable.  Now we've got these great bundles.  I want you to take a look at the Ring of Security Bundle Kit or Pro Bundle Kit because we can  get you fifty dollars off.  It includes a ring video doorbell, either the regular, which is what I have.  That one has a year battery and the new one is a little slimmer because it doesn't have  the battery.  So it has to be for a wired doorbell.  It's also got 1080p video.  You also get an additional camera.  They call it the stick up cam.  You could because you could put it anywhere.  It's wireless.  It's a and and it even comes with a solar panel so that you don't even have to have power  for it.  You just connect the solar panel, connect the camera, put it where the ring don't shine.  So you have the ring in the front, the stick up cam in the back.  Now you keep an eye on your whole property.  And by the way, the stick up cam, just like the ring video doorbell, lets you not only  see, but also hear and speak to visitors.  So that's awesome.  They'll even throw in one of these chimes.  That is really handy because it plugs in any power outlet.  It's like another chime for your doorbell in your house.  So if you don't hear your chimes, if you're in like the, you know, the potting shed or,  you know, out back, you could put that chime anywhere.  There's a plug and now your doorbell ring there as well.  It is just great.  Now we're gonna get you fifty dollars off the kit right now.  If you go to ring.com slash twig, T W I G, whether you get the bundle or the pro bundle,  fifty dollars off at ring.com slash twig.  Join the hundreds of thousands who protect their home with ring.  Many of you, I know viewers and listeners of our shows, we love the ring video doorbell.  Give it a try.  Have you tried the stick up cam?  Yeah.  Have you tried the stick up cam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  I have one coming, so I'm eager to see how that's gonna.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should get one.  I wanted two or three actually, because I would like the sides and the back.  It's so easy.  You want to use the doorbell in 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And some cool AI software to stitch it all together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A panorama of your house.  All around your house.  Peace.  Will peace reign in Europe with Google?  They got a good decision in France, right?  France said Bing and Google are not liable.  They do not have to pull down search results to return BitTorrent links.  That's the first good news out of Europe in a long time.  They've had a long time, yeah.  You wrote a piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got invited to write a piece on the European Commission Vice Presidents,  who is in charge of the digital one market stuff that they're doing.  And so they asked me to write a kind of op-ed on his blog.  Wow.  Just arguing because they know of a different viewpoint, but I've just simply said it's time to move past war footing to business footing.  I think Europe is hurting itself by this constant war.  And what's the response been?  None.  Some Europeans on Twitter said, linked to it, but some Europeans on Twitter also said, Google fanboys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy, I think you're so right, though.  I mean, I think it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm dealing with, I think there's a chance to build an ideal relationship, to negotiate, to be diplomats.  And I'm dealing with Latin American publishers who, one came, I don't know if I ever told the story on Twig.  One came to me some time ago and said, you know, we're thinking we're not happy with Google and Facebook.  We're thinking about doing a war like we did in Germany.  And I said, it's been done.  Why don't you try to develop a model relationship and have a mutual benefit?  And Google, at least Google so far, responded well.  And there's the start of good talks.  So Europe could find itself in a case where the tech companies just kind of write them off, not in business terms,  but in terms of ever trying to go to them to do new things and collaborative things.  Now, Google, meanwhile, is very hopeful about their digital news initiative and their development fund.  They're not happy when I call it a blackmail fund.  And good things are happening.  I think they can.  But if the EU keeps spreading the Leistung Schutzrecht across all of Europe, which they're now basically threatening to do,  and constant antitrust and the right to be forgotten and all this stuff, I think Europe is hurting itself.  So that's the point I made.  That was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We didn't mention Facebook's stock results.  Good earnings.  Excellent.  Wall Street loves them.  The stock is soaring.  These results came out today, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right before show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right before the show.  So I haven't had a chance to review them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think there are now a billion, was it a billion mobile users now?  Geez.  What's the number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they were at that already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They were.  There was something I saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This graph is fascinating.  Average revenue per user.  Worldwide, they make $3.82.  That's per quarter on a user.  But of course, that's worldwide in the US and Canada.  $14 a user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my gosh.  1.7 billion users.  That's insane.  Sorry.  No, I'm just looking at like their total users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $13.82 times 1.7.  And then you get a number.  Yes, they're doing okay.  1.7 billion active users.  They're pretty much, I don't know if there's more growth available at this point.  Oh yeah.  Why do they have to get to drones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why they're trying to bring internet to more places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, okay.  But right now, how many internet users are there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, let's not even just look at, okay.  Are there 9 billion people yet in the world?  Where are we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somewhere like that.  But I think there's 3 billion.  Total internet users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, 3 billion internet users.  I think they want that to be 6 billion by 2020.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's so obvious why.  Because they're going to hit the ceiling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, then from those people, you should be able to continue growth.  I mean, they'll keep buying new platforms that provide a lot of activity and growth.  Like, you know, Instagram and WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  6.44 billion in revenue.  97 cents per share profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  23 billion in cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's nothing compared to Apple.  You know, it's so funny because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's not compare it to Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, it used to be that, you know, you have a couple of billion in cash, you're doing pretty good.  But Apple set this new benchmark and now 23 billion.  Oh, shoot.  But that's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is.  It's not outdated centers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Importantly, it's a fund for buying stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and their stock is still great.  So they don't have to even really...  Spend money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Spend stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook Live going great guns.  Washington Post has now a full-time, more than one, I think, Facebook Live producer.  Their sole one and only job to produce live content for Facebook.  I found that interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they have two positions.  Now, of course, Facebook is paying various publishers, including the Washington Post.  Oh, so this might be Facebook money.  I think a good portion of it is.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So why not do it?  Right.  Facebook, if you want to give me some money, I'll hire some people.  Oh, yeah.  I would do that in a heartbeat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But why not devote people to it?  Yeah.  I also find it fascinating.  I was at a newspaper two days ago.  The need to publish natively to platforms and specialize in those platforms is putting another huge burden on these guys and what they do.  So you also have CNN is hiring a full-time, I think full-time Snapchat producer.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is Snapchat paying for that?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Snapchat does pay some organizations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if you're in Discover, they do.  Social publishing.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the weekend Snapchat producer.  Yes, the weekend.  Implying there is a weekday Snapchat producer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's another one, Leo, I didn't put up.  There's a trunk job.  You remember the trunk video we made fun of?  Yeah.  There's a trunk job listing.  Tribune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chicago Tribune Online.  Like assembling other content job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The army of bots.  Chief plagiarizer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aggregator.  You'd think they'd have the pride at least to change the description a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They think it's, no, well, they do.  Where is it?  Okay, here we go.  Here we go.  I got it.  Content specialist.  Oh, yeah.  Hiring a dedicated individual to join our team to develop and support our news content  harvesting robots.  Harvesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Harvesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was it.  And classification and management systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Harvest other people's content and turn it into separate the wheat from the chaff and  turn it to a fine loaf of news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They are an industry leader in providing content solutions to the global information marketplace  and with its innovative content ingestion classification and delivery platforms.  And someone said, it eats it up and it shoots it out.  If you're making the metaphor to ingestion, guess what?  The link up here.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what we've come to.  It is.  Chicago Tribune is now trunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just put it up in the.  Yeah, we see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So your job is to develop, maintain and upgrade content harvesting robots, develop and refine  news ontology.  Most people I know don't know what ontology means.  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tagging.  In this context.  No, tagging is taxonomy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's tagging.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's a content structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they misusing the word ontology?  I think they are.  Ontologically they are.  It's a branch of metaphysics dealing with the nature of being, not taxonomy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they are.  They're misusing the word.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, because ontology is when you talk about like, remember the semantic

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  web?  Yeah.  So ontology is in the semantic web are classification systems.  I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Information science.  In computer science and information science, an ontology is a formal naming and definition  of the types, properties and interrelationships of the entities that really or fundamentally  exist for a particular domain of discourse.  So it's a practical application of philosophical ontology plus a taxonomy.  Let's not use the language as a brutal instrument of subjugation.  Let's be inclusive.  Fifth grade words, please.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't even believe I brought up the semantic web.  The semantic web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whatever happened to that?  I don't know.  Let's ask.  Timber's Lee's dreams.  I think it's been I think it's there.  I think we're here.  We're some don't get Kevin Marx started on it.  That's all I can say.  No, no, no.  Where is Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me explain.  No, I love Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yahoo.  Let's talk about it.  $4.8 billion, not including Yahoo Japan or Alibaba, the really the valuable parts of  Yahoo, just the intellectual property, the properties like Flickr and OMG.com.  Are you sad, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just I'm just Verizon buying content in your carriers.  This is their strategy to avoid kind of a dumb pipe.  You get new revenue streams from ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that what Netflix and Comcast are doing?  They're becoming creators.  Well, nobody wants to be a dumb pipe.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I just it stresses me out that they're involved in my my particular industry, I guess  media.  So I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Verizon is not the most beloved company in America, but neither is Comcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Once they have DreamWorks, they will be.  Oh, God.  DreamWorks, Universal.  Really?  Are they buying DreamWorks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know they I know Comcast owns Universal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Comcast put in a $3.8 billion offer for G Works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that right now I'm hanging my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mark this moment.  I'm going to defend Verizon.  What?  Not Verizon Mobile, but Verizon.  I have files.  I love files.  Right.  And so I'm a huge fan customer.  It works well.  A few weeks ago, two weeks ago on the show, somebody mentioned maybe it was Twitter, but  for some reason Frontier is an oh, well, did I find out my poor parents in Florida is moving  them into retirement home.  All we had to do is move their phone from one place to another.  We are weak to do it.  Frontier was awful.  My sister, who is a Presbyterian minister, was driven for a half hours, four and a half  hours on the phone.  She was driven to tears and cursing.  Not the cursing is that uncommon for her.  But you know, it makes a good story if she's a minister.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Presbyterian is a little more lenient.  A little more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So then I hit town.  They're still nowhere.  I go berserk.  I finally wrote an impassioned email.  I found the emails of the executives, you know, big mistake, put it into the VP of customer  service or customer relations.  I sent her at 9.50 to work credit.  I sent her at 9.15 at night an impassioned email.  My parents, my mother's diabetic, my father, one of them is deaf.  They can't move.  This is a lifeline.  And I'm out of town.  9.15 at night, 9.30 she called me to her credit.  And you know, they all bump it up to the president's office.  So, you know, do that.  It takes more days.  They don't get it done.  They can't get it installed.  They don't show up when they're supposed to show up, even with the president's office  involved.  Then they do install it and it works for 12 hours.  And then they moved it back to the old house.  And so I said, that's it.  I've had it.  And I'm going on Twitter and people are saying, oh, yeah, they are the worst.  Everybody hates him.  Everybody hates him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should hear Southern California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, then.  So then I want to.  That's it.  They're in Bright House territory, which is just bought by charter.  And so I said, that's it.  We're moving them to Bright House.  Bright House couldn't get the number.  Three days.  I had to get back on the horn to the president's office.  Unbelievable.  I mean, the VP was very nice, but if your staff just can't do it.  Somebody said in Twitter, oh, get a hold of Kevin Rose.  He had to go to the president's office to get anything done.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But let's to be fair.  So what is Verizon sold its Southern Florida franchises to Frontier?  And the same thing happened.  I'm going to make you wish for Verizon.  So I have one request, Verizon.  I'm now in Fios territory.  Please, Verizon, please.  All is forgiven.  I will say nice things.  Don't sell me to Frontier, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To be fair, it may not be entirely Frontier's fault.  Verizon may not have done the handoff very well.  You understand?  I understand.  Their data may not have there may have been a mismatch in the formatting.  The data may not have, you know, it's the same thing happened in Southern California.  I don't know who to blame.  And I hate to defend Verizon.  So you mean Frontier?  Either one, Frontier or Verizon.  But we don't know where the where the when you have a handoff, it could be either side that could have caused.  I don't know how long ago the handoff was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Verizon bought or sold to Frontier in like 2008, 2008.  Hold on.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.  No, no, no.  This is this is more recent because this transfer happened from Fios to Frontier in Southern California about two months ago.  I suspect it's related or it's the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they did a big package.  I think they added to it in one of their.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been an ongoing thing because remember, we talked a little bit about Frontier buying Verizon's Fios installation anyway.  That's just so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So here's a story from the Tampa Bay Times from April.  Can Frontier regroup efforts, bundle Verizon Fios takeover or will this get ugly?  Give me the answer to that question.  It's ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ugly.  So Marissa Meyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  There's a consumerist from actually 2016.  So yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is this is a nightmare in Southern California because I get I'm on the radio down there.  I get a lot of calls.  Marissa Meyer says to Yahoo's anyway, I'm not going anywhere.  What?  That's not true.  No, there'll be a time.  Fifty million.  What is it?  Was it fifty one million dollars?  Golden Parish.  No, come on.  Plenty to stay till the end of the month, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, when's the actual closing?  Wouldn't you have to stay till the closing?  Yeah, she'll stay to the closing.  Well, when's the closing?  I think the closing is until like 2017.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I presume there's got to be regulatory approval.  Maybe not.  They're not quite in the same business.  The problem is, of course, Verizon owns AOL.  So maybe there is an issue.  If it looks, I made the joke, Verizon looks like a collector of old Internet properties now.  Like they're buying, they're snapping them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the LA Times had a story about Verizon getting some Silicon Valley real estate with this deal with the Yahoo.  So I thought that was kind of interesting.  I was like, oh, Verizon.  I mean, they've got they've got stuff, but it says they get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So real estate is included.  Oh, I thought it wasn't going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.  Well, yeah, what does what does Yahoo need with a campus?  Meier says she couldn't be more proud, couldn't be more proud of her achievements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I'm still going to defend her to the extent that she had an impossible job.  Utterly impossible job.  But OK, I don't know what I would do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you be would you be touting the great job you did, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think her point is compared to what it was without her, you know, her her what was that?  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The mobile tripled the mobile base, six hundred million monthly active users generated a billion dollars of mobile advertising in the year gone by invested in and built our mobile video native and social businesses from nothing in 2011 to one point six billion in gap.  She leaves out, you know, didn't really bought Tumblr, didn't really make anything of that.  Really weren't able to turn around Yahoo mail or Flickr, the kind of jewels in the Yahoo crown in any significant way.  And really, the most of the value in Yahoo came from their prescient or maybe just lucky acquisition of steak in Alibaba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the big mistakes that Yahoo were made before her tenure right now.  No, I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we even said at the time she must have seen this as a challenge and a worthy thing to sink her teeth into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I've got to criticize for anything.  It's the hubris of thinking that you could fix Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But why not? She's got nothing to lose.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's you know, that's when women CEOs are often brought in.  It's when the company is like, true, just nothing can be done.  So you're like, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's not when you bring in chainsaw Al Dunlop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are the ones you want to have turn around.  But think about it.  I mean, there's Meg Whitman at eBay.  She did actually really well.  That's interesting.  Sorry, Meg Whitman at HP.  HP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was not great.  Carly Fiorina at HP.  Well, she was different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just thinking of companies that are in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Meg did go to eBay later.  Right. She's at eBay now, isn't she?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She at eBay now?  Yes. So I was thinking about her at HP.  Right.  That was just an untenable position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  HP is another company that just was unmanageable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just put another link up.  Marissa, I think really to your point, Stacey, an important point.  Called out media for the sexist coverage that she had to suffer.  Really?  And then others. Yeah.  So you'll see it in the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? I mean, look, believe me, I see sexism everywhere.  And I'm not a supporter of it.  But I thought she got pretty intentionally pretty even handed coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think about it.  I'm trying to be gender blind and believe tech is a gender neutral zone.  But do think there has been gender charged reporting, she told the Financial Times.  OK.  We all see the things that play that only plague women leaders, like articles that focus on their appearance, like Hillary Clinton sporting a new pantsuit.  Right. I think all women are aware of that.  I had hoped in 2015, 2016, I would see fewer articles like that.  It's a shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If she were a man, though, I think much of the criticism would be exactly the same.  I mean, if a guy are in there, didn't turn around, it wouldn't call it a shopping spree necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, you're right.  I mean, OK, I admit that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's probably not the right phrase to use.  But I also think it's look, Jerry, Jerry Yang didn't turn around either.  No, I don't think he was treated any better than Marissa Meyer was.  Yeah, I want to brag about one of my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say a double standard like you got to be you got to work twice as hard and twice as good.  She's going to go be raked over the coals far more than Jerry Jerry Sanders.  Jerry Yang was for freaking not selling to Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, I mean, I think so.  I put it as I want to brag about one of my students, one of my brilliant graduates named Jenny Avens, who's at courts, who did, I think, a brilliant job about talking about the headlines.  Hillary Clinton's husband wore a fetching pantsuit to honor her nomination.  Oh, that's terrible.  No, it was brilliantly done.  It was really fetching pantsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  It's a parody.  It's a parody.  OK, women are covered.  No, that sounds like a headline you would see, frankly.  I thought it was a real headline.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's on court sentence.  It's short. And it's I think it's I put the link up on there.  It's really well done.  Props to Jenny.  Yeah, I like the the fake Hillary Clinton medium post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see that?  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was just you can't you can't show it on your own.  It's so profane that I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it was it was hilarious.  Freaking awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've been doing my homework for 30 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me remind you, F'ers, who I am.  What the F is your problem, America?  I'm Hillary.  Goddamn Clinton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I also noted that it originally said Hillary Clinton, and now it says Hillary Clinton.  Oh, it didn't say parody.  Yeah. So I'm glad I'm glad.  I mean, this is an medium is apparently stepping in and good.  It should say parody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It should say parody doesn't it doesn't diminish it in any way to say parody.  It resolves a momentary and it would only be momentary confusion.  So as you start reading it, you go, oh, that's obviously a parody.  That is not her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Although that I bet if you got Hillary Clinton drinking this and talked to her about it for real, I'm sure that's a similar.  She's got a similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why it's funny, because I know this is what she's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm so jealous.  My son, Jake, met Hillary in New Hampshire and actually had a conversation.  He worked on our campaign.  Our campaign.  My sister, the Reverend Jarvis, just got invited to a reception with clergy in Philadelphia for Hillary on Friday.  I'm jealous as hell.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm never going to get an invitation now that I'm known as a sexist pig.  It's over for me, but I'm voting for.  This is my favorite one.  I've been preparing my whole life for this job, F'ing job.  So stop making me dab on Ellen and just give me an effing chance already.  And there's a picture of her on Ellen learning how to dab.  I guess that's a dance, the kids dance.  And it says, F'ing kill me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But we make we make politicians do sillier and sillier things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bill Clinton played the saxophone on our senior.  So what was it Obama on that show where you survive in the wild or something?  No, it was what?  Why is he on?  Yes, he's on some reality show recently.  Don't you have something better to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's been on like late night television and FLOTUS has done Carpool Karaoke and Billy Eichmann and.  But FLOTUS is a little different.  Obama did Between Two Ferns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was awesome.  Did he do Seinfeld?  No, he did something where he had to drive around.  He did.  He did.  Mark Maron.  Did he do Seinfeld?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mark Maron.  Yeah, he did because he had that great Corvette.  Yeah, he wouldn't do running.  I thought he did do Running Wild with Bear Grylls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's the one thing he did.  There was only one thing he wouldn't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He didn't want to get too wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the very fact that he was on that show was bizarre, especially since he wasn't running for office.  I understand when you're running for office, you kiss the babies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But now he's in WTF mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems like there were more important things to do than run around with Bear Grylls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  Did you watch the FLOTUS Carpool Karaoke?  No, I have watched everything starting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Corden is great.  It's a terrible show.  I tried to watch the show and it's an awful show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you see they've just done a spin off.  The Carpool Karaoke is very, very good.  They're spinning off that with other drivers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, it only works because of James Corden.  Exactly.  I hate TV.  I hate TV.  So she wasn't even in that.  Wasn't James Corden doing it with her?  It was. It was. It was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This case, I would say they just announced after that a spin off.  OK.  I think it'll be an on air.  I mean, on web spin off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was up to your favorite YouTube stars doing Carpool Karaoke with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, maybe you could do it.  Oh, or who was that?  Something.  You could do Carpool Karaoke in your Tesla.  Yes, yes, yes.  Did you see I didn't think I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I talk about the Bill Gates interview with was it Neil Stephenson with the in his Tesla.  Did I show you that the most awkward?  Did I not do this?  Yes, it was very awkward.  Yes, Stevenson, the author.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  It was it was so unintentionally painful.  And it's in his Model X.  It's in the Gates Model X.  And and they did it in 360 degree because it wouldn't be enough just to be talking to.  But the thing that was awkward was like the whole thing was awkward as hell.  It was just really weird.  So it just shows you that's flattering camera angle.  Well, it never is not no wide angle.  Not good.  Yeah, Bill apparently really enjoyed Seven Eaves, Neil's most recent novel.  And I did, too.  It's very good for a man.  Let's see.  I'm just going to add that from now on for a man just to kind of balance things out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll sort of keep you honest for a white male.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty surprisingly good.  Twitter is going to not only stream football, they got MLB, Major League Baseball and NHL hockey.  Twitter is becoming the go to sports leader.  Right.  No.  Why would you watch it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They just promoted now watch the convention.  So I clicked on it on Twitter and it's CBSN.  Yeah.  And it says we'll resume in 100 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.  Because we're in a commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, but that's like what MLB does on MLB.com.  Yeah.  I mean, snack time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it for people like you, Stacey, who just don't own a TV and so you want to watch TV on Twitter?  I just really don't understand it.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't watch TV.  I just don't have cable.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't watch anything.  But if you wanted to watch sports, you have to watch on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would Chromecast it if I wanted to watch it on Twitter.  OK.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, Leo, I couldn't do this on my Chromebook.  You're on a real machine there, right?  Yes.  Google Omnitone Surround Sound Project.  I couldn't get the demo working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I don't have flash, but let me see.  Maybe it's flash.  I think it was.  As long as it's not flash.  Where can I?  I see a lot of articles about it, but I actually want the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's on the rundown and there's a link to.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do I have to wear my?  It's web based VR.  That's the thing.  It's web based.  Do I have to wear my helmet?  I don't think so.  Spatial audio.  Oh, yeah.  So the idea.  Kind of been under I think under played in VR is you really good  audio makes a big difference.  It needs to be as three as immersive as the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  My.  You remember Sarah Bartlett, our dean, her son has made this his specialty.  It's a brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody put on your headphones and which one we should we do?  Forza in prevista or resonance?  Let's be classy.  Let's.  Let's be classy.  All right.  Drag the screen to hear the spatial audio effect.  Press play to play the video.  OK.  Oh, now it's coming from the right.  Now it's coming from the left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, this is like those surround sound.  THS surrounds.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's like eight simulated speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's kind of fun.  Oh, my God.  Now we're looking at someone's bedroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so he's in front of us.  I'm going to move it behind us.  She, I think she hit.  Boy, she should have really picked up before she did this.  Now she's behind us.  Can you tell she's behind us?  Can you tell?  Can you tell he's behind us?  Can you tell he's in front of us?  Can you tell he's not made his bed?  Can you since you're there?  This is terrible.  Is this really what they thought?  Oh, you're not getting in stereo.  It's working for me.  I was going to ask, does it work for you?  You're not getting in stereo?  It's not behind you now?  I have one earplugging.  It's totally working.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's totally working.  Oh, now he's in a church.  Suddenly the bed got made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was like, what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is pretty cool.  So this is exactly what immersive media needs to do, which is come from now we're in a burnout warehouse with graffiti on the wall.  OK, let's go back to the gallery because I'm not I'm not getting this man.  Let's go the first time.  But I've seen that this is cool.  Now this definitely works.  If you go to Google Chrome, that GitHub dot IO slash Omnitone.  This is VR Playhouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And to you, I like this music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now she's singing.  She's in front of us.  Now she's tell me where she is.  Can you tell she's on the left?  Now she's behind us.  This should work with stereo.  This does not require more than a stereo.  I can't remember.  Do we put this out as a stereo podcast?  I think we do.  I think we were going to we were going to start doing it.  You could find out more.  Earplugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you're not.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Open Source.  Yeah, right.  It worked.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder if it works if you like Chromecast that to an actual surround sound system, if it plays that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the point I would guess is that is for VR headset using using.  Using stereo headphones and modern imaging capabilities, you can simulate surround with only two speakers.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Without having all the channels.  It's kind of like Doppler.  Is Doppler doing something like that?  No, they're doing.  No, sorry.  Not dope.  Yes, Dolby.  But no, Doppler is a startup that got 24 million, but they're actually doing pulling out noise cancellation for specific noises.  Like when you're when you're talking or listening to someone on a conference call and you're using your headset, they actually filter out like sirens and everything else.  And anyway, nice technology, but very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of this is computer technology using.  Yes, yes, it's it's it's simulating these effects and doing quite a good job because hey, computers, they're smart.  They're getting there.  They're getting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not getting much smarter.  If we talk about Moore's law, is Moore's law being broken again?  Again, they're saying they're saying we've got until 2021.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I just point out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said they said we would only have till 2010 a few years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it we are.  But it will live on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  But it will live on.  Transistors will stop shrinking.  But Moore's law will live on because we have new technologies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  3D stacking, cooling, there's quantum tunneling.  That's really interesting.  I saw a company that is doing a new transistor based on what was it?  Quantum tunneling and something else.  And then did you guys see in Gadget had a story about atom scale storage?  I don't know if you all saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's where the original concerns about Moore's law, even Moore himself said at some point, and we are very close to this, we're now down to I think 14 nanometer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we're 11 on certain memory chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So at some point, quantum effects become an issue and you can't go any smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, if you want to talk about leakage and quantum effects, I am your girl.  Are you the queen of leakage?  The queen of leakage.  Yes, that depends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you mean, Stacey Higginbotham?  How did you become how did you how did you become an expert in all this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I covered chip manufacturing for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No kidding.  Wow.  So tell us about quantum effects.  Do they not become a problem as you get down to eight or nine nanometers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, there's still a problem.  It becomes more expensive and you have to use these crazy things like doping.  And you you've got FinFET technologies where you create like, what's the word I'm looking for, 3D transistors or you kind of not stack the actual chips, but you create different shapes on the transistor.  But the whole point is as you move your transistors closer together to cram more of them on a chip, electricity that you need to conduct the signals, it starts.  You can't control it as well.  And we're talking at widths that are, let's see, what is it?  Ten nanometers is like a thousand.  Is it like one one thousandth of a human hair?  I mean, this is ridiculously small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ten nanometers, according to Scott in the chat, Scott Michele in the chat room, is 18 to 20 atoms.  There you go.  That's tiny.  Geez.  That's tiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that's what we're talking about.  So things just get crazy.  It becomes much more expensive.  Your yields go down because these things aren't going to be, you know, you can't manufacture them in a way that's consistent.  And there's also the idea that outside of storage, where you could do a lot of cool stuff, you may not need that many transistors and the processing power.  It may be better to like split it up over different chips.  There's all kinds of other kind of technologies we're looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The wall we ran into really before that was really the clock wall that we really weren't able to get past four gigahertz in processors reliably.  And Intel was kind of surprised by that.  That was the whole Itanium fiasco.  And I think that that was Intel's response was, well, OK, fine, we'll just give you four of them or eight of them or twelve of them or twenty of them or thirty of them or whatever.  And now, of course, Intel's being eclipsed by ARM, which is not clock speeds are slower, but there are other techniques being used that improve performance.  And I think you're right, Stacey.  I think performance isn't really the issue for most of the stuff we do right now.  There are other issues like power consumption.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks to virtualization, you can actually split up a job pretty easily among many cores.  I think we talked about this last week anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't think we did.  It must have been you and Tofa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I must have been doing something else.  So once you've got, sorry, virtualization, you're doing you've got this massive server that's doing like dozens of small jobs.  So you can actually split that up between different cores.  And that was why ARM thought they were going to have a play in the server space.  We did talk about that part.  Yes, you're right.  So they've done a bunch of things like in containers actually kind of now that we're all talking about, you know, various containers that actually changes it a little bit.  Yeah.  Docker, Kubernetes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, and now Pokemon Go uses Kubernetes, we think, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that why it doesn't work in Google's cloud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the issue is not.  So that's actually a good example of really where you run into problems scaling is not processor speed, but transactions and handoffs.  And so that's that we we don't know.  Nobody's talking.  But the thought is that that's one of the problems Pokemon goes having is it's got all these transactions between maps and OAuth.  And it's just a very complex system.  And that's why it's so difficult to scale it.  You can't just throw more servers at that because you got you got all these handoffs and there's bottlenecks.  We had a great segment on the new screensavers on Saturday with nobody in the know, but people who work with scaling servers and things like that.  It's very interesting.  Atom scale storage that you were just talking about.  Sixty two terabytes per square inch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. And let's stress right now before people get too excited.  This is research level.  This is not something you can buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But isn't it amazing?  I mean, we've seen this.  I mean, I thought I remember saying on the on the radio that, oh, you won't be using a hard drive in the year 2010 because hard drive.  I think it was actually the year 2000.  Hard drives will be eclipsed by some other form of 3D storage or solid state storage.  Hard drives went much farther than we thought.  And now I think we're looking at solid state storage.  This can go much, much farther than we thought.  It's really impressive.  These technologies, we find more and more ways to squeak out performance.  It's really impressive density.  They're using their coding the data using a scanning tunneling electron microscope to shuffle chlorine atoms on a surface of copper.  Creating data blocks where QR style code markers indicate location and whether or not they're in good condition.  This is how you get 500 times the density of the best hard drives.  What?  What?  You can buy a 10 terabyte hard drive now for a few hundred dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But imagine if you had that storage on your phone or imagine if you I mean, you would have to rewrite.  You would have to rewrite your coding and programming language because you'd have nearly infinite storage.  It's kind of mind boggling.  And speaking of quantum tunneling, which oh my God, we were.  Yes.  There's a company called Amorphix.  A-M-O-R-P-H-Y-X.  And they filed for a patent that basically.  Let's see if I can do this.  I was reading about this and I was just like, what?  It replaces the semiconductor based transistor with something else.  It's it's the amorphous metal hot electron transistor.  So that's what their patents filed for.  And again, they're using quantum tunneling to to create these new types of transistors.  So I have I have many questions for them and I want to know way more about this because it looks fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are in a situation, though, where this top technology isn't we can't even understand it, let alone recreate it.  And if the handful of people that understand it and make it disappear, we'd really be deep to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, think about I mean, like we've had CMOS for God, how many years?  Yeah. Was it 1970?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, I mean, if you if we can standardize around something else, that's a big if since there's so many options out there, that'll be I mean, it'll be a new generation.  And we'll we'll get the basics will be down and then the fun stuff will be all the software and how to like optimize it and all that great stuff.  But first we have to get there and everything will have to kept cold.  I don't know if you notice that, but quantum computers need to be kept in like superconducting.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then these quantum tunneling, the making of these crazy chlorine, whatever things they can only operate at like negative 77.  Is it Celsius or Fahrenheit? Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's cold at that point. It doesn't matter.  Celsius and Fahrenheit coincide at 40.  So it's 77 Kelvin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kelvin. Wrong scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really cold.  Negative 300.  Kelvin starts at that starts at absolute zero.  So that's really cold.  That's almost absolute zero.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are these are made in very specialized places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you know the Fisherman's Wharf area in San Francisco has 70 Pokestops?  Each of them tomorrow night, each of them will have an active lure on it between six and nine.  Means that this is the one place in San Francisco you do not want to go tomorrow night.  It will be swarming with Pokemon Go fanatics, thousands of them.  And I'll tell you, we have a park with three lures on it and you can barely move.  So this is going to be nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not a friend of mine today from London who was with his teenage son in the south of England on vacation to go to the beach.  And the kid got all the Pokemon there were to be had around and begged to go back to London.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hashtag wharf Poké Night.  If that becomes trending on Twitter, you'll know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saw people out on the streets of New York right from the start and doing Pokemon.  I have not seen it for a week at all.  What?  I know.  It's over in New York.  I think we're the cool place.  We've reached Poké Peak.  Poké?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No stuff.  Well, we'll see what happens tomorrow night at the Fisherman's Wharf.  It's the Wharf's Poké Night.  6 to 9 p.m.  75 Poké Stops with active lures.  It'll be a... and you know who's sponsoring this?  The local businesses.  Why?  Because they're going to attract thousands of people to have drinks, have something to eat, do a little shopping.  From Pier 39 to Ghirardelli Square.  And of course it's free.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I'm tempted.  I want to go down.  I'd like to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Camera.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  I think anything else you guys want to talk about before we get to the picks of the week?  I want to leave time for that because Stacey's got something extra special.  And so do I.  I have an unboxing.  Something came today in the mail.  Ooh.  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm just curious about your opinion and Steve's opinion about the Kremlin and WikiLeaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, we talked a little bit about it yesterday, but the news continues to develop on that one.  And it seems very clear at this point that the Russians did hack the DNC's servers.  I mean, even the FBI and national law enforcement is saying that.  The other thing that I found interesting was Assange, who had...  I didn't know this, but in an interview a couple of months ago said, I have some dynamite stuff,  but I'm holding on to it to an appropriate time and has now admitted that he did time the release for the days right before the Democratic Convention because for reasons I don't quite understand Assange.  Well, I understand why he doesn't like Clinton.  But yeah, he apparently wants to throw the election.  Clinton has said, I think that Assange should be prosecuted for WikiLeaks, which I disagree with.  But maybe there's more to it than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She was the head of the State Department.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, she should be saying that.  That's her job to say that.  And I, on the other hand, think that WikiLeaks is a good thing.  We wouldn't know about a lot of nefarious activity, including the Panama Papers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, but there's a story in Fast Company saying that WikiLeaks has gone from whistleblower to weapon.  Well, that's clear.  It's being weaponized.  If it is used selectively to Assange's agenda, that's a very different matter.  I agree.  I agree.  Or to Putin's agenda or Trump's agenda or whoever's agenda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They shouldn't be holding back material to time it to have the most explosive...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly what they complained, The New York Times, that held it back to the opposite.  Right.  The original unwarranted search phone record story that they held it back from the government for a different reason.  Well, then Assange is guilty of the exact same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Oh, ScooterX is reminding us about the family library.  You say you can't get it to work, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I guess it's going to roll out.  Yeah, I tried to and it wouldn't let me.  But it said ominously, like, you can't have this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your family is too big.  So you can share your Google Play purchases and that includes apps, but also TV and movies with others, up to six family members.  And I don't think they check the bloodline.  So it's really up to six people across devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They take the ex-girlfriend out.  Right.  Function.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say once I have 23andMe totally integrated, then boom.  Then it'll be a real family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then they have genetic information.  Google is just kicking off the official rollout to Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, the UK and the US.  But it's going to be staged as always.  So I have I have the $15 family plan.  But so you do have to have that right, Jeff?  No, that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think for the things that I have bought.  Wow.  I bought lots.  At no additional cost.  Wow.  Yes.  Then I put the link in there.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so that's interesting.  So I have the music family plan, but this is this is kind of different.  Just get started with family library.  Well, I should try this.  You'll access a new setting in the Play Store where you could figure one person as the family manager and add the other members.  The family manager should be an adult in the family who's responsible for adding, removing members.  This is how Apple does it as well.  Some it's because it's based on somebody's account.  They'll also enter in the payment information where family purchases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, let me understand that I can share everything I buy.  But if Jake buys something, I won't get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But no, no, every member's purchase will be shared with everyone else.  Oh, that could be terrible.  Well, but there's the option to selectively share it.  So parental controls.  I don't know if it's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess I can do that with Amazon with my daughter's Kindle using Kindle free time.  Right.  I can throw movies that we've bought and all this other stuff on her Kindle.  I'm just trying to think of analogy.  But God, that's such a pain.  I'd hate to be the like I'm already the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The process right now on the Apple requires it really is a pain.  Periodically, members of my family will have to call me up and say,  what are the last four digits of the credit card number that you used?  Like, I'm going to share it like the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second here.  No, hold on. This problem.  Select a credit card as the family payment method.  Family library and play music.  Family plan requires a shared payment method.  Right. Does that mean that my kids can't then buy things on their own with their own money?  It all has to be. Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't want that.  No, it'll it'll.  OK, you can go to play dot google dot com slash store slash family slash create.  Thank you, Scooter X play dot google dot com slash store slash family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can see if slash create and see if you're eligible.  He says, let's try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Play Family Library is not available for you yet.  This is the no soup for you. That's what I got.  That's what I had before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But now that was that was right before the show.  I got that. Now I'm in. Oh, you are in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you're complaining. Panned out.

Transcript:  Turn it on for job as he's bitching again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of course, I have to do it with my Google Gmail account.  Oh, you can't do it.  No, because my play stuff is all stuck at the time when you couldn't use apps with play.  I am stuck in a bifurcated world where all of the things I purchased are in my Gmail account.  I'd rather my apps account, but I can't you cannot move things over.  Oh, unless. Oh, unless I can invite myself in my apps account.  Into my family thing, and maybe then I can use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you could. That's one of the accounts maybe. Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just want to purchase.  With my Gmail account, but I can play with my apps account.  Cool. See what you've done to me, Google.  This is how I spend my days and nights. Yeah.  If you say it stays here, you sign it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I was actually playing with Prisma on the is that awesome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that awesome? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's it's not great on the Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's slow. It's slow or it doesn't finish sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's slow and it crashes all the time. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if that's because so many people are using it now.  Or it's 10 million downloads on iOS.  It's an amazing, really wonderful app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's fun. I've been turning my pictures into art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's you know, it's kind of like a filter, but it's better.  I think because it's like it's doing some sort of AI style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's painting it in the style of a certain artist in some of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like repainting it. Right. Wild. Yeah.  Does anybody have the Google beta version of the Google app on their  Android device? Because it's got some new commands, including I like this  and ETA commands.  So when you get in your car and it pairs to your Bluetooth, you'll get  you can get an ETA notification.  I don't know how I don't know how it knows where you're going, maybe  based on your calendar or yeah, your calendar. Yeah, that's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I like how my calendar pops up in my car. Yeah, that's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's nice. It is nice, I guess. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then if you hit your address where you're going, it'll it'll navigate to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was my theory is that that was why it did that.  So you could see, oh, I have an appointment.  And if there's an address in that appointment, I can just have it automatically  go to the navigation. Cool.  I thought that might happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. So I just invited myself to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you didn't invite yourself. You invited your other account to my other self.  Yeah, very confusing.  You're you're on your consumer account.  You're inviting your Google for work account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there we go. One new you're invited.  You're invited to join Google Play. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that way, you're going to be able to move all your consumer account  apps over to your work account.  I hope so. I mean, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your movies. When you join, you can use the you can use the family payment  purchase over. So it'll give you a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you want to use the family card or your card?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've got to tell my kids. Well, I'm paying for it anyway.  Oh, no, no, no account.  Not supported. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Darn it. Sorry, Jeff.  Oh, darn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look for version six point two of the Google beta app for these new Google  features. This is not the beta.  This is that I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how you get to the beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

We thank Rocket Mortgage for their support of this week in Google.  I would like to unbox something right now before we get to a Stacey's pick of  the week and Jeff's number of the week.  This just came.  You I see people will be pissed.  No, it's not.  Oh, where is my mevo?  I know.  Where is that?  I bought it because you said to buy it and I still haven't got it.  You have an effect when we saw them at NAB because it's live.  Yeah.  And they demoed it and I thought it was quite cool.  They said, oh, yeah, we'll get you one right away.  Nothing.  No, this is ZTE, Chinese phone company.  Oh, and they have released kind of like one plus one plus a four hundred dollar  flagship style Android phone.  This is the Axon seven.  Oh, and I preordered it online and I just came today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this come with Chinese government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm trying to remember, but I'm pretty sure ZTE was one of the companies  that the Department of Commerce said the American companies shouldn't have  anything to do with.  You know who you know, who knows?  Everybody's snooping on everybody else, right?  It's a nice box.  These Chinese companies would love to Huawei and ZTE.  And what's the one Hugo Barra?  Xiaomi or Xiaomi.  Show me.  Show me.  Show me.  Would love to get one of the things that I was interested in is the front  facing speakers.  They said sounded quite good.  I don't remember who they is.  What's pretty?  It's thin.  Yeah.  Every phone looks the same these days, though, don't they?  It does.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  What size is that screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Looks like very similar to the one.  In fact, so similar to the one plus one that I don't know if I'll be able to tell  the difference.  So that's five, I think five point two.  It's not super big.  Headphones.  Sim good.  I can have changed the SIM.  Let's see.  Type C.  Looks like it comes with some sort of type C adapter.  That's a good idea.  Micro USB to type C.  That's a great idea.  That's like I'd buy it for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I would too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have quite a few of those now.  I do like type C.  I'm all type C.  Let's turn on.  See what it looks like.  That's pretty, it looks like a pretty good screen here.  So this is the ZTE Axon and you can get it directly online.  It's unlocked.  You know, one of the big questions and I think this is the first time they've sold a phone  in the US.  One of the questions of course is how pure an Android it'll be and more importantly,  really for me, whether they'll do those updates because if you don't do the Google security  updates, 20 megapixel camera, optical image stabilization, 4K video, 240 frames per second  slow motion.  Everything's got to do that now.  Aluminum.  Oh, that speaker does sound kind of good.  Full metal jacket.  I love the fingerprint reader on the back.  That's always the way to do it, right?  I'll carry this around.  It's pretty, it's a little heavier than the OnePlus 3.  It reminds me a lot of the OnePlus 3 though.  NFC.  It's got a, I think it's got a very good DAC it looks like for audio.  They're really focusing on audio.  Dual noise suppression mics, 4 gigs range, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5,  4.5 mic's, 4 gigs RAM, 64 gigs ROM.  It's a Snapdragon 820.  That's a good chip.  It's the best.  I was like ooh.  This is flagship, right?  Flagship quality at $400 bucks, 3250 milliamp hour battery.  We'll see.  We shall see.  Oh, dual SIM of course and SD card support.  That's nice.  That is nice.  One thing that is missing on the OnePlus 3 and they're claiming good battery life, quick charge 3.0.  That's another thing OnePlus 3 has.  That is remarkable.  You were talking about that I think, Stacey.  Half an hour.  Yeah, it's amazing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I guess they say sound, cameras, performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good.  I mean, what it really is to me what this points up is the challenge Apple's facing in this market  because they're and Samsung actually as well.  Twice as much.  Do you get twice as much phone?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's larger.  It fits in fewer of my pockets.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is big enough.  Yeah.  I'll put some cards in.  Is there a screen protector on here?  Must be because this does not look good.  Yeah, there it is.  There we go.  That's better.  All right.  So I'm not going to skip this.  Yeah.  I wouldn't say a great screen.  It must.  It looks IPS.  Not OLED, but 400 bucks.  I shall have a full review sometime in the next week or so.  I usually like to spend a week with a phone at least to get the...  It's interesting.  They are using some pretty good DACs in this.  It looks like it's got high res playback and all that, which is kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you lose by having to switch phones every three weeks?  With Android, not much.  Not much really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's the beauty of Android because I lose the hour it takes to download or two  that it takes to download all the apps again.  But I always back up to Google, so it's got everything in it.  And then I let it download the apps.  And then one of the reasons I use Nova Launcher is because I can save my desktop setup.  This is the biggest pain on iPhones because you have to go through...  There's no easy way to get your desktop setup back.  But on Android, I just download my desktop setup in the Nova Launcher.  And it looks exactly the same.  In two hours, this will be indistinguishable from every other Android phone I use.  And that makes it a lot easier.  Anyway, that's mine.  Let's get a number, then we'll let Stacey show us hers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What should I do? What should I do?  Okay, so this one is all right.  One of these stupid rundowns on the 13 craziest Google patents, most of which we've heard about.  Most of which we know.  But there's a few ones I didn't know in there that I thought were amusing.  Now I've got to find the darn...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, I think this actually is an OLED screen now that I look at it.  It's looking very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, wow. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's okay.  So the one I didn't know about was tattoos.  It's a 2012 tattoo.  You can patent a tattoo?  That includes a microphone and a lie detector on your neck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ooh.  Why would you want a lie detector?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you put it on somebody else when they're sleeping.  Aha.  The other one is another 2002 portable fan that would attach to your body and spray fragrance when it detects that you're exerting yourself to cover up your body.  That's hysterical.  Wow.  A Google patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If they revamped that for mosquito repellent with Zika, that'd be great.  Except off I think sells one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they really? The special Zika spritzer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They sell a spritzer. I don't know if it's a mosquito repellent.  Designed for Olympic athletes?  That needs more than just repelling mosquitoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it does. The poor people have to be on the water. God help them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh God, that water does not look clean.  Oh, it's so not clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like a super fun site.  I mean, you're swimming in effluent. It's gross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really awful. I don't blame the athletes who are saying never mind.  Never mind. I'll skip this one.  I'm going to Rio after the Olympics. I'm not going to the water.  There's a Nest patent with all kinds of sensors on the crib, which I think is nice.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin and I have talked about that.  A Nest crib, that's a great name. I'd buy a crib that's a Nest.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, I think there's a brand called OOF that makes a crib that's actually a Nest crib.  But yeah, this would be great until it goes down like so many of the Nest products do.  And you're like, my baby, what happened?  Are you anti-Nest now?  I'm not anti-Nest. I'm just, Nest has some issues.  And like just this week, they were down for remote access.  Do you use a Nest?  I do. I use a Nest. Oh, is that a nice bag?  Is that your Merce?  Yes.  That's a nice bag.  Isn't it?  I bought a new bag. That should have been my thing. Dang.  Okay. Sorry, Jeff. Keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You won't have one for next week.  No, there's only three I like.  What's special about your Merce, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing. I just had a, this is where my 200 gigabyte SD card is.  Oh, I see.  By the way, I carry in my Merce all the tools, the SIM changer, SIMs, extra SD cards in case a new phone should arrive.  I'm not kidding.  I believe it.  That's why I started carrying that. And this, I'll show you the other reason I started carrying a Merce.  Not for that. My keys have, I feel like a jailer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your phone should be your key. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. My phone should be my key.  Wow.  Have you seen the new, oh, it looks like a little mini Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It says Model X and it's got little windows. You press the window, the door, the different, you press different parts for different things to have happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true. I bought, I bought a little cover that's like a little plastic thing that shapes over that because they give you this leather one that's just too big.  Oh, they didn't give me nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but it was a nice, it's a nice experience when you buy a new one.  They have a little kind of like a little plaque and stuff.  I mean, they, they gave me an umbrella.  Sucker plaque. They gave you the special sucker plaque. It's great.  There we go. I got my SD card.  Stacey, your pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. This, this in keeping with my literary tradition, not so much.  I, if you aren't watching Stranger Things, you should be because it is like X-Files meets Goonies.  Exactly.  Just, I'm not even a huge horror fan, but.  Me neither.  It's, it's eight, it's only eight episodes. It's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they've got renewed for a second season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They did. And I haven't seen, so I haven't gotten all the, I've, I'm on, where are we? Tonight is episode seven.  And I actually have come up with this like Stranger Things, quote unquote hack because I can't handle where the show cuts off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. This is, they do it really well with cliffhanger cutoffs every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So now like at some point in time towards the end of the show, I'm just like, stop it right here.  Oh, that's funny.  So we can go to bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's hysterical. Yeah. Cause other, okay. So that's why I've seen all eight in a couple of days for that.  Cause Lisa will say, let's just watch the next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what my wife says. She's like, we could do three in a night.  We do three in a night. Easy. Yeah. It doesn't take long. It's a good show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should watch it. This is a Netflix original. I just saw a review online. It says one of the five best Netflix originals, which isn't.  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Watch that. Have you watched Brain Dead?  No.  What's that?  It's an Amazon original. It's also on CBS. It is Alien Ants. It's from the producers of The Good Wife.  Oh, I love that show.  Exactly. And Alien Ants. It explains why Washington is so messed up because Alien Ants have gone into the heads of politicians and their brains departed.  And that's why they're all being stupid. And so it just explains our current politics.  That's pretty funny.  It is. It's great. Tony Shalhoub is in it.  Oh, I love him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He looks like there's brain ants in his brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He does it very well. It doesn't very well. So I love that. I love Brain Dead. And then I'm a huge fan. I think we talked about Unreal.  I haven't seen that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I want to watch that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you got it. You got to go start the first season. It's only you can. It is. It is the best. Unreal is a fictional account of behind the scenes of a bachelor like show.  It is magnificent. I love this show.  Reality behind.  Yes, so it's their moral quandaries in doing horrible, evil, awful things just for the sake of showbiz. Those are my two favorite shows right now.  Lovely.  Stranger Things. I'll watch Stranger Things. Thank you, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's Winona Ryder's return to a television.  Love.  It's kind of irritating in this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because she's cookie.  Yeah, she plays a hairy mom with a missing child. So you totally understand why she's a bit shrill. But you're kind of like...  Enough with the shrill.  Yeah, please, Winona. Take it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what's interesting? There are three different distinct groups. I think you'll be interested in the structure of it, Jeff, because there's three distinct groups.  There's the kids, the Gooney age kids. By the way, there's a lot of resemblance to ET as well. And this is the 80s.  So it's got all the 80s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The guy is basically... And there's actually posts that you can see that pull out every reference in the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the Duffy brothers, whoever they are.  Duffler.  Dufflers. The Duffler brothers. And then there's a teenage cast. And then there's an adult cast. And they're parallel stories. And it's really well done.  It's all one story, but it's really well done.  It is.  Yeah, I really liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And as a child who grew up watching those movies, I was just like...  It's your people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, that's not going to be my ringtone.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's different. I never get invited to those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say, wow, Jeff, you're fancy.

But so far he's not listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's very funny. To be working at Amazon named Kindle. That must be something.  In the hardware division.  Where can we find that podcast Stacey?
