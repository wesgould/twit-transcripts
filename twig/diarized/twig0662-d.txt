Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I missed y'all, but I'm glad to be back today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love your red coral necklace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to spice it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does look like little tiny spice chilies, but it's not.  I can tell it's coral, right?  It is.  It is coral.  It does like little chilies.  Glenn Fleshman, your neighbor, filled in for you last week.  Thanks, Glenn.  It was fun.  Lots of typography talk.  Yeah.  Oh boy, you didn't miss a thing.  Ants back to Ant Pruitt.  We missed you too.  Oh, thank you.  It was a tough show with no Ant and no Stacey.  Twit.tv slash HOP.  He was going around the other day taking 8K videos of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Beautiful 8K from the...  I think the bags in my eyes look at that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They sure do on the 8K though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what Photoshop...  You look much better on this particular...  In 2K, in 720p.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And whatever we're in here.  Let's stay with 720p.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, we put it in the Slack and we're going to upgrade the cameras here at Twit.  Not 8K, please!  It's official.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.  We want to see what Leo would look like after the zombie apocalypse and possibly when he's...  I'm going to go with near death from a lung infection.  Yes.  That's the image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I look like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  Also, from the beautiful New Jersey, the Lenningtown professor for journalistic innovation at the  Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York, Mr. Jeff  Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I want credit for having brought Glenn on the show.  Love Glenn.  And then I bought his book.  Oh, London Kerning.  A little book about a typographical tour of London.  Oh, how fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He is so nerdy.  Actually, we're going to have him back.  I think he's going to be on Twit in a few weeks because I never met him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's really kind.  When I first started out as a journalist working in the tech press, he reached out for something  or he commented on one of my posts.  He knew a lot of wireless stuff.  And I was going to be in Seattle and I was like, hey man, you want to meet up?  And he just was so kind.  He walked me through some technology stuff.  I mean, just a genuinely nice person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was opposed to us, I guess you're saying.  No, but I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was nicer than you and me, that's for sure.  He was really great.  We had a great time.  We were talking about thongs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's meant for the Twit network, yes.  But don't steal him from Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no.  He could be on the grown-up table.  He could be on other shows too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, hey, I personally think this show is the grown-up table.  I agree with you.  I don't care what anyone else says.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is where the grown-up is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is where we talk about the boring things.  You don't see me.  I'm saying, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On Sunday night, you're only going to catch on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We could change that actually.  Have you ever done Twit, Stacey?  Yes.  I think she has.  I've done it once.  I say no.  You say no.  I hope we ask you.  Oh, yeah.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I choose this table.  It's the table to be on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you can't do it this Sunday.  It's Mother's Day.  So I won't let you.  I'm actually working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll be at a conference.  Really?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're going back to a lot of conferences all of a sudden now that things are going  things have opened up.  Careful, Sam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is possible.  I am vaccinated.  I'm triple vaxxed.  I'm going to get quadruple vaxxed, but I'm waiting.  I don't know when to get anyway.  Bottom line, I'm going to a conference next week.  Where's that?  The week after that.  The next week is in Vegas.  Oh, fun.  Siemens Realize Live.  I will be the emcee, y'all.  Oh, how fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really?  Oh, okay.  Nice.  Singing and dancing.  Now, Siemens is famous for making skated devices.  They're a German hardware company.  What is this about, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is their OT technology conference.  But you know what they also make?  Oh, wait, I should double check this.  Every time I see Siemens, I think they make powered infrastructure.  Yeah, they make powered infrastructure.  And I think they make the Washington state ferries.  Oh, wow.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they're one of those like Hyundai or Kuretsu, giant German company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, Siemens makes the Washington state ferry boats.  Wow.  Possibly other ferry boats, but definitely.  I just remember walking by the ferry one day and being like, what?  Siemens here?  Huh?  So let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This looks like fun.  Siemens Realize Live.  And it's going to be mostly IoT things, yeah?  Yes, it's industrial IoT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My next conference is in Dallas, which is less of an exciting place, but the conference  is going to be more exciting.  It's going to be about smart homes.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Matter.  You see mom and dad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, mom and dad live in Houston.  Look, there she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's Texas.  Right there in the speaker section.  Look at that.  Host moderator.  How fun.  Mrs. Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, look, I'm wearing the same necklace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want you to talk to the head of strategic partners of Red Bull Racing.  Is that Horner on there?  No, no, it's Zoe Chilton.  She must work with him.  But Red Bull, of course, has the champion.  Matt Smith.  Stop him.  Racing for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's really good.  Gosh, he's so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, great to have everybody here.  One of the reasons Stacey wasn't here last week is she did not want to talk about Twitter.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true.  I was like, oh, goodness.  I did.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I screwed up, Ant.  I forgot to call on your PC you sent in DM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was looking forward to it.  The Twitter troubles continue with Elon Musk.  The staff is up in arms, as you might imagine.  Part of the problem is if you take it public, their compensation, which is based on stock,  suddenly becomes a little iffy.  Private.  Yeah.  Take it private.  You said if you take it public.  Vise versa, yeah.  Although the reason I was thinking that is because Elon, who's trying to get the rest  of the money together, has been reassuring investors.  Don't worry.  Don't worry.  We're going to go public in three years.  Like, oh, great.  That's good.  After what happens.  So he's basically saying, yeah, I know I can't make any money on it, but we're going to  We're going to shine it up, polish it up.  We're going to sell it back to the stock market.  And then new kitchen counter would be beautiful.  Yeah.  He's basically saying he's going to flip Twitter.  You nailed it.  Flip in Twitter.  Show title.  There should be a new red Discovery TV show.  You know, social media flippers.  Poor Argo all had to reassure the staff, which who said they see seems very, very tired  and unhappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I mean, he just got the gig.  Well, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he's got a golden parachute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think forty four million dollars.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's going to be okay.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Would you be sad and tired if you knew in six months?  I got forty four million dollars and a lot of time on my hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Miserable.  Miserable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For the most part, he stuck to the script, says platformer.  This Casey Newton's blog.  This was a simple business deal designed to provide the most benefit to shareholders.  At one point, he apologized before once again using the word fiduciary.  Excuse me, but I'm going to use the word fiduciary again.  He said he began by saying, please stop leaking to the press.  He made a low key effort to rally the troops while acknowledging he had little idea how  Musk might change the company.  Newton writes, we don't know the specifics of change.  I don't want us to go in believing nothing will change.  He quotes him.  Here's the company's current employees to stick around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is it unfair?  Please don't leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it unfair to assume that Musk is going to make that a better business?  Is Twitter a better business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some say Musk may lay off more than half the staff in an effort to cut costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But Twitter is a business, right?  I know we use it as a social media platform.  But it's a money-losing business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it doesn't actually lose money, right?  Well, it doesn't make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, hold on.  Do they report Twitter?  Oh, they just reported.  Let's see what the Twitter results are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The stock is up to $49, which tells me the market doesn't believe they're going to get $54 a share from Elon.  I'm looking for the quarterly results.  Do you have them somewhere?  Still underperforming.  I thought they just released it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm looking for it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter latest file that admits losing advertisers on TechCrunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  May 3.  May 3.  So they're losing advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's see what else is going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But again, it's still a business.  What is wrong with someone saying, hey, my business is failing and I'm trying to make my business better?  So if someone wants to buy this business and make it better and have at it, what's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is just an SEC filing.  It's an SEC filing.  Yeah, it's not a quarterly result.  Its core advertising business could now be at risk as a result of Musk's takeover.  In addition, employee hiring and retention efforts and other factors at risk.  Yeah.  So it's a business that never historically has made very much money.  It has a lot of mind share.  That's the value, right, is the brand is worth something.  Employees are upset and possibly leaving for a variety of reasons, partly because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sounds like any other business.  Are you complaining, Ed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Would you spend $44 billion of your money on it?  No, I wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But what I'm saying is look at like Dell and all of those other companies that they went through some form of a transformation.  Yeah, Michael Dell took Dell private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dell took him private, though he took a private with a strategy.  His strategy was convergence.  And he's actually implementing that strategy.  And executing on that strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it was perfectly fine.  I was just...  No, no, it's all good.  I'm just trying to fill a blank, but your blank was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My blank is just blank.  And he, by the way, did the same thing because he took it private in 2013 and five years later put it back on the stock market.  Yeah, that's what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He basically wanted to take it out of the public eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I see the idea being, you know, we're going to put like put a big sheet over it and fix it and then...  Flip it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, his concern was Wall Street had such short term thinking that they were not valuing the company's investments properly.  And I mean, sure, every CEO thinks that, right?  But he actually had a plan and a strategy because his whole thing was building out a converged computing strategy for cloud infrastructure.  Although he actually has done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do remember in 2013 when he did that, people were saying, oh, he's overextended.  This isn't going to work.  This is a really risky move.  People were just skeptical.  They were just as skeptical.  You thought he would do well.  And you were right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I knew exactly what he was doing because we could see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Miss Stacey, is the problem that this is Elon Musk just taking this on?  Would people say the same if it were say, I don't know, what's his name, Buffett?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Elon doesn't seem to have a plan.  Like Michael Dell came in with a plan that he articulated and had been articulating for months ahead of time.  And the other thing is, I'll just be honest, Elon Musk does not have the gravitas.  Right.  And not even this like theoretical gravitas.  This man's like a total.  You cannot take him seriously with a lot of things.  And there's also the fact that he's got multiple other businesses to run.  And historically, his businesses have not met their deadlines in some of the execution has not been awesome.  So like and I mean, I drive a Tesla.  I was excited about Starlink, for example.  I, you know, I'm not denigrating Elon Musk for being a visionary and lots of things that he does.  But I also don't think he's the he's not someone I'm like, oh, yeah, that's a guy who's going to turn around a struggling social network.  You know, it's worse than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's he's said things that we know are going to be damaging.  You know, take off the moderation that gets it to be finally a decent place.  Invite back bad people.  Do things like require identification, which hurts the vulnerable.  But what about open source in the algorithm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that a bad thing?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, first of all, Elon has no idea what open source means, because back in the early days of Tesla, so we're going to open source our car.  He did not open source it.  He just essentially said about he had licensed it.  So he doesn't understand what open sourcing means.  But you wouldn't want to.  First of all, you probably couldn't open source the algorithm.  He's saying it's like Coca-Cola.  It's just the secret recipe.  It isn't that simple.  But even if you did, the real beneficiaries of that, in my opinion, and others, is the is the spammers who would then game the same reason Google doesn't open, doesn't tell people how it works.  Facebook doesn't tell people how it works because all that does is encourage gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Gaming the system.  OK.  Fair enough.  It's a different matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, but a better answer to your question, Ant.  This is why I keep harping on Blue Sky, because that is a plan that says let's make Twitter and other social media into a protocol so that people can post wherever they want.  Hello, Kevin Marks.  And then we could come along and say, oh, I'm going to find all the good people talking about cameras.  I'm going to find them here and here and here and here.  I'm going to use these criteria and put it together in a new value added ant social world camera thing.  Right.  Now, that's a strategy.  That's more than just saying, oh, no, I'll make it open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting because we talked about that on Sunday.  Cory Doctorow and Owen Thomas and Tim Stevens were on Twitter on Sunday.  And Cory said I asked about Blue Sky and Cory said it's interesting because the way Blue Sky is structured, Elon does not control it.  It is already funded.  So Elon cannot take the funding away.  And there's no guarantee.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yes.  And there's no guarantee that what Blue Sky does would end up being under the aegis of Twitter anyway.  They, you know, so Blue Sky is kind of a, you know, skunkworks R&D project that is really going to be out of it's a hedge.  It's going to be out of Elon's hands, which is good because Blue Sky looks to me a lot more like Mastodon.  We were talking about Federation.  Yeah.  And Mastodon, which is we run a Mastodon server, one of thousands, twit.social.  Everybody.  So you couldn't steal.  You couldn't take Mastodon because you'd have, you know, there's nobody owns it.  Right.  You know, Eugene, who does the software as a, you know, independent software developer in Germany, I guess you could buy him.  But the software is open source.  So somebody would fork it.  Keep it going.  Yeah.  And because this is the beauty of a federated server like Blue Sky or Mastodon, each server owner, me in the case of twit.social decides what goes and what doesn't go.  Right.  And if you don't want to, if there are some servers I don't like on Gab, for instance, runs on Mastodon.  Yeah.  So I know I can say I don't want to see anything from Gab.  They can moderate it any way they want.  But if I don't want to see it, I just say in my settings, no Gab.  And then nobody.  Your users.  I sign up for twit.  No, you could do it in.  This was an eye opener.  It is at server level.  Yes.  I actually don't federate with Gab.  So, but I might turn that back on because it turns out you can also do it as an individual.  So you can be on any server and say, but I don't want to see traffic from server X, Y or C.  So you really have total control over what you see.  I think it's a really it's a beautiful system.  Let me see if it's if it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've been getting a lot of notifications for people following me on Mastodon.  And I just want to say here that folks, I hardly ever hop into twit.social.  Well, come on in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Come on in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We have a nice time in twit.community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's a good place to you know, that's a forum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love both of them.  So jump over to a twit.community.  It's free.  It's free.  Just sign up and somebody I know sitting next to me here walking through the approval process.  Just like Mastodon.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am a fan of federation in general.  Yeah.  And that's what Blue Sky is about.  Corey was very strong.  Although there was a funny little twist because when the Supreme Court decision was leaked,  a number of people pointed out that all Justice Alito is saying is well,  because Corey was saying just like the United States is a federation.  Yes.  And each state has its own rules.  And Corey said, and this was before it was leaked.  You just move.  If you don't like the rules of your state, you move to another state with different rules.  So if you want to be in Texas, you move to California or Washington state as you did.  I don't know why.  I don't think it was because of that, Stacey.  But actually, it was.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It wasn't.  No, it wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When the decision came out, it became very clear that's kind of a luxury to say, well,  I'm not going to live in this state.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't just be like, y'all, just move if you don't like it.  Yeah.  It doesn't work for most people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Especially the people who are most deeply disadvantaged by this.  So it was kind of a little twist on this idea of federation.  But there are reasons the United States is strong.  We do have a federated union.  And each state does get to make a lot of its own rules.  And I, in fact, think that's not a bad thing necessarily.  Anyway, not to get political and not to get into Twitter.  Sorry, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We do talk about Google on this show, folks.  I promise you.  Is there any Google at all?  We always get to the Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, there's a lot of Google because Google's quarterly results came out this week,  last week.  And Google I.O.  We're going to do, Jeff, thank you for joining us.  So the Google I.O.  keynote is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't get to be there with Jason and having the snacks.  I don't get any free phone or anything.  But I'll have you.  Well, that's not our fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's Google in their infinite wisdom decided not to invite the press.  I guess it's kind of a weird hybrid I.O. this year.  But the only people in person will be Google's employees and carefully curated.  Will there be cheerleaders?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Also, there will be nothing but cheers?  Sounds like the Apple kind of thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I thought there would be a couple.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, I'm not invited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Nobody I know was invited.  So figuring nobody could could possibly be going.  It will be May 11th through 12th, both live and online.  And we will be covering the keynote at 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern 1700 UTC on Wednesday, a week from today, May 11th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do we want to say what we're looking forward to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very sick of you.  Jeff Jarvis and Jason Howell and I will be doing the play by play.  You could join us if you wanted, Stacey.  But I figure you're probably...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I'm doing my job.  Yeah.  My other job.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're not invited.  I'm doing that thing, you know.  Sorry, Leo.  I got a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got a thing.  I'm washing my hair.  I can't, couldn't, but other...  I'd love to, but...  Husband, don't I have a thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a thing.  What's that thing?  Oh yeah.  Yeah, yeah, that's right.  I have a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're doing that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll be emceeing my conference.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know.  We know.  You already told us ahead of time.  So you're covered.  You're safe.  What will we expect at Google I.O.?  I think a Pixel Watch.  Pretty sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm excited about the watch, the final bringing together of the Fitbit acquisition, the hardware,  the software integrations.  Oh, that is an interesting way to look at it.  Yeah.  Everything related to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And from what we've seen, it's actually a really attractive watch, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's, I mean, all watches are too big for me.  That's just...  It's the floppy hands.  I've got floppy wrists.  I can't...  I've got delicate wrists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can't support a watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's one thing I could never say about these watches is most of the time they're  always a little bit too small.  It's nice to see these larger face watches.  For a big guy like you and me.  My hands are big.  Yeah.  Oh, geez.  Something like that looks okay.  You know, this one.  Is that the Pixel Watch?  Can you and Leo put your hands up next to each other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm curious to compare the size.  Oh, God.  You don't even want to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't even want to...  I'm like a child.  Oh, wow.  Like a child.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Child's hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Little tiny baby hands.  Oh, that's a good one.  Little tiny baby hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Mr. Trump.  This is why I still use these tallies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  These old mice too.  Because these old mice actually fit my hands better.  Oh, that's interesting.  How tall are you?  I'm just six two.  I'm not very tall.  Just six two.  Okay.  That's like the average height.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So your hands are not out of proportion.  Five ten is the height of the average man in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's my height.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're not five ten.  I was before I got old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was reading about this surgery you could do.  You're $75,000.  I stopped busy, huh?  You get three, gain three inches, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My hands would then even be smaller.  Relatively.  It'd be like really tiny.  I'm sorry, chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought six two was roughly an average.  Isn't he sweet?  Bless his heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Six two.  That's the average guy.  Six two, right?  I thought so.  And your hands.  My hands are really big.  So are they bigger than like a normal six two person?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think so.  I've always been told that.  They seem pretty big.  You have puppy dog hands.  Where's Jason?  Get Jason in here.  Football catching hands.  How old is six six, right?  No, he's six eight.  Six eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And have you compared hands with him or anything else?  Wait, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I will hang up if he shows up in that direction.  Excuse me, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't have to.  Let's see.  Jason's in the house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it's great.  It's like real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So their hands are the same size.  He's a little smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's slightly smaller.  Slightly smaller.  So you're taller.  Mega hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got really big hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Your hands are like, it's stretched.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you, Jason Howe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you, producer Jason Howe.  Mr. Ray Gunn.  Yeah, it's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have people in the house.  It's really nice to have people around.  It really is great.  Sorry, Mr. Gunn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure our listeners really appreciated the hand comp.  Especially the audio listeners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you're listening in audio, you're probably imagining giant hands.  You're not wrong.  And then I walk through the door.  You're not wrong.  So this is a lost, it was a lost pixel watch.  It was left in a bar or something.  Like the iPhone.  Yeah.  Except that that seems a little far-fetched.  I think probably intentionally left behind by a Googler.  In fact, we know who left it behind now.  I think they found out.  Oh, they did?  Yeah.  But these are pictures from, I think it was Android Police that got the pictures.  I think it looks pretty good.  I dig it.  Yeah.  It will be obviously Android Wear.  This is the thing that's amazing.  Google's never made a watch.  I stunned me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you tried Android Wear?  It's terrible.  Well, I bought the first one.  You can tell Google's never made a watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Remember the Moto 360?  I really liked it.  I liked it.  I have the new Samsung Galaxy 4 Classic, which is that weird Android Wear slash Samsung.  Tizen.  But it's Android Wear and it's quite good.  So big battery.  The battery in my Galaxy Watch is 247 milliamp hours.  According to 9to5Google, 300 milliamp hours for the Google Pixel Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But what does that mean in days, weeks, half days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably not more than all day battery life, really.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So for people that want to get these watches and sleep in them for sleep tracking and things  like that, what's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so Google's...  So here's where I'm excited.  Sorry.  I'm interrupting.  I'm sorry.  No, you're not.  All I said was um.  The Nest.  Um does not qualify for an interruption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can talk whenever you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google has the Nest 2 Hub with the Soli radar for sleep tracking.  So it's possible Google could be like, hey, you get the watch, you get this guy, you charge  your watch, this guy watches your sleep, compile all the data, you get it, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, also what a lot of people do with the Apple Watch, which also is only all day, is  it charges fast enough that you can wear it all night and charge it while you shower  and get ready for work and then put it back on.  That makes sense.  So they charge within under an hour.  Okay.  So I think that that's another solution.  So I read somebody said that of all the sleep trackers they tried, the Google Nest Hub was  the best.  You use that, right?  I don't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not using it right now, but when I used it, it was very good with my...  It compared well with my Fitbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you have to have the one with the camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's with the Soli.  I mean, they all have cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, I have one that doesn't have a camera, but it might have the Soli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  It's only the only sleep tracking one is the Nest Hub second generation.  I can show well, I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I see it.  I have it right here on the...  So that's not a camera.  That's the Soli.  That's also a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the Soli, I think is actually one of the others.  Oh, okay.  To both of the others.  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Part of the problem is a lot of people don't want a camera in their bedroom watching them.  Fair enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can physically turn the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it will still work with the sleep sensing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because the sleep sensor, Soli is a radar.  So they're using RF, not a camera to track your...  It tracks your respiration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does it also record audio too?  It does.  Because some of them, they want to listen.  It will know if you snore, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it tracks your snoring and it records it and does all of the data processing locally on the device.  And then it'll just send you...  And you can, I believe, store the recordings of your snores.  But you don't...  So if it hears other things in the middle of the night, like my dog's collar jingling, it did not pick that up.  Or if it did pick it up, it didn't record it or do anything with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I am going to...  Are you ordering it in the room?  Because I have so many sleep trackers and I want to compare them.  So I have the Serta or Beautyrest or something sleep tracker that's from MotionX.  That's under the mattress, the paddle.  I have my 8 sleep mattress, which is...  That's going to be next to my...  That should be the most accurate.  I just ordered this...  I guess I thought I had it, but I guess I have the first generation.  So I ordered the second generation to replace it.  They're only 99 bucks.  It's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to install Google Fit.  Right now, you have to use Google Fit to get that data.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Got a Pixel 6.  I never liked the Google Fit app.  Seems like all the other third party apps gave me more information than Google Fit did.  Has it updated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I've used...  I think Amazon Health, Google Fit and Apple Health are all pretty comparable.  But you're actually a fitness guy.  You might have a different opinion.  I did not like Google Health.  Sorry, Google Fit.  Yeah.  The real key for me on all of these is that they connect with enough devices.  Because I have all the different things that...  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So yeah, and it's giving you a daily...  Steps.  It didn't do that before.  Maybe I should install it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but it tracks your steps and stuff only from your phone, not from your watch.  Well, it might if you had a...  And so that's why we're getting excited.  But the other thing...  It doesn't work with a Fitbit?  You can pull in...  Actually, can you?  For the last time I checked, it would not let me do it.  That's sad.  Well, now that Google owns Fitbit.  But it does work with my...  This was right after they bought it, actually.  But now that it does pull in my Nike training workouts, which I feel that are hard...  Those workouts are hardcore enough for you, Ann.  I feel like you'd be like, oh, well, this is sort of challenging because they absolutely break my body.  I'm just like...  No more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm measuring my heart rate now, but putting my finger on the camera.  That doesn't work.  Really?  That doesn't work?  Look, it looks pretty good.  It's like a sine wave.  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it match your heart rate on your watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to find out.  So that's why I want to try all these devices and see which is the most accurate.  I also wear the Aura Ring for sleep tracking.  Is that your heart rate, man?  I'm doing a freaking TV show right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Would you ease up, please?  He's on air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm 84.  We're getting upset now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You guys are so mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I'm worried about you, man.  Well, my resting heart rate's like 56, so don't worry about me.  I'm OK.  OK.  Nice.  I know it feels like I'm calm, cool, collected when I do these shows.  I'm relaxed.  But actually, this is hard work.  You guys are tough.  The watch says I'm 78.  Maybe I calmed down a little bit.  I just installed it.  Oh, no, now it just went up to 81.  Blood pressure?  It's going up.  Let's see.  I think the Apple Watch has been the most accurate because I compare it with one of  those polar straps, which I think is right.  That's probably the most, most, most accurate.  It's always the same as the polar strap.  I feel like the Apple Watch is very accurate.  I've got the Aura Ring.  I've got so many sleep trackers.  They all say something different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which is not good if it's supposed to be tracking one person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it makes you wonder, is this just a made up number?  Whose algorithm is right?  Yeah, my 80.  Let me see what the...  I'm 58 right now.  You don't look a day over 70.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, your heart rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not nice, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know how to track my heart rate on here.  I have to figure that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Your heart rate is 58 right now?  I just took it, yeah.  That's not possible.  That's impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You are the coolest cat on this panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's like he's...  Well, because I'm bored by this talk because I'm not in shape.  So I don't know what to do with that.  How could it be 58 for the next topic?  I'm 63.  I guess I am too high.  I'll try my cardio.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Cardio, yeah.  Those are nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's actually truly accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A live core, right?  Oh man, I didn't realize my heart rate was so high.  Yeah, mine's 68 right now.  I got a dry cough.  I got a bad heart rate.  Yours is 68?  Yeah.  See, my resting heart rate's like 53.  People don't realize how hard it is to host a show with you clowns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, my heart rate when I'm on stage walking around giving a speech,  for that amount of time, it's sustained like 80.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I have to stand up for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I don't have to stand up.  Cardio's 59.  Wow, Jeff.  I would worry.  Jeff's just like...  That seems very calm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mine is higher than y'all's.  Mine is 92 right now.  See?  He's working.  That's why.  No, you're making me nervous, Leo.  I get excited.  I get fired up being on a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, just start talking moral panic and then see what happens.  I'll check it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll check in on Jeff's heart rate later when we talk about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do we think Google will announce a Pixel 6a?  Why not?  Wednesday?  Probably.  Why not?  It's about that time, right?  Yeah, there is something.  So a new phone and a new watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, you want to hope for your new notebook?  No, Chromebook.  Chromebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not going to happen.  That's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want Jeff to have something nice in his life.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I'm assuming they're going to talk more about the, air quotes, improvements to the  Android operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because we saw Android 13 start, the first preview of that come out last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, you mean the one that started wiping phones?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That one?  Well, hey, look, you know, it shouldn't have to be said.  If you are downloading the very first public beta, and was it even a public beta or a dev  beta?  I think it was a developer beta of an operating system.  You're not putting that on your main phone, I hope.  Mr. Howell, I feel so bad for him.  Did it happen to Jeff?  Really?  Jason?  Oh, wow.  On your Pixel 6?  That's his job.  That's his job.  But dang.  So, Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch, we had rumors last year that Google was going to announce a folding  phone.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  And it sounded last year like they were close to doing it.  You don't think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we would have heard something.  I think we would have heard folding jokes.  We heard something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't we get a folding phone leak of something just like yesterday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, maybe I'll change my mind then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But maybe it was a Samsung one.  I just remember it was like it was a folding phone leak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you have a folding phone, so you probably agree.  I do have a folding phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought it was, we saw leaks in the, like, a common headline in the code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Google's first foldable.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What does it say?  Are we asking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, one day ago, I'm asking you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Google's first foldable smartphone will have a rather compact cover display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  But we don't know when.  1400 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Last night, Jason's saying the guest on All About Android had a Pixel 6a case that was  shipped to him by accident.  So that sounds like the 6a is definitely on for Wednesday.  I'm sorry, but this is from Tom's Guide, Jeff.  All the things Google will not announce on Wednesday.  Not in 2022, a Pixelbook, a Pixel Slate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not traveling much yet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but he just wants a nice working device.  I go out to the deck and work.  Yeah, he wants a nice working device.  Hey, do you think, I mean, I have my go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's nice. I like it.  I just did a dumb thing.  I just bought a Google Nest Hub.  It's five days a week before they're probably going to ship a new one.  A brand new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here, cancel order.  Have you opened it yet?  I just ordered it literally on the show.  You literally just ordered it.  Yeah, cancel order.  Oh, then I'm an idiot.  You got time.  You think I should?  Yes, please.  Wait a week, dude.  No, cancel it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I want it.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  Also, if I order it now, it's more likely Google will update it on Wednesday.  All right.  Let me cancel my order.  It's a hundred bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can always use another Google display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably went, oh, quick ship it.  Quick before he changes.  We found another one.  Selecting a reason.  I'm a schmuck.  Ordered the schmuck.  Yeah, I never know what to say on the reason because it's never matches my real reason,  which is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, plus that only some of them are acceptable too.  So that's the other problem.  OK, I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're all acceptable.  Just some of them won't give you your money back.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I cancel it.  So we're good.  We're good.  Thank goodness.  So now that puts it's like Schrodinger's cat because when I had ordered it, then it for  sure meant they would announce something next week.  Now I've canceled it.  What has happened?  Has it killed the pixel nest hub?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're probably going to just talk Waymo next week.  Waymo.  Would that be funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's talk about self-driving vehicles.  So funny.  So funny.  Well, I'm excited.  We haven't had a real Google I.O. in a while.  We still can't gather.  I have such fond memories of getting together, Jeff, with you and Gina Trippani at Google  I.O. some years ago.  It was so much fun.  So much fun.  We used to battle over the show.  We did the whole show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We did the show from down there.  Yeah, I remember you guys broadcasted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jason's done that several years in a row with all about Android.  So cross your fingers.  Cross your fingers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I liked the dried fruit.  It was very good.  They had good chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Remember the first time they did a shoreline, they had like a whole campground set up with  all these little tents and booths and you got to choose a little button with your pronoun.  It was great.  Interesting.  Yeah.  You got a free phone.  Yeah.  That was the good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, we're old enough to remember I.O. when was it Chromebooks that came out originally?  The applause from the Yoskone Center.  Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, I got the Nexus 2, Nexus 1, Nexus something that they handed out.  Yeah, I remember those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those were nice.  Google Cardboard caused much joy even though it cost $1.98.  That was really fun though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you used that to distract yourself while coming over the Golden Gate Bridge.  Yeah.  So he assembled his cardboard.  So in the What's New Keynotes, which are after Sundar Pichai's keynote, they will be covering  Android, Firebase, Learn How to Build and Run Apps Users Love with Firebase, Flutter,  which is another nice cross-platform framework for developers, Web, Learn How Google is Investing  in the Web Platform, AR.  There's a lot of AR interest right now between Meta and Apple.  I wonder if Google will respond to any of that.  They've kind of had a rocky experience.  Soli, which shows up in the Nest Hub, was their AR solution for the phone, but they  decided not to put it in the phones.  Google Play, Chrome OS, Google Home and Google Pay.  That pretty much covers it all.  But of course, there's no leaks about what they might announce.  But I think that's a pretty good guess.  Wednesday.  Let's take a little break.  Come back with more.  It's great to have the gang all together again.  Stacey Higginbotham from stacey on iot.com.  And Pruitt from Hands-On Photography.  Jeff Jarvis from Craig Newmark.  The loins thereof.  The loins of Craig Newmark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Spring Jeff Jarvis with his heart rate well under 60.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by privacy.com.  I'll tell you what brings my heart rate up is buying something online with a credit card.  And I can't even count the number of times that number has been stolen and somebody else  has bought something else and I've had to cancel the card.  That's a pain.  You got to get a new card.  For the last few years, I have any time I'm buying online used a card from privacy.com.  Let me tell you why.  Privacy masks your real bank information and creates virtual credit cards for your use online.  There's two different kinds of cards.  You can do a card that's locked into the merchant.  So if I know I'm going to be buying from Amazon a lot, I'll actually create a card for Amazon with privacy.com.  And then only Amazon can use it.  No one else.  Or you can make a burner card that can only be used once period by anybody.  That really eliminates the risk.  Plus, because your real bank information doesn't go to the vendor, your privacy is assured.  You never have to worry about giving out not just your card number, but your name, address, and all that other information.  Privacy is a tool that makes it easy to manage your financial life online while keeping all of your most important information secure.  I just love privacy.  I'll give you another great use case for privacy because you can pause a card or delete it anytime.  Whenever I'm buying a subscription, a recurring purchase online, let's say I want to buy Adobe Creative Cloud, I use a privacy card locked into Adobe.  I set the limit to how much they can charge.  You can do it per charge, per month, or per year.  And then if at any time I say I want to cancel, and a lot of times these companies make it really easy to subscribe and really hard to cancel, I don't have to worry.  I pause the card.  And that's it.  They don't get another penny out of me.  It makes it safe so they can't overcharge you.  They won't keep charging you after you don't want something anymore.  It just blocks the charge.  You always get a notification whenever the charge is blocked for whatever reason, whether it's because you paused the card or because the card number was stolen and somebody else tried to use it.  So you always know what's going on with your card.  A great way to do recurring payments and subscriptions online.  They have a Firefox extension and a Chrome extension, so it's very easy to make a new card.  You don't have to jump through a lot of hoops to do it.  It's just very easy.  You say, give me a new card.  You got the number.  You got the expiration date.  You got the security code.  And by the way, you can use with privacy any address you want.  You could be John Doe with 123 Main Street, Anytown USA.  Oh, you figured out my secret address.  And I use that with all the merchants.  Whoops.  Unless they're mailing me something, obviously.  Although that guy, Anytown USA, is probably getting a lot of my stuff.  He's probably a lot of junk mail.  So that they don't see, you know, and privacy doesn't care what zip code or address they give it.  They know it's you because you set the card up through them.  It's a great way to share a card.  So I wanted to send my mom a credit card because I want, you know, she's 89.  She doesn't cook as much anymore.  I wanted to buy her dinner once in a while.  So I sent her a credit card.  I said, Mom, you use this with whatever delivery service you like.  Remember, once you use it with them, they can't you can't use it with anybody else.  But I'm buying dinner and I get, by the way, I get a notification and I see it on my statement.  You know, when she buys dinner makes me feel good.  In fact, she told me the other day, she said, your sister's coming over.  We're going to have hamburgers.  I said, oh, that's great.  She said, you're buying.  I said, that's even better.  I love that.  And sharing it with her was so easy.  It's I don't have to mail her a number and you know, or text it to her.  None of that's secure.  You actually just create the card and privacy on the website and you say share this.  You give them I give my mom's email address and that's it.  They handle the rest.  It's very easy.  She doesn't have to have an account to use it.  She's got everything she needs.  It's I just love it.  You get a full activity summary.  You can tag purchases.  So it makes it very easy to filter by date or by how much you spend or by tag.  It's great for budgeting.  I just think this is a no brainer and I want you to do it.  You should check out the various levels.  There's a free level.  Most people will want to use that.  I actually pay for privacy.  I have the like it's ten bucks a month because I get one percent back and I use it so much that it makes me money.  It doesn't cost me money.  Privacy.com slash twig.  Privacy.com slash twig.  Right now, new customers will automatically get five dollars to spend on their first purchase.  P R I V A C Y dot com slash twig.  Please use that address.  That's how you get the five bucks.  But also it's how you let them know you saw it here and helps us.  Privacy.com slash twig.  Huge fan.  Huge fan.  Use it all the time.  Let's see here.  Parliament has invited Elon to come visit.  That's funny, isn't it?  This is why I think this is why Elon buys Twitter, right?  It gives him a little cache.  Parliament wants him to discuss the future.  Oh, maybe this is not maybe this is not much fun.  Not that kind of invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to get rid of moderation.  No, no, no, no, no.  We're not thinking of what shit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We are interested in the developments you propose.  In particular, your intention to roll out verification for all users echoes our calls on the UK government as part of proposed legislation.  He also wants to know about misinformation.  It's Julian Knight, member of parliament, chair of the DCMS committee, the digital culture media and sport committee.  We'd also like to know how do the jocks get into this?  How do you feel about cricket?  Wait a minute, why did the camera flip to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do the jocks like this?  Let's go to one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I therefore wish to take this opportunity to invite you to speak with our committee and discuss your proposals in more depth.  I look forward to hearing your response and discussing your plans for the future of Twitter and committee in the near future.  You are sincerely a Julian Knight.  Yes.  Well, I don't know if Elon will accept, but I have my doubts.  He has the invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anonymous fee, the fee we're going to be paying for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he said a small fee for commercial and government users, but we already pay.  I already pay three bucks.  We all pay the two.  Yeah, I'll be a little less small than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you think it'd be more.  Did he talk about it being like a set amount per follower count?  Oh, kind of like a MailChimp idea.  Or did I just imagine that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not nice to call him a chimp.  A slight, he says slight Twitter fee for commercial users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like every thousand followers cost you a dollar a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It doesn't say.  Some revenue is better than none, he says.  So Nike.  I don't think he even knows about Twitter Blue.  No, he doesn't.  He doesn't even know about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, good, good.  Keep them away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I don't know if anyone else knows about it either.  It's just the four of us supporting all of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think all of this is because he needs to raise money because his stake in the 44 billion,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  which is 21 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he's reducing that now.  He's trying to get other people in.  Is he?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's trying to get people to lend him money because he doesn't have 21 billion in cash.  So I think that's why he's saying things like, and we could go public in three years,  and we're going to develop new ways to monetize tweets.  He also says we'll crack down on executive pay to slash costs.  I think there's a legitimate and serious concern that he's also going to lay off a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the wrong people by that.  I mean, the functions that the moderators care about.  Yeah.  Journalism relationships, that kind of stuff will go.  Oh, no more Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.  I was like, oh, we're getting into it.  Didn't you all get into it last week?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was at the Met Gala.  Will that make you happy?  You want to see his outfit?  No.  He's wearing, looks like white tie.  That was the theme or not the theme.  The theme was Gilded Age.  But yeah, I mean, I took it pretty seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The dress code was white tie.  Ryan Reynolds was also wearing white tie.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what, Elon, get a tailor.  The collar is way too big.  Your neck's rattling around in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they were out at the rental place.  They just didn't have a size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Richest man in the world can't get a fitting suit.  It looks, you know, this is very haughty.  Who's he with?  Who's that?  It's not Grimes.  Oh, mom.  Oh, isn't that sweet?  Certainly not Grimes, yeah.  Well, you never know.  Somebody said, I thought he looked like a conductor.  Yeah, anyway, there you go.  That's Elon Musk at the Met.  See, that's nice.  That's nice with his model mother.  Speaking there, he said that the reach of Twitter is only niche,  but he wants a much bigger percentage of the American population to be on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, having everybody yell at everybody is not the way to do that, Elon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the thing.  I don't think people understand that moderation is the key to growing.  You can't have a...  Yes.  If you just let everything go, it's 4chan.  And 4chan is not big.  It's full of awful people who can say anything they want.  And it is not a successful enterprise in any respect.  They don't make any money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe he'll talk to the Reddit people, because they've done a pretty decent job of corralling.  I love Reddit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's my social network.  I read it more than anything.  What is it that makes Reddit work?  Because there's bad news.  They do have moderation.  They have moderation.  And it's very moderation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Each community sets the standard.  It's kind of like federation.  Very rarely do community level...  There was actually a really interesting article on Slate about how the prepper community  kept downvoting women's issues that women think about for prepping.  Things like birth control after the zombie apocalypse.  How do you manage that?  And they were like, eh, not important.  So then the women just were like, well, screw this.  And they created their own prepper community.  So that's also...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's walking dead.  We're seeing it before our very eyes.  They're going to go and war each other?  That'd be fun.  It'd be a good show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think actually, though, you nailed it, which is that each section is moderated separately  with its own rules.  And I only follow...  They're appropriate.  I only follow subreddits that I like.  And if it's out of control, I don't follow it.  So much more so than anything else, because Reddit, unlike Twitter or Facebook or anybody  else, doesn't push subreddits into your face that you aren't a member of.  You see just...  Occasionally they're promoted.  I always turn that off when they have...  Hey, here's a subreddit.  I turn that off immediately.  So you only see what you want to see.  So it's very much...  It's like Usenet, but better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, look, we know how hard it is to do a social network without moderation.  It went down in flames for a while.  Literally, in flame wars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, also, for the book, I had to add in something about the well.  And I was never a well guy.  I thought there were a bunch of snotts.  Hey, that was on the well.  But I didn't really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't even know what the heck you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of course you were out.  Yeah.  The whole earth electronic link.  It was run out of a little houseboat in Sausalito for some years.  Very big with the Digerati in the Bay Area.  Stuart Brand started it.  What did you say about it in your book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the fascinating thing about it...  I was talking about the lessons learned in the early days of the internet.  And so I put that in there.  Plus, the reviewer of my manuscript thought it would be good to talk about it.  And I think he was right, so I did.  What I didn't realize was...  Number one, Wired called it the most influential network on earth.  It had only 10,000 members.  Yeah, it was really small.  It was really small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but it was influential people for its time.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they gave it...  They charged.  They made it free for the journalists.  That's right.  But what was fascinating about it was I didn't realize that there was a case...  Katie Hafner, I think, wrote about this.  She wrote a book, I think, later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where the Wizards Stayed Up Late was her book about the internet.  Where Wizards Stayed Up Late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And she wrote about the well, and there was really bad trolling.  Not just kind of generic people coming in now and getting...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, she wrote a book on the well.  You're right.  I did not read this.  I have to get this book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so they came in, and there was one guy who died.  What?  From trolling?  No, not one, he didn't get killed, no.  Oh, okay.  And he had a relationship with a woman on the well, and it turned bad.  And they each had problems.  And so it was a very early example of trolling and the problems that if you don't watch it...  Yeah.  The well was famous for saying, you can read this three ways, you own your words.  Right.  That was...  You have the copyright to them.  It was also...  Early section 230, hey, not our problem, you better watch it out.  But it also said you're responsible for them.  Which I liked that as a motif that Facebook should have said from the beginning.  Twitter should have said...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, the well still exists.  It's not the same.  It's well.com.  Wow.  Yeah, I was on the well for a few years, and it was weird.  Never heard of this.  But it's the first experience I had of the internet, because you could drop through the  well software into the internet.  So it's how I got online on the internet.  Cool.  I'm going to have to read Katie's book.  By the way, speaking, I did not...  This is a sign of the times.  Marques Brownlee was at the Met.  Where were you, Leo?  Good on him.  And that is not a white tie.  It is a black tie.  It's not a white tie.  But he looks pretty darn good.  Good on him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a sign of the times, right?  That a YouTube star is at this...  A geek YouTube star, even that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, the geek YouTube.  I mean, because there's been influencers.  The Met is co-sponsored by Instagram.  So there have been influencers there.  Oh, it is co-sponsored by Instagram.  Oh, I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Marques has a master class now, by the way.  He does.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He is a star.  I can't believe we had the temerity to offer him a job.  Did he even respond?  Yeah.  He said, well, I'd like to keep going to college.  Thank you very much.  He was thinking, are you kidding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to be gay.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he's still fully independent, right?  He still owns his...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  He's doing very well, too.  He barely gave us time of day at CES.  He said, I knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, yeah, he was with that crowd that they were hurting him and a couple other people.  But he knew who you were.  But he did stop and speak to me for a second.  Yeah, he knew who you were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No idea who I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He didn't know who I was.  I'm some old bald dude saying, hey, young man, I like your tech videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have really big hands.  You should wave at me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here is...  This is what my two favorite people, the stars of succession wore to the Met Gala.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  Wow is right.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, the fingernails, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look at the hands.  Yeah.  That's Kieran Culkin who plays Roman Roy, the youngest scion of the Roy empire.  They killed those parts, man.  And Kendall Roy on the left there.  I can't remember the actor's name, but he's great.  Jeremy Brown.  Jeremy Strong.  Strong, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He wore just like a bunch of bottle caps on his...  Yeah, it's a really weird outfit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's going on there?  I think it's like a little bit like a teenager saying, okay, if you want, I'll wear a white tie.  Okay, if you make me.  Okay.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you order your new selfie drone yet?  I did.  I ordered two.  Two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Please no.  So Ant can have one?  Please no.  Well, so Snap is selling something called the Pixie Drone.  $230 selfie drone.  It's kind of a neat idea.  Why are you skeptical?  You like real drones, yes?  No, I'm not.  I was not.  No, no, no, but Ant's going, oh, no, no, no.  And Ant, you have to understand, I'm not allowed to operate a drone.  No, you are not.  So this is a drone I don't have to operate.  I don't know exactly how it works, but I get the impression you just kind of throw it in.  Well, they've got a video showing how to do it.  Oh, all right, let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here.  I just don't think this is worth $230.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that was the funny thing because then the chat room said, oh, don't get that.  There's another selfie drone does exactly the same thing for half the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not to.  And that's not worth $230.  That tech that they're touting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I bought the other one too.  And we're going to do a head to head and you're going to be the guy in charge.  OK, you're going to be you're going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And another thing here in Petaluma, have you you go outside, you see how windy it is every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but this should work just fine because I can't control it.  So the idea is you release the drone and it has three modes.  One is it takes a selfie.  One is it follows you around and one that kind of goes around you.  Right.  And then you just hold out your hand and it lands in your hand after taking the picture.  It's like a pet.  Look, look, watch.  So she's she's I don't know how she gets it to launch.  Oh, she presses a button.  All of that is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just not $230.  It's not.  You think that's too expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How much did you spend for your most recent for something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's 100, 150.  OK, because you're not going to get the best of image quality.  It's it's it's yellow.  And then it's going to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One of the questions is if you can post it to something besides Snapchat or can only go to Snapchat.  That would be no.  It's just so the other one I got you can post anything.  Probably.  That's probably more practical.  Yeah.  It's the same model of thing.  Probably from the same.  I'm sure.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I would just say to you, remember the flip camera.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was that a life changer?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it was easy and you could just.  So this is like makes drones and turns it into kind of something so easy that you can just use whenever you want.  So I agree with you that it's not like the best.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But drones are already pretty easy to use now at that price point that are way better quality at that price point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My question is, do I have to learn how to torque?  Um, please don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What were you saying?  This is Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But if I want to be an influencer, don't I have to do the influencer little dances like she's doing?  That's no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.  I think it's going to be super cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm hoping it comes in time for our Alaska cruise with Paul Therot, because I'm going to do a lot of next thing.  So pictures, the battery on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How many batteries are you going to have with you?  Because you know, that's not going to fly for more than 10 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's fine.  How many selfies can I take?  Right.  There's one.  The one.  The other one that I got has a little battery thing like pouch that charges it some more.  What's the name of that other one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this will be a good present for Christmas of 2022.  And I say this because we're going to get a lot more awareness from it now.  We're going to be actually out in public with places.  And I'm thinking about for kids and like for people who just want to have and the price point will come down or we'll find the right one.  And for like 150 bucks to give someone like a little drone.  And I know they want to walk down.  We'll get this instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm square with it.  They're apparently quite.  Yes, exactly.  Won't that be fun?  So this is the air selfie air selfie camera dot com.  This is only 150 bucks.  OK.  And doesn't it look exactly the same?  I think it's probably the same hardware.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does the same kind of thing.  That's what I'm saying.  You can.  That's a more reasonable price for that piece of equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Two K HD video.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know how.  That's good.  All of that.  That's legit.  12 megapixel camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not two hundred seventy four degree field of view.  So it's slightly wide.  You can go 60 feet.  It weighs.  These things weigh nothing.  Less than two ounces.  So I could carry them in my hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  With your floppy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, anyway, I ordered one of each.  There are turns out I didn't know this because I was so impulsive.  But there's quite a few selfie drones in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are.  Yeah.  I just I feel like that's why I feel like the snap pixie is kind of fun because it could  kind of drive.  Yeah.  Attention.  Like there's nothing right now like they exist.  But no one's really using them or excited about them.  And I think something like this might help with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and federal law prohibits me from operating a drone.  But this way I'm not actually operating itself.  I couldn't possibly.  It's operating itself.  It's operating itself.  It could possibly screw it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Judge, I was not operating.  No, it was all on its own.  I know it hit that kid in the eye.  I didn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's 13 weeks out.  So I'm not going to get it probably till August.  So it'll be a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I love drones.  And this this sounds fine.  They just overpriced it for what it's capable of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you're not a drone snob or a snow drop.  It's not that you're snobby about it.  You think it's too high.  Which it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's overpriced for what it's going to offer you.  You see those tiny sensors, image sensors.  It's not going to be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it'll be like you don't think it'll even be camera phone quality.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you know what we're sticking on our camera phones today?  Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like this couldn't run that kind of processing power even if it wanted to.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  Well, I want to say I was another $239 you've wasted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did it for you.  I'm going to get both of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can review them.  We can review them together.  Whatever you want.  Yeah.  Here's the headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't buy this thing.  I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will look forward to that review because I'm here to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think this would be a good thing for a gift for your kid.  But don't get this.  The pixie.  Get the other one because it looks exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, did they mention any type of AI for recognizing pets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pets?  No, this is for your influencer channel.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, pets are influencers.  Well, pets are influencers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  My niece has a influencer dog.  It has a cereal box ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really?  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Your niece's dog is on a cereal box?  Yes.  What cereal?  Magic spoons.  Oh, I like magic spoon.  Magic spoon is the keto cereal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're not on the box.  They like did some photo with the box with the dog.  I don't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's like an ad because they're doing a lot of ads.  Yeah, because the box has a cartoon on the cover.  Well, that's pretty cool.  That's really cool.  Yeah.  Magic spoon.  It tastes like styrofoam, but it is keto.  So.  Oh, so it's legit.  And it costs like forty dollars a box.  Okay, so it is legit keto.  It's sort of keto.  It's five net carbs, no sugar.  Most of the carbs are fiber.  Okay.  It's high protein.  But like I said.  This is the selfie drone of cereals.  It's the selfie drone of cereals.  Oh, they got more flavors though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If it doesn't taste good, it's probably keto.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When I was keto, I ate it because I thought, well, I should have a treat.  But anyway.  So Apple's interesting.  People coming back to work, right?  Maybe this is a premature.  We're still waiting to see the COVID levels are starting to spike in areas like where  you are, Jeff.  Yep, it is.  It's spiking here, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they spiking here now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We are going to an indoor concert tomorrow.  Is that a mistake?  I have no comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you going to wear your mask?  I'm going to wear a mask now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I am.  We're going to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Judy Offee got her third case of COVID at the White House Correspondents' Dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We all knew that was going to happen.  They were on stage joking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, super spreader event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like germs don't recognize irony, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In 95, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'll wear a mask.  Good.  Thank you for the suggestion because I don't want to bring it back.  And yeah, a lot of people I know are starting to get it.  So maybe it is in any event.  More people now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know more people now who have it than I've ever seen.  Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Me too.  Yeah.  Isn't that interesting?  Still, I still haven't gotten it.  None of you haven't gotten it.  Jeff, you haven't gotten it.  You haven't gotten it.  Stacey.  Knock wood.  We're all the paranoid types, I guess.  Fortunately.  I live in a cave.  Oh, that's it.  We don't go anywhere, right?  Yeah.  So we are asked.  Yeah, you are going to be in Vegas next week.  Will you wear a mask?  Not when I'm on stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going everywhere else.  I'm usually outside when I go somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you're safe on stage.  I'm usually fine outside.  Yeah, outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, it depends on the ventilation and the hotel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We haven't been to an indoor concert in two and a half years, so this will be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who are you going to see?  Anne Wilson of Heart.  And Sundar Prachai.  No.  This week in Google.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  She's going to sing crazy on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, it's going to be fun tomorrow for Cinco de Mayo, but maybe now I have, well,  we'll see.  I promised a test before I come back.  Enjoy it in 95.  But what I was saying is people are starting to come back to work, except they don't want  too many cases.  Now, the estimate is as many as half of the Apple employees who've been told they have  to come back to work at least several days a week.  At least half of them are thinking of quitting.  Quitting their job at Apple rather than come back to the office.  That's nothing wrong with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because they can get jobs elsewhere.  If they can get another gig somewhere else.  They probably can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, hey, they don't have the best value for themselves.  I think they're hoping that if they say that, that maybe Apple will rethink it.  They should.  Apple, like many companies, says, no, no, we've got to all be together for the collaborative  aspect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They actually have legitimate, because they develop hardware and because they've got such  a culture of secrecy, they kind of do have a legitimate argument for putting people  in place in an office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there was a really good BBC comedy show that people who have been staring at the screen  in their home are now ordered to come back to a larger building to scare out a screamer.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And to spend hours of their day driving to and from and many, many dollars on gas.  I understand why.  Airbnb just said, you know what, you don't ever have to come back.  I think this is smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can get why some people want you to be on site for certain tasks or duties or whatever.  But the world has proven to us over the last two years that most of these on site jobs  were not required.  So much business was still able to get done from the comfort of your couch.  Your home office.  Well, they're redesigning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's been enough stories now about home builders and talking about how homes are shifting  because more people are going to work from home.  And I do think...  Smaller private rooms, more flexible space.  I mean, our guest room is also my husband's office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I know I'm different from most people, but when I was working in a day to day job  in an office, I hated being there because I couldn't get anything done because of all  of my coworkers.  Yeah.  As bad as that sounds.  They come over and they say, hey, what you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never got any of my work done because people kept visiting all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And my superior at home was like, hey, what are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was like, wow, I got this email from you at 11 o'clock at night.  Thanks.  Why are you working?  And I'm like, because it's the only time I could get something done.  And then that discussion later turned into why don't you just stay home?  And I'm like, thank you.  This works.  And I worked from home for most of my professional career.  And I loved it.  So Airbnb has an interesting twist on this too.  So that you can work anywhere in the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can go into an office or not.  But you can also work up to 90 days a year in any of 170 countries.  Nice.  Very Airbnb, obviously.  Yeah.  I guess just places where you probably can't get arrested for working there like Russia.  Right.  Which you can't go to.  But that's a really cool.  Why would you want to?  You go to Barbados.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's where I'd be right now.  If I worked for Airbnb, I'd be there.  Right now.  If I worked for Airbnb, but my boss won't let me leave the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  20 plus countries offer remote work visas.  And more are in the works.  Barbados is one of them.  Killer for Airbnb's business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One of our sponsors, I won't say who, but he was in Barbados for at least a year on a special visitor visa for COVID.  Loved it.  The internet's very good there.  They all speak English.  It's beautiful.  It's not in the hurricane zone.  Nice.  Yeah.  If you can get the gig.  It's not in the hurricane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well.  The folks at Apple, if you can find another gig that's going to give you the quality of  life that you feel you've earned, then go for it.  Tell Apple to kick rocks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Phoenix Warps says he annoys his coworkers by listening to twit at the office.  I'm sorry, Phoenix Warp.  I know who you work for too.  Let's take a little break.  We have lots more big announcement from T-Mobile.  They had a big event today.  We'll talk about that.  I actually want to ask Stacey a little bit about it because it's kind of an IOT story.  But first, a word from Red Hat and their newest podcast, Compiler.  We've talked about Compiler before.  It's a really cool idea.  It comes to you from the makers of Command Line Heroes, another one of our sponsors,  another podcast I love listening to.  This new one, Compiler, is hosted by Angela Andrews and Brent Siminoe.  It's a brilliant idea.  I can just see them coming up with this.  Red Hat, which is one of the great Linux distros, it's a great company to work for.  They do wonderful stuff.  Red Hat has an internal, as many companies do, kind of in company forums where they have  fascinating discussions.  When you get a bunch of smart people talking about stuff, it's fascinating.  I think they said, you know, this should be a podcast because essentially each episode  covers a big question in technology.  Then they ask different Red Hatters what they think.  What are tech hiring managers looking for?  Or a good one, do you have to know how to code to get started in open source?  Or how much should managers be coding?  Do you need to code if you're a manager?  Episode two, what can video games teach us about edge computing?  The Internet is, of course, a patchwork of international agreements and all kinds of  infrastructure, but there's something coming to change the way we connect.  In this episode of Compiler, hosts explore what edge computing could mean for people  who enjoy video games and what this form of entertainment could teach us about the  technology.  Actually, I was really thrilled to listen to this because this is something I've been  saying for a while is that this gaming at the edge is really just the predecessor to  computing at the edge that I cannot imagine Microsoft at some point won't just say,  I don't buy Windows, don't buy, just run it on your cheap, low and slow hardware on your  Chromebook or whatever.  We'll manage it.  We'll run it out of our.  So I can't wait to, you know, see what the Red Hatters think about this, because of  course you could do the same thing with Linux.  Episode nine, how are tech hubs changing is right up the alley of what we were just  talking about.  Used to be you'd have to move to a tech hub, right?  If you wanted to work in technology, but nowadays you could be in Barbados.  So for this episode, the host of Compiler speak to a few of the change makers who are  thinking outside of the physical and social dimensions we've come to associate with  innovation.  So these are new episodes.  I loved the first season, new episodes of Compiler.  You can go to a Red Hats website, red.ht slash twit.  That's the short form red.ht slash twit.  You can go and listen there, but of course you probably should just subscribe in your  favorite podcast client.  Anywhere you listen to podcasts, listen to Compiler, Apple podcasts, Pocket Casts,  Spotify, Google podcasts, everywhere.  And we'll put a link just to make it easy on this episode's show page as well at  twit.  Thank you, Compiler, for making a great, I'm always interested to hear what other  people are doing.  You think managers should know how to code?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I remember having this discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they should have been coders at some point, but the thing they talk about in the  episode is fascinating.  Some managers say, fine, I don't have to do this anymore, but some of them say, get out  of my way.  And this is where you got to watch out.  Get out of my way.  Let me write that.  Terrible idea.  Don't do it.  That was a fascinating conversation.  And I think the idea of not having to be in San Francisco or Austin or New York City to  participate in the tech revolution is a big, big idea.  That's an episode of Muscle Seekers.  You mean I can be in Calhoun Falls, South Carolina?  You have to sit right here next to me.  Don't you be going anywhere.  Where would you go?  Calhoun Falls?  Calhoun Falls, South Carolina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That sounds like something from Rocky and Bullwinkle.  It's about as big as this TD booth.  If you could be anywhere, that's where you would be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Calhoun Falls?  No.  No.  Where would you be if you could be anywhere?  Right here.  Okay.  Thank you.  Right.  Good answer.  Stacey, if you could be anywhere, would you be on the island?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I would be in a waffle house.  Good answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they never close.  They never close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love Waffle House.  I love Waffle House.  How come the Welcome to Calhoun Falls sign is a gravestone?  That seems kind of counterproductive.  Fatalistic.  It's the gateway to Lake Russell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh man, he pulled up Calhoun Falls on twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did.  Oh boy.  Have you been to the Blue Hole?  I have not.  Richard B. Russell Lake and Damn Overlook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Calhoun Falls is a town that I have driven through in a matter of seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's only 1,800 people in Calhoun Falls.  It's a tiny little town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's smaller than my town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are the restaurants there?  I want to look this up.  Can we go to Google Maps and see what's there?  There's apparently only three destinations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is there a Waffle House?  You know what?  I bet there is a Waffle House.  No, definitely not.  We don't have Waffle Houses out here.  Do you miss Waffle Houses?  Yes, I do.  I have never been to a Waffle House.  All we have is IHOP.  And I don't think that's the same as a Waffle House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When I went back to visit my mom, was it last year or the year before last?  I went to the Waffle House.  I took my uncle to the Waffle House with me.  What makes it so good?  It's just because they cook in lard.  Lard?  The secret is lard.  They cook in lard.  But I remember sitting there and just having a good time talking with him.  They brought the bill out and the bill was like $25.  Lard's cheap.  Oh man, I miss this stuff.  So the nearest Waffle House...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a high end bill right there.  How many people do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The nearest Waffle House to me is to us is Goodyear, Arizona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we have to go to Arizona.  So is there a Waffle House?  There's not one in Seattle either, I'm sure.  Oh God, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't think they've put them in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's more of a southern thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They cook in lard and they give you the pecan pie.  Oh, I love pecan pie, baby.  They put a little butter on the top.  More butter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's not enough fat on your pecan pie, you've got to put butter on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, that's the best egg I've eaten.  Wait a minute.  Pecan pie isn't fatty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pecan pie is just sugary because you cook it in caro.  Oh, that's right.  It's all caro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You heard the John Oliver Waffle House joke?  No.  Oh, let's see if we can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, Chicken A21, yes, Apple Butter.  Yes, Apple Butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There is something called the Waffle House Index.  You know about that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, everybody knows about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because Waffle Houses never close.  They're open 24-7.  If a Waffle House is closed, that means there's a disaster.  So there's three levels on the Waffle House Index.  Green, where there's a full menu, means a restaurant has power and damage is limited.  Yellow, limited menu, means no power, only power from a generator, food supplies may be low.  Red, the restaurant's closed, indicates severe damage or severe flooding.  It's usually flooding.  This is all that's left of a Waffle House in Biloxi, Mississippi after a King Katrina.  Oh, Biloxi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Biloxi, that's where all my family's from.  Really?  Pokertown.  Every single member of my family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've rebuilt the Waffle House.  Really?  I'm so sorry.  So was that the hardest hit by Katrina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's where Katrina made landfall.  I know that Louisiana had, you know, New Orleans had their issues, but Biloxi's where it hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The amazing thing is this Waffle House was only yellow.  It wasn't red.  They were still giving you some food.  Yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were right there in the thick of things from a hurricane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I am like, this show has taught me about Popeyes Fried Chicken, about Waffle Houses.  You never had Popeyes?  I have now.  He has now.  Thanks to Ant convincing me.  Did you bring him a visit?  He has the chicken bolus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The chicken bolus.  He went to get the chicken sandwich.  You ever been to a Stucky's?  I did not go to Stucky's.  I've seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  FEMA actually uses the Waffle House index unofficially, but they do use it, which is  wow.  Wow.  Concede defeat, says Jeff Jarvis.  Time to surrender.  Wake up, Jeff.  Wake up, Jeff.  Get that heart rate up to 70.  Jeez.  Says concede defeat to bad speech.  What do you mean, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's that it's always going to be around.  We're putting all this resource and all this effort into it.  It's getting all the attention.  It's thus doing the job of the bad guys.  We're painting good speech on the internet with the rush, the tar of bad speech.  We should be putting resources into finding good speech.  I completely agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  I think you're right.  I think we're overreacting to disinformation, bad speech.  Check your pulse.  Don't get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't worry about disinformation, but treat it like spam.  It's just going to be there.  It's going to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're never going to defeat spam.  It's a human condition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I disagree in the sense that there's so many, if you have bad speech with an agenda, so  you think about like the bot armies that China and Russia, and probably to be honest, we  probably do it too in other places.  I think that no amount of just ignoring that or ignoring that is kind of silly and naive.  We kind of ignored things like QAnon, and those have unfortunately real world impacts  because they still reach so many people.  I agree that we should be promoting good speech, but I also think that's kind of what we're  doing with some of the things like, remember the COVID-19 banners?  I think they're still around for some sites.  So I agree with you, Jeff, but I'm also like, I don't think that's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not saying you get rid of the efforts that there are.  There's so many efforts going on.  They're not going to go away.  They're there.  But now let us turn some resource and attention to promoting good speech, but also supporting  it as art.  The story I always love to tell about this, and I'm telling it in my book coming out next  year, is that in 1470, a decade and a half after Gutenberg there drank, Niccolò Perotti  said to the Pope, you've got to appoint a censor because you've got to approve the stuff  of the press.  It's all a mess.  But he wasn't asking for a censor.  He was asking for quality control.  He was asking for editors and publishers.  He was asking for new institutions that didn't exist at the time to try to support and assure  quality.  When Harper's came out in 1850, they kind of did the same thing.  They said, oh, there's so much stuff coming out now because of faster presses and we've  got tons of content.  We're going to create a whole magazine that's going to try to bring you the best of it.  That's what I'm trying to suggest here is until we start trying to promote art and intelligence,  we're not going to get any of it.  So I'm just trying to urge investment there too.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you're right.  I do.  I think this is a specific instance of a larger case where we sometimes miss the forest for  the trees, where we get so concerned with something else that distracts us from, I think  that a lot of respects a lot of the complaints about the internet in general.  I'm starting to turn into Jeff Jarvis.  Uh-oh.  Distract us from the benefits because we're so worried about trying to do something  about the harms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which we're not going to ever, Stacey's absolutely right.  We can't completely ignore them.  It would be like saying, Mat Cots, don't bother with spam anymore.  No, no, no.  You still got to do what we do.  You point them out.  You point it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You say, yeah, that's, it's kind of like, and this seems discredited now, that the old  antidote to bad speech was more speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it's discredited at all.  It's Brandeis.  It was the best proponent of that.  And in fact, I was just editing that chapter where I mentioned three efforts to disagree  with that and say, well, it's just proven.  No, I don't think in the long run that's true.  I read John, Ariel Pujitica, the famous defense of free speech that argues that in the long  run, the truth will out.  In the short run, it won't.  I quote a book from the 1970s where Rabbi Lillefeld, the father of a famous New York  journalist, New York Times journalist, said in the short run, truth won't win either.  But in the long run, it will.  And we've got to try to keep that in mind, not to give up now, but to try to put our  resources and our attention to what's good, or else we're not going to get it.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  It has been used in some negative ways.  Clarence Thomas cited Brandeis' counter-speech passage in Laurelard v. Riley when he invalidated  a number of restrictions on tobacco advertising.  Thomas said, if the state of Massachusetts' concern is that tobacco advertising communicates  a message with which it disagrees, it should seek to counteract that message with, and  then quoting Brandeis, more speech, not enforced silence.  That's an example where I agree with Stacey.  You know, the tobacco advertising, you could stop that.  You could stop that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Tim Wu asked whether the First Amendment is obsolete.  That scares me.  Oh, man.  Phil Napoli, who's an academic I respect a great deal, wrote a paper saying, what if  more speech is no longer the solution, just to this point?  My online friend Ian Begost, who's brilliant, is at Washington University now, wrote a piece  in the Atlantic saying, what if people shouldn't say so much and shouldn't say it to so many  so often?  And I get that.  That's a point of advice.  Like, do you really need to add a hot take?  Though I find it ironic this comes in the Atlantic, which is nothing but a hot lava  flow of hot takes.  But anyway, yeah, we've got to meter what we do as well online.  Yet, where are the patrons of the arts in this world?  Where are we going to get more TikTok musicals to irritate and that's what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it binary like that?  Is it like, no, no, you have free speech or you have it's not buying crap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, not at all.  It's just that we were we were so monomaniacal right now about all the bad stuff that we're  giving attention to the bad guys, which is what they want, what they want in their hands.  And we're we're harming the freedoms of the Internet overalls by fear.  You know that about me.  But again, it's about it's kind of about investment.  Where's the person who's going to support?  So the press comes out and there's a lot of junk in the world, but who's supporting Michelangelo?  Right.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Stacey, are you worried that that kind of doctrine is going to encourage just more  hate speech?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not worried about hate speech.  I'm worried about weaponized misinformation.  Yeah, I guess.  That's I mean, yeah, that's that's what I'm worried about.  I mean, I'm sad about hate speech as a person.  Well, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, especially as a woman.  I mean, you get you are much more the target of this than any guy online.  Yep.  And as a black person, you're probably much more the target than any white person online.  So I can understand how if you're the target of this stuff, you might say, well, there's,  you know, we got to do something.  Right.  It's easy for me to say, oh, yeah, Jeff, two old white guys to say, yeah, go ahead.  Let a thousand flowers bloom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think I would say and I don't know how Ant would respond, but like if I received  a lot of hate speech on Twitter, which I don't, you don't actually, which is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't encourage it.  No, I'm like, I'm like, I'm OK with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody needs to.  But if if I received it, I would just leave Twitter.  And presumably, I mean, would I be sad not sharing pictures of my dog with everybody?  Sure.  Would it have a noticeable impact on my business?  It might be not.  No, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a promotional.  It has promotional value.  It has promotional value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, worst case scenario, I could always, you know, have I have a bot count account  if I wanted to do that or something.  I mean, but I would just basically, you know, I would basically tweet out only my stories  and not engage with people.  And that would be that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's what a lot of the bigger companies are doing anyway.  You look at somebody like Nike.  Yeah, that's the first company comes to my mind.  They have a Twitter account, Facebook account or whatever, and they post something.  Hey, we stand with so and so.  Hey, this is the new shoe.  And then it's done.  They're gone.  They don't come back and do comments.  They don't do anything like that.  It's just sort of just.  Well, that was Elon Musk.  It's a complaint about the top 10 Twitter users like Taylor Swift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She just promotes.  She doesn't hang around.  Why should she?  She's just going to get attacked.  Yeah, she's she's she has no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no.  He wants her to engage.  Yeah, he needs to set up some different rules.  I mean, she's just on the real Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And also, that's a mass way to look at it as if you've got to have 8 million people to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  be real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Taylor Swift probably doesn't want to engage on Twitter because why would you want  to talk to that many people?  You would never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Breaking news, we were going to talk about T-Mobile.  No, we're yes, I will get to that.  But breaking news, T-Mobile is also but less important.  Cameo just laid off according to Yanke.  Rector's writing a protocol.  Your friend, Yanke, who's great coverage cover of media.  He was a variety.  I'm glad to see he's got a protocol.  Protocol is.  Yeah, they're doing a great job.  He was one of the original protocol place.  Was he?  Oh, he went back then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, he's been a protocol for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, he was.  Yes, because they're new.  That's right.  Yeah.  Relatively new.  Cameo lays off close to 90, including the CPO, CTO and VP of marketing.  Cameo.  I don't know how you lose money on this.  They are the company that charges that lets celebrities come there to charge, you know,  50 bucks, 100 bucks, 500 bucks to do quick greetings.  Yeah.  It was huge during the pandemic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's probably your answer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We get tired of things.  It was cute for a while, but then Giuliani shows up.  There goes the neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, this is what they're saying.  The Stephen Galanis, the CEO, says we hired a lot of people quickly and market conditions  have rapidly changed since then.  Accordingly, we have right-sized the business to best reflect the new realities.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People aren't spending money on stuff like that.  On stupid stuff.  You know, just not it.  Because money's tight nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you can get last minute delivery for Mother's Day.  Get the perfect gift for Mom.  A Mother's Day gift she'll never expect and never forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what your mom wants?  Your mom wants you to call her.  You to spend some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me pull something off like that.  Not someone famous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm imagining my mom getting a thing from whoever's on there and she'd just be like,  the heck?  Stacey, I want you to talk to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wouldn't your mom like the bachelor to say, hi, Mom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My mom doesn't know who the bachelor is. Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That would be the height of dumb to send her something like that.  And she goes, why is this strange person saying hi to me?  What's going on?  My mom is a science fiction loving day trader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, let's see what we can find for Mom.  Yeah.  Let's see.  If you got Neil Gaiman to do it, she'd be excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think Neil needs to do cameras.  For charity, he might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Hugh Laurie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is he only? Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I said Hugh Howie, but Hugh Laurie would be.  Oh, I was like, Hugh Laurie she'd do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is kind of like his character house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you're a Hollywood celebrity, it's kind of like appearing on the love boat, right?  It's kind of like a sign.  Oh, it's below that.  It's below summer theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Laurie Berkner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Singer in the Laurie Berkner band.  She's only $125.  Do you want her?  I can arrange for her to say hi to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but my daughter loves, actually her music was lovely.  Oh, okay.  She does kids music.  So you could do that for your kid's birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. See, that's cute.  Yeah, you could see the problem here.  Part of the problem is also actors are going back to work.  They are no longer sitting around the house wishing they were working.  They actually can go do some movies and TV shows.  Why don't you get on Cameo and see how you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd be so curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What should I say?  They'll tell you what to say.  Yeah, but don't you want to have like your trademark thing that you say?  Hey, hey, hey.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How about if I pay them?  I'll pay you to take my video.  How about that?  Yeah.  The only thing I'm famous for is saying screw you to Mike Harrington.  I could do that.  Oh, I saw that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apparently we have some stickers.  Did you bring the stickers in?  Would you go get me that sticker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What ever happened to Mike Harrington?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He moved to like Washington State and now he's in Miami?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's around somewhere.  Yeah, he's like hiding out.  Last time I saw him he wouldn't shake my hand.  Not because he doesn't like me, but because he was germaphobe.  So these stickers, this is going to be my new Cameo thing I think.  We made stickers out of this.  Uncle Leo one is in there.  Oh, look at, whoa, John, you got a lot of stickers.  This is a ton of stuff.  Holy cow.  John's been collecting stickers, but this is my favorite.  It says, remember kids, Uncle Leo says screw you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Put that on your Cameo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Except here's the problem, I just did that Cameo for free.  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  Oh, he lives in Miami.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not how this works.  He lives in Miami.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is he writing?  He has a crypto fund.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course he does.  Of course he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you can't do Cameo, do crypto, right?  Clearly.  Yeah, he doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, this is not a flattering picture of him on TechCrunch's site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was the founder, for those who don't know, he was the founder of TechCrunch, a lawyer,  and TechCrunch in the early days of dot com was huge.  Big, yeah.  That was how you found out who the next big thing was.  I had very long conversations with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was trying to understand what do I do with this thing?  It's taking off.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was a huge success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why did you say screw you to him?  What was the idea?  Oh, I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you want to watch a video?  Sure.  Let me see.  I bet you I can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, he basically called you like a shill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, he called me a shill.  We used to do, I used to host the Gilmore Gang.  This was 13 years ago on Twitter.  So that was Steve Gilmore and then Mike Harrington was on it, a bunch of other people were on  it and I was doing a review of the new Palm.  Palm Pre, right?  Pre, which I really liked.  A lot of people liked it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you happy with it?  Love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why?  It's quite impressive.  Well, you know, I thought that maybe.  Kevin Marks is on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was like, it's young Kevin Marks.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's get the disclosures out of the way right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a one week review unit.  I couldn't get one and unfortunately I don't think I'll be able to get it.  I was going to go out and get one this afternoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so you got a free pre.  You're one of the very few people that got a free review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not at all.  I think there are quite a few reviewers here on ScobelHus.  Mike, that's BS and I'm really pissed off that you would imply in some way that this  quote free pre that I send back in seven days would in any way predispose me.  Screw you.  What are you going to do about it?  Mike, you are such a troll.  Screw you.  Okay, it gets worse from there.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pause for a second.  Look right there in the bottom right corner on the screen.  I know that guy.  That's Lauren, right?  Oh yeah.  And I'm just watching Lauren the whole time.  Oh, Kevin left.  He is the troll.  He is the troll of trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He had trolled me for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He did a puppet thing, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's still around doing puppets.  Yeah.  I don't want to know.  Lauren just sits there.  I'm looking at his expression while all of this is going on.  He loves his fights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He loves his fights.  Kevin just ran.  Kevin just ran.  I would run too.  I'm with Kevin.  I'd be like, oh yeah, this is upsetting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry I asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's go back to happy news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought that was funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody thinks, oh, the internet used to be really nice and people all would go along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was 2009.  That was 2009.  I thought that was hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  13 years because you went off the north and west.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I lost it and I felt bad about it.  In fact, I called Mike later and apologized and I apologized to Steve Gilmore.  But I stopped doing the Gilmore King.  You were right.  Well, it wasn't that incident.  It was a series of incidents of him.  That was one of the things he really liked to do was needle people and insinuate without coming out and saying it.  After several months of that, that's when I finally blew.  I actually liked Mike.  I did too.  He was a smart guy.  He was doing things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he had a thing.  He had to be difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You want to know something?  He's blocked me on Twitter.  Good for you.  I don't even know the cat.  I wonder if he blocked me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not going to take time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I remember finding that he blocked me a couple of years ago.  I'm like, I don't even know this guy.  Why am I blocked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you find when someone blocks you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When you go to look them up and it shows.  If you look their name, it'll say you're blocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's probably blocked anybody who has anything to do with me.  I would imagine.  Maybe that's it.  Amazon responding to the Supreme Court, potential Supreme Court decision on Roe v. Wade says,  we will reimburse employee travel for abortions.  That is such a big problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's why.  If you want to take a stand against abortions,  if you really believe that this is a big problem for your company,  you say, hey, I'm not going to have my operations in a state with.  Just move out.  Move out.  Hitting in the pocket in every state now is the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they are.  But do it that way.  They'd have to move out of 23 states.  And tell the people who live there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey, that doesn't make this bad.  That doesn't make.  Should they do more?  I agree.  But that doesn't make this itself bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This itself is bad because already people.  How many companies come out to say anything?  It's kind of like greenwashing.  No Levi Strauss Levi's Levi's also has come out.  But and we'll see more.  I mean, a this isn't an actual opinion yet.  But B saying you'll look out for your employees.  Half the reason America is dealing with like issues associated with like  health care and costs, like many of our costs are associated with this,  is because we're reliant on our companies to pay for things like this.  We don't have a social network that beholdens people.  To these companies for all kinds of things that really the government  probably should provide.  I personally believe why companies don't are saying exactly what you said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey, because why should they want to pay this?  I've never understood why they weren't the ones fighting for single.  It was a deal.  So it was a deal way back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, how did this start?  There's a really good book.  I'm not going to make this up, but sorry.  Go ahead.  Make it up.  Go ahead.  No, Stacey does it.  Stacey's a journalist, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's not a hot taker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically, when they were coming up with Medicare, Medicaid and all of the  social security programs, basically the government did this thing.  They basically agreed with the big industries of the day that they would  provide health insurance.  And I can't remember reason why, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's shameful when a company like Walmart doesn't pay its employees  sufficiently, so they have to be on food stamps and get government health  care.  That's basically Walmart leeching on the U.S.  government.  You think I don't think the government expected that, did they?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I would also argue that if you look at where the Republican Party seems to  be going, both with how they're.  Well, don't get us started on this.  Sorry.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The cynic in me looks at some of the policies and says, hey, many of the policies

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that we're enacting as a country really just create a more indentured population  that requires them to have these low wage crappy jobs.  And capitalism originally was built on slavery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And those chickens are coming home to roost, I have to say.  Yeah.  Between income inequality, ridiculously low minimum wages, wage slavery effectively,  lack of health care.  Now this latest pending decision from the Supreme Court, which was an assault on  women, I can't believe that we're going to go on like this.  Something has to snap.  Oh, we are.  I don't think we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People are not snapping.  People are going to their jobs and doing everything because.  And that's I mean, what are we doing right here right now, Leo?  We are talking about technology.  Yeah.  We are not.  I mean, honestly, I'm kind of.  If there were a general strike, though, I was I was thinking about this last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If we're agreed, we're going to do a general strike on Friday.  I would go dark.  We would go dark in this station.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey, I put that story in there because it's the only story I could find that was  related to the abortion decision and tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't see that.  You didn't see the story about, you know, governments potentially looking to buy data,  location data.  Oh, isn't that sweet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, there's a story positive side.  In fact, I saw somebody saying, you know, if you're using a menstrual application to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  monitor your menstrual period, you should stop because that could be used against you.  If abortion becomes illegal, that data could be used against you.  And then this story that, in fact, who is it selling this information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Peter Thiel was supposedly involved in one of them.  I'm trying to find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the CDC story.  Safe Graph says Mr.  Safe Graph. That's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Safe Graph is selling information about who visits abortion clinics, both coming and going  on sale by a data broker, including information from Planned Parenthood.  And guess what?  Hey, gang, it's only one hundred sixty dollars.  Oh, my gosh.  It's only and this comes from your phone records, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is this is one of those things.  OK, this is not by the way, credit to Vice, who got this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They actually paid the data broker one hundred sixty bucks for that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And Vice actually did a story earlier about the CDC getting location data on people following COVID  curfews, which in the wrong hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, as of a couple of hours ago, it says they have stopped selling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, they got caught. So they stopped.  They got caught.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, this is we need new cat.  So like there are rules in place for personally identifiable information, PII, right?  And we need to include location data as PII because there's no way you can anonymize a person's location data period.  You know where they go.  You know where they live.  Any location map can be.  Attributed to an individual very easily and that I know it sucks.  You know, we love location data.  The entire ad industry is like salivating, but we have to actually classify that as PII and we have to have really strict rules about who can access it and how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For a long time, I've been defending the invasions of privacy saying, well, where's the harms?  I want to see the harms. It's just selling ad tracking.  It's just selling for ads.  And I now see the harms. And it's we absolutely it is very clear how this could be misused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If your state.  So one of the the period tracking data is interesting because a there's been several stories over the last couple of years about how much they haven't really gained like outrage and traction.  But those apps take a lot of data and then they also sell it to a lot of people.  So that's that's a problem.  But then if you're looking at some states are looking at like, hey, could we maybe prevent abortion and like sue people or at their stuff?  Could we get access? They want jurisdiction.  They want jurisdiction over people who are not in because, you know, if you're murdering babies, the next state over, that's a problem.  Yeah.  So they're saying, hey, if you conceive in our state, then you're also under our jurisdiction and you can't get an abortion, which is an interesting idea.  And the only way you could figure out if someone's conceiving in your state is combining that sort of.  Now, they're not doing that now.  And if you were a lawyer, you know, but but yeah, we have to be aware of how much data we're giving these companies and how it's I mean, it's it can be used by the states.  They've already talked about using it in ways that are really creepy.  And we can't wait for the courts to come in and say this is bad because by that time someone's lives, probably many people's lives have already been ruined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Stacy, I think it's going to be worse than that.  If you look at the at the Alito opinion, what he's basically killing is the right to privacy.  So it kills a lot of things and it kills, I think, the principle to stand on to do just what you just asked for.  The courts will start throwing that out if we lose the right because there's no right to privacy in the Constitution.  It was created out of the four out of various parts.  I wrote about a whole book about this.  And if that if the one gets pulled up underneath that, it's not just this.  It's obviously all the issues of of who you choose to sleep with and who you choose to marry.  But it's everything else, too.  It goes into privacy in the Internet and says that any data can be grabbed up by government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, honestly, the reason I was so sanguine about data collections, I thought, well, the government would never do that.  I'm clearly well, was it naive?  Maybe not. Maybe it was optimism.  But I really thought we lived in a better place where government wouldn't do that.  But it's clear that some state governments certainly will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And some people want that.  I mean, they want the issue.  Yeah, the issue is when the state has access to this information, they can punish you.  And hello, 1984.  So I'm too incensed.  We got it. No, I am, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what's your heart rate?  Yeah, really?  Like check.  T-Mobile. Here's some T-Mobile news.  And this is actually IOT.  I think IOT interesting news.  I Verizon and T-Mobile both offer residential Internet using their 5G networks, which unless you are near, I think, a 5G tower with ultra wideband, the midband, the low band, I don't think is fast enough.  That's just LTE.  Or maybe you're lucky and you've got the millimeter wave.  But if you're near a fast enough 5G tower, these are pretty good deals.  My daughter lives in Marin.  And I noted I brought I had a Verizon phone there and I said, wow, you're really you're right.  You're getting ultra wideband and it's fast.  So when it was time to get her Internet for a new apartment, instead of getting Comcast at 60 bucks a month, I already have a Verizon account.  I was able to get 25 bucks a month, get this Verizon wireless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Femtocells.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No. Yeah, it's it's it's not a femtocell because it's not for your cell phone.  It's a it's a little Wi-Fi receiver that uses the 5G, but it's 380 megabits down.  And I've been doing tests all through the day.  Yeah. Nineteen megabits up for 25 bucks a month.  Why not? Yeah.  Now, there's a couple of catches.  One is it is not as maintainable or there aren't as many settings.  For instance, I don't I to protect my privacy, I use Next DNS for my DNS provider and do a lot of blocking at the house.  You can't change your DNS provider.  Verizon clearly wants all that privacy.  That's data. There's a good data in there.  And it's pretty clear Verizon doesn't want you to modify the DNS settings.  So it's a very limited. It's not a great but it's 25 bucks.  Phone. No, no, it's because, you know, she's on her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. OK. If you have Verizon phone, could you modify it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I don't know about the phone, but you could certainly if you're using this thing on each computer that connects to it, you could use next DNS individually.  So you can't modify the router.  But nevertheless, even if you do, Verizon knows it's you and they know what you're doing.  So you know what? Verizon's got a lot of information from that T-Mobile just announced.  One of the things Verizon said is this is an introductory rate.  We reserve the right to increase it. OK. T-Mobile just said that's what they normally do.  We're going to give you in home internet.  They announced this today for fifty dollars a month and we're never going to change the price.  And if you're already a customer, thirty dollars a month.  So this is disruptive. I think.  Now, Stacey, you're the IOT expert.  But I do feel like if you live in an area with 5G ultra wideband or as T-Mobile calls it, ultra capacity, this is a very good choice for that price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds like a good. I don't know how it deals with IOT, but it does do with broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, these are IOT devices, really, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're routers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I call a router.  This may be a nomenclature issue, but I think anything that goes on the internet that is not a computer is an IOT device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But OK. Oh, you're one of those people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, man. That's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, if you from a broadband perspective, this is good.  Huge competition.  It's competition.  It's also so.  For this is are they using 28 megahertz?  Are they using the mid band for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They must be because my daughter, like I said, three hundred and eighty megabits down, 19 up rock solid day and night, even during commute hours.  She's near Highway 101.  I imagine they have towers right there.  So she's probably very proximate to a 5G UW tower.  Yeah, sounds good.  You should buy it only and you should.  That's what you should do.  You should check T-Mobile or Verizon.  Make sure you're getting that 5G.  Now T-Mobile is offering 15 day home trial.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought that was actually pretty disruptive because it's not like you can normally test broadband.  How else would you know?  Yeah. Yeah.  So now you can actually just very easily bring this in and be like, hey, is this going to work for me?  Boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They lock it in for life for both home and business.  The thirty dollars a month is not, I know, locked in, but it's for existing Magenta Max T-Mobile customers.  They will also give you $50 off any streaming device, including Apple TV.  So it's kind of to encourage that.  They give you 50% off YouTube TV for a deal.  So they're really this is a arrow aimed at the heart of the cable companies.  And they give you they'll help help you cancel your existing some up to $500 in early termination fee coverage.  This is like Comcast.  Come and get us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Direct TV did this years ago too.  Right.  When they came in and said, you know what, we'll pay your termination fee.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good move.  So I think this is pretty amazing.  You should check to see if you're eligible.  Verizon did not charge for the router or the equipment.  There was zero cost for that.  Same with T-Mobile.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say I would just look at the reviews for how it behaves like in rain and other kind of events.  If they're in the mid band, they should be fine.  But that's just something to think about because as you get up into those higher spectrums, they attenuate faster.  So they don't go through as many walls and bushes and trees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, then Verizon does want you to put it near a window.  Although I tested in a variety of positions in our apartment.  It was it was worked fine.  Worked the same almost everywhere.  Let me just let me just do a I've been doing speed tests on it.  You can do a remote speed test on a new speed test on it just to see if it's affected by time of day.  Because that was the other concern is that, you know, maybe who's on.  Yeah, maybe if you know the commute hour and everybody's on that tower, maybe that's not so good.  Let me so I'll just run a quick speed test while we're talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My T-Mobile signal is not very good in my neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it had you'd have to be somewhere and that's mostly urban areas where you're going to get high speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This this motivates them to put it more.  Well, they are rolling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say this isn't the same as your mobile.  I mean, I don't know if they're using the same spectrum for their mobile 5G.  Oh, you think they're not. Oh, that's interesting.  I thought they were doing something different.  Your mobile 5G is actually in the lower megahertz because they were using so that but I don't I don't remember.  So so here's the deal. Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know about but I do know a lot about T-Mobile because I'm a T-Mobile customer and my main phone.  They rolled out the 700 megahertz 5G almost.  Yeah, but that's exactly they have speeds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're OK. OK.  But that spectrum is going to be way better.  It's more crowded and they have tinier channels.  So they do they are doing it at LTE speeds.  But that's because their channels are wide.  So they could be faster down the road, you think?  Probably not because they don't have like it's 700 megahertz.  I think your channels are limited to either 10 or 20 megahertz wide.  Right. So but for the in-home, if they're using the mid band, then they're going to be using 28.  And those channels are freaking huge because no one's there.  So then you could have a hundred megahertz channel.  And then that means you can pack as many bits as you can in each of those megahertz.  Right. So so when you say LTE speeds, that's sort of true.  But the underlying technology like I mean, 5G is actually really LTE release like 15 through 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I have noted, though, when I get the UW 5G UW on my Verizon phone or the 5G you see on my T-Mobile phone,  that's when I get those speeds.  So I mean, maybe someday they'll be on the low band as well.  But I really think it's the mid band that they're using for both here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should be able to find that out. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, would you? Because I'm curious. It's a really I mean, it's kind of very easy to set up.  It's you can see the signal strength of it, you know, on the on the app.  You can I mean, it's really kind of an amazing it has ethernet ports.  So I connected her IMAQ directly to it so she could get the highest speed possible.  It's it's but the limitations are here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Their home Internet is 1900 megahertz.  Oh, they're using OK, 1900, 17, 700, 2100, 600 and six and two point five.  So they're actually they're actually most of its low band.  Interesting. So it's all the same. So good for them.  So and I'm wondering how many channels, how many megahertz they have it, the mid band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So again, I was getting pretty consistently about three hundred eighty megabits down in nineteen up, which is honestly so yeah, three twenty down.  I just did the test. Nineteen three up.  Lanes is a little high for 20 milliseconds latency.  So you couldn't do the show from it. Well, I don't know what the jitter is.  Twenty is not awful milliseconds.  That's you know, it's one fiftieth of a second download again.  Three twenty upload 19. Anyway, I think this is actually I'm thrilled to see it.  I really feel like, you know, T-Mobile's heralding it is Internet Freedom Day.  But I really think it's a shot against the cable companies.  People are starting to cut the cord and this gives them a way to do that.  I think that's great. I'm still going to stick with the stupid cable company.  Well, I have to too, because I don't have at home. I don't have anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Personally, I'm spoiled by this speed, the download speeds and being able to watch these streaming services that I watch in very, very high quality is quite nice.  So there's value in it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But that was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just me singing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Good thing you're good at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that was her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was sorry. That was that was my excited like I got to nerd out.  I feel I offer the most value that I'm like, oh, here's a deeply nerdy topic I can offer Simmons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why I brought it up. Change. Change the subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you. Make you feel bad in that and putting out that routers are not IOT devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they are. Why is that not an IOT device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, look, if we define everything as not being a computer, then we have to say, well, what's a computer?  I mean, my nest thermostat is actually like a server because it's I mean, so basically when I think IOT devices, I think more modern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, everything's a computer, but I'm saying no display, no keyboard, no mouse, no direct user interface.  I guess that has a user interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, sure.  If you want to call it an IOT device, but I certainly don't like a lot of it.  I'd be wrong. Go ahead. Be a fool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right with me.  You know, I think my my sense of it calling an IOT device comes from more about security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the security people do this all the time and it kind of drives me nuts because they're like IOT devices are a huge problem.  And it's really routed.  Yeah, they're like my light bulbs.  And I'm like, it's not your light bulbs.  It's your 20 year old network DVR, your 15 year old printers and your 10 year old routers that are the issue.  So I feel like. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Anyway, I am going to declare victory over Facebook.  You can thank me later.  Facebook has pulled the plug on their podcast business.  After a year, they will end the short form audio feature, shut the audio hub no more for the pivot audio.  Yeah, they were. That was a big deal. Right.  They were going to do audio. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was fun. Google for dropping things.  Google at least waits a few years and forgets about it.  Facebook drops it in no time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that was the big Mark Zuckerberg thing.  Among other things, we're going to pivot to audio.  Anyway, I.  Spotify, you're next.  We have outlasted Facebook.  Oh, no, that I don't think is going to happen.  I think Spotify is really moving in hard and fast.  Let's do a quick changelog and then we'll get your picks of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google TV announces favorite channels for its life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't sound so excited, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They already have something, but now you can kind of see what's live now.  It's some difference. I don't use YouTube TV, so I use it this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I press the button on the YouTube.  No, this isn't YouTube TV. This is Google TV.  I press the button on my Google TV remote and I played David Bowie and Freddie Mercury under pressure on YouTube music.  And then I went to work.  That's a favorite channel now.  The perfect use of Google.  Pressure under pressure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good. So that's why your heart rates up.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was dancing around the house yourself something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google Play system and updates for May.  Bring nearby share to self.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's what they were talking about when we got on.  They were talking about nearby share self sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know what nearby share is. It's like Apple's AirDrop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is now you can share between your devices on your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  So you would share to another device that you own.  OK, right.  Right. Like why would I share this photo to myself?  I'm here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the funny thing.  I could swear we talked about this last week and it's so lacking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We did. We talked about nearby share coming.  Now it is here.  It's here.  It's a change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And a redesign for Google help and a lot more.  And yeah, if you watched all about Android, you'd know all about that.  Nearby share lets you move files across all your Android devices.  So that's very cool.  There it is.  All your Android devices hassle free.  Google Assistant and Chrome powered by Duplex can now auto change stolen passwords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, that is how does it work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope it tells you what your password is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it'll remember it, but you have to use Chrome for the rest of your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just can't be. You're not responsible.  I'm not going to let you win this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if a password you just logged in with, so I just logged into a site, it was found in a data breach, you know, like have I been pwned?  Google Assistant and Chrome will offer to change your password automatically.  It'll pop up and then you'll get a blue button.  See, it says it right here. Change your password.  Now Chrome found the password in data breach.  Your assistant can change your password automatically.  You press the button, change automatically.  And the process begins.  It will navigate you to the change password page.  And then the assistant will generate a suggested password.  You'll have to do you have to interact a little bit.  You have to say, yes, I want that.  And it will save it to your credentials manager in Chrome.  At any point, you could take over if you say, I want to do this myself.  That's a good anything that encourages people to change your password.  If it's a bad password, it's a good thing.  And it's free.  Yep. Comes with your Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Powered by Duplex. I'm not sure how that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because Duplex is the thing that calls and makes a reservation for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I guess they're calling.  It's like everything's IOT.  They're calling everything with AI.  Everything's AI.  It's all AI. It's all Duplex.  May's Pixel 6 and 6 Pro update is out.  My major improvement only to haptic feedback.  There's some minor little hoo-has.  Just three fixes total.  Fix for occasionally causing a display to wake without user interaction.  Actually, my Google Nest Hub does that every once in a while.  In the middle of the night, big bright white light will come on.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is that a security camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no. It's just like the Hub thing.  Maybe, I don't know, maybe it thinks I'm snoring and it's trying to wake me up.  I don't know.  And there's a fix for an issue causing launcher crashes after restarting.  Roll me over.  Roll me over in the clover.  Get ready.  Google Chrome OS is going to be rebranded to drop the space.  What space?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In between the...  What?  There is no space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  Okay.  The system officially is Chrome Space OS.  Although it is often stylized lowercase c, no space.  That's all I ever see.  But the official name is Chrome Space OS.  I know.  Okay.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who made a million dollars for that brilliant move?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going...  Well, think of the money Google's saving by eliminating all those wasted spaces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it used to be you had to have led spaces.  Yep, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, yep.  That's the kind of thing we talk about right here on the Google change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Aren't you glad you asked for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Riveting.  Let's take a break and then the picks of...  If I mentioned one thing before...  You want to do a TikTok?  Go ahead.  You can do a TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Well, you could do that.  I just want to mention last week you talked about the Theranos...  Shlag.  Did she get something?  There's a story in here on 146.  There's bloodlust.  There's bloodlust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bloodlust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Theranos merchandise on eBay, according to the Guardian, sparks bloodlust among Elizabeth  Holm fans.  Well, or people who collect memorabilia from failed companies like our friend Christina  Warren.  I wouldn't assume that she is an Elizabeth Holm's fan.  No.  Five pens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are these people who are excited because of the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think we could take full credit.  Like the dropout?  Oh, maybe.  I thought you meant a twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The harsh one.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You egotist, you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think we should take credit for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So they're probably more Amanda Seyfried fans or fans of the Hulu show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they're $150 for three Theranos pens.  I think it's more...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Failed company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's Christina Warren stuff.  I think the Guardian got it wrong.  I don't think this is Elizabeth Holm's fans.  No.  This is people who, like Christina, want a Theranos pop socket to put in their collection.  Right.  We talked about this last week with a great story about Christina Warren on NPR.  NPR?  Doing all that, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, I just want to mention that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, that's a good one.  I guess there's a few we should throw in.  Rape My Skype Room has a book coming.  His name is Claude Taylor.  You knew that.  That's his name, yeah.  I didn't know that.  How to Zoom Your Room.  Talk about cashing in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How long is the book?  Is it 10 pages?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could write this book.  I mean, you should have written this book, but you don't have that room raider brand.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they have Connie Schultz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, the former reporter from...  They did a caricature of her room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh.  Four eyes.  So I'm jealous as heck.  I mean, yes, I got a 10.  You got a 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They should have a caricature of your room.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it a caricature?  Is it like a diorama?  I don't understand.  It's an illustration.  I mean, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to have to get that book.  All right.  There are other shorts.  Oh, wait.  We're Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Elon.  So a lot of people like Rape My Dogs, et cetera, all the merchandise you get from having a  successful Twitter account, Rape My Room.  Yes.  Maybe he should take a cut of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, like a percentage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like a platform fee.  You owe me big time, buddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  That's my free idea of the day.  It's worth exactly what you pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, is your video ready yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google.  I was going to show a behind the scenes video I shot of my son.  It's so funny because every time I launch it, since your video will be ready soon, it  shows just one frame.  Watch.  Oh, it didn't do it this time.  It shows one frame and then it says, well, now your video is still not ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  You should probably stop that and re-upload it, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's fine on Apple Photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was there a couple of days ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was showing how Salt Hank shoots his chicken parm with the vodka penne sauce with his Canon  R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I stole Salt Hank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that in his apartment?  It's posted on my Instagram.  I could put it on my, I could go to my Instagram.  No.  So this is great.  He just moved his apartment because he didn't like the kitchen in his apartment.  It wasn't photogenic.  Well, it wasn't photogenic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that's his job, man.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He needs to shoot it.  So here is the video.  I should turn on the sound.  This is, I got, okay, wait, wait for it.  Wait for it.  When it plops into the Cuisine Art.  Oh, son of a.  We need to work on your Instagram.  How does social media work here?  I posted the behind the scenes.  This is of him making the thing where the Salt Hank sets up a shot.  All right.  The key is now you're using the Canon R6.  Canon R6.  Video.  Yeah.  And weirdly named Mike, the comica comica, but gets the job done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not conica.  Comica.  Comica.  Is he getting proposals from the show?  He's writing a book proposal right now.  Oh, yeah.  Like to get married.  Like to marry him.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He gets a lot of attention.  Attention.  I'm trying to say it without.  It always has to have a little bit of salt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look at the plug.  The plug.  Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Hank, I come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And of course he's wearing his cuts.  Oh, yeah.  This is another advertiser.  Yes.  Cuts.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to stand back.  All right.  So this whole thing set up for one second, the plop of the sauce into the cuisine.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What happens if he messes it up?  He has to take it all out and wash the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Start over.  It's all about the plop, baby.  Anyway, that was I respect.  That's fun.  I totally respect that.  He he loves what he's doing.  That's that's all I care about.  He's he's become.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You might care that he can also afford a place to live.  That's not your basement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, like I said, he's moved into a he doesn't live in the basement.  He's moved into.  Well, no, I know that's what I'm saying.  Although I'll be honest, that kitchen is his mom's.  It's not.  And he's been shooting there a lot because so he's got two million followers now.  This is the video that he was making.  One point two million views on this video.  This is and wait, wait for the plop because it's really good.  You're going to hear it.  Sound is his thing now.  Yeah, it makes a difference.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hear that?  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's got a lot of travel in the background.  I love his edits.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You know what I realized?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He doesn't cross the line.  He's actually I don't know if he knows this or not.  What do you mean?  I was when I did the thing, I'm walking around and I didn't do any cuts.  It wasn't a problem, but his angle on the whole thing is the same.  He's always coming in from the left.  Always.  And I realize if he can't if he switches the way at once at all, he'd be crossing the line and make people uncomfortable.  I don't think he knows that rule.  Maybe he does.  He studied it in college.  He probably does.  But I probably shouldn't assume this is all instinctual.  He's he's obviously knows what he's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love it.  I just don't like what TikTok is doing with him for me as a follower.  I never see his videos.  Yeah, I know.  Same here.  What do I have to do?  They're weeks old when I get the alerts from him.  Yeah, that's how they do it.  Yeah.  I follow him actively.  Why are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, what you have to do is what I always do, which is go to his name, search for him and watch the videos.  That's how I always do it.  Yeah.  His biggest video, I think 30 million views.  But he tells me it's not the views, it's the likes.  Yeah.  It's not the views.  You've got thirty four and a half million likes.  That's awesome.  That's a good number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis, did you see that I actually did a TikTok?  No.  Wow.  Well, I shared it with you on Twitter.  What's your handle on TikTok?  It's probably still Ant underscore Pruitt.  It is everywhere, isn't it?  That's what I tried anyway.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a chase Pruitt.  That would be no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or just Ant Pruitt one word maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't even know your handle, do you?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I mean, there's how many Ant Pruitts are out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apparently none.  Son of a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just did this thing and I thought about Mr. Jarvis when I did it.  I was like, there's a Hannah Pruitt.  It is an underscore Pruitt.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, see another thing, TikTok screwing up.  Oh, I have to view all results.  There you are.  So it wasn't that wasn't the first one it was showing me.  Wow.  Is this the new one?  This first one here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that one of the.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're doing a video of our sponsor, Blue Lands container, which you're making it look better than they make it look.  You probably should sell this to them.  You're like you're lighting it from within and all that stuff.  And it's very cool.  You were like you need to do a hands on photography for product shots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I was rehearsing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cool.  How did you get the green light?  Is that behind it?  That's actually part of my pick of the week.  Oh, well, we'll get there in a moment.  But first, a word from our sponsor.  Our show today brought to you by IT Pro TV.  Now, I know you were an IT pro before we snagged you away from your job.  You worked in IT.  It's a great job.  It pays well.  You can if you're into tech, you get to do the tech that you love.  But one of the hardest things is getting that first job.  You got to talk your way into that first job.  Right.  Oh, no, really, I'm good at it.  So that's why this certification thing was set up so that you could take a test like the A plus test and show that's for desktop tech support.  Show you know the material.  Those certs are so important.  That's why people study.  They take the tests.  They look for somewhere to learn IT.  And I want to tell you the place to go that you will love is IT Pro TV.  It's an online IT training platform.  It's the best out there.  It's got the most up to date content.  Look at all the categories, certs in every area.  They'll even help you figure out what area you want.  They've got coaches, counselors.  They've got all the subjects matter.  They just released a new course, CompTIA's A plus.  I was just talking about that.  Core one and core two series.  This is for people who, you know, desktop support.  They support today's core technologies and its security, its networking, its virtualization.  This A plus cert is the industry standard for launching an IT career in today's digital world.  This is what you need for a lot of IT jobs out there.  So take the course.  You will learn about hardware.  You'll learn about operating systems, networking, security, troubleshooting.  You can actually take the test before you take the test.  They have practice exams.  You can work on hardware that you don't even own.  They have virtual labs.  IT Pro TV has seven studios.  They're working Monday through Friday creating new content.  So it's always up to date.  They have to do that because the IT world changes minute by minute.  New programs, new versions, new tests, new questions.  Their courses go from those studios into the library in 24 hours.  All the courses have transcripts.  So it's easy to search them to find the part you're looking for.  You can watch a chunk in 20 to 30 minutes.  So it's a very easy way to do it during a lunch hour or a break.  And with those virtual labs and practice tests, you know, you're going to be in great shape.  To take that CompTIA A plus test, get that cert, get that first job.  The best part about IT Pro TV, you can learn and get certified on your schedule.  So if you've got another job, maybe you're doing a podcast, you know, or something like that.  Maybe.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You can still study.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's always entertaining.  IT Pro TV's courses are fun because they're edutainers, they call them.  They're teachers, are experts in the field.

She wanted waffles two hours ago.  She's probably fainted.  I actually got a waffle.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whew.  Someone on the chat caught me during my little waffle interlude.  Waffle Express.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Landshark, got a waffle for you.  Stacey's pick of the week this week, your thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is actually a thing.  It's from our site.  So it's Stacey on IoT.  Kevin did a review of the, what's it called?  The Schlage.  He always calls it Schlage.  So I've always had to do it like, wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do you say it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've always wondered.  Schlage is the famous lockmaker.  Schlage.  Okay.  Yeah, it's Schlage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just Kevin being so shlaggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Schlage.  The Schlage Encode Plus Smart Wi-Fi Lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I have the Encode Plus Wi-Fi lock, but this is one with HomeKey.  And I'm not a HomeKit person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, HomeKey lets you open the door with your iPhone.  Yes, or your Apple Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or your watch.  Oh, I got to get this.  So yes, this is why we're, so I didn't try it because I'm not an Apple user.  So Kevin did for us and he loves it.  He loves it and his family loves it.  I think it's safer because it's NFC, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not Bluetooth.  It is NFC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they have a Bluetooth radio in there too, but you can use NFC.  I would turn that off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get really nervous about the Bluetooth.  But if it's NFC, that means I have to touch it like Apple Pay.  That's very secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah.  So this particular lock is $299.99.  The Schlage Encode Wi-Fi lock is $249.99.  So if you don't need HomeKit, you're at the HomeKey functionality, then you don't have  to do that.  But these are good locks.  I mean, mine is done well.  Granted, mine's on my front door and we don't use the remote unlock feature all that often.  We mostly unlock it with a keypad, which still the power draw is moving the motor to move  the deadbolt.  But the locks or the batteries lasted for like, I think almost a year, like 10 or 11  months.  Which is pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Even though it's pulling the deadbolt back.  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  So this is a good lock.  It works.  It has a keypad for everybody who wants a keypad.  And this particular one has HomeKey.  And there you go.  I don't know if you can buy it just yet, but you should be able to buy it soon.  And then a reminder.  Yes.  Sunday is Mother's Day, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you say that as a mother?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I just, you know, I feel like, no, I just, I, you know, I always, you never want to forget  your mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I told you, I gave her a June Oven for Mother's Day.  She said, Oh Leo, you shouldn't give me a June Oven.  You already gave me, I forgot what it was.  Something stupid.  That's what she said.  No, that's something stupid.  Something dumb.  I forgot what I gave her.  I said, no, Mom, you need a real Mother's Day present.  That was weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, here's an update.  I think it's good that we were called out, says Aron Hoffman, the CEO of location data  provider Safecraft.  He told this to Protocol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think it's good that we got caught selling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's basically saying we were not aware of this.  Oh, they didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So there you go.  Sorry.  Little update there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They didn't know.  Well, thank you for keeping it, keeping us up to date on that.  And thank you.  Sunday is not Mother's Day in the UK, says John Aron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  See, I'm totally not listening to you.  I'm reading this article and he said, okay, already researchers are complaining that we  took this data down because they actually want to see if these laws dampen family planning  visits.  Twist.  I would argue that's why we need to have good regulations around this data in how you access  it, who gets to access it and what they can do with it.  I agree.  Okay.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry.  I agree.  Just wanted to update.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry.  Sorry.  If you build in the UK, this is US centric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We already had it in March 19th.  But thank you to all the mothers in the US of A.  And now it's time for a number from Mr. Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'll give you a little short one.  So after last week's show, our new friend, your new friend, my long standing friend,  Glenn Fleischman, tweeted this online 162.  Someone is selling a picture of me on eBay.  What?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  For $20?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For $20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For $20.  My mother wouldn't buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why did they get it?  Where did they get it?  That was the best photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wasn't happy, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, and they ruined it by the ballpoint pen by circling your name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why did they keep it?  I love that it's a historical image too.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know.  Do you think if I buy it, it will have that watermark on it?  Because that's ugly.  No, does this say best offer?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Don't do this to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, look.  You bought it.  It's from historicimages.com.  Oh, let's make an offer.  Best offer is no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't show my log yet.  Possible for framing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Two cents.  What should I offer?  Make an offer.  Can you offer $0?  Catch a bit?  Maybe.  Maybe to take it?  Similar items sold for $12 to $16.  Oh, Jeff Jarvis, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you're going all the way up to $10?  You're betting against yourself, man.  I'm going to start at $10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Will you autograph it if I buy it?  Oh, yes.  This is suspenseful.  Give the seller a day to review your offer.  If it's accepted, you have four days to make your payment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You'll get a notification right now.  I didn't do buy it now.  No, no, no.  The notification's coming back from the seller.  Oh, somebody made an offer.  Let me please dump this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's like buy it now.  It's not an auction.  If I make an offer, then he has to say, hmm.  Yes or no.  I wish that he would jump on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to be stuck with his photo now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We found another picture of you on eBay.  Oh, man.  And this is you with some other guy.  That was the publisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got a box of stuff over there.  Should I?  No, it's a different seller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, Mr. Jarvis.  It's a different seller.  It's a different seller.  This one came from Historic Images 03, and that one's from R Fleet Jr.  Inventor of the Anima.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That one has a nice kind of smirk on it, I think.  Oh, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm kind of sad I bought the wrong one.  It's too late.  Maybe I just buy both of them.  I don't want Klingman in mine or Klingle Smith.  I could put my face on Klingle Smith's face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, make it off.  Make it so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Now he's only asking $13.99, so I should do 10 to 10.  Save some money.  Okay.  Send that along.  This is suspenseful.  I might have two Jeff Jarvis pictures.  Your email is blowing up right now.  I'm very concerned about y'all.  There might be more.  If you're selling a Jeff Jarvis picture on eBay, you ought to let me know.  We found your buyer.  Wow.  What's the number, Mr. J?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, sorry, I got to get my eyesight back from laughing.  So you know the long S, this is about a typographical moment.  You know the long S how you say Congress.  If you go to line 167.  Okay.  And to refresh everybody's memory.  Oh yeah, we're talking about.  Congress of the United States.  It's like it says C-O-N-G-R-E-F-S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Congress.  Every school kid has seen this.  It's like fs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Congress.  Yeah.  And so this confuses the heck out of everybody who sees this, but for years and years and  years, Ben Franklin was one of the ones who said get rid of it.  It's ridiculous.  So.  Does it represent a double S?  When is it used?  No, it's not.  No, it's just another S. And I don't even know the pattern of why one goes in one place  and one goes in the other place.  But it's just another S. It's a long S and a short S.  No difference.  No difference.  So now go to line 165.  This is what you learn on Twitter.  If you can.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I found it.  Yeah.  Technically we should be Fneezing.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So actually says Susie Dent to Dennis Duncan who wrote a wonderful book about the index,  the history of the index, that it actually is not sneezing.  It's Fneezing.  Fneezing.  That it was a long S to confuse somebody and it wasn't an F. It was an S. So the actual  word is to Fneez.  And if you then go to the next line, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my God.  This is like a scavenger hunt.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Dennis Duncan who wrote this wonderful book called Index, a History of the.  Yeah.  Which is wonderful.  It's brand new and out.  You'd probably enjoy it.  It's about the history of the index.  And so you'll see there it says Sneezing, Fneezing and try to pronounce Fneezeth.  Fneezeth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whenever he finds Fneezeth or Gapeth, he maketh to foath his faith in the sign of the th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So for now on, and the reason by the way, this is a little piece that explains why you should  not have been blessed because it was the plague and you were trying to not die with  the plague.  It's now you no longer sneeze, you Fneez.  Fneez.  Fneez.  That's a show title.  Fneez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  God bless you.  Oh my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fneez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fneez.  Well there you.  Because it sounds like it, right?  Right?  It sounds a lot more.  Fneez.  Fneez.  Fneez.  Oh my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Weren't you fascinated by that?  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fneez.  Hey, take a bow Mr. Jarvis.  That was next level there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you were wondering how Ant got that beautiful sheen on the Blue Land bottle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a very, very inexpensive light I got off Amazon.  I don't know how long it's going to last.  It's called the Fneez.  Fneez.  It's super duper cheap, but it really works well.  There's only 30 bucks and we have it in the show notes.  LED light, you can change the colors of it, change the color temperature.  And if you're doing product photography, you can hide it in your scene to help separate  your product from the background.  Oh that's nice.  So you get different colors in your...  Right.  And if you want to just use it for portraitures of people or video or whatever, you can use  it as a hair light or something like that.  It's super useful and you can just charge it up with a USB-C charger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what would be fun to do with this is time exposures in the dark.  Light paint.  Light paint.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And again, it's only about...it fits in the size of my hand so I guess it's roughly five  inches.  Foot by foot.  Yeah.  So it's roughly five inches, but nice little light.  But that's the first thing.  But my main picks of the week is to tell everybody to take care of themselves.  Pick number one, I went to have my physical not too long ago and the doctor is just like,  wow.  I've never seen such big hands in my whole life.  And he's like, well, what are you doing?  I said, I'm the most healthy, unhealthy person that you'll meet, but I take care of myself  by taking supplements such as good old fish oil.  Fish oil, good for you.  I also take fish oil.  It's not expensive.  It's really, really helpful for your heart.  I also take garlic tablets.  That's helping with cholesterol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually noticed I've purchased this fish oil six times.  See?  So there you go.  So take care of yourselves, people.  I'm with you on that.  And you eat garlic in a bottle?  Yeah, because I don't like garlic so I take the tablets.  And it upsets some people's stomachs as well.  That's true.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just get you some fish oil, get you some garlic to help take care of your blood and  cholesterol in your heart and all of that.  Nice.  And lastly, this is May.  I love it.  This garlic is called Puritan's Pride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Puritan's Pride.  Oh, OK.  The Puritans would have been so proud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  This is May and it is Mental Health Awareness Month.  And so to shout out Mental Health Awareness Month, I wanted to mention a book with Ms.  Jennifer Lewis.  She's called The Mother of Black Hollywood.  And you may have seen her on a couple of different movies and TV shows.  Oh, she's the star of Black-ish.  Yes.  And she's a hilarious woman, but she has had a really interesting history in Hollywood  with some of the things that she dealt with being treated as a woman.  And then she battled mental health problems.  And in this book, she just comes straight out and tells you all of her struggles with  mental health and says, hey, if you need help, go get help.  And if you need medication, go get the medication and take your medication.  Stop with the stupid stigmas of people being on medications for their own mental health.  OK.  So check her out.  Ms. Jennifer Lewis, the Mother of Black Hollywood memoir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you want to hear her voice because it's good.  Oh, it's funny.  Listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a lot of predictable voices in Hollywood, but I'll be damned if now, at the moment of  truth, I could remember one line of the script I had studied.  Oh, what a voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love her.  Jennifer Lewis, the Mother of Black Hollywood.  My pick of the week is this photo of Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you own it yet?  No.  This is another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This one comes from vintage press photos and it has a red dot on the back.  But I think it's kind of no, it's not the same, is it?  You're now in a plaid suit.  Oh, no.

Transcript:  He still looks just as cranky.  Jeff, interesting bitch face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But why are there so many eight by tens of Jeff Jarvis on eBay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The world wants to know.  How long has it been there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Should I buy it too?  No, I only two.  No, I only two is more than I need.  Two is more than you need.  You think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually think you should buy as many as you can find wallpaper in Jeff's house when  he goes out of town and just like have him come home.  Yes.  It would be amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  Well, just all right.  I'm going to make a $5 offer just in case.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, oh, they turn it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They say Jeff Jarvis is worth more than $5.  Wow.  Take that.  That was pretty damn quick.  The guy said, no, absolutely not.  That's my final offer.  They probably have a floor on it.  Yeah, they have a floor.  So let's find out what it is.  You can't, by the way, keep doing this.  You've got to only have like one offer left.  So let's try eight.  No, he's going to, I'm going to say not well, $15.  Yeah, eight.  That's more than half.  There you go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wasn't rejected out of hand.  And here it goes.  They want their money.  They're not taking a penny less.  They feel that Jeff is...  They've seen there's a rush on it.  They see there's a market now.  You're betting against yourself now.  They're checking on the other ones.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's see if he'll take, will you take 10?  Oh yeah, he'll take 10.  All right, so $10 is the cost of a Jeff Jarvis.  He was accepted by the Jeff Jarvis family.  He was accepted by the Jeff Jarvis family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was accepted by the Jeff Jarvis family.  What if you have to pay all the others?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that a better one than the other one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't reject the acceptance.  You're stuck, right?  No, you're stuck.
