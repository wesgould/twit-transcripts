Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see your modern house your 22nd century house. Oh  Yes, so where do we where do we start today? I don't I don't I don't I don't see any  you know, usually I can see a foothold a good place to  To you know something chewy we can really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Begin with and I don't see I have two things that I saw that I was like  I can't wait to talk about these good. That's what I'm looking for  Okay, one was I saw that Google officially announced that they were canceling the pixel and I was sad for Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't see that. Oh, they they're canceling the lap the Chromebook. I believe so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's let's find it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the best laptop ever made. Oh  Wait, now it's not happening. Why Google morning what calls time? Okay, this was at Mobile World Congress

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is a random. They said no, they're not doing it. He said they're not doing it. They're not making it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is from Ted brunch Frederick. Okay, Lali noire  In a small meeting with journalists at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona today  Rick Osterloh who of course remember he was the head of Motorola now as senior vice president for hardware at the Google  said  That the pixel laptop has hit the end of the line after just two iterations  When asked if Google had plans to produce any more laptops Osterloh said no plans to do one right now  You know, actually, I'm actually glad to see this because now I can pull this pull the string  Pull the trigger. I've been waiting on because I was like you Jeff as  As nice as the Chromebook plus is and by the way, I gave it to my daughter. She's a college senior  She had the Chromebook pixel and she wanted something lighter. I so I brought the Samsung  I said what is this is and there's a beauty of a Chromebook is she can say yeah  I'll take that one and just logs in it's just her Chromebook immediately  So she liked the lightweight a Samsung  But she you know, she didn't I don't think she has the same standards for hardware that that you do  So I have very high standards  I'm looking for a pixel replacement and I still think Dell when they come out with a touchscreen  Dell for work Dell for business Chromebook will be a good choice. Have you decided?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know what I did  What I did return the Samsung the sound went out and didn't work  For perfect and you know what else I did what else did you do I went and I bought the only  Lately used Chromebook pixel 2015 I can find

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing's wrong with yours, but it's just as a backup. I just want a backup. I just want about yeah  I did you pay for it thousand there were two online

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One was eighteen hundred dollars  Okay  So somebody cut and then a nice a nice civilized decent moral person charged a thousand dollars for it  That's only ones you can find online period period. There are tons of 2013s that are running about 350 dollars  But you know, I have that and don't want that. Sorry. It's a lot in this morning outfit  But yes, I bought it I bought a second pixel because I'm not concerned I'll use one at home in one of the office  I have the 2013 in the office. I'll take one of these in there and  But I don't know what

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Said Chrome OS is a huge initiative in the company Google hasn't backed away from laptops  We have the number two market share in US and UK  But we have no plans for Google branded laptops. In other words, they're gonna there is no premium Chromebook  Yeah, well there could be this is not premium. Yeah. Yeah, and I don't think the pro will be any any more premium

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's mid-range which is good. I mean mid-range is new too. They were they were all low-end  They were all all tinning low-end except for the pixel. I think Google should have waited until somebody made a decent one  Now the truth is they did I have no idea how many they sold very few  I'm sure it was just a  Way to show what chrome can do but now we don't have that now  If you want to go out if I convince somebody to buy that Chromebook and buy the best Chromebook they can get they're gonna get  a mediocre Chromebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, there is an update Frederick then put in this because Osterloh maybe got a little hot water  I don't know because he sent us an additional comment regarding the future of Google branded laptops whether called pixel or not  I should clarify  We don't have any plans to discuss at this time  That's just  I got in trouble. Yeah at this time they but it implies that maybe at some time they will I wish you wouldn't do that  If you're not gonna do it don't do it and let us then  Pick the best one available that's because otherwise I was waiting for pixel 3, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is so the the the aces is gonna have it you you tweeted that Leo that the the  There is a nasus with more memory. Yeah coming for Ram coming. Yeah, I think that's probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the one to watch aces makes great stuff  They do sell the pixel see tablets still on the on the store which is they do and I have surprising to me frankly  Yeah, I love it still. I love it. You were the only one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It took a little getting used to I loved my but I also loved my Nexus 7 and that's gone. Yeah, I mean, this is Google. Yeah  Yeah  It's a shame. So I put up a post from you know to read crim I do not I mean I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do not I mean I know mention him before

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he put up a post on on Facebook just asking and I don't think coming off the the pixel  Is is necessarily the basis for that for this kind of worry, but he but he adds it up and just starts to ask whether  Google is the new  Microsoft they've got these chat apps that nobody's using they you know, they come out with hardware that they stopped  It's confusing maybe a little overblown but but you know one always has to wonder what always has to ask  I  Really like and really use what Google does but when they desert you I  Don't want to sound like you know the guy who complained for 20 years about Google getting rid of an RSS reader  I have been kind of intrigued about that though. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, I mean I use Feedly so I still have an RSS reader but  I did tweet that what we really should do for you Jeff is just get you  Get a premium laptop  Just pick one that you just love all the features and we'll put a nice Linux on it and  And you'd probably be happy if you stuck to Chrome, it would be no different than a Chromebook. You'd probably be very happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's things that I can now do like download Amazon movies and download Google Play and we can't do that stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know actually that's an interesting debate because  The w3c  Has kind of certified Google and Firefox and Microsoft's decision to put copy protection into their browsers  This is a requirement of Amazon and Netflix  And and I just read somebody I can't remember who it was kind of castigating  Tim Berners-Lee at the w3c first for kind of  surrendering to DRM  Like he said, you know, you should you know, you don't have to agree  Tim Berners-Lee  According to Mike Masnick love Mike in in tech dirt offers depressingly weak defense of his decision  So DRM is now in the HTML 5 or at least I mean with Tim Berners-Lee's endorsement will be in the HTML 5  standard in the form of encrypted media extensions Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of Mike Masnick his legal fund is active. Oh good because he's been sued

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the guy who did or didn't invent email depending on  Good so Mike has is it on tech dirt calm I bet it is I'm sure it is I I donated it was a couple

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Couple days ago that I donated but yeah, it's I think it's through a different organization

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe I don't see any link on the front page here. Oh, what if I donate it as somebody's non-existent legal fund  Well, they'll be very they'll be very happy to get the money I'm sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the tech dirt survival phone fund

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boy, you'd think tech dirt would link to it wouldn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You would it's at I support journalism comm right on URL like that. How could you not you had to give?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You had to give  exactly  Alright, so there's that actually we probably do have quite a few more things to talk about there  Is because I support journalism

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We probably there's also pixel assistant on my phone finally coming soon. I think I hope

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  We're cool assistant. Which phone do you use? I have the 5x

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so Google has said yeah, we're gonna we're gonna make the assistant more available. Do you use alo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't use alo

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cuz I has the assistant. Yeah. I mean I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello  Who else is in alo right I once couldn't find Kevin Toffle  So I pinged him on you know messages Facebook Twitter and alo

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would use alo, but Google didn't do the one thing. I can't this baffles me  I can use Facebook messenger as an SMS app on my pixel on any Android phone. I can use  Signal but I can't use Google's own out. I can use hangouts  Can't use alo if that would make it the de facto choice, right?  No, now there's now they're making Android messenger  Which is confusing because Samsung's messengers got the same name  But the the Google flavor of messenger is now gonna be called Android messages and maybe maybe that means  You know they when you get the pixel they encourage you you use messages now Android messenger as your SMS app  But you can still use hangouts and hangouts is better for me because hangouts is on as my Google voice number  It's on everything I can use the desktop to send messages and receive messages  Now there's meat. I'm just God diggity darn it  What's me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who is in charge over there business? I know that's what Tariq was saying. This is looking a little wacky

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So me an enterprise friendly version of hangouts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they're just aren't enough does that mean it's I mean hangouts  Was always enterprise, right? I mean I used it at every single company

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've ever is is is intended just to do the video conferencing stuff, right? So it's like telepresence  No, no, but I guess it's stripping. I think the plan is and I feel like this has been  Mentioned before to get video conferencing out of hangouts and put it in something else

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you guys feel about video just in general like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For casual work conversation. Yeah, do you the only time I ever use is with my mom and other family members  That you know long-distance family members. So it's like being with a family  I would never like if I called you I wouldn't do a video call. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  get lots of I  Get lots of requests now for video  Interviews with people and I'm kind of like, oh, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Say see they want to see you on your pink beanbag chair, that's why

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is a there is a pink amorphous pink blob in the corner now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Monogrammed amorphous pink blob

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She comes in from that she keeps you company. That's cute

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, she comes in and draws and reads and talks to me and tells me I'm not a real writer. So what?  She she's a she's a real writer. She writes fiction and she's pushing me to write fiction nonfiction writers are not real writers

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's very cute. That's really sweet. That's actually kind of a sophisticated concept

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She is a sophisticated. It's very sophisticated

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is that why you're wearing morning Jeff because the pixel is is dead

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that's why you're wearing blacks. I have truth is I always wear black but  Co-opting it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know when you with your hood on you did look like a little like death  incarnate coming with a  cheekbones and like I was like, oh dear lord that is frightening. I'm so glad Stacy's pick on you now instead of me

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Death is laughing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Looks like Tariq pulled that down or because I went to the link and it's it says this is no longer on Facebook  Oh, sorry, Drake, or maybe it's a private. Maybe it's a private. Maybe it's prop private. Oh, maybe that I'm doubly. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a good argument

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do we want to talk about the cloud failing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would we talk about yesterday the cloud failed us all Amazon's s3 it was just the s3 east

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it was always it's always the s3 east  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is that is the most common one that goes down  It's one of their older data centers and it's also the default if you spin up a s3 instance, it's gonna be there  So if you're not paying attention  when you build your cloud program or when you start  Hosting stuff on s3 you're gonna end up there and the fact that it's a weak place means it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We we we are we use Amazon's cloud front as a load balancer for our website  our website did not seem to be impacted by it and maybe that's because we're on West or  Because and I think you can't set this up, you know, there's a failover. So if yes, yeah, so  So these are but a lot of sites a lot of slack was gone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this kind of drove me nuts because slack like I  Used to write about the cloud and spent a lot of time talking to people about how they  architect things and it is possible to  Have your site go to or have Amazon go down or one availability zone go down and not be affected  You should have a failover  So failovers now that is more expensive and it does require a level of sophistication  that  Might not be available to you  I don't know  I feel like it's almost inexcusable for like a site like Trello or slack to go down because people pay for it  It's an enterprise service medium was down apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was media just journalist. I don't know what they don't know. Who cares?  Just that Jarvis fella  They came back by 3 p.m. Pacific  so  They were pretty much fully normal by 310 Pacific so it was an outage of maybe I  Don't know five hours six hours. That's a pretty long. That's that's a long time  The error rates began at 840 a.m. This is from Amazon's report  Am error rates in all s3 centers began to quickly climb our alarms went off by 850 a.m  Pacific error rates were significantly elevated very few requests were completing  By 855 a.m. We had multiple engineers engaged in investigating the issue our alive our alarms pointed at problems  Processing customer requests in multiple places within the system across multiple data centers. So maybe it was more than  Just the Easter maybe the east failure  created system load elsewhere at 941 a.m.  We determined the servers within s3. We're having problems communicating with each other  As three I didn't know this but they use a gossip protocol  Spreads server state information throughout the system. That's that's how they're supposed to root around failed or unreachable servers  But the gossip failed  The gossip failed on Sunday. We had seen a large number of servers that were spending almost all their time gossiping and it  I'm not making this up and a disproportionate amount of servers that failed while gossiping  so maybe  Maybe they maybe there was a gossiping issues  So in fact, they think it was related because at 1032 after exploring several options

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We wait wait wait wait stop your chat room is smarter than all of us  This is 2008. Yes, am I looking at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  cheese Louise I never make mistakes you  Had one job

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As Leo goes so goes the world apparently this happened in 2008

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It did I  Think people used to say they called that swear to God the article I was reading from was dated by

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tyler Durden February 20th 2017  But for some reason tied up Tyler decided to quote an old Amazon event report. This is from several years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was when Skynet failed. That was what they called it the Skynet failures. I remember that failure

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, do you think this though? What is it? What is it? What does this mean? I?  Mean does it you shouldn't trust the net oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have so many opinions on this because again. I that's what people pay me for or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should never read articles by Tyler Durden probably that's the first  Wasn't he the guy in first rule of journalism? Yeah  First rule of journalism is don't read Tyler Durden bylines

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's no Tyler here

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, so tell me what happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't know what I was having fun reading about gossip. Yeah, I don't I didn't realize they had an error report out yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, you know, I think they don't I think that we don't have the analysis yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I yeah without knowing what happened yet, and if someone finds it, let me know but  S3 is a bedrock sure service for Amazon. They're storage service  It is their basic storage service. They have all kinds of crazy fun stuff there  So where was I going with this Oh, but  Netflix didn't go down some of the sites that did go down  I worry that they are not architecting  it's hard to say don't architect to Netflix as standards because Netflix is like the company that gave us chaos monkeys and  this concept of designing for resiliency, but  And again since we don't exactly know what happened yet. It's hard to say but I think  Better planning is probably good and I mean even AWS they their  Dashboards were down for a little bit because they hosted it on s3  so  hosting  Hosting your note of your dashboard notifications on a site that might go down as kind of an example of this  So, I don't know it also took down the Internet of Things oh  Oh did it  Suffered too. Oh, yeah, I took down if this then that so a bunch of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, and that's the backbone for IOT in many cases

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For some people but there's always you can always go to the base service  But it also took down ring the doorbell company for they had problems Canary the security company  Piper and I want to say something else

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lots of probably lots of things run keeper was down

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Imager was down  Dockers registry hub was down which meant that probably you couldn't register a docker  Doesn't mean docker was down, but there but but that's a big deal  That to this at least the  Now searching for any explanation for Amazon all I've seen  Here is that it wasn't an outage but an increase but a case of increased errors  That happens cuz I mean see Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's right  What there's more errors in the world falling apart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all because of the you Millennials

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not a millennial. I'm a hardcore Gen X er all right millennial tendencies. I can't blame you then no  Yeah, so  All right. Well, well next week. We'll tell you what happened  All right, well well next week we'll tell you what happened  2009 next week I'm twig with 2009 somebody tweeted according to our chat room somebody tweeted  They couldn't turn off their smart lights

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they couldn't turn them off using if you send that right could still turn them go to the switch and turn them  And I will say to you here we go wink has local  Local access in your hub so the wink hub I can still control my devices smart things is actually hosted in AWS and my smart  Things stuff actually work just fine if you have in Stee on gear that was gonna be fine because there's local hubs in control there  So, you know maybe relying on if this and that or your core stuff may not be the best idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I say I I went to a site. I can't remember the name of it  Like is it that wasn't is it down for me? Yes, is it down or is it down for me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which just shows you you can't rely on  That's isn't that funny. So yeah, I mean look at these happen all the time, right the way the the internet is  It's not fragile, but it's all interconnected and it's not the I mean you get power outages to in the grid  I mean things happen and  once

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Had to walk downstairs and open my garage door manually because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I almost didn't know how to do it. Neo said he couldn't close his IOT garage door  There is a string on all garage doors that they work even if the power is out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Soylent green  Fortress yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the last thing on the Twitter  Amazon's web services Twitter feed is for s3  We believe we understand root cause and are working hard at repairing future updates across all services will be on dashboards  That though is from yesterday and is so they radio silence from AWS at this point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They still I mean it takes a bit to  I'm sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do not I do not want to be one of those engineers with his hair on fire  Hey, I have to apologize because I did not disclaim Amazon web services is a sponsor of our podcasts  All right, we forgot that yes, I should have said that I don't know how that  Affects anything but I should say it because  Then you'll know I guess and you can I believe in doing that I agree. It's an important thing to say so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't you know? Oh, you know what? I mentioned ring too. I don't know if that matters as going down

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a problem is bring is also it's right at some point. We're just gonna be the whole thing is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are so popular you are so rich and successful  Trump of podcasts  You see by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The greatest sponsor Oprah Winfrey is thinking about throwing her hat into the ring for 2020  So is Bob Iger Bob Iger  CEO of Disney ellipse. Yes, she's and and I guess what both have  Deduced from the past election is you don't have to have  political experience to run and win

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Knowledge or expertise sir, I would vote for Oprah she's cool. Oh, she would drive me nuts  Well, the speeches be a little oh she'd tell us all to go to sleep. Oh, that's ariana  She'd tell us to keep lists of the things we've accomplished today

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's run a successful business and she's probably overcome quite a bit and she's brilliant

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And sadly yes true to all of that she also drives me nuts and you'd get a car and you'd get a car and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody look under their ballot boxes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mobile World Congress you want to talk about that? Let's take a break and we'll come back  We'll talk cuz like I'm sure they talked a lot about it on all about Android yesterday because there's a lot of Android device  News, in fact, it's mostly Android device news. We can talk about that a little bit our show today brought to you by blue apron  Let's see this week. I'm blue apron. I made a lovely udon noodle soup. That was so good  Discovered a new ingredient called verjuve erj us. It was amazing  Used blood orange juice in the couscous. That was incredible. I did a lovely tempura cod and  Then a day before yesterday. I ran out because we did all three. I'm waiting for our next box. I did a chicken breasts  couscous and  sauteed broccoli and I discovered a new way of doing capers of  Kind of sauteing them till they're crispy it was what and then using that as a topic see blue aprons great because I like to cook  I really do any  One of the nice things about cooking especially with your family or cooking for a loved one is it's it's kind of this wonderful  Sensation that you're making you're doing something really wonderful for them  The house fills with beautiful aromas and they come home and you go. Yeah, and they sit down  Here's your dinner, and it's just wonderful  I also like the creativity involved but one thing is hard to come up with new recipes new ideas a lot of times  I'll make the same thing over and over again  Sometimes I'm just I don't have too tired to shop and I'll we'll eat out and we've really been trying to cut back on eating  Yeah  Eating out is bad not just for your pocketbook  But there's lots of calories in this delicious food that they make for you  And I just prefer to make something healthy and fresh from blue apron now  Here's how it works blue apron will deliver to your door  A refrigerated box nothing's frozen even the meat the fish there are but they're all nice and chilled  You pick the menu so you go to the blue apron website and before the box comes you pick what items what menu items you want?  In your box they give you exactly what you need to make those meals no more no less  So there's no waste. I had one blood orange even the verju  I only needed like a quarter cup of it so it came in a little tiny verju bottle was so cute  The meals cost less than ten dollars per person you can prepare them in about 40 minutes you get a completely easy to follow recipe card  And everything's pre-portioned so it's almost as if you have a sous chef putting everything together for you, and it's really fun  It's a great feeling and now you know how to make it you can make it again  And by the way they cost less than the grocery store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I will say this we talked about it on the podcast tomorrow, but Kevin had a problem with his oven what happened  One of the heating elements just didn't work so they sent it back and  They apparently support was great, but I was like, oh Kevin. I'm so sorry. He's like Barb

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's his wife didn't even mind these things happen, you know, they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and I will you know, I mean I saved the boxes so I could send it back if I had to but heck

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, do you have a warehouse with boxes of the stuff that you mostly I don't say boxes this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But usually like if it's a computer I save it for a week or two  I don't save it who wants to have I used to and I gave it's like too many boxes  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your husband does he stop did he stop? He had to stop because we started buying because I started buying so many things  That's why I stopped. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it only works if you don't buy a lot of things  Exactly, but when you're but when you're in our business, you got to try everything, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I say I only try like half the things because everything would be crazy. Oh, you couldn't try everything. No, what is bears you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know green juice. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's wine colored. It might be made out of wine, but it's they say it's a great  It's a highly acidic as acidic juice made by pressing unique  I'm sorry unripe grapes crab apples or other sour fruit. It's used instead of lemon juice, but it has this wonderful flavor  Apparently it's a middle it's from the Middle Ages  It was widely used as a condiment or an ingredient sauces in the Middle Ages  We used it to deglaze after I after I sauteed the chicken. I deglazed it with very shoe  Okay, and it was really good and Lisa doesn't like vinegar. So I I  Thought this was a good alternative to vinegar because it has kind of a you know  It's kind of vinegary but without being vinegar she you like the version right?  Do you remember that no you didn't like it? Did you okay?  Never mind. She doesn't like she doesn't like tangy stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't know why I like tangy stuff  So there you go, how about that, huh?  indeed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. So see oh the water world Congress. Yeah mobile World Congress. So lots of phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lots of phones nothing from Google  But there's the LG G6, which looks very nice  It's a weird dimension it's actually two by one  And they said they wanted to do that because they wanted a 5.7 inch screen  But they wanted you to be able to operate it with one hand. So it's tall and I don't know I might like that  Yeah, I mean, I think that look there's these phones are all the same now, right? It's just yeah  How many rounded glass slabs, you know, so you need something to differentiate so that is something people complain about is the big phones are hard to  operate with one hand so  Maybe this you know what I want. I want a phone. So when I pick it up, I immediately know what top is. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with you on that. They're all every phone. You've got to turn them around  It's like it's like the USB problem, right?  So either there is no top which is one possibility or there's some kind of bumpy  Thing or something so I just know what the top is speaking a USB this wasn't at Mobile World Congress, but Wall Street Journal

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Published a rumor, but since it's Wall Street Journal, I think it's very credible  That Apple is going to abandon the lightning port on its new phone and go type C  Thank you  I  Mean it's a it's gonna be very upsetting to people like me who bought a lot of lightning port accessories  God just pick one standard people. I don't need that many accessories

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the story goes apparently that the when Apple adopted lightning in 2010

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were they're part of the USBC coalition and they in fact were an early adopter on their MacBooks  But that wasn't ready in 2010 and they wanted to get rid of the 30-pin. It was taking up too much room  So they should they opted for lightning  But but now this is gonna be a pain in the ass  But but now this is gonna be a painful switch people are gonna be very upset because I mean I've spent hundreds of dollars on  Lightning cables lightning docks. Oh, I still go I bet you guys do too  You go to hotels and they still the clock radio still has a 30-pin  Dock, right? Like they even bothered update six years ago. So they'll be in good shape. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Noticed and this is this is like the tiniest portion of my life, but I bought a suitcase a radon  I think is what a Raiden  Connected suitcase with like a charging port and stuff in it  And an app because it was a smart suitcase. I loved it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your suitcase has an app

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I sent it back and the reason I did is because it used old-school USB  Micro USB and I've got my phone charges on USB  C  See I didn't want to see it  Yeah, but I didn't want to buy a dongle like a little thing to hang off my suitcase because that just felt stupid  So but then I was thinking about all these devices out there that are kind of like supposed to be future-proofed and now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is the app do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, okay. So this suitcase is very pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's white or I guess they have different colors, but I bought it in navy blue, okay, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just just in case you were wondering it I bought it because I wanted something that charged my phone  The battery is built into the suitcase. You can remove it if you want. Our sponsors away. They made the same kind of thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but they didn't have an app

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the app is so you can use you it's got a scale in it  So you see the weight on the app and then it also and this this was not a functionality

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With the suitcase is just sitting there  Pick it up. Oh, you pick it up. Yeah, it gives you the weight. You can't get up  like the handle has a scale in it I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Guess I don't know where the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then this phone says 32 pounds. Yes  Must have a scale in the handle

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that and then it also like a tracker or tile  It also wanted they wanted to create a network of these  Raid in suitcases, but it didn't use one of those networks that used its own network

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is kind of a problem because I mean how many suitcases have they sold right? Yeah  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's what it was. I took it back because you were just reviewing it. No, I returned it  I actually my husband bought it for me for Christmas because I wanted a suitcase and he knows me and was like a smart suitcase for my honey

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is really sweet  Isn't it and then just like my wife you returned it  Well, yes, but for good reason. Do you know how that?  Guts us, right Jeff you buy it. It's not I buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't I can't remember the last time I was able to successfully

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why guys don't buy gifts anymore. Okay, he returns half the stuff. I buy. Okay, okay. I  once bought him a bottle of  Like really fancy scotch because he's so hard to buy gifts for yeah, and he he kind of mocked me for a while  he's like, okay, I mean not in a mean way just like I  Didn't really need this Stacy and then I felt bad about spending a lot of money on a nice bottle scotch for him

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In my family, I will confess as I grew up we were all before opening a gift. The giver would always say it's returnable

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's returnable. This is the way we came to call these living gift certificates  It's I mean I what would Tony Robbins say  Wait, stop saying it's returnable have some confidence. You're gonna love this  Then they don't and then they don't because they never do and they feel very awkward and I wouldn't like that  You know what we at least and I've worked it out she just puts what she wants in her in the shopping cart and sends me  a link

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what my husband's family does they don't buy any  To me, it's like a registry for your like presence. I'm kind of like yeah, what's wrong with that? It's a registry

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look, but I mean part of she says it's okay shopping cart and Etsy and you'll find some surprises

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you should always have at least one good surprise  So, you know, and if it doesn't if it doesn't succeed, that's okay. I know I know but it's hard because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As men we're already, you know self-conscious about our gifts giving. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I've given up clothes impossible. Can't get long since no long since

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Big or too small, I mean it's the you thought I was thinking what were you thinking? I  You know, I look I look like a circus performer in this dress  You cannot win  I'm just I'm just saying  Next time I'm gonna buy you a water bear aquarium  This is the weirdest thing I've ever seen so water bears are taught a great tardigrades, right?  They're awesome. That's kind of is that is this brine shrimp? Is it the same or no, they are different

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're like their algae chomping microorganisms  And they'd live forever you find water bears that are millions of years old

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There might be pictures look up the pictures of the other close-up of water bears because they're so cool. Yeah  Also look up them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's more

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google just Google tardigrade. Yeah and images and  So they're really cool, but you don't see that. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz this is like a micro like electron microscope, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See I could buy that that's on that's that's an Etsy I could buy that no, all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so I'm gonna tell you right now don't buy tardigrades for your wife. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So and so what so Google's doing an app that's like a tamagotchi

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's doing a phone ad on that has live they're actually live  Yes, because they wanted to do something it was just so different. Nobody would have thought of it  Well, maybe because then we did it. Maybe that's the reason you should not do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this project era this is an era module. Yes, it's the follow-on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it it felt like the the onion to me? It doesn't seem real

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's an early  mock-up of the tardigrade  Module that would snap onto your phone. I mean they are microscopic so they don't take up a lot of room

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they trying to show off their camera lenses or I?  Mean it's cool that you could see a really small creature

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Through your oh, I don't know so. Oh, okay. I get it. So you do see them close up  Oh, I see I think that the thanks to science  science  Okay, so it has like a built-in microscope

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's cool. I think there's a PETA fight coming

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Over tardigrades really know these things live torture a tardigrade

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that is nice because they because you so you're saying if I got one of my phone it would last longer than the phone  Right possibly what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fish they die. What is their actual lifespan is?  I just know that you can freeze them you can do crazy things to them and you thaw them out hunt like they've thawed out  Chunks of like ice that have had tardigrades living in them or not living but like frozen in them and they revive them from  They're like hundreds of thousands of years. Yeah, like Brian shrimp from

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they're not Brian shrimp. I got it from venture be before Google cancelled our in August 2016 an avalanche of module  Proposals had poured in from outside developers over a thousand of those there were at least a hundred credible submissions that Google was going to pursue  Including the water  Bear aquarium when Google shut the tardigrade program down quote  We were literally like a week away from connecting the optic stack to the app. It was like all working  It was one of the few things you couldn't possibly ship a phone with there was no way Apple was going to produce a phone that did that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would have worked it's April fools, right they just they just  Early March fools. I think this is actually pretty cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Technology is neat. I mean because imagine having a super powerful microscope

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if that's what I know that this is an aquarium concept  But if you had you could turn a phone into a super powerful microscope think about like disease  Identification in like third world countries. That's that could be super cool. I mean really these phones are so powerful

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the ability to add stuff that would be the real promise of project aura. I just it wasn't going to be a consumer product  That's the real that's the real problem. I put up how to care for tardigrades

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The bottom of the Google section. Oh finally suck out juices for moss algae and and  They eat nematodes  Oh good. I have a real nematode probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh look at their x-ray radiation  These are the cockroaches of the microbiology world levels of x-ray radiation one thousand times the lethal human dose

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could sustain sustain. They could sustain it. They don't they they can't be they can survive boiling alcohol  Vacuum is alcohol boilout space  This is the module basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How to kill how do you how can you kill a tardigrade

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  173 degrees. Oh, well, it's less than water, but it's still pretty hot Waymo suing uber

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For lasers. Did we do this last week?  No, we did that they hired

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's close. We did that they hired an executive. So I think that they went after the executive  Anthony Levandowski

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently took with him when he left  Uber  14,000 confidential proprietary design files  I'm sorry. We left Google and went to uber  Including design. This is the key designs of Waymo's lidar  and then shortly after  I mean the  Waymo had announced that they had a way to cut the cost of cut the cost of lidar but like  Ten times right?  I thought we did do this last week. Didn't we do this last week? No, we did. It's all blurring together

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry  We should just not talk about cars anymore. Tens of thousands of Chromebooks have failed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because of Symantec blue coat  Blue coat

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If that's the  Firewall you're going through. Oh, this is Maryland's Montgomery school district. It's not a Chromebook problem. It's a Symantec Chromebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In Maryland the school system uses a hundred twenty thousand Chromebooks and multiple PCs all running Chrome when they updated a Chrome OS 56  Thirty percent couldn't log on and when the PCs upgraded to Chrome 56, they couldn't reach the web either  It was a  Man in the middle SSL web proxy that the schools uses the Symantec blue coat  It examines SSL and transport layer encrypted web content. In other words, it's a man in the middle it so far so good  If you want to make sure your seventh graders aren't peeking into foot pornography  But it doesn't work with TLS one point three, which is of course  What the new Chrome uses  TLS 1.3 is actually a big improvement to 1.2. We talked about on security now on Tuesday  And it is also faster and it's more secure, but it's apparently not compatible with blue coat  So don't use blue coat I guess or get an updated version famous patent troll  That's suing Google  Eolis remember them the case has been booted out of East Texas

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thanks, East Texas  For once

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eolis well, God they lost a bunch of big cases  they were suing Microsoft I think and  They lost the Texas jury struck down their claim to own the interactive web. They were suing Google Amazon and Yahoo  They're saying hey we invented interactivity  by the way, Eolis  Had a partner in that suit the University of California

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm. Hmm. You know what? I always thought tech companies with their infinite millions and distributed workforce should do  They should actually put an engineering operation in Tyler because then  You could start stacking the jury in your favor

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is good news for this is good news for this for Google the  Trial was transferred to the northern district of California  This is Tyler. That's good as Tyler  The company was formed out of a patent filed by Michael Doyle who was head of IT at University of California, San Francisco in the late 90s  He claims he created the first program that allowed users to interact with images inside a web browser  That patent means, you know, I own the web they sued Microsoft in 1999 they won  What is believed to be more than a hundred million dollars you see made 30 million out of that a  subsequent case  Resulted in dozens of settlements from Google from a bunch of companies, but Google Yahoo and JC petty remember fought this  Four years ago, they won  However, it continues on  You

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Guys want to explain something to me. Yeah, I know I don't use the mansplaining don't don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then trap me this is I would love for someone to explain what's happening with RCS messaging  Google versus SMS because I've been reading that I just basically didn't want to research it  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is it's an improved  Form of MMS that Google rich communication services and it could do a lot more  It will allow for higher quality picture messaging up to 10 megabytes group chats location sharing video calls  but  Carriers have to support it and guess what?  I  Was apples got a you know messages and  So this and they're not gonna do it. So this is really probably a DOA technology, even though Google is not giving up on it  I think they got sprint to partner with them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like the regular web or do they use the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dedicated cellular channels. Oh, they must. Yeah, they must at this point  I mean, I'm sure that one thing they go to carriers and say you could finally kill that SMS thing your SMS servers  Yeah, do data do data servers  Okay in the US sprint and T-mobile will support the unified universal profile standard  Verizon has not rolled out service. Yes, but yet but is listed as an official operator  AT&T is already using RCS, but doesn't appear to be supporting universal profile. I guess universal profile is the authentication  It's not necessary to support it, but it will help with compatibility  So  Yeah, this is a mess messaging is a mess

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm with you. It is a mess. So here's a question for you since I'm only Android and not I'm not an apple worried about what color  people are  How can I SMS from my laptop using Chrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  only on a hand or  Hangouts is it yeah  Or but that will work if you thought about what about you have to work this is yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could so this is Facebook is my SMS if I go ahead and say yes to that request

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to use you have to take your phone and make one of those things be your  SMS messenger and then if you do that you can use the desktop version of Facebook messenger or  Signal or any of the SMS compatible programs or hangouts  I always go back to hangouts though because it doesn't seem  to  well  What I can I can send and receive texts from my phone using Facebook Messenger?  But it doesn't seem to propagate to message on the desktop properly  So I'm not getting all the messages in my that my the SMS messages  My desktop it does work with hangouts  Hangouts to and I'm sure Google will break this any minute now  But for for now hangout seems to be the best way to send and receive text messages that  In which you are perfectly synced with the text message threads on your phone

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So RCS  So Google bought a company called jibe I  Remember and they've created a universal Android client based on the universal profile for advanced messaging  Google is also offering a carrier hosted service  This is cut I'm quoting this from Android Authority by the way  Google is also offering a carrier hosted service for operators to launch and manage advanced messaging services, so they don't have to do their own  infrastructure  But I my sense is you know this has been going on for a while that the carriers aren't all that excited about  Doing this  Carriers hate anything that you know they want don't troll entirely remember SMS in many cases is still a great revenue stream for them  Right they really overcharge most people by now must have unlimited SMS, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was gonna say most people are probably there are probably holdouts on plans that don't have unlimited SMS and those are  Ridiculously high rates if you count the amount of data  But at a certain point you've got to support the service itself and they have additional equipment  I mean, it's it's a complicated thing if you're trying to make your back-end telco infrastructure look like a cloud like one monolithic  Service where you just split up little chunks for messaging versus having dedicated hardware for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now this article is from back in November, so there may have been some progress made  Since then but T-Mobile and AT&T offer some advanced messaging and features through their stock messaging apps  But this is pre the universal profile  Google has RCS support and messenger 2.0, but it only works on the pixel XL and Nexus 6p  Sprint is working with Google to bring the messaging app to select LG and Nexus handsets you can see this is older I  Think this is I think this is one of those things  They say second quarter 2017 in this article is  When we'll see the first devices, so that's the question to ask is the devices that are being announced now at Mobile World Congress are those  universal profile compatible I  You know what? This is I feel like this I didn't I I haven't paid a lot of attention this I've read up on it  But I haven't paid a lot of attention to it because I feel like it's a waste of time  It's gonna be this phone the carriers don't want to do this kind of stuff. I  Think  Samsung apparently is gonna start doing it  Here's a  blog post  Undated oh no February 24th from Amir Sarhangi who's the head of RCS at Google and  You know selling RCS RCS messaging is  Available to users across the world with 27 care carriers and device manufacturers  launching RCS to Android users with Google  Sprint in the US Rogers in Canada  telonor in Norway orange Deutsche Telecom and globe are  planning to support the jar by CS cloud Jive RCS cloud from Google and  We'll be preloading Android messages, so I guess that's why the rename for Android messages. That's the RCS  version of messages  But they're also gonna include their standard native messaging app I  Would I I'm a big fan I liked XMPP I'm a big fan of this, but I was burned with XMPP  I really thought that was gonna be a standard and Google abandoned it that was Google Talk and they abandoned it  So I just I hope that they will stick with this and they can and they can get everybody behind it and the carriels will  Support it because it would be a much better experience. It's the kind of thing you need to really  You know we're so far behind China with WeChat  You know and the the things you can do in WeChat and this is these are the kind these are the kinds of technologies  Would be enabled and instead of having a separate third-party app to do it you'd be doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  messaging app right so stay on that for a minute in an age of assistant and  embedding functionality into chats  That's what Google is really building  That has a lot of appeal  You'd think that the carriers don't want that they want to just do that proprietary they think they're gonna invent WeChat

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's I think that I I think that they I?  May be wrong, but I think that they still are kind of wanting to make to squeeze the last penny out of SMS messaging

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just yet  They want to control the services running over their network because they feel that because they have the network  they should be providing the services on top of them and  This goes back to their dumb pipe fears  and if they  Can control these things they can get a cut of the revenue they can do all sorts of fabulous things

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They just they don't want to be irrelevant who can well they should go for this in fact one of the things  He's talking about in this blog post is how businesses could use this to give much more rich interactive  Information to customers that message them. It's kind of what alo. I feel like alo is  Was kind of moving there, but and and really maybe when RCS becomes universal with carriers  Then we'll get that kind of experience in every you know phone for instance. Here's some images. This is Walgreens  You could start a conversation with Walgreens. They'd you could say give them a zip code  They give you a map a list  They could they say your product is in stock and it's available at this store, and you could and you could navigate there  Here's a a boarding pass  for a train  So this kind of interactivity which alo kind of started right could come could come from businesses as well  I mean, I think this is very there's a lot of reasons to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think there's some mistrust of Google though people don't yeah, I mean I do I feel like I'm the ghost of Gina is  Looking back and say remember way right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you want to put my ghost of Gina costume on we're trying we may not need the ghost next week

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm gonna be out of the office on Wednesday and  I we're trying to Jason Howell's gonna host the show. We're trying to get Gina on too, which would be cool  Yeah, so be great may not you may have less than a ghostly Gina  Now putting the pressure on because we really we'd love to see her and of course you too, too  So I you know so that's a good question  What's going on with RCS and it it seems like what it is is that you've got to get all these  disparate groups to agree to support this platform and  Google's the one kind of pushing it along  And Android messages will be the app  For aloe no for RCS. Yes, and that's that may explain Google's ambivalence about messaging  because they hope eventually to get everybody use Android messages with  RCS built in and so they don't want to put too much stock in aloe and hangouts and meat and all these other apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Lord forbid you put all of your eggs in one basket as a company that's making products  All right, well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the fact that it is a big deal  That at least elsewhere in the world they're getting some support the fact that orange and Deutsche Telecom  Have agreed is very very big news  They at Mobile World Congress announced 27 new carriers and device global  Wow, okay. See I feel good that I paid attention to this for a little bit. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this has been going on since 2008 yeah, okay  Okay, well this was exactly the amount of time I wanted to put into this so yay  And this to answer your question unlike mobile messaging apps database apps. This works over cellular networks

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Irrespective of a user's client operator device, so it does not require internet access on a phone  You could use it on a Nokia 3310 if you want to use it on a phone  Okay, yeah that is exactly enough in other words you're saying no more right no I'm well, okay  Yes. Yes. That was my subtle no more enough RCS

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good do we want to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we want to take a break is what we want to do and then we will talk about Google at Mobile World Congress

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Yeah  Chartbeat meh, maybe using optimise Lee or mixed panel. You have lots of different tools  You know how your websites your mobile apps your cloud platforms are doing who's using them what they're doing with them that kind of thing  The problem is each of those let's take a web page  each of those is integrated into the web cage with a little clip snippet of code and  More and more and more and it's a mess  Your engineering team is spending a lot of time with integrations and figuring out how to work  segment is the plumbing that makes this all much  Easier a platform that lets you write one line of integration code a  single API and it unifies all your data all your analytics on any platform for  Marketo to Mailchimp  It's used by some of the world's best companies Atlassian uses it into it new relic Reuters  Of course, it supports all the integrations you want to do hundreds of integrations all the most popular apps for advertising  analytics a B testing attribution  that's just the A's and  What's nice is you get the segment dashboard and that's where your developer your team can add a new tool can kind of  Sketch out the plumbing what goes where?  It's it's it's the easiest way to do this you can integrate a new analytics tool for the data driven account manager one for the  App happy marketer another for the data scientist who needs a unified data warehouse and segment brings it all together  From any source you can import historical data  You can customize what ends up in your data warehouse of choice  And you know if something happens like yesterday with s3 and one of your analytics tools stops responding. No problem  Segment will collect the day continue to collect the data the plumbing still works and when yours tool comes back online  They send it all down. You don't miss a bit  It's the customer data platform the both developers and analysts love because of its elegant API its extensive partner  Ecosystem if you're out there struggling with integrating all these different tools  You're gonna love segment and your CEO will love your quickly deployed integrations with Zendesk and intercom and app nexus and on and on and on  8,000 of the world's best companies use segment to drive growth and revenue to simplify and save money in the long run on a lot  engineering hours  Twit listeners can try the segment team plan free right now for three months  segment comm  slash twit segment  comm slash  twit  What were you there was something you wanted to say Stacy  No, I wanted to bring up  No, no Google at Mobile World Congress  Congress

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you see it on facebook all the time all the time. What is that?  Because if you share it it doesn't have the same  Uh, I don't know it doesn't then it says  Jeff Jarvis shared this as opposed to being a post from Jeff Jarvis, but what and and and and so what does that accomplish?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A picture in this post so for some I don't know how this got to be a meme  I didn't put a picture in this post, but I want to see if anybody reads posts without pictures  So put a one word how we met what that keeps cropping up year after year

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know and I don't know why what what is what is who who gets what out of that idiocy and you didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Um it i'm reading through it. It sounds like  Well, it's a long answer. Um  But this is  This is hacker related though  So it's copy. Well, it's so this is I I can't see if  Why copy and paste a post warning instead of sharing it are yours warnings or they just any post

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  when somebody says something like  you know, uh  You know, here's here's 20 things trump did in december that made me nuts  They say don't share this cut it copy it and paste it into a new post  From you and it has to do with the number of posts. I'm sure it's about seo

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, here's a buzzfeed article on it  My community it's political but more than just an opinion but the let copy and paste a share, uh, la la la la

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you know what else is falling apart the lead a good lead you'd find out there we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here we go. The theory is the theory says that there that this will be a new text status rather than a shared existing one

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it will be shown more prominently. It'll go in your and it'll go in your feed  People are tricking facebook by copying and pasting and not sharing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People are revolting against the medium to get their message from figure out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they're they're fighting the tyranny of the feed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think people the most people who do this don't know why they're saying it. They're just they're just saying it right? Okay  They're hacking the algorithm. Yeah, they don't hey, you know what? We buried the lead youtube has finally launched youtube tv  And I didn't even mention it  Yeah, oh is that the 35 a month one 35 dollars a month you get abc cbs fox and nbc  35 cable channels. It's an over-the-top  Uh service you get six accounts. So with 35 bucks a month  Everybody in the family can have an account. You can only watch three concurrent streams at a time though

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is you know, there are some things missing like all the channels from via com which include mtv and comedy  Central nothing from turner. So no cnn  uh  Showtime is an add-on  additional cost not hbo  And then you get youtube red originals for free not that anybody would pay for those  um, so they haven't announced the date but it will roll out in the next few months and it will be market by market, right because  uh, if they're gonna put abc cbs nbc and fox  They have to do a deal with a local affiliate. Maybe you get the local affiliate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Smaller cities, you get the you get the crummy espn channels. Oh, but do you get real disney?  That could be in usa and is it bravo that everyone's excited about where all the real housewives. They're in bravo

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bravo is the real housewives. Yeah  NFL content on tv and pc but not mobile and that's because verizon as you know has exclusive on that  It integrates with chromecast  And google home  So you can say to your home. Hey, goo goo  Watch the desperate housewives. That's the real desperate housewives of new jersey and the southern atlantic coast

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, but wait, this is this isn't on demand though. This is just like when stuff is on streaming

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, oh it is streaming. I think  Oh, wait a minute  No, there's dvr style recording of your favorite shows with unlimited space

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In google's cloud and you have to go through that why go through that effort? Why not just look up the show and ad skip

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, oh i'm sure it has to do with licensing, right?  Oh, stupidity  Uh, you can this is challenging  This is so complicated for consumers. I but it's complicated for the companies that want to offer because all these different stakeholders  You say well, you can't do that without doing this  And nobody wants to piss off comcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, i've pissed off comcast. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, so by the way this goes so here it is if you go to it it's uh tv.youtube.com  And um  Yeah, you know what for cord cutters this might be huge  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  no  Someone's pointing out it doesn't have the scripts network with like hgtv food diy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of people like those kind of shows. Well, you're gonna if you're that kind of person you're gonna keep your cable, right?  But I think what this really is  Is you've got netflix you've got amazon  You've got google play  But what you don't have is live  Events you don't have the academy awards. You don't have football. You don't have the live stuff you want to watch  You don't have locals. You don't have live local news  So this is the add-on service that gives you local live locals that's a big deal  Price is 35 bucks and you know  I think everybody's realized by now court cutting is not about saving money. It's about you know, give a screen giving it to the man  but you're not going to save money when you by the time you add your netflix subscription and your  HBO go sub hbo now subscription and all of that it's going to add up  That's why I don't think it matters if you don't have hbo you subscribe to it  Where you get hulu for the other stuff? This is this is I don't think this is intended to be like everything you need  It's the supplementary package that gives you live locals  for cord cutters

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the um sequel to uh, the good wife  The good fight with christian baranski good fight, which I really want to watch  But I think you can only get that if you subscribe to cbs for like six bucks a month. Yes, which is insane. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's amazing  We tried to do that. You can't yeah, we tried to do that. You can't you can't get it on demand. You have to  You can only get it on you. You know what you can get three episodes on demand and then the rest you have to subscribe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something like that. This is this is a what is this?  No one's content is probably that valuable. I mean I they all believe it is  Oh, yeah, it is going to be a hard way to fall in  I don't know  So, I mean some people like i'm sure if like there was a star wars

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know there are a few there are a few I think you know football is one  Uh, you know cnn is probably valuable  espn is very valuable what we think right because I don't I mean, I think it's probably more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Less channel focused and maybe more event and show event or show like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I might pay five bucks to watch the oscars live, right? That's I mean, that's what users say is I want it all a cart  And that's exactly what the cable company doesn't want to do. They don't even want to give you a channel a la carte  Right to buy packages  Well, that's because the music industry was afraid of this too. Remember steve jobs forced them to sell 99 cent singles  They didn't want to because they knew most albums have one or two popular good songs. The rest is filler  They wanted to sell you the whole cd  But jobs forced them to and now look at now look at the music industry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's crazy also look at the paradox there we ended up at a um  All you can eat bundle which is like a cable subscription, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, isn't that funny it ended up going to that?  Yeah, that was that article. I was talking about last week the great unbundling  Right the great rebundling I should say going back to bundles  Consumers in the long run lose every time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um  He's he's just not he's just not optimistic today is he consumers well in the law

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay in the short run consumers lose in the long run. They may win  But it's going to be the very long run  The moral arc of history tends towards benefiting consumers. Yeah. Yeah in a hundred years. You'll be able to watch any show you want  There you go. Well in a way, that's why that's why torrents exist why piracy exists because consumer, you know  This is the thing that most terrifies these big content companies and their aggregators is that consumers  Thanks to technology can disintermediate them and just steal this stuff one z two z  And that's why they're so scared of that piracy. This is what really scares them. Well, there there are cost things to think about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, the cost of producing content should be certain types of content should be spread across a wide audience  Even if that wide audience isn't consuming it. That's the same argument we do for like broadband. That's nuts

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not that consumers say, you know everybody well you don't  You pay to see a movie I don't pay for a bundle of movies when I go to the movie theater  You should pay for the show you want to watch and to force this is why there's piracy  Because they forced aggregation they forced all this crap  We we stopped buying cds because you'd buy a cd because you like that song and there was nothing else on it that you liked  And and it backfired on them and that's because consumers really just want to buy a song or a show  Shouldn't they be allowed to do that? And I think it would work if you did  Maybe not  H hbo has a bunch of weak series that are powered by one or two really strong series, right? Is that that's the theory, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is the theory. It's also just inertia

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, I wonder what movies movies are there, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true  I mean like I watch once we cut the cord I watch so much less tv because I had to make an active choice  On what I wanted to watch and that was actually really nice because I found I had extra hours to oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the worst all smart devices. That's the worst thing from hollywood's point of view  I know they that's the real existential threat. They might not watch it. They might not need us at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've turned a podcast. That's an interesting theory

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We need a 500 channel universe not merely because we aggregate because because because it the bundles the costs  But because if people don't have this constant flow of content pretty soon, they'll go. Oh, I guess I really didn't need that  I'm gonna go read a book  What's that is I was like that is what I do i'm gonna go feed a tart feed my tartar grades

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm gonna go feed my friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's tartar grade feeding time  Is posting on facebook a constitutional right? This is a fascinating story

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not about whether facebook cuts you on or off or not, but it's about whether the government of I forget which state  Uh ruled that a sex offender could not go on social media. Issy Lepofsky writing for wired

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lester packingham jr. Registered sex offender in 2002  Uh is he he took to facebook  To celebrate a recently dismissed parking ticket praise to be praise be to god. Wow  but by using facebook he was breaking a 2008 north carolina law  That prohibits registered sex offenders from accessing websites that enable people to exchange information where minors  Can participate facebook is one of those sites he fought back  He said that's a violation of my first amendment rights. Yep  And it's going to the supreme court  Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting wow there was actually what it says further here is that facebook it's not just it's a first amendment case  But it's also saying that facebook is  You know critical to an open society it's it's it's it's you it's it's a it's a speech utility  It's a speech necessity  I don't know how all that cuts. It's fascinating  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's accepted that  uh  A state can ban a hacker from using the internet for a period of time. Kevin this may challenge that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm because but it's also the state can also

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So well the state can limit where a sex offender lives right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, that's what they argue by the way, it's no the sex offender can live somewhere  Well, if this is the primary means of speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think you could argue convincingly that it's the primary means of speech yet  But it's worth and i'm not sure that that'll be really an interesting case. You're right. Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really is fascinating. Yeah, and where's the the times version?  So i'm trying to find that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they've are are they arguing they've already argued this in front of the supreme court

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, it sounds like is this from 2008? Hold on the justice has got the times version

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Yeah, they've they've we're okay. What the hell it's in chinese

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has a link to the chinese version  What um, wait a minute what?  Of the new york times they started doing that I think haven't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting  All right. Yeah, I didn't know that I read it in spanish. So i'm like, okay. Do you wait a minute really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've started i'm learning spanish and the new york times has excellent coverage in spanish. That was spanish language edition. So  I I am practicing my spanish by reading it there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah, so this is being argued or has been argued

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the the justices remarks suggested they would strike down says the new york times the north carolina law under the first amendment, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Justice kagan took particular issue with the idea that the law would prevent someone from accessing for instance president trump's twitter feed  this is  No, it's a key communication channel between the president and the public. This has become a crucial crucially important channel of political communication. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, quote so this has become a crucially important channel political communication and a person couldn't go  On to those sites and find out what these members of our government are thinking or saying or doing  So facebook gets to be a right trump saves twitter because of yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now is is he arguing just to be able to get on as opposed to post. That's right. It's a good read

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a question of speech here

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh the the government or north carolina argued well, there's other places they can get information  Uh samuel alito agreed  He said I know there are people who think life is not possible without twitter and facebook and these things and that  2003 was the dark ages  He's so grumpy, but I don't know that there are any channels of communications that were available at that time that have been taken away  But the president only tweets on twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It goes on facebook too, though  I think doesn't so justice kennedy said that social media sites had become and in some ways had surpassed  The public square as a place for discussion and debate right on right on right on  Quote the sites that justice keagan has described and their utility and the extent of their coverage are greater than the communication  You could have ever had even in the paradigm of public square justice kennedy said wow. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, so maybe you just need to  Change your sentencing laws because in jail you don't actually have access to these places  To social media sites necessarily  Um, so then that kind of raises the question of could you institute a punishment for someone like a sexual offender that actually?  Sentences them to not having access to this over a period of time  Which is kind of I mean that would be a way around this. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we'll find out  So they also they mentioned linkedin

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they say that that if if this complaintant wanted to try to find a job the way you do that is on linkedin  And teenagers are allowed to post information there error go you've cut them off from being able to get a job  Isn't that fascinating justice kennedy mused that any number of free speech doctrines doomed the law

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really fascinating  Where do you stand on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  should facebook be a  Fundamental right that can't be well and then and then well, here's the problem. We don't lay felons vote  I mean, there's this there is precedent for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For governments a lot of people who think that that is crazy wrong and want to change that though

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but there's plenty of precedent for a government restricting somebody's rights based on that's not covered by the first amendment

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First amendment is a matter of speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you think that the that the right to speak trumps the right to vote

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It clearly does I mean the constitution I mean that's franchise versus speeches

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, though. There's another case today of a teenage girl who spoke at a uh, um immigration rally  She's a dreamer brought here when she was young and she probably got arrested  No, that is wrong. Chill. Does that put on speech?  Yeah, what was she arrested for? Hold on well for being  So called illegal

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can I can go to twitter.com  Jeff Jarvis  Twitter needs a search a better search that I could like say what did jeff Jarvis tweet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my god. Hello 2008. They want your complaint back

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, oh my god the rundown has so many interesting stories that I hadn't scrolled down to yet. Oh, yeah  I know we put it on as we go. Yeah  uh, so um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a visa a visa overstay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, but what does that do my point is what does that do to speech showing effect? Yeah, that would be chose  Does she have a first amendment right to speech?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And does this action chill that this wasn't uh, yeah, she could speak but she could also get arrested for being a criminal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that's that's a complation of two laws. I mean it is  Oh, but yeah that ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sad this frustrates me now. Here's a happy story  The norwegian news site that's requiring you to pass a quiz before you can share their stories  Before you can comment before you can comment. Yes, I think this is a great idea  This is by the way, you don't know this because I got on your feed and you reshare chas edwards  Chas is an old friend. He was one of our great sales guys at tech tv  Yeah, and he's now at pop-up magazine  He was in federated media for a bit because it federated that's right, yeah, so  nrk beta which is a tech  vertical of the norwegian public broadcaster nrk  Uh said that um  You have to answer so you have to answer three basic multiple choice questions about the article before you can post a comment  I'm not sure that's a bad idea  No, I think it's kind of interesting  You run the risk of less engagement, but on the other hand, there's are people engaging that aren't reading so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Over sexual harassing he left as under a cloud. Yes. He went for a cloud. He wasn't fired

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He wasn't fired. He left under a cloud according to cara a female employee filed a sexual harassment complaint against him in 2015  Google later allowed singhal to leave  Before the company could take further action singhal denies the allegations, but he has stepped down  at uber  Ubers I would imagine very sensitive these days about those kinds of stories  Did you read about the border patrol agent  Who asks  Uh asked a software engineer to prove that he was a software engineer by balancing  a bee tree  Celestine Omin is a 28 year old software engineer from lagos, nigeria  He was traveling to us on sunday as part of his job with andella, which is a startup  Uh, actually mark zuckerberg, uh and priscilla chan are investors  Upon arrival at jfk was questioned by a border agent waited for an hour  Then was brought to a different room to be questioned by a second agent. He wrote on linkedin  Quote your visa says you're a software engineer. Is that correct? The officer asked omen in a tone  The engineer described his accusatory when omen said it was right the officer presented him with a piece of paper and a pen  And told him to answer the following questions  Write a function to check if a binary search tree is balanced  And what is an abstract class and why do you need it?  To omen who had had not slept in more than 24 hours  The question seemed opaque and could have multiple answers while he's a skilled software engineer with more than seven years of experience  He later said the questions looked to him like someone with no technical background googled something like questions to ask a software engineer  He did his best to answer the questions and after first being told he flunked the plot pop quiz was nevertheless allowed to go  Presumably because in the meantime omen's employer had been contacted and vouched for him  And we all probably saw the tweet which was retweeted thousands of times  I was just asked to balance a binary search tree by jfk's airport immigration. Welcome to america. I thought it was a joke

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  You know, i've been talking to lots of people who've been coming across the border people  You know from ireland the people from england people from germany all getting more hassled all yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they are are any of them white?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, they're all right. They're just they're just furners furners are getting hassled period

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's more furners not just it's been hard. You know, this is not ever since 9 11. It's been

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little bit more difficult. I mean, I i've I remember, you know friends people like will harris complaining. He's a brit  You know you had to get hit  People entering the u.s. Have to submit fingerprints. It's answer tough questions  And uh, and then it goes the other way  I think the canadian border patrol started doing similar things to america's entering canada almost as retaliation  This they have a broad right to do this  And and a lot of discretion

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that also speaks for our country and it's shameful  What they're doing to people who are friends and our relatives and our co-workers who want to just come to our country

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's a little they're doing it to people who like are citizens of our country, too  if they look the wrong way and that's that's frustrating for my friends because  That's not cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there are a lot of stories. There's the  The woman who was coming, uh, where was she from ireland to speak at a conference in houston?  And was detained at the airport almost turned back  Uh, who she says i'm never coming to i'm never well, there's a beloved, uh australian australian writer. That's what was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, she said and then there was an ex a holocaust expert who was almost turned back from the conference

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, let's uh, take a break and get your picks of the week, what do you say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep, okay  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seems about that time. You know what? This is my friends. This my friends  Is the answer to all your wi-fi problems dad. This here is the euro  Why just settle for a dumb old wi-fi router that's so 20th century when you can join the cool kids who are using  Mesh routers and these look good. These are beautiful euro was it's actually a year old. Can you believe this?  Happy one euro birthday  To eero  the original whole home wi-fi  System  It's a mesh system that blankets your entire house  Fast reliable wi-fi no more buffering no more dead zones  wi-fi that just works see what happened was  Wi-fi was wildly successful and suddenly even if you lived in a relatively, you know remote area  There were lots of wi-fi signals all over your house lots of congestion houses got bigger  We demanded more bandwidth and pretty soon this you know wi-fi router you'd been using just wasn't good enough  Eero created this notion of mesh routers multiple routers  Communicating rapidly with one another so unlike an extender. They don't have the bandwidth  They give you full bandwidth  Throughout your entire house each euro unit does about 1500 square feet  So these three units would do forty five hundred square feet and i'll vouch for that  That's about that's a little bigger than our house, but we we use three units to cover the entire house easily  What's also great about the euro?  They're overbuilt and I did not know this maybe you didn't either stacey  I know you're kind of an expert on this stuff, but they put more processor and more memory in the euro than they needed  Because they wanted to be able to push software updates  In fact, they pushed their most recent one the 2.0 mesh update big big update and there's more capability there  They also automatically upgrade the firmware. So it's one of the you know, key ingredients of any iot device  Is that it'd be patchable for security issues and the euro is absolutely  Absolutely up to date protected with state-of-the-art wpa2 encryption, of course  And there's features in the euro app that are very sophisticated kind of hides the complexity makes it easy to set up  But if you want to dig down into the app, there's some stuff you can do  That are is really high end  Check it out on amazon great reviews a hundred seven hundred fifty of them  There's a one-year warranty it works with your existing modem and internet service  And is of course a 30-day money back guarantee euro  The original whole home wi-fi system to celebrate its first birthday  They've permanently lowered the prices for euro  You can get the three pack and again, that's about 4,500 square feet for 399. That's a hundred dollars off  Two pack enough for 3,000 square feet most homes. That'd be plenty  299 50 off  Go to eero.com or best buy or amazon  and never again  This is why I had to go to the euro  Will you hear?  Honey, the wi-fi is not working  I can't watch the tv  What's going on fix it?  Fix it  Right, but I fixed it  No complaints eero  dot  com we thank him for not only the support of this week at google but for  Saving my marriage  Uh  Well, let's see here. Why don't we start with stacy's pick? I'm sure you've got something exciting and fabulous for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I wish I have like so many devices that are like on route. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Instead of excited about what are you most excited about that you haven't seen yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh  Oh, oh you guys  Like oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just doorbell you won't believe it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's amazing  No, there is a device called so i'm excited about this the review unit's not coming out though  So I can't tell you like if it's any good or not, but it's called the bond  And it is an ir and a  rf  Um device the reason i'm excited about it is because it's 99  and it is going to be able to do with the  ir it can control a bunch of different devices like air conditioners and  So it's a it's an ir blaster  Well, it's not just an ir blaster  You just plug this in somewhere in your house and then you can also tie in like  I'm excited about it because i've got these samfi motorized blade blinds and it's going to work  With those according to the company  And to set it up instead of doing this crazy insane z-wave setup that I do right now  Which sucks and it takes a long time  I'm going to be able to just point my remote at this  Blaster thing basically in the app and it's going to automatically add it. So it's going to be a lot easier  To add my devices. So you just do it with ceiling fans  Yes, and it's got the echo. So now if you do it with like if you have a remote that controls your ceiling fan  you can actually  Program the bond to that and then use it to open your ceiling or to turn on your ceiling fan with your voice  With your voice, wow, you can also use an app but i'm i'm anti-app because I hate pulling out my phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, i'm pretty I think the I think the amazon echo is actually the killer application for iot frankly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's what I like. I this is going to be my device if it works whenever it arrives probably because I am super

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stoked about it and there you see it ladies and gentlemen  the the perilous  roller coaster ride  Between high hopes and dashed hopes that every iot device goes through

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of dashed hopes guys. I got my logitech harmony working. Oh  It was some weird  Confluence of events. Oh good  So we're all good  and  Your husband don't even know  My husband is now speaking to me and he admits  That it might have been worth it to pay 99 dollars for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, don't apologize. I like it bond home.io  Available for pre-order now at 99  dollars  Jeff i'm sure I saw I saw a good number but i'm curious if I have lots of numbers first

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Though I want to mention something if I may yes  um the uh  The first draft coalition, which is a wonderful organization working on more facts in news  together with news organizations and others, uh backed by  Google I think facebook too has launched, um cross check in france to uh,  Check on on on the news in their election. So I just wanted to mention that as a as a um bit of a  Plot this is a fake. It's not my number. Yeah, so when is the election? Is it soon?  Yes soon in germany after that marie penn a front runner or  It for a a plurality. Yes  Okay, guessing is that in the runoff she would suffer but who knows  And then uh, you know  year here  Builders and the other ones is also uh, it's a similar  Politician so that's going on. So anyway, so yeah, lots of I got lots of numbers here. Um  What I probably like is that google now says that we watch one billion hours of youtube a day  Which is 10 times more than netflix though netflix makes plenty of money their way and is approaching the 1.2 billion hours of television  We watch in a day one billion hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of youtube 1.2 billion a number uh, us only number or is that nielsen data shows 1.25 billion tv watch america. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's always why is the youtube number one billion global? That's a good question  Yes, i'll bet you're right, but it is approaching tv  If you click on the link at the top there, that's uh, that's the blog post in google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But even the numbers one billion hours watched. I mean it makes me think of how much server and bandwidth are devoting to youtube  I mean that's that's how many petabytes of data a day is that  I know  If it's a billion hours  And an hour of youtube streaming is probably let's let's be generous an hour of hd streaming is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's about 700 gigabytes two. Oh, wow. Oh, oh, sorry an hour of h. No an hour of hd streaming

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or 4k hd is about two. So let's say one just to be generous because not everybody's watching an hd  okay, so  That's one gigabyte times one billion

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which gets us what's is that a petabyte?  I think a billion gigabytes. Is that a petabyte or is that a byte help me google convert convert

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay

Transcript:  We had a great interview on saturday on the new screensavers with one of the planetary scientists a three phd guy  Oh, wow who was involved in that and  He said that there's a another story help me out here  another research project being done  to take the basic  chemicals  early planetary chemicals  And combine them  And there is strong evidence. They haven't written the paper up yet, but I got the impression from him  He has an inside track on this that they were able to create  uh rna  Just by combining these these elements that it that if that were the case  And we've now found these these earth-like planets including three planets that are in the goldilocks zone in this in this new star  That are you know, in other words where life as we know it could exist plenty of water, which is also a condition  and the scientists can show that the the actual creation of  Replicating life from basic chemicals  Is possible through a lightning strike or some other addition of energy?

I said well why have  If life is common because there's billions and billions of galaxies  Each with billions of stars if life is and if there's many many planets there might be you know  An exabyte of planets out there if life is common. Why haven't we heard from anybody?  And he said well it might be common, but it's also easy to wipe out  And he said getting to the level of civilization we're at we're talking about life like us like this kind of life single-celled  You know filament  Uh for life to get to the point where it could travel through space or communicate through space.
