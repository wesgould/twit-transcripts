Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, I'm sorry that you don't have yours with you.  I feel like going to a convention with other party people and having a lot of drinks and  saying and having secret handshakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well if you did, I would be the grand poobah because as you can see, mine is taller than  all the rest.  I have the super twit fez.  It's so big we're going to have to zoom out a little bit.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff is the author.  What would Google do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He also blogs at buzzmachine.com.  To his left, hatless, but nonetheless we're so glad to have her.  Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So sad I'm fezless.  I didn't take it on the road.  I'm on the road for vacation to see the family, but 2011 I'm rocking the fez.  We'll take it off now and you can feel comfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll take it off.  No fez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's like which one of these is not like the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fez free episode.  Well for many reasons.  Fair enough.  Great to have you both.  The last episode of the year, next week we're going to do a best of episode.  Our viewers voted on their favorite bits from previous episodes, including some gleeking  out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Awesome.  Some chipotle.  I can't wait to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And more.  Yes, it'll be a lot of fun.  Let's get to the news.  There's quite a bit of news.  I guess the biggest story and I'd love to get your opinion on it.  I know everybody listening would too.  Yesterday the FCC approved a net neutrality regulation that made no one happy.  I mean literally.  I don't think anybody liked it.  Republicans hated it because it was regulation of the internet.  Democrats hated it because it wasn't enough regulation of the internet.  Actually, I'll tell you who liked it.  Google and Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, even Verizon is talking about so well.  This is bloody Verizon's plan and Verizon's whining about it.  What?  Well, now that's just, that's just they're talking about sportsmanship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On what grounds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just because it hurts them.  We don't like it.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We will do what everyone to do or we'll take our ball and our wire and we'll go home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well now.  Why did I start that?  I'm sorry.  Droopy dog moment.  I just, to my understanding of what this proposed regulation is, is that there would be so-called  net neutrality enforced on landline internet service providers like Comcast, but not on  mobile providers.  Is that, did I get that wrong?  Isn't Verizon a mobile provider?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what's so disgusting about this.  But yeah, that was, that was the Sudentenland split that Verizon and Google did.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And in fact, I would say, you know, somebody pointed out, I think it was MG Siegler on  TechCrunch that language that must have come from the Google Verizon proposed agreement  was in there saying, well, Android's open, so you don't have to worry about net neutrality,  which makes no sense at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no sense whatsoever.  It's crazy.  So this is basically what they proposed, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, this is, this is the Google, this is the Google Verizon deal, is it not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's hands are dirty.  Dirty, dirty, dirty.  And I'm very ashamed of you, Google.  And I'm more ashamed of, I'm also ashamed of the FCC that they didn't make any of this  process open.  Oh yes, we could go and Neil Dash, your colleague, Scholar, be able to, did you give suggestions  on the site?  I don't care.  They didn't give us the stuff that we could have argued about and dealt with as it went.  Even when they approved the thing yesterday, they didn't make it public what they approved.  It's now up online.  And I, and I put that up on the, on the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll have to read it though.  I mean, you know, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we got to do this long thing.  It's gonna take us a while.  But it's just transparent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A lot of people commented on the website and was remember, wrote them an 1800 page, 1800  email.  Um, public knowledge caught him after the vote.  I think he was actually there in the chambers to watch this happen.  Steve Wozniak, the founder of Apple and the, and the original geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're here with Steve Wozniak, who's a co-founder of Apple.  And we heard from Commissioner Kops that the order didn't go nearly far enough.  We heard from Commissioner McDowell that it went much too far.  What are your thoughts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's nice to see people standing up for the people, the consumers, and given them  protections against a lot of big business.  I don't think you're going to find hardly any American, aside from a lawyer or somebody  who's got a political side, who would ever say that they could trust the actions of the  major carriers, the phone companies, the cable companies that we have today.  I think pretty much whenever those companies are given some leeway, we wind up feeling  kind of taken advantage of, screwed, given misinformation, deceived about what we're  getting versus what we could have gotten.  I think that all the comments of the minority side could have been made just as effectively  back when AT&T was this awful monopoly that kept us from any innovation in the telephone  world, kept anybody from connecting to their lines up to the card version.  We could have made those exact statements in that time frame.  It works.  We got a real success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he's got a point, but we didn't get quite what we wanted either.  I don't think we have a Carter vision case, although maybe if Verizon sues and loses,  we'll have the courts behind us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't understand here politically why the FCC and the Democratic commissioners  knew the Republicans weren't going to go along.  They knew this is going to end up in court anyway.  Why didn't they go ahead and push this to its proper definition?  They said it was a compromise.  With whom were they compromising?  Not us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hate to say it, but this is how the Obama administration has worked the entire two years.  They're compromising with straw men who still vote no.  It doesn't make any sense at all.  Gina, you were going to say something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm confused about why Verizon is suing, if this is basically what they proposed.  Because they're breez sons of bitches.  Also, can we talk about the Android connection?  What is that?  I read that paragraph a few times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's Nile Patel in Engadget.  I want to give credit where credit's due.  The paragraph he's talking about, further, this is in the FCC's decision.  We recognize there have been meaningful recent moves toward openness, including the introduction  of open operating systems like Android.  In addition, we anticipate soon seeing the effects on the market of openness conditions  we imposed on mobile providers that operate in the upper 700 megahertz C block spectrum.  We by the way was Google who insisted on those, which includes Verizon Wireless, one of the  largest mobile carriers in the U.S.  In light of these considerations, we conclude it's appropriate to take measured steps at  this time to protect the openness of the Internet when accessed through mobile broadband.  When they say measured, they mean none at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, measured is none at all.  So they're defining openness as absolutely no rules at all.  So carriers can do whatever they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and Android has nothing to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It makes no sense at all.  It doesn't make any sense at all.  There's no parallel there.  I'm still trying to understand what they mean by that.  Do they mean that like any manufacturer can do whatever they want with Android?  So we're going to take the same approach with the network to see what happens?  I'm confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're not alone.  OK.  In fact, I mean, I think that maybe it was M.G. who said this means basically they took  the Verizon Google proposal and cut and paste it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Here's the, I just found the reference that I think comes from National Journal through  link here that Verizon is basically questioning whether the FCC has any authority over broadband.  So they're going to use this as a chance to sue and say, you can't do anything to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nothing.  Well, thank you, Jeff.  Jeff filed a Freedom of Information Act petition saying we want to see the correspondence between  the FCC, Google and Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any correspondence relating to this and meeting notes and meeting schedules between the FCC  and any company, including but not limited to technology companies, Google and telecommunications  companies, Verizon.  And we want to open this to this.  I filed a FOIA a few years ago with the FCC when it came to them going after so-called  indecent programming, finding out that it was very, very few people who complained.  So we'll see what happens here.  The government is very good at not responding to FOIAs, but this is ridiculous that we have  no transparency in this process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And by the way, you say I'm willing to pay up to 250 bucks, whatever it takes.  Whatever it takes.  We'll do a fundraiser on Twig.  I think you get enough.  I'll promise you whatever amount I'm not, I guess they charge $25 per search item or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  something.  It should cost nothing because it's for press.  It should cost nothing is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep.  Oh, I guess so you get a waiver.  That's why you put in an amount, but you also ask for a waiver.  Yeah.  Good.  Well, I hope I know that the FCC will pay close attention to this and respond immediately.  So what do we get?  Did we get true?  Let me ask.  And I know we're still reviewing this document, which is now just now up.  Did we get true net neutrality at least for Comcast and the land-based Internet service  providers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't tell.  It has words like no unreasonable discrimination.  But what's the definition of unreasonable?  Yes.  That's kind of a problem, isn't it?  So it says below that pay for priority unlikely to satisfy the no reasonable discrimination  rule.  I don't know what that means.  The double and triple negatives are confusing me in a terrible way.  I need my fez back on.  So if they go to a provider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If they go to a provider like level three and say you will have to pay us for priority  access to our customers, that according to this regulation is a violation of net neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the sentence.  A commercial arrangement between a broadband provider and a third party to directly or  indirectly favor some traffic over other traffic, dot, dot, dot, would raise significant cause  for concern.  Yes.  That's a very odd way to write a law.  So now the courts can say, well, struck down for being vague.  We're concerned.  We're concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're wringing our hands.  We're concerned.  Doesn't mean we're to stop you.  We're concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Priority would represent a significant departure from historical and current practice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me, though, point out that John Perry Barlow and others, libertarians most say,  well, fine.  We don't want any Internet regulation.  I mean, it's true that I mean, I'd hate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If we had competition, I would absolutely agree.  The problem is that this is this is in lieu of competition.  We're stuck with monopolies and duopolies.  And when they do violate the market, we have nowhere to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And there is no competition.  No.  And there is no recourse.  And you know, this is the specter that is now raised by this is a company like Verizon  might very well say, well, we'll charge you 10 cents a megabyte if you watch YouTube  videos or twit.  But we won't charge you at all if you watch our own Vcast product.  Right.  Or we could even block YouTube because, well, we have to protect our networks and people  are watching an awful lot of YouTube videos.  We know that, in fact, AT&T asked Apple to restrict YouTube videos to 10 or 30 seconds  on the iPhone.  Apple said, but Apple is in a rare position of power with AT&T.  I don't think Motorola or HTC is going to be able to say anything if Verizon goes to  them and says, yeah, by the way, no, no YouTube videos.  No twit, none of this twit crap.  Those guys, we don't like those guys.  And that's what that's the real problem that this raises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I just got this from somebody sent this to me, Fabrin Hort on Twitter.  The reaction of the telcos.  I'll retweet that right now via Engadget.  Retweet.  And so the Verizon's funny.  It says, although we share the FCC with the FCC, the overarching goals of an open Internet,  we are deeply concerned by today's 3-2 decision.  Everybody's concerned.  We are deeply concerned.  We are the ones who have a right to be concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People are not concerned.  They're in secret opening the bubbly, jumping up and down, wearing funny hats.  But they have pretending that they're deeply concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We won, we won, we won.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, it's all tied in not to get too meta here, but it is tied into WikiLeaks.  It is tied into the idea of open and closed networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The climate has changed thanks to Julius Assange.  And government now is a little bit more, it's a terrorist wind kind of thing.  They're a little bit more likely to assert control over the Internet.  They don't, you know.  Yeah, that Internet, you know, it could be a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is our greatest tool of disruption.  Thus, the disruptors will disrupt it.  They won't let us use it.  And that sounds, I sound like I'm about to start singing the international and go to  Woodstock.  But you start to believe this, that it's, it is powerful institutions are going to be  against this disruptor of power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And, you know, here's the thing, and this is why it really is appropriate meat for this  show, is I had high hopes that Google, because of their deep rooted interest in net neutrality,  would be fighting on the side of the angels on this.  And there was a powerful ally for us.  And now, and they've abandoned us.  If anyone was going to do it right, it would be them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would be Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we have no institution we can rely on, and we have no organization of the people  of the Internet to rely on.  And so that's somewhat our own fault.  And we're getting, we're going to get hammered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Happy holidays.  Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should do a version of Sue's The Grinch with Google's The Grinch.  Yes, we should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're the mean one, Sue's The Grinch.  She looked good in green, by the way.  She did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People are going, wait a minute, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All we need is a mention of Chipotle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A full circle.  I am mad at you guys because I've been craving Chipotle for an entire week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It worked.  Curse you.  Our plan.  I'm not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was, there's something in there.  They coat those chips with crack or something.  This is a story that we actually had last week, and I think it's still going on.  YouTube said to me in talks to buy Next New Networks, which is the video kind of, they're  kind of like a video aggregator, except that they produce some content.  They're actually a producer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're actually a producer, which I think is, and Fred Seibert, who started it,  is a great guy and the other staff there is great.  I'm all in favor of them getting a good deal.  I think it puts Google in a terrible position of now creating its own content and they will  get accused of favoring their own stuff, which they get accused of anyway.  Yeah, no kidding.  And it doesn't help them in discussions with media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When asked last month if YouTube would consider acquisitions of web video production companies,  Eric Schmidt said, quote, you never say never.  We've tried not to cross that line.  But he said, he noted that YouTube had helped finance web video production in the past,  but quote, to actually own the content is an important decision.  He didn't say no.  We're always debating these things, he said.  The good news right now is there's enough of these little digital studios that can raise  capital and they say YouTube is a viable distribution point.  By the way, that's what we do.  I'm not sure why would they even want to buy Next New Networks?  They do AutoTune the News was out of the Gregory Brothers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bed Intruder Song, that was the number one video of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do the political jokes and they do the do-it-yourself fashion stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they do all their content, Next New Networks, or do they aggregate some?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They hire people to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they are a production, basically a production company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Indie Mogul, Fastlane Daily, what's the one that's so great?  I'm forgetting it.  Darn, I forget the name of it.  Angry Orange, is that theirs?  No, they do a fashion one that's a lot of fun.  Not that I would know anything about that.  Threadbanger.  Threadbanger, I just like the name.  Yeah, it's great.  It's how to make stuff yourself.  You can tell that's what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what about this notion that Google does favor its own content?  When you do a Google search for a lot of products, what you get is a list of Google stuff first, whether it's YouTube or places.  Isn't that favoring your own content?  How is that okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every website links to its own content.  And if Google knows that its content, knows most about its content, if it thinks that it's the best result, then it should show it.  I don't have a problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Google's not the New York Times, though.  Google's not the Post.  Isn't it a search engine?  Isn't it different than what Yahoo was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yahoo sends its firehose, as they proudly call it, to their own stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but I think that's the question.  Is Google a content creator or a search engine?  If it's a search engine, it needs to be content agnostic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, Leo.  But let's remember that they, not to become the Google Defender here, but I've just been kicking them.  But that's the rule they came up with.  If you look back to what Bill Gross created and Yahoo bought in their placed ad structure back in the day, search was for sale.  Google came along and changed that precedent to decide that it wasn't.  The main question for Google, I don't think, is a matter of unfairness to companies.  It's a question of their credibility with their users.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Google's tried to launch, like, Null, right?  That's always the thing that I think of.  I think of Google trying to create or host content.  And if they were truly being biased, you'd be seeing Null pages above Wikipedia pages, but you don't, right?  I mean, it's like, I trust that they make good decisions about what are the best things to show at the top of results.  And you know what?  I see Google ads, and those benefit Google at the top of search results, and I accept that.  I mean, those are clearly marked, and that's a different story.  But for the most part, I'm not worried about Google favoring its own content.  As someone who's run a website for many years and has had great Google placement because it had good content, they treated me fairly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You wouldn't be so happy if Google started a lifehacker site, and then every time somebody searched for the best way to take text notes, and their site came up first, though, would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that would bum me out.  I suppose I'd be up in arms if I felt like their own page, if it was worse than lifehackers or my own blog.  I guess that would upset me.  I don't know.  I never spend too much time trying to figure out what the SEO algorithms is, but I've had great success with, you write good content, it shows up in search results, period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Webby in our chat room said, yeah, and when you do those Ford's ads, Leo, you should also say Chevy's not so bad either.  And we do.  We, I mean, we're a content creator, so of course we plug our stuff and we refer to our stuff, but we're not trying to be kind of somehow content agnostic.  I guess that's really that's that next new networks issue exactly, which is if they're a content creator, then they no longer can be a reliable search engine because they have a dog in that hunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, they still could be, but they'll always be under suspicion.  Right.  That's the issue.  I would say, well, you know, really, ThreadBanger is the best DIY fashion site and somebody else says, no, I think mine's better.  They find themselves in a qualitative discussion they can't really have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but they're not putting it in the actual normal search results.  They're putting it above them, right?  They put the place you search for a dentist.  They put the places stuff first.  It's not kind of it's kind of it is separated a little bit from the search results, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, in some cases, right?  In some cases, I mean, if you do weather and your zip code, you know, Google is going to answer you, right?  Google is going to just going to try to give you the right the best.  And that's appropriate.  Right.  And that is absolutely appropriate.  Yeah.  I mean, am I upset that or definitions that kind of thing?  I'm upset that that I don't have to do another click to get a definition.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I guess on the other hand, if Google started doing a dictionary and American heritage didn't show up, but Google did, then you were American heritage.  You'd be upset.  It puts you out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they grab, you know, they aggregate definitions from all different online dictionaries, right?  It's kind of come up with the best, the best one.  That seems to be kind of the best one, right?  When you do define, let's try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What if here's here's a great one from our chat room again.  The 17 R3W, which I think is his tire size.  He says, you're looking for the new Lady Gaga video.  There are two versions, one on Vimeo, one on YouTube.  YouTube shows up first.  Identical videos.  Is that OK?  It is if you're if you're not if you're Vinny Vimeo, it's not OK.  Wouldn't you be upset?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the argument is they're already in this position.  So why not?  They are already.  Yeah, they already are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's true that YouTube videos do show up first, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  YouTube is I would I mean, YouTube has to be a more linked to site than Vimeo.  It's a much bigger video site.  Well, here's here's the question.  So here's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Knowing how much smaller Buzz is member buzz.  Yeah.  Then Twitter.  There's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What if the buzz results should have showed up higher than Twitter or showed up at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good one.  That's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a very good one.  But do they?  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the social the social searches that your results from your social circle.  I think that maybe buzz shows up, but it's primarily it's Twitter.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you still using Buzz, Leo?  No, there's nobody there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And by the way, as soon as I say that the five people who are there are going to flame me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the buzz fans are.  You do not want to mess with them.  You don't want to mess with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They a couple of about a month ago when I left Buzz in a fairly loud fashion as I am wants to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They said, we're going to invade your chat room and take it over and ruin things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there was like three people.  Not exactly anonymous.  Steven Pearlstein writing in The Washington Post.  Time to loosen Google's grip in case you hadn't noticed.  Google isn't just a web search company anymore.  In addition to online advertising, it's moving into operating systems, application software, mobile telephone software, email, web browsers, maps, video aggregation.  Also in the process of assembling the world's biggest digital library of books and visual materials, Google portrays each line of new business as a logical extension of its core mission to expand.  If you define it broadly enough, I guess everything is to expand digital horizons in ways that allow people to use the Internet to improve their lives, etc.  It's a I added the etc.  It's a noble goal.  Google does it very well.  But how much bigger and more dominant do we want this innovative and ambitious company to become?  There's nothing improper or illegal about Google's monopoly.  It earned that dominance fair and square as IBM and Microsoft did before it.  Where I have a problem, however, is this is again, Steven Pearlstein writing in The Washington Post.  Where I have a problem, however, is in allowing Google to buy its way into new markets and new technologies, particularly when the firms being bought already have dominant positions in their respective market niches.  This is the case with YouTube, DoubleClick and AdMob.  ITA software, which is really being fought right now.  This is the travel software that Google spent 700 million for under review by the Justice Department.  Would have been the case with Groupon.  Google apparently looking for a mini Groupon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still think Groupon is.  We don't get it, but we're guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, OK, so I don't need my hair removed and my nails done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I talked to I talked to who did I talk to?  Was it Veronica?  I think it was Veronica Belmont who said I use it every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah, I'm just not a I'm a tomboy.  I'm just not a shopper.  I checked it out recently and I was just like, I don't I don't know.  I don't want to do a spa day with like 10 of my girlfriend.  You know, it's just not my thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google responded.  Don Harrison, Google's deputy general counsel, responded to the Pearlstein argument.  He says as companies make build versus buy decisions, sometimes it's possible to develop a new product in house.  But other times a company decides it could bring in a new product to market faster by acquiring.  He says consumers benefit from these acquisitions like the acquisition of Keyhole, which led to the development of Google Earth, which was the first free satellite imagery application.  He says, look, we're not the only one.  Microsoft, Apple and Facebook are also spending and buying and acquiring.  I don't yeah, I don't I don't know if I agree that there's an issue with Google making acquisitions here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think there is. I find it shocking that a guy from the business section of Washington Post is writing that.  Come on, what do you want them to do? They got billions in cash.  Look at his own company.  How is the Washington Post still afloat? Because they went beyond their business and bought Kaplan.  Right. And they were a monopoly in Washington, D.C.  It's just absurd argument.  Well, let's say it's anti-Google thing now that pops up and now it's spreading in the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the terrorists are winning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, but I don't want this. I don't want to defend Google today because I want to be pissed at Google today because of the FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, I have to be.  OK, you figure out what you want to be while you're doing that.  Let me mention SquaredSpace.com.  Actually, when we come back, I want to get you angry again, Jeff Jarvis, because the Wall Street Journal is back with more privacy allegations.  But we'll talk about that.  Oh, Jeff, we're just just warming you up.  Just are winding you up, I guess I should say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We need him to be green for the Be the Grinch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Look at this. We're all dressed in black. What is that all about?  We're all wearing black. It's the most depressing twig of the year.  It is. It's the most saddest twig of the year. I'll play some glee music. It'll cheer us up.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boy, Sue really trashed that tree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, he did.  But then and this was a little weird.  It's all of a sudden she gets nice at the end like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, time constraints.  There was a much longer script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a much longer arc somewhere, but we ran out of time.  SquaredSpace.com, my friends, the fast and easy way to publish a high quality website or blog.  Go there right now. SquaredSpace.com slash twig and take a look.  It is. I. I. This is such a great company.  They both hosting and software unparalleled quality.

So the Wall Street Journal now, this one seems reasonable to me, but I'll let you I'll let you puncture it.  Wall Street Journal now admittedly in this privacy series, some of the stuff that they've come up with is just ridiculous.  But they point out that a number of apps, whether it's on Android or the iPhone like Pandora, send information that really no there's no reason for that app to send about you back to their advertisers.  Pandora apparently sends not only, you know, your unique identifier, but information, demographic information, too, to five different advertisers.  Your apps are watching you, says the Wall Street Journal.  Why is that OK, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Number one, they're not sending your phone number and they never made that clear in the entire article.  They're freaking out thinking they know they can call you and know your phone number.  They're sending the phone's unique identifier, correct?  The UDID. Exactly right. Right.  Not a phone number. As goes with this entire series in the journal, they're trying to lead people.  Let me like down the text plus for the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This iPhone sends your UDID, but also the phone's zip code, users, age and gender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK. Guess what? It's ad targeting. Oh, yeah.  You're going to you're going to target the ads better.  And if you can, you're going to get higher value and we get more free stuff.  And I keep saying go offline and you'll find this far worse.  I go to Axiom AXIOM and try to buy names.  And I can go to Gina's zip code and I can ask for every woman single between the ages of 18 and 29  who have ex income and ex education.  And I can then get their names and addresses and send them things.  Compare that to what goes on here. What's the real harm?  We got to get past this notion of merely I don't like that creepiness, right?  Because it's actually less targeted to PII than it was in the past.  And all it's really doing is giving the signals for targeted, thus higher value advertising.  Well, fine, if we want to turn on, you know, do not browse on every possible thing,  then we're going to make phone companies happy because you're going to be paying up the yin yang for stuff.  You're getting this stuff free because of advertising.  And if it's low value, all you're going to get is dancing monkeys and no value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Doesn't this I mean, listen to this quote from the chipper Megan O'Halleran of Traffic Marketplace.  The great thing about mobile is you can't clear a UDID like you can a cookie.  That's how we track everything.  Ms. O'Halleran says Traffic Marketplace, which is a unit of Epic Media Group, monitors smartphone users whenever it can.  Quote, we watch what apps you download, how frequently you use them, how much time you spend on them, how deep into the app you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Idiots. But you know, the other problem is that she's actually being...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It isn't linked to it. She says the data is aggregated, not linked to an individual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I do complain loudly and I've done this with the industry that they've done a god awful job of being transparent about this stuff.  And so that's what does freak people out. And that's a problem.  I was just writing up the section of the book when I talked to Philip Kaplan, PUD of Blippi.  And he told a story of everybody comes to him and says, well, what if people could see that you bought porn?  He said, probably, A, who needs to anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That just shows how stupid you are. Right, exactly.  B... I love pirating porn because I know both.  I'm doing good things for exploited women by undermining pornographers and I get my porn for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There you go. It's a good justification, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Protecting those women. You can say I'm screwing them both ways.  But I wouldn't. Oof, oof, oof. I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So PUD decided to play with this as is his want.  And he went to the Castro, which is the main street of gay America for the West Coast, right?  And he went to the most sexual story he could find, a store called Your Mother Doesn't Know.  Oh dear.  And he bought stuff. Right? And so because he wanted to know how people said, so you went to a porn store. Woohoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know why? What's the big deal?  Everybody does. And in fact, this is, I think, I would guess, a big point in public parts,  is that this kind of transparency just reminds us we're all the same.  Yeah.  And it's a phony, it's a very faux kind of righteousness that says, oh, porn.  You know, it's the preacher who's got three boys in his closet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're not going to be using Blippi if you're going there and you've got a problem with this.  You're not going to be, you know, putting your Tiffany's purchases up if you're buying something for your mistress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although I have to admit, I forgot that I'm on Blippi.  Oh, Leo.  So I actually, I probably shouldn't go over there at this point because I, God only knows.  40 Fezes. Why would you have that on your credit card?  God only knows what my Blippi, I actually like, I kind of like Blippi because it is fun to see what people buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and it now defaults to, if you looked at the old one, it now defaults to approving every purchase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it does. Yeah. Well, see that shows that there was some sensitivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I also know, but you see, Pud also said the reason that it works out for him is he discovered that if you had to review every purchase, you are more likely to put in reviews, which gives you more data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've really focused on that. In fact, they have a little game, you get to the next level if you review it and you say, well, I like this and blah, blah, blah.  And then you can also publish it. So yeah, I think that they're actually getting quite, this is a free app.  Gina, do you think I'm not supposed to talk about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, just to go back to the Wall Street Journal article, you know, I'll admit that for a hot minute it freaked me out because when I install apps on my Android phone and I see the list of things that it needs access to, my contacts, my location, it's not always clear why and what those apps are doing with that information.  I wish that there was a more, I wish there was an explanation. I wish that Pandora would say, hey, we need access to your contacts so you can share a playlist so that I would know.  I mean, often I just agree and assume that it's for, so that I know.  But then again, you know, do we ever really know what a website is doing with our data?  You know, forget the data that travels from your phone to the advertisers. Once the web app has that data, what are they sharing with advertisers? So there's that issue.  And the other issue is, you know, all the stuff that advertisers know about you when you browse from your desktop computer, I mean, it's a lot of information.  I don't know if you guys have seen the EFF project, Penopticlick, where you can kind of footprint your browser based on a lot of information.  Not only the user agent and the IP address, but your browser plugin details, your screen resolution, your fonts installed.  And if you look, I just ran it. You know, my browser footprint right now is unique among like 1.3 million.  So they really can kind of track someone. I mean, this woman was sort of saying that she was so happy you couldn't delete your cookies so easily because people couldn't delete their cookies on their browser.  But really, it's not that hard to track usage, you know, given some sort of unique footprint on a regular browser.  So I see. I see. I'm really I'm with you, Jeff. Although I have to say, I when I first saw that article, I was like, oh, crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you want an interesting counter viewpoint? I thought this was the chat room passed along a link to me to a blog by a guy named Don Marty, who is a longtime ad guy.  And he said, actually, targeting is not a good thing for advertisers. It's a very interesting logic.  I don't know if I can express this completely. But the point he makes is that by advertising, a company is saying we do well enough.  We're signaling to consumers that we do well enough that our advertising costs can be recovered. We are a high quality firm.  Low quality firms don't advertise. He says the problem with targeted advertising is less expensive.  So it doesn't signal as clearly as, say, a full page ad in The New York Times, which is not targeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of backwards to me. That's the under that logic.  Then you would never do direct mail. You do nothing but billboards on the street.  Yes. I just prove that you had enough budget to to do that. Yes.  I think that's old ad agency. I got to read it myself and see.  But to a certain extent, that's old ad agency think that says that I get paid on how much advertising I buy and the more inefficient it is, the more I get paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's interesting. His blog is zgp.org slash tilde D Marty.  If you want to. Tilde. You don't see those much anymore.  Or else I wonder if he's on tripod.  Moving along, we mentioned this on on Twitter.  I'll just mention it for the for the giggle. Google's being sued by a Japanese woman for showing her underwear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was on her clothes line. It was on her clothes line. Google Street View got a picture of it because no one else hangs their underwear on their clothes line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But she was so real. Look, she had to move. She said move.  It did. She lose it. Lose her job.  Wow. I'd say it'd be more damaging if she didn't have any underwear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look on Street View. There is nothing on her clothes line.  She must be wearing her knickers. No, I don't know. That's the German.  I don't know what is going on.  It's a fun. It's a fun story. We'll see.  Yeah, she's she must be going commando commando.  Yeah, you will blow your clothesline from now on.  I'm going to I don't know if I want to talk about share spaces.  Let me let me pause and we'll come back because I want you to address this because it really is kind of it looks like they're kind of saving pieces of wave.  It does. Yeah.  Let's talk about that in a second.  Before I do that, I want to tell you what to do with your stuff.  You know, holidays are upon us.  You probably going to get a whole new pile of good stuff and you have a lot of old stuff that you don't use anymore.  What do you do with it? Well, don't sell it.  Well, you could, but it's a lot easier to gazelle it.  Get cash for your gadgets at gazelle.com.  It's the fastest and easiest way to sell your electronics.  And if it's too old to get any money, well, they'll recycle it responsibly.  No parts go in the landfill. None of it goes overseas.  It's all fully recycled.  And I just like going to the website.  You can see, look, now being sold to gazelle customer from West Monroe, Louisiana, just got forty eight dollars for her cell phone.  I just love it.  The category products in many, many, many different categories, twenty categories, two hundred thousand unique items, everything from Blu Ray players to PDAs to video games to tablets.  Wonder if you had like an old slate or something, if you could sell that.  Who makes your item? Apple.  Oh, these are you'd be fun if you could.  I wonder what my Newton's worth.  Let's say I have a 16 gigabyte Wi-Fi iPad and I'm going to sell it because I'm getting ready for the new one.  They ask you a few basic questions.  No, it works fine.  No, it works.  Works well.  So square.  It's no noticeable flaws.  Looks like it's never been used.  Do you have the original goodies?  By the way, I don't know if you've noticed, but they've redesigned this.  Look, two hundred sixty eight bucks for that.  That's great.  Geez, I can recover a lot of that.  And so cover my marriage.  You should have done this.  So here's what you do.  Here's what you do.  You go through all your stuff and they send you a mailing labor.  You throw it all into a box.  They pay the postage.  They're product experts who will view it.  They will remove all your data.  They know how and they will remove all your data.  So you don't have to worry about that.  And then they send you a check.  It's great for a charity to Gazelle has a nonprofit pages, which I think is a great idea.  They call it Gazelle for Good.  If you have a nonprofit or a charity, they you can you can set up a page and have a gadget drive.  Don't you love that idea?  That's great.  Yeah, I think Gazelle is a really neat company.  We've been really happy to partner with them.  I was skeptical.  I admit it.  When they first came to us, I said, well, let me try this.  I thought it might be like, you know, one of those cash for gold type of things.  So we sent a bunch of stuff back.  And when we got without telling them, you know, it was secret.  We got the check.  And now I got email from people all the time, tweets saying they sent me a bigger check than they said they were going to when they saw it.  I mean, this is a really neat company.  You should have an intern do a Gazelle inventory of the content thousands and thousands of dollars worth of goodies in this cabinet alone.  Oh, and wait till you see my house.  I've got drawers for we all do.  You have one of those wire drawers where you just throw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, wire drawer, the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, just throw crap in there.  And then and there's like it's like stratified.  So you can see like, oh, I can go back 10 years.  Look at that.  It's really sad.  I got it.  I get an intern in Gazelle.  Gaze double le dot com.  And by the way, I'm going to give you a little heads up here.  Gaze le dot com.  And you can get a five percent bonus over and above the amount of money they promised you.  So just go through the whole thing.  And use the offer code at the end when you check out Twig, T W I G.  And they'll give you five percent plus just a little thank you for for coming to them from this week in Google.  Don't sell it, Gazelle it.  Nice new website, too, by the way.  All right, Gina, tell us what this shared spaces is.  I saw this in the Google Wave blog, which is still around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Still around.  Shared spaces dot Google labs dot com.  So the thing about wave is that it was a platform where you could build gadgets on top of it, kind of little mini apps.  The problem was that I think the barrier entry to wave was so high that a lot of people just totally missed the gadgets.  So shared spaces and it was a third party.  The third party developers could make these gadgets.  So shared spaces is now kind of freeing, separating, decouples the gadgets from wave and just puts them on a regular web page.  And you just you know, you hit this button, create space.  And it's things like polls or, you know, let's plan an event together, pick the dates that you're free or mind mapping.  But it's all real time with a real time chat chat log kind of kind of enabled so people can sign in with their Google account chat or lists that kind of thing.  So look, I mean, here's a shopping list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And so it's just a plug in on this page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Just a plug in on that page.  And you can you can share it with other people and other people can log on and you'll see their their Google profile kind of icon at the top of the page.  And they can edit the list at the same time.  And it's got that all that real time wave chat.  Goodness. And there's chat that goes on.  So you can very easily kind of post a tweet or post a blog post and say, you know, yes, no, maybe gadget was one of my favorites.  Just ask a question and get a yes, no, maybe answer that just that's just a simple poll.  The waffle gadget lets you plan an event.  Say, hey, can you make it the 10th, the 12th or the 17th?  You know, and then people just say these are the days I can make it.  So it makes it easy to choose a date and time.  Map gadget, you can, you know, mark off places on a map if you're creating an event and multiple people can do this at the same time.  So really decoupling the gadgets from from wave is a really, really good idea.  It kind of it still lets these gadgets live on and people use them because, you know, a lot of developers put a lot of work into into wave extension.  So I'm really happy about this.  It's a really good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's neat. And when you're done, delete your space, I got like 800 shared spaces now.  I got to delete them.  So there's quite a few.  So is this every gadget done for Google Wave or how does this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not quite.  Actually, there's quite a few.  There is quite a few.  And actually, yeah, I was just looking at the featured page.  You can see there's there's productivity.  So I'm not sure how they made the decision which ones to do, but it looks like they really hit on the most popular ones.  These are certainly most of the ones that we wrote up in the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, so maybe we should put the book back on the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, really, it's much easier to say go click create space rather than it is.  It is.  It is a wave and hit the pause button.  This is kind of what wave should have been, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's true.  So let's see.  I'm going to.  So there's some games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's let's roll some dice.  This is good.  We could do Dungeons and Dragons.  This is really neat.  And I noticed it links into Buzz when you do it.  So I guess that's where the.  I don't know.  Maybe the tweet goes or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can share it on Buzz.  Right.  So it's a really good.  So, you know, so yesterday I tweeted, hey, do you think that shared spaces is good for for wave gadgets?  And, you know, I had, you know, 25 people come into my yes, no, maybe gadget and and vote and then chat about what they thought.  It was a really nice, like impromptu kind of get together live space.  So, yeah, I think it was a nice, nice reincarnation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gina, I know you need to I know you need to take off, Gina.  I hate to do this to you.  I know that's OK.  Why don't you give us before you go, give us your tip, because actually it's very timely.  It's really because almost a news story.  And then and then we'll let you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely.  So, OK, two quick tips.  OK, Gmail has had free calling to the U.S.  and Canada from the U.S.  through 2010.  They've extended that through 2011.  So, yeah, in Gmail, if you click on call phone in your chat window, you can dial.  It's basically permanent, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, don't you think they'll extend it in 2012 and then on and on and on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Possibly, but it's through 2011 for now.  So that's that's pretty cool.  And that's only for U.S. Gmail users.  Second tip is really quick one.  This happened the day after last week's show, so we didn't get a chance to talk about it.  Google Maps 5.0 for Android.  If you haven't gotten the update, get it.  If you did get the update, check it out.  It's a really great update.  It's super fast.  3D buildings.  I'm here in New York this week.  It's amazing.  You can two finger tilt to zoom and drag.  Do I need a satellite to get the 3D buildings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How do I do that?  No, no, you don't need satellite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just you need to be one of the 100 plus cities that they have.  So New York is one of them?  Yeah, New York is one of them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if I search for New York, I'm now in New York and I zoom in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Zoom in and if you go zoom in and down into Manhattan, you will start seeing 3D buildings.  Wow.  And if you use it should and it's super fast.  These are vector drawings now.  Look how fast it is.  Those tiles.  Right.  Oh, there we go.  There's some 3D buildings.  There you go.  And so now do the two finger drag to tilt and you can see kind of a...  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah.  It's pretty neat.  Pretty neat.  So and that works offline as well.  If your phone is offline, it works.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If it's cached.  I mean, I imagine at some point it has to cache them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, if it's cached.  But you know, it used to be that Google Maps was these just these tiles, these little images  that would kind of tile together and download as you scroll.  It's not that anymore.  It's just these vector images which are much smaller.  It's amazing.  Look, it's making Leo so happy.  As I go through Manhattan.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These buildings pop up.  Well, they must somebody with somebody they put a lot of SketchUp artists to work doing  this.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, seriously.  Holy cow.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that neat?  It's true.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're also bringing in subway routes, which is a wonderful thing for us, real people who  have to take subways and trains and things.  Unlike you, California's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  What's a train?  So this is, that's really, that is absolutely, it's free.  Not yet on the iPhone, but I think they said pretty soon, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Soon, soon.  Yep.  And I'm still, we're still waiting for Gingerbread, us Nexus One users are lowly Nexus One users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I love the Nexus S. I love the Nexus S. Big four inch screen.  Amoled.  You can upgrade.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should just do it, right?  It's not great.  I followed a couple of my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's some things missing that are kind of weird on this phone.  There's no notification light, which is kind of strange, and you can't put an SD card in  it, but it does have a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they switch the home and the search buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  That drives me nuts that nobody's figured out the order here.  So yeah, home is now on the far right and search is in the middle.  Oh, Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was in Best Buy.  I kept tapping the search button.  Right.  It's like, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's taken me a while to get used to it.  On the other hand, boy, and I think this is mostly gingerbread.  Gingerbread is a lot faster.  Once you get gingerbread on your Nexus One, you may not care.  I mean, it's so much faster.  Yeah.  It's just great.  Yeah.  All right, Gina.  Thank you so much.  Gina Trapani is at SmarterWear.org.  Thank you.  She also has a great program called ThinkUp.  ThinkUpApp.com.  ThinkUpApp.com.  Have fantastic, fantastic holidays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll see you both next year.  Yay.  And I can't wait to watch the Best Of.  That's going to be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It should be fun.  I think, as I mentioned, a little glee, a little chipotle.  It should be awesome.  Bye, Gina.  Take care, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina Trapani, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, and by the way, and I should mention that we have been using Google Talk for this because  Skype has been down all day, and Google Talk is doing a great job.  Now, I can add Kevin Marks, I think.  Let me see if I can add Kevin Marks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin was tweeting.  I think now that G, because I only had one machine that had Google Talk ready to run  on it.  So I'm going to call him right now and see if he'll come on and replace.  There he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Am I there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Excellent.  Yeah.  Hi there.  Hey, Kevin.  Thank you for doing this.  I'm sorry we couldn't get you on sooner.  I only upgraded two machines to use G Talk.  I have to say this is working pretty well.  Yes.  Kevin works for British Telecom Ribbit.com.  I wonder what your thoughts are on this Skype outage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's fascinating.  We've had this thing over the last week where we've seen a lot more single points of failure  in the internet than we were expecting.  Yes, all in one week.  The WikiLeaks thing exposed that where suddenly they were using Amazon and their DNS provider  to shut them down.  Seeing Skype fall over like this, I think what Skype said was some of the super nodes  were failing.  So the way Skype is a peer-to-peer thing and some clients end up becoming super nodes as  switching points for each other.  You'll notice if you Skype on a fat connection suddenly it's using a lot of CPU because it's  rooting other people's calls for them.  What they said was they had a bug in one of their releases that meant they stopped working  with super nodes and so therefore the network became fragmented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've been creating mega super nodes rapidly to take up the slack.  Well, thank goodness.  This is the first time we've actually used a GTalk video and actually I think it looks  pretty good.  Yes, it is appropriate.  I know you've been watching.  In fact, you've been sending links along.  Thank you, Kevin.  I appreciate it.  For those who don't know, Kevin is a former Googler himself and former Apple guy and he's  now at British Telecom as I mentioned at Ribbit.com.  We just love having Kevin on whenever we can so I'm very glad that you could step in the  breach.  Any thoughts on anything we've talked about so far including the net neutrality thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The net neutrality thing, I think, as Jeff said, the fundamental principle here is what  you need is structural separation so there's actual competition.  That's the way that it's regulated in the UK.  The piece of BT that provides the fundamental connectivity sells to the rest of BT and to  every other company at the exact same price and there's a sort of Chinese, there's a  firewall between them.  They're a separate company and as a BT employee, I'm not allowed to talk to them in any way  that amounts to collusion.  That's interesting.  The way that's set up, that means that the actual ISP part is very competitive.  BT had most of the plant, the underground plant in the UK when it was privatized and  so they set it up in this way so that it was easy for competitors to work with that.  There was some of that in the previous Telecom Act and that basically got smushed away by  regulation.  It used to be able to, in the DSL day, be able to have multiple ISPs that were all rooting  through the same tech but then they changed the regulation basis for the internet in the  US so that was no longer true and we now have these local monopolies.  The net neutrality rules are a sort of a patch on the fact that there are local monopolies  and we'd be better off enabling more competition at that level, either by doing the enforcing  structural separation if there is a monopoly or by not granting monopolies but allowing  more competition, allowing more people to run cables, more rights to run fiber and ducts  to the home.  That's the deep problem.  The net neutrality rules are intent to work around that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, in short, do you think that these rules are adequate?  I mean, you work for a mobile carrier so...  No, no, well we're not actually a mobile carrier which is interesting.  That's a good point.  Okay.  Do you feel that mobile carriers have a reasonable complaint that they're different in terms  of their infrastructure than land-based ISPs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, they are different, sure, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they  need to be favored.  Again, the build-out tends to be more expensive, but again, there is slightly more competition  there in that there are multiple carriers at any given point, in any given point where  they can be.  Competition solves all of this, of course.  Competition solves it broadly, but the real problem that the mobile carriers have is that  their model was a call-based model, not a database model.  And what we've seen in the larger cities, San Francisco and New York, is that they weren't  expecting that much data and they've got to scramble to build new.  They're actually telling people to use Wi-Fi instead.  And in my head, that's a good thing.  I think more Wi-Fi is good.  And Wi-Fi is actually a universal standard that does work.  This is the sort of fascinating thing, but it's displacing a lot of the mobile use because  it's actually higher bandwidth and much more targeted because it is very distributed.  We've all deployed it ourselves.  We've all bought base stations and scattered them around the place where we happen to be.  So I don't think they should be distinguishing between the two.  I think we do want to have neutrality on the mobile as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Especially since we're using it more and more and more as our primary needs.  That's where innovation is going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And if you look at the stuff you're doing with the Android, with the mapping stuff,  that is enormously useful and very valuable.  To some extent, when Google built Android, they built the assumption in that you would  always be connected because that's the way Google works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, if you want to know about that, and you have latitude turned on, and I know  you both do, go look at your latitude history.  It's a little terrifying.  I think I turned history on.  Yeah, you might want to turn it off if you have anything to hide anyway.  I was kind of shocked.  It knows everywhere I've been and keeps stats on it.  And it says, oh, you know, over the last year, this is where you've been.  This is where it's kind of shocking, frankly.  Frankly.  So, yes, you're right.  They intend for this always to be on and watching at all times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because they want you to be able to search all the time.  That's the value for that.  If you're walking around using your device and it's not connected, that's not as valuable  to them as if it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, that dashboard thing is great.  That's how I found out about this, by reading my dashboard.  There you are.  Yeah, that's me.  And by the way, you want to know where I've been?  Here is everything for...  We can only display the most recent 500 locations.  And they will give you a graph.  They will give you all sorts of interesting information.  It's kind of amazing about where you've been and when.  At first I thought, hey, this is great.  If I ever get busted for murder, I could say...  And then they say, where were you on the evening of December 22nd?  I can say, well, just check with my latitude.  But then I realized it really isn't where I was, it's where my phone was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, also, I mean, there's a distinction here.  I'd like to make that the Harry Potter analogy.  In Harry Potter, there are two geolocation metaphors.  There's the Marauder's Map, which they use in the school to show you where everyone is.  And you see little dots moving around.  And then there's the Weasley's Clock, which is the clock they have in their house,  that says they're at work, they're at home, they're in mortal peril, they're at Hogwarts, or whatever.  So it's a sort of a known location indicator.  And the problem is that latitude is way closer to the Marauder's Map,  which is this creepy we can see everywhere you are thing,  than it is to that, are they at home, are they at work, are they somewhere safe?  And that's...  If you think about the difference between those two worldviews,  there's a difference between geo stuff that you feel comfortable with and geo stuff that makes you nervous.  And what we're seeing with Foursquare and the ones that explicitly let you check in,  is you're basically saying, I'm at work, I'm at home, I'm at the bar, I'm somewhere safe,  which is much closer to that sort of comfort model than this will track you all the time and pin you down thing.  By the way...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like the difference between Beacon and Blippi.  Beacon kind of snuck up on you, and Blippi, you know exactly what's up everybody except for Leo,  knows exactly what you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look at this, it says, here's a pie chart.  How do I spend my time? Work, home, sped out.  I mean, this is an amazing...  These are all the places I've spent.  I spent 29 hours at home last week.  I don't see Dr. Polt lay there.  This is...  I mean, if you have Latitude turned on, go to your dashboard.  You might want to just think about what you're telling...  I'll have a look at that after the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You didn't know, did you?  I think I turned on...  You were smart to turn on the extra tracking.  Actually, it's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At first I went, oh, I want to turn this off, and then this is a tribute to Jeff.  Then I turned it on and I said, no, I think this is kind of cool.  I got nothing to hide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the tension is, you know, who has access to this?  This is sort of the core of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they say very specifically, only you have access to this aggregated information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  You and Google and whoever you're off to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And a cop with a subpoena.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Oh, never mind.  To your monk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the tricky part of this, which is...  What we're seeing is that people are starting to realize that they want to have...  They want it, they want it introspect.  They want to see where they've been.  They want to see the stuff for themselves.  But making sure that someone else has that is the way to do it is a problem.  The thing, the flap last week was around Delicious closing down.  And suddenly people were saying, wait, I'm going to lose all my links.  I was invested in that.  Yahoo has now said they're not going to close, they want to sell it or whatever.  But there was suddenly this like, oh, I've invested all my stuff in that place, that thing there.  And this is a similar challenge with when Google shut down Dodgeball or...  If I've got everything in Twitter or if I've got everything in Facebook,  and then they suddenly shut down my account, then you've got a problem.  And that's how we've had stories that happen to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Paul Buhite, who of course tweeted that he didn't think Chrome OS was going anywhere.  People are starting to say, oh, you're anti-Google.  He posted a blog post.  I thought it was an excellent blog post.  For reasons, Google is still awesome.  And we don't say this enough.  And I know, Jeff, we were a little upset with Google at the beginning of the show  because of their stance in net neutrality.  But let's not forget, Google, this is number one, point number one.  They take big risks.  Yeah.  He says people point to projects like Wave as evidence that Google's lost its magic or something.  To me, it's evidence they're still willing to take risks on new ideas and new ways of doing things.  Number two, they're willing to build new technology seemingly unrelated to the core business,  things like autonomous cars.  And boy, thank goodness that there's somebody out there who's willing to do blue sky research  just because they're interested in that.  He said from an employee perspective, these non-core projects are also an opportunity for greater autonomy.  Part of what made the Gmail project so fun, Paul was one of the creators of Gmail,  is that we had a lot of independence and could pursue ideas that other people inside Google  thought were, quote, the wrong way to do it.  Most other tech companies don't offer that kind of freedom.  Number three, they compete in positive ways.  Google's weapon of choice is more often open source and open standards, not closed standards.  They don't try to weaken open.  And in fact, the criticism they get for Android, I'm adding this,  really comes from the fact that they were kind of saying, we're going to make it open.  And finally, they don't seem to mind honest criticism.  And I will say that because I tell you, we went to Google and we're oftentimes critical of Google on this show,  and they embraced us as if we were never critical.  They understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really true.  And Eric Schmidt, when I interviewed him for the book, he'd just gone through the Times Square hell  and what he calls death by Twitter.  And he says, listen, we want criticism.  We just want a paragraph, not a sentence.  We want it to be reasoned and thorough and smart.  And then that's valuable to us.  And they mean it.  They really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good for Paul for writing that.  You agree with his analysis, Kevin, because you worked there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think he sums that up well.  The open standards focus is very important there.  And they said that in public.  Someone in chat was saying Android isn't open.  Android has two halves to it.  I've said this before on the show, but there's the fully open source piece of Android, which means it can be deployed to everything,  which is fascinating.  And then there's the other half, which is the with Google part, which is the apps that are proprietary to Google are included with the phone,  like the navigation stuff, the maps that you were showing off.  And so they have sort of they've got two pieces to this very deliberately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there's good reasons why that's proprietary.  There's all sorts of proprietary technology.  There's a mixture of reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But what it means is that they can provide some kind of we will only put the with Google on if it if it satisfies these criteria and they can set those criteria.  But they're not actually preventing people from building other devices.  So, you know, I've got my like wacky Chinese fifty dollar and it's running Android because it's running Android open because it's because it's free.  And I bought I bought this random thing in the in the this was ten bucks.  It's a MP3 player before players.  Ten dollars.  It's not running Android yet.  Next year, these things will be.  It was in the hardware store.  They had a box and I thought, wow.  So the thing that Android is this sort of very the open piece of Android is this very powerful force that is going to permeate consumer electronics next year, even more than it already has.  We're seeing it.  Everyone's building on it in that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not just permeated, Kevin, but I think also connect things that weren't connected before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, yes, exactly.  That's the other piece is that this thing doesn't this thing is ten buck thing doesn't have an Internet connection, but it has a USB so I can make that way.  But you can you can imagine adding Wi-Fi and things to these and as they go.  But the the other thing is that I my prediction is we will see someone else replace the the the closed half of Android.  So they will provide replacements for the contact management, the mapping, the the other specific Google specific apps that are that are baked into that.  And there are a bunch of companies that might do this and could do this.  Facebook is an obvious one.  Twitter is another one.  You could you could you could see somebody like Yahoo or Microsoft even doing this and saying, OK, we'll take we take the open source piece.  We'll we'll swap out the bits on the top.  We've had hints of that already with the Verizon androids that search being instead of Google because they were able to do that.  And that's going to be fascinating.  And that that's that that's something that's going to get more interesting over time.  There were hints of that in the Chrome announcement as well.  When they when they when they launched Chrome, they said, well, at the moment you have to look at the Google account, but we could potentially log in with other things in future.  That's that's another sort of potential market.  If they if they hold true to the the openness of this stuff, that should be able to be the Facebook OS at some point.  It could be it could be it could have the Facebook set of apps on top of that.  I said that's that's that's possible.  And if we you know, if we get the open sound pieces right, that that would be viable and that would be useful.  That would mean that we're not sort of blocked to to one source in future.  You suddenly find you have a single point of failure like when like Skype going down on you.  You were able to connect through through different systems that are closer to the original vision of the Internet.  That's that's the big challenge we're seeing at the moment is that we're seeing that there are all these sort of points of control in the Internet that have grown up because through habit and through program habit as well.  We're now used to the idea of things not running directly edges but always having to talk to a server to communicate.  Right. The model of I've got a web browser and I've got I've got but the real stuff happens on a server because servers have real IP addresses and your client only has pretend ones.  And that architecture is now sort of permeated the net because we were short of real IP addresses and and because laptops and phones change the IP addresses depending where they are.  But I suspect we're going to start seeing some pushback on that over the next year where we rearchitect so that you can actually run stuff directly from the edge your edge clients to other edge clients without having to root through central servers.  That's you know we're seeing sort of markers from of this in in some of the things that have been going wrong and failing this week and that that will trigger the engineers to go wait.  Oh well you're supposed to fix that a long time ago. Why does it does everything have to be centralized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is a self healing thing which is a good thing. Yeah. At least as long as humans pay attention.  We are. I'm so glad you joined us Kevin. We're actually running out of time. We're running a little bit late here.  So let me get to our final words here which start with Jeff Jarvis and his numbers of the numbers numbers numbers numbers we got numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well some quick ones. Gina contributed this one which is the tabs for charity which I don't fully understand but they got 60 million tabs for charity on Chrome and you can look that up at Chrome dot blog 60 million chat.  I don't understand. I don't either. And I try to read it but I just actually pay attention to you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Big mistake. There's your problem right now. This is they've actually raised essentially equivalent of a million dollars by opening tabs in Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't get how that connects but that's fine. I'm glad they raised a million dollars. That's fantastic.  Then we have 300,000 San Francisco has 300,000 Facebook fans more than L.A. and New York. Of course. OK OK OK.  Of course. That's just obvious. L.A. has 200,000 poor New York because we don't play along like this has 10,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey what do you want. I don't get no like button for you. Hey if you had a button. Yeah. Yeah. You got a problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then we got a million Apple TV's. Yeah. And a million Roku boxes they say before the end of the year. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just shows we're really connecting to the Internet. However now that net neutrality has changed we'll be able to use any of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We played with my tool on that didn't come out right at all. We played with this on Twitter this week and we had a lot of fun.  This is a joint project I think with Harvard and Google Books to take and analyze all the contents of the Google Books and create N grams arbitrary N grams from data in Google Books.  And you know you can do your own if you want. Just take any number of arbitrary comma sensitive comma separated phrases.  Let's say Chipotle Taco Bell comma Taco Bell and McDonald's.  I don't know how good this is going to be. Remember these are from books Google Books. I don't think there were a lot of mentions of Chipotle before 1990.  But anyway and yes it certainly went through the roof. But look at that Chipotle number. Whoa compared to McDonald's which is green and Taco Bell which is way down there.  So obviously at least in the Google Books N gram viewer Chipotle is a big winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And our readers by our readers our listeners viewers are starting to lobby Chipotle tweets for sponsoring the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know they don't have to sponsor the show they just have to cater it.  We want a Chipotle bowl delivered to each host right at one o'clock every Wednesday afternoon one o'clock Pacific 4 p.m. Eastern.  You can watch us at live dot twit dot TV. Jeff Jarvis is buzzing at Buzz Machine dot com.  Also the author of a great book called What Would Google Do? and his new book Public Parks. He's working on it right now.  Kevin Marks is at Ribbit dot com. Thank you for joining in Kevin. It's always great to hear from you.  We're going to get you on a full show soon. Yeah. Thank you very much Kevin.  And we will end with something Matt Cutts put together with his team. They call it the 12 Days of Googlemas.  Jeff have a great holiday. Great new year. We're off next week. We will have a best of episode.  We will be back doing this show January. What is that third? Fifth?  The day before we head off to CES at live dot twit dot TV. Happy New Year everybody.  Happy Holidays Kevin. It's great to have you.  And now ladies and gentlemen the 12 Days of Googlemas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On the 12th day of Googlemas my Googlebot gave to me  12 optimized titles, 11 local listings, 10 site maps submitted, 9 bloggers linking, 8 site links showing, 7 Google Trends, 6 social signals, 5 followed links  444's fixed, 3301's, 2 indented listings, and a first place organic ranking.  Season's greetings from Search Engine Land and Google.
