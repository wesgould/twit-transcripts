Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  School of Journalism at the City University of New York  That's that's literally what they mean when they say you don't have to make a big production out of it  We made a big production out of it  I'm surprised this is not this shouldn't be our lead story, but I'm gonna make it a lead story  They are renaming the Staples Center, which is the the big  Beautiful, you know what it is right now. A that's where who plays it  That's where the Lakers Lakers. Yeah, what was it called before was the Staples Center?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's always been the same since they did it. Yes, they built it before that. They had to go to the front

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Since they built it before that they had to go to the forum was it the paperclip Center before that that would be okay, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They've rebranded it  Staples has given up their branding to  crypto dot-com arena  That's crazy now. We know we are living in the future

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I got the money up front  But at the same time crypto dot-com is all over f1 and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How much money is going in f1 formula one racing? Yes crypto. I don't even know what crypto.com is

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's just a service that allows you to acquire crypto way easier than you know  Trying to figure out how to create a crypto wallet yourself. It's about like coinbase  Okay, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did see a story about how  They've arrested actually I think was on security now yesterday. Mm-hmm  The  Ukrainian  crypto  Giant who was because the his crypto exchange was being used for ransomware  folks  So it was another one of the ransomware arrests the US is really we're pissed  That's it we're taking you guys down  So  you know  It's too bad because I think there's nothing inherently evil or wrong about Bitcoin just as there wasn't frankly anything inherently  Creepy or wrong about bit torrent, right?  but because bit torrent was often used for piracy it became the piracy and I'm I worry that because of  Ransomware and other misuses of crypto that the crypto is gonna be seen that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But doesn't it happen with all the things we use? I mean the internet was supposed to be so we can't have nice things  right in for communication and information and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You are becoming you are becoming  Jeff Jarvis already and we haven't even gotten to the ramp portion of the program yet. Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Look at that was a positive rant. That was that was defending the internet in the internet joys of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's not a rant US detains crypto exchange exec for helping Ryuk ransomware gang launder  profits  Dennis Dennis Dubnikov founder of egg change and crypto coyote  He was he was actually on vacation. He was attempting to vacation in Mexico denied entry to the country  They sent him to Amsterdam where he was arrested by Dutch police the request of the FBI  Actually, he's not from Ukraine. He's a Russian national  So  One more rest wonder he was helping right you can't they're Russian gang. Yeah, it seems like all the ransomware, okay  Are in Russia. I don't know why that is they're just giving Russia a bad name, right?  All right now back to the real news the top of the store top of the top of the heap a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Number one Stacey hates her pixel six. Hmm. Yeah, this is the top of the the garbage heap y'all  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Love my pixel 6 Pro. Mm-hmm took it to Mexico got great pictures  I was just talking about how I've decided not to use the pixel launcher but switched over to a third-party  Launchers you enjoyed at freedom  And that's one of the things I love about Android  I don't have to use their launcher and I'm using action launcher, but there's many good ones  Including  ScooterX likes Nova launcher use that for years. There's one called lawn chair, which has a good name  Microsoft even has its own launcher  But I like but I'm using action X and it gives me a lot more control over how it looks and feels and stuff  But what is it you don't like about so I'm just saying I'm just gonna stand up for the pixel six

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pro now you got the pixel six. I got the pixel six and my issue with it. There are two issues  one  It's freaking heavy like it is literally hurting my wrists. Yeah, so did you have before I?  Had the 3a it was like 150 ounce or grams versus 207 grams

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yep, so this is a huge so it's a whole pound more same with the 4a. It was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it's half a pound  It's almost half a pound total total total

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's a few ounces more I guess is what I was thinking 28 grams. Yeah, so yeah four ounces more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like two ounces more. I think two ounces more  Doesn't seem that heavy but okay. Okay. It is it is truly heavy and like when I'm holding it one hand  It's kind of it's hard to control and keep it all in  So that's that's one

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Normally floppy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I  Had carpal tunnel. Oh you do have and then  so my my grip strength is not great, but there are lots of people who have like arthritis or  Extra floppy wrists

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So so this is a personal thing it's not necessarily a  indictment of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, the second reason I'm doing it is because this finger processor is just

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, that is more of an indictment of the phone and a lot of people are complaining about it. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not hold on I  think it being so heavy like half a pound is a lot like and  I think that's an indictment thinking about the user base because I think there are probably lots of women people with small hands  People who suffer from any sort of joint disease. This is a problem and that there's no alternative. That's what gets me

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There are lots of alternatives just not in them in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Flagship pixel variety

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, but I think that's a big I mean, I think you think Google should make phones in a variety of sizes. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mean, I guess they do make it small. Yeah, I think it's not crazy to be like here's a  Medium sized phone and here's our supercharged pro phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is it safe to say a 6a would be ideal for you if they continue along that same trajectory  What it's not gonna be much lighter. I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they give it at the glass  I mean the glass is what's heavy and a lot of people and I love you for thinking this y'all are totally right  it does feel super premium, but I would I would love to get rid of that premiumness because I  Mean, okay when you're like lying on your back trying to read your phone. God help you if it slips  It's gonna whack you in the face. It's gonna hurt. You would hate

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the  Pixel 6 Pro it's even heavier. Yeah, I know I've been sitting here googling the gray at the weight and grams of all these phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This last week, so I guess the argument I would say

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For this is I'm glad Google made a phone and didn't say oh well  We got a really limit what this phone could do because we want to keep it under a certain weight  They still make the 4a and the 5 you can still get the 5 the 4a the 5a right?  So and I'm sure those are lighter you can't get the 5 anymore  You can only get the 5a the 5 was actually what I wanted to get but they don't sell it anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm thinking about I bet you can get on Amazon or somewhere Google may not. Yeah, I think I can get it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that I mean that's that's a personal choice  And of course you're certainly entitled to your personal choice  The fingerprint reader is something that a lot of people are complaining about actually again  I haven't had any problem with the fingerprint reader  It's both laggy and it's and you know, honestly again with it being so heavy I'm having it in the back

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is where I'm supporting my phone. Anyway, you know when I have to move my thumb over  It's farther. It's a little it's it's not too far, but it's almost too far and it kind of destabilizes it with the weight  So I just so you can't get a nice firm press on it because you definitely don't get a good press and you need that press  And I think that's the only thing that I'm going to be able to do is I'm going to be able to do it  Yeah, I don't get a good press and you need that press

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See I've moved over to the two-handed phone operation  Basically, I I gave up a long time ago on one-handed phone. You're like you're like Trump with a glass of water

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not just I mean words there I  Have I mean if I'm walking with the dog, I've got a leash in one hand. I've got groceries. I've got a kid  I've got all I mean like the times when I'm oh, yes, I can totally use my

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Priorities Stacy the phone more important than anything else

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I would say anytime I'm out in public I  Try really hard not to be super focused on my phone because then that makes me a target  so I also like to just be like  Quickly access things and I can't on this thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's why you need the pixel buds, right? You know what you need, Stacy  Pixel buds iPhone mini

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they you know this ironic because I've Apple stopped making the minis because they didn't sell very well

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, they started making they're really start making they make this won't want to get my way finally finally got a new phone  Yeah, they make the 13 mini. Oh, they do make the 13 minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, I've been I think what you need is the flip the flip open or the Samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was actually I'm gonna go to the Verizon store and see what I love  This I think the flip that's why I have one just play and the flip three has a fingerprint reader on this on the side

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which so and it works very well and very quickly and you can hold it with one hand  Maybe that maybe the mini the flip three rather is for you. Yeah, I  Enjoy myself. It's a tear fine dainty

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I have large I really just you do wanted to stay with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Andrew or Andrew I do want to stay with Andrew. He's my favorite  I do want to stay with Andrew

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  iPhone mini is a hundred forty one grams. How much did you say the pixel six is 207?  207 so it's  36 grams heavier. Yeah, that's like it is  Yeah, so  Okay, okay  It hurts my feelings. I don't know why I don't care. You should get whatever you want  I really I guess what I'm thinking is I'm so happy that Google finally  Made a big jump in their phone  I didn't buy the five because it was no much right no better than the four Excel  So and I always buy the Excel so I don't large doesn't buy. I'm a big guy  You are but I want yeah, would you say?  You are I'm rotund not beefy like you but you're short  Ten is not short. Oh, yeah, it is. Oh, yeah it is to Burke is not  Today you're not a big guy something. Oh, sorry wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You said my opinion just isn't you what did what did you say about my opinion? Oh, it's my personal opinion. It's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not a criticism of the phone. It's just too heavy for you  I don't think that that's a criticism of the phone the fingerprint reader is a criticism of the phone. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My problem is still Android 12  I keep I continue to have issues with Bluetooth connectivity it just toggles off just for whatever reason just shuts off  Not necessarily the devices disconnect, but the actual switch. I really want to defend this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I  Have had no problems with it. It's a great  I think it's a really good phone and I'm really pleased that Google finally the phone stepped up to the plate great camera  It's fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Reception like cuz I've noticed my reception on this phone is a little in areas where it had been dodgy  Run red  Island with dodgy reception, so I can't really complain but it like compared like I'm not able to  Full call  Is that I had been yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean there are a lot of people who are unhappy with the pixel six and we were it's funny cuz we were talking on Windows  Weekly this morning and Mary Jo Foley's not happy with it. Mm-hmm Paul isn't happy with it. What are their reasons?  Fingerprint reader primarily. Mm-hmm  Mary Jo said it was too heavy. Yeah, she's too heavy for her. She does like the camera  She's really happy with the camera. Well, you're gonna I mean you're gonna have a I mean this is lighter than a camera  Between

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Capabilities lighter than carrying around a supercomputer which it is but you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I mean I mean if you were to carry a good camera, okay, this is very very good camera  It's a lot lighter than any other camera that you might you're trying so hard to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Work you really are if I can't maneuver the camera or maneuver the phone safely. I can't use any of it. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm not I'm not saying you shouldn't  Throw it away. I'm just I don't want I was just gonna return

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just kind of want all mine was I almost headed out the window. I don't want people to hate it because I really

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Think pixel did a good job. By the way, they're selling like hotcakes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? It's there. I love many parts of this phone  I you know, and I was looking for this phone, but it's just too heavy for me  But I think that's a valid criticism, especially for people who sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Absolutely. I mean lots of people want smaller phones, too  How about so what don't you like about it Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I've had a big week  Oh, no, what happened my my laptop every cable box in the house  Which is more than you want to know about Verizon and a phone and so it wasn't a good week  Did they take away your cord?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was difficult it was difficult what cord what

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff has a corded phone a landline phone. Oh  No, oh no, he still has it  Maybe they took that away and he was like I need the night I have I don't I haven't used one of those since before

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The pandemic I mean I probably in years one of those Wow in a while. We have my daughter's I'll tell oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's never seen one. She went over to her grandparents as little kids  She would play with it they were just like what is this thing?  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Jeff I'm sorry your bad. So so alright, so so so two things  One is I friggin hate the rounded edge Samsung thing why it?  Distorts I don't like the feel of it. I just really hate that I just do  It's also top-heavy. So yours is yeah. Yeah, a lot of people are complaining  The crazy yeah, but this being taller  It's awkward is even more awkward I would say

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I hate this phone  Certified big guy just hate this just throw it away

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Had me going berserk Oh, well have you going berserk Oh is an old

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Fee on this show. Oh, what's that? Which is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Workspace workspace notice g-spot or whatever it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We know it's better on the Android 12. Oh wait. Oh wait. Oh wait. Oh just you wait  Okay, tell me tell me what I have so the problem was

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because I I have my personal domain is a workspace just so I can have the damn domain, right?  I don't have a staff of 20. Mm-hmm run an IT for me. It's just me  I am my own bad IT and  And so I try to put it on it says you must establish a work profile and then it says  But you're not authorized to establish a work profile. You have to talk to your IT manager. Who's the IT manager?  Me you can I find anything anywhere?  Absolutely anything that tells me how to allow my own self to establish the work profile, which I don't want anyway  I don't want this personal versus work thing. I  Hate it. It doesn't exist on my Android 12 on my nice. Oh 3xl  Now it exists on this and it's getting in the way and I was ready to throw out the window  I reinstalled things like five times I was going nuts  I couldn't find it then a very nice Googler took pity on me and sent me a DM  I guess it was a DM. I guess he wanted a private. So I won't give credit  But thank you Googler to tell me how to authorize myself to do what myself wants to do  But I still  I still don't want this whole work versus personally. That's that's why does it exist on the pixel 6 Pro because it's Pro  Not on the same operating system on my  3a XL I don't know so I was getting pissed off and fed up  I was doing the same thing as Stacy. I was looking back at the five and the four even I was then looking at the pixel 6  I'm probably being silly because hey, I'm a silly guy  I can send it back. Oh, wow. Oh, yeah  No, no, because that's the only way I rest easy is I can get rid of this thing  Wow, and and so I got it  I probably won't return it because I feel kind of bad returning things having done so with a laptop recently and  So I'll probably hold on to it, but I'm not as pleased as I should be  I haven't even put myself in the position to do that. I'm not even going to do that  I'm not even going to do that. I'm not even going to do that. I'm not even going to do that  As pleased as I should be I haven't even put my sim in it yet because I'm just not committed. Oh wow. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh now mr. Howell made a good point about that whole top-heavy  Visor part it does feel okay if you put your finger right there up under and it or you get a pop socket

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah pop socket. Oh, I am far too old for a pop socket. Yeah, I'm not don't you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will send you the perfect pop socket  Now yeah, I'm coming up with Jeff's perfect pop socket, that's what I'm gonna be thinking of

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's shit. So I'll probably hold on to it, but I'm not happy about it  And so now I'm stuck with this thing for the next you know four years that that picture. That's what we need

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Got it I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thought we'd just get him a Frank Sinatra pop socket

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We could put I I think this is more you know present-day value Jeff  To live in the past when he was called a bum

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is you spoke about the curved edges edges as well  I like a flat edge phone just for a better grip because this phone is on slippery  And then you put those curved edges on it that absolutely and this

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Distorts what does it do to photos? I think I hate it the way it does it to text and websites  What does it do to photos to have the curved edge on the screen itself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I haven't noticed any type of distortion because I guess everything is sort of centered and not necessarily towards the edges now

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's gonna drive you crazy  You like the I was soon gonna be throwing the phone down saying I hate it. No, I dig this phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just come from the 4xl. So this is a  improvement  Hardware standpoint I came from the my only beef is no way this has nothing to do with the phone  My only beef is the OS you guys are just a punch a picky

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Return it return it because I don't think we can handle you complaining if you keep about oh no

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because we can get segments. It's content

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Regenerating wheel of content Jeff. Well, I finally got my my I finally settled on a new

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got the pixel book go good. Was that the one you returned?  No, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, it's complicated I got the cx9 and really disliked it. Oh, that's the Acer. Yeah, I was really expensive, too  Yes, we got a refund for that. What do you like about the what do you like about the cx9?  The I thought it was a bad build the screen was yellow. Oh, no, I hated okay  And when you have the convertible where the back raises up the keyboard, it's kind of weird  Yeah, it's the keyboard more wonky right? Yeah, I want a solid keyboard. So man, I'm listening  I'm hearing my Android God in my head on my shoulder good Kevin  There's no bad. It was only a good Kevin on your shoulder about Chromebooks comm and so I  He's been he's been pushing the the 713 spin. Yeah, I'm pushing it. I won't say no, but that's his favorite  I think it's he likes it. He recommends it. He has a reasonable and it's and it's the aspect ratio I want  So I went and I bought it  But I didn't open the box  As I thought I don't know  I just don't know so then I went and saw the go because you know, Lee I go only place  I can see it was at the Google Store in New York of Manhattan their pop-up store. Yeah  Pop-up it's permanent. It's there forever  So I like to go a lot and then I so I returned the 713 but it was unopened  So I don't feel bad about that because he they'll just use it again and I went and got to go  It's more than the 713. I'm not happy with the aspect ratio. I'm not happy with a smaller screen  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I'm gonna make it go. I thought you would have really liked the aces though. It's that was a top-notch one  We didn't even know I thought it was gonna be it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So disappointed  Open it  disappointed

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Which the spin I went to the I went to Best Buy I became best buddies with the guy there  I went there. I'm trying to try it there. Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I go full

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm trying to make some sense of this because you you defend the internet you defend with all its flaws and warts you defend Facebook  but  Hardware  If it looks at you funny, you don't even you don't even open the box zero tolerance zero tolerance

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember on this show. I famously did the  Re re boxing. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you've returned more than you've kept in  Your years. I've returned some stuff years, but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't change and software does so you can always in the internet changes and  So hardware if you buy it and you hate it from the get-go, it's not gonna get any better  Sure, if you hate the physical well, no, that's true  But they see an IR major

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The fingerprint reader might get better in fact Google has an update that's gonna supposedly it's gonna fix it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's so the weight of this phone is not gonna that's not that's my core problem. So I'm like you could get stronger  Okay, you laugh but I'm actually in physical therapy right now tennis elbow lifting little weights

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's $1,500 bucks, but they pretty generous on the in the trade-in  So if you have an old phone a trade-in you might get a few hundred bucks or more  I was able to get a lot for the fold

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'm just gonna get my pixel back to Google and right then just all I've got now because I gave Anna my

Transcript:  Why am I getting cause I'm hungry  Let's see  Apple has this is a breaking story that just came out and it's a huge story as you know  Apple's been taking a lot of heat  most recently because they said  Third party repair companies can't replace the screen on the iPhone 13 and if they do the face ID stops working Apple  Changed its tune on that shortly after receiving a ton of criticism today  They took the extra step  They announced that they are gonna allow the general public to repair their own phones  They're gonna sell this is something third party repair shops have been begging for for years  Apple fought in the right to repair bills in many state legislatures Apple is going to sell repair parts directly to the public  This is something. I don't even think Google does this it will also make repair guides available to the public  Apple said in a press release this morning available first for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13  Soon to be followed by Mac computers featuring M1 chips  Self-service repair will be available early next year in the US expand to additional countries throughout 2022  The initial focus will be on screens batteries and cameras, but will expand next year now  I have to tell you repairing an iPhone is a non-trivial thing if you go to I fix it  You can see there's a lot of glue it's a  But after you've completed your own repair you can report  Now by the way if they allow end users to do that presumably that means you could also as a third party repair shop  Get the same stuff or I could buy it and bring it to a third party repair shop after they've completed their own repair  They can return the broken parts to an Apple store for store credit  Apple said it will offer more than 200 individual parts and tools to help repair iPhone 12 and 13's this is stunning  Yeah, complete reversal and the right by the way the right thing to do. Thank you Apple. Let's give them credit  This is what I get rid of geniuses

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, there still will be a market for geniuses  People will still have issues and bring it to the but this is what a good solid  FTC that means business can do just the threat of that has been is push them to make this and that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's also let's give lots of credit to  Right to repair campaigners like Kyle Wien said I fix it and others who for a long time really pushed for this  To the media which has been very critical of Apple's  unrepairable devices I think this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Amazing this is a good correct step, but if this phone is ridiculously difficult to repair

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What's the point of having all of these if it's not engineered for a parent right exactly then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've made the battery

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no in the most recent it's pretty easy to replace the battery. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so I think they're making and this is all part of us. I think  Okay, FTC the EU France actually passed a law  Requiring this so I know that nobody cares what France does necessarily but good  And it's a sustainability thing like people are getting their consumers and customers are looking at that they're like  Toxic metals yeah, so I think that's really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hey kids, I'm old enough to remember when you could take out your battery in your phone carry around six. Yeah, me too

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I repaired the battery. Thanks to I fix it. I repaired the battery in my phone  I'm in my up pixel 4xl. So and you can do it  Apple often has special tools in the Apple stores for these kinds of repairs, but I suspect this is a first step  Maybe they'll be more repairable next year. Thank you Apple  I you know we we've been hating on them for a while for not doing this  And I think it's a really good thing that they are and I'd like to see Google follow suit  And usually when Apple does something even if it's something as dumb as taking away the headphone jack other companies follow suit

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  so let's let's not just not just Google but Samsung and and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Motorola and other companies. Yeah was when your decision to buy the pixel go was it influenced by this story Google?  Allegedly won't release a new pixel book next year. I know I was doing my my beloved pixel book

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, I loved it so much  It's it's the best machine, but it was with battery 98 percent ten minutes left

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I knew it was doing the keyboard was starting this is again the argument for right to repair this although the other problem  And I love I still I also have this very nice  Last pixel book it's a great device. Oh, it's a great  Only other problem with it is that a Google didn't guarantee continued updates  I think they were now they've changed their tune on pixels on the phones  So I'm hoping that they will do the same for Chrome effect. I think they did do the same for Chrome. Yeah, why not yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I have a Chromebook. I have another Chromebook. That's that's out of  The prior one you still use it  In the office yeah, it's my back. I don't see any reason not to to machine. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, let's take a little break  Everybody's got all the spleen all the bile out you feel better  Lots more splenum bile to come oh yeah, I wasn't particularly billy s I felt

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I thought in the Jeff off here. I think Jeff still won frankly. Yeah, yeah, I have a hard time being that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to really piss me off oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, and there's no reason to be mad at the pixel. It's just not for you. It's not for her

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a it's a completely appropriate to return. She's highly your baby. Is it ugly this pixel is lovely. It's just not for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it's not it. It's me. It's not your fault. It's mine that we're breaking up

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by  Nirva we're all getting back to work, but you still want to practice social distancing you still want to be  Sensible in the office. Do you have a huddle room a big one? Do you need some audio?  There's a couple of choices of course you go to a pro AV company  And they they will come in for the mid-size and large rooms. They'll come in with multiple components mics speakers  They'll put them in the ceiling. They'll spread them across the table  lots of cables  You're gonna have to have technicians not only to figure out what you need but to install it and then yeah even calibrate the system  forever  Installation could take days tens of thousands of dollars per room for purchase and installation  Yeah, you probably get a good result, but then you got all of those microphones. You got a clean after every meeting  It's just a nightmare  Nereva is the right solution  It simplifies almost every aspect of audio conferencing, so let's say instead of going with a pro AV solution you went to Nereva  Exceptional audio for rooms up to 25 by 25 feet  That's with a single integrated microphone and speaker bar if it's 30 to 50 feet if it's a bigger room get two bars  You can install them yourself. It's just like installing a sound bar 30 minutes two screws one cable. That's it  It's an easy DIY project and it costs a small fraction of pro AV systems  And I gotta say Nereva is brilliant this microphone coverage. You might say well, where's the microphones there? They're in the device  Using Nereva's patented microphone mist technology, which gives you using computational audio  True full room coverage. Everyone's heard no matter where they move in the room  They can even face away from the microphone and it's continuously calibrating  No expert has to come in and do it. In fact, you can control the whole thing from your Nereva console  So if you have multiple rooms a fleet of systems easy, you can monitor manage adjust and scale you won't need any training  It's it's so easy to use  it's just a great solution and  And only Nereva can do it because of their patented microphone mist technology  I want you to check out Nereva N u are  Eva.com it's the solution for these midsize and large meeting and learning spaces and  It's a so much better solution than the probe AV solution  Nereva is changing  The world of audio in meeting rooms by simplifying almost every aspect  Nereva go to Nereva comm slash to it to learn more  It's it's a great solution  N u are EVA Nereva comm slash tweet we thank them so much for their support of this week in Google  I'm as you know, I kind of a audio fiend and Nereva is pretty darn amazing. What they're doing is incredible. Thank you Nereva  Did you see I actually meant to talk about this on  Sunday we had Paris Marno who works for Jessica lesson at the information  We just didn't get around to it, but I thought this was very interesting Jessica lessons husband Sam was at Facebook  He was a Facebook vice president  He had his own startups a couple of them. I got to know him then because I was a big fan of his startup  He is now a VC Sam lesson

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  His father's footsteps. I was a friend of his father. Oh, I do who is his father

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Robert lesson was a major investor banker investor. I did not know that I did not know that  Sam was just a sweetheart. I always thought Sam was smart and really nice  He has his own  investment  VC firm  slow  Ventures and instead of investing in startups and in companies they've decided to start investing in  Creators  They've they've they've joined a few individual investors spending 1.7  Million dollars for a 31 year old YouTube personality Marina  Mogilco they didn't buy her  No, they invested in her they gave her 1.7 million in return for actually I think a small  You know a chunk a 30 year employment contract or not contract but a 30 year investment deal  5% of her creator reading related earnings  What she makes over a certain amount over a certain amount plus a percentage from any IP she develops  So it could be even longer she she said Marina said if I write a book record deal it's like a record  Yeah, it's a long deal  What do you think investing in people in  instead of in

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Products or companies I thought that's what all great employers to do from the get-go. It's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They always say we're investing in the team not the yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I think it's like scholarships in a way  And maybe we should look at it that way  Where maybe you should pay back your scholarships only when you start making money and maybe you pay a little higher rate if you make  A lot of money or something like that  So it's interesting. It's also interesting to say  This is a way to support a creator  Which I like the problem is the underlying ways in which the creator actually makes the money to pay it back  Hasn't been revolutionized. No, so you revolutionized one part of it where you can invest and and give some money up front  And I think that could be interesting  But I'd really like to see more innovation in how that creator in turn gets revenue for those 30 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the same type of tactic for people to write books

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's not at all no they get an advance for a specific book  It's a dance against royalties and you it's the other way around really instead of you giving them 5%  They give you five or less. Yeah per book. It's not a lot of money  So this is this is different as you said Jeff they Sam lessen told vice that  They don't get any money unless she's making in the range of hundreds of thousands of dollars  You know she takes that off the top  Adding the number will adjust with inflation as well  If she decides to become a lawyer or just gives up YouTube she she keeps the 1.7 million  If she gets a Netflix deal or a job with the YouTube  Related to the creator economy. She has to give them 5% 5 is of course much less than an agent would get but they're not making  They I don't know how much they're helping her get the deals. That's another question. What do they hate?  What do they do for this money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, is it basically go Jeff. Oh you go you go  Well, I was just gonna say is this just a loan but no one else knows this so you're doing well

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess it's well in the sense that you have to pay it back

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I think that's the right question Stacey because because unless she's investing this in some way  Why do you invest in? Why does the company take investment at all so they can grow faster than they would otherwise?  Yeah, but what does the money do for her that lets her do more than she otherwise would do?  Maybe maybe it means she can hire  You know a staff

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Offer I don't know her be more efficient as a creator and just cut down a little bit of angst and stress  From being a creators where they can actually focus. Yeah, I mean doing the job the genius award

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and you and you could focus on riskier stuff in the hopes that it pays off  You know in the future because you don't have to pay your bills today out of your creator funds, right?  So you can do longer slower projects. I mean giving people  Runway is always good for those people, right? I mean provided they  They do something about it. They're focused, right?  Yeah, I'm like if you gave me runway and I just spent it on chips and read books the whole time  Maybe that's not great. But you know if I built something

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah  And actually Sam made the same point you made and he said even if you invest in startups, you're investing in the people  This is just making that explicit  It's interesting I mean that I think you are seeing something very different in the media scene  This is one way that the internet and YouTube have changed that in tik-tok and others have changed that which is  You know when I in mainstream media when I was working in mainstream media  The last thing any company wanted to do is to promote a star because it meant that was going to cost them a lot of money  They wanted to lose them  Then you'd lose them so they they wanted you to be a star but they  mixed feelings about the whole thing and  and in any event NBC saw its  Operations as more than any individual, right?  So, you know, maybe Tom Brokaw was a star but it was really a bunch of people and there was certainly stars star maker salaries  Even more than she's getting  Being handed out lots more than she's getting being handed out. But now you're investing  But in that case you were the company that providing the infrastructure doing, you know doing the backbone kind of like twit is  Mm-hmm. And now it's just you're saying, you know  Go ahead do whatever you do  This is your  YouTube too in a way they're letting YouTube do all that stuff that normally NBC would have done

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What if Sam came to Hank and said Hank? Here's a million and a half  Hey, I own five percent of you for the next 30 years. I don't know, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hank we're talking about my son who has a fairly successful  TikTok channel has has already been approached by investors  so there there are definitely people out there who want to throw money at him and say  But nothing quite so explicit as this all on five percent of you. Mm-hmm five percent

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's kind of returns as he's what kind of returns is he promising? I mean look at look at that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He hasn't done any deals yet  He's he signed a management deal with a company that does this and but mostly what they do is they get him ads  They get him revenue. So but he but there be people  Big name people have come to him and said we'd like to put money into you in  in some way

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  For what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well  In the I don't know all of the deals this guy's my kid is like going like crazy. I don't know  I  Get the one of them was a product tie-in  So we'll in we'll we want to invest in a product that you're gonna do  He's gonna start selling salt salt. Yeah, and that's an investable thing. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I said no don't let them invest here  I want to buy him so I  Mother and I have invested in him  That's a little friendlier investment to you know, yeah, so I  Think this I'm dead. That's why I bring this up not so much about Hank  But just in general this this is a new one makes it real about it makes it real  Yes, a new way of thinking about it. So so if Hank is a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let me let me put it this way then if Hank suddenly had a big lump of money  Right. He could hire publicists to get his name way out there and he could he could  You know to get him on the Today Show and do all that stuff and pump him  He could hire a production team to make more things across more platforms, I'm just trying I'm just brainstorming here  Yeah, he could  What else could he well he could he could then make more products than the salts, right?  He could he could come yeah, but that's what's so weird because again, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If NBC comes to me and says we're gonna pay you a point point seven million dollars a year to anchor the nightly news  They do everything  Except I do the host. I  This is kind of the other way around you know, you do everything we're gonna give you money you do whatever you want with that  We're just gonna take whatever happens. That's a weird leap of faith and kind of a strange

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, okay. Hold on. So think about it from the venture world. It's where you will have for every huge home run. You're gonna have  Five of yours utterly fail, right and then a couple make even and then one or two do like triple 5x  Maybe so if you think about investing in a this creator, you've got a creator  You're gonna take 5% of them. Let's say she creates her own empire worth, you know, I don't know  I'm trying to think of what's a really like 500 million. Well, that's kind of what they're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Lesson said and this is the vice article  Slow ventures is close to finishing up the paperwork with more people that will be investing in listen to this  Hoping one of them becomes the next Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk or Kim Kardashian

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now very different things. Yeah, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like Reese Reese Witherspoon  2012 I think it was she started her own production company and now it's worth like  900 million  So if you funded Reese

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Back in the day, but the way you would find 45 million now is you would make a deal to fund the production company  These are just like I believe in you as a person

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Whatever you're gonna do, but if you invest that to start a company you make it a piece of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, she's gonna create a company around her stuff  Do they I mean if they're giving me money are they giving are they doing the deal with Stacey Higginbotham?  Yes, with SKP Labs LLC

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, well, so that would be the latter be more traditional  I think about Spotify  Giving the who's your daddy host?  Twenty million dollars a year for three years. That's a more traditional thing. We're paying you twenty million dollars  You're gonna work for us and make a podcast for us, right?  And then we're gonna get the benefit of that  That would be that kind of investment into into your production company  This sounds more like if they had just said here's a million bucks go do something and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  More than one thing then so then you're not you're not tied to that one product. So Stacey  Investing in Stacey, right?  So you could decide somebody could invest in your media property today, right?  and then you owe them back and you have appropriate of that, but you could decide I want to start the Stacey late switch company and  In the Sam lesson deal Sam would get a piece of that because it's related to IOT  And you're freer to start more ventures

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if she's now if she does a job like if if she's like, you know what this YouTube things not working out  I'm gonna go work for apparently they don't get my they don't get that they don't get that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if you have a real job, yeah, I'm sure the contract is more specific  But it's the implicate what they've said is she could quit become a lawyer. They wouldn't get any of that  It's like her whatever she does as a creator  I'm sure that I would hope the contract would say you too. You're gonna keep doing I don't know  You know normally you'd say and for that we expect you to do YouTube for five years  All right, there's some I mean, but I don't sound like it though. It sounds like more like they're buying you  They're buying a percentage of you. I like I don't know. I would be feel weird saying I'd like to buy 5% of antpruitt  Yeah, that would be we don't know what the contract says

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We only know that they're trying to market to creators to tell them that this is a good deal  So maybe maybe it is more concrete. Yeah, I think about

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  again from the IT perspective like a CIO saying, you know what we really need to ramp things up and  Goes out and looks for like an infrastructure  manager or what-have-you to help really tighten things up between all of the different properties and  They hired as infrastructure manager and infrastructure manager says I I'm gonna get this done  But I need you to just sign the checks every every month so I can just  Make it happen regardless of the cost and a lot of the big tech companies. They're doing that  They just sign the checks because they need everything to run on time and no downtime and all of that good stuff  So they're they're invested in the vision of the people that they hire and they just continue to write the checks  It sounds similar to me, but maybe that's still a little old-school thinking but there's usually

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know you're working for me. Mm-hmm. I  Don't think that it sounds more open-ended than this, but I don't know  Lesson says he he thinks he stumbled into the solution  One of society's longest-standing and most burdensome issues debt  He says so messed up the young people have all the equity value because they're the ones that are gonna do the work  Provide for the future. Oh boy, they have the future potential, but they don't have any of the cash. So so redo scholarships, please

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes  It's close to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The idea that you know you can invest in a college student and they'll go on and do things and gives back some other  This gets into basically what is glorified indentured servitude. Yes, that's what that's kind of my feeling

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But Sam says no, no, no, no, no, it's the opposite of that or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  patronage is it is it is it  DaVinci and patronage

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not patronage because they're taking five percent right percent  I mean the Medici's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's still it's still an investment even if it's a 30-year payout  he says Sam says I'd rather was permanent because  That's it 30 years is too short a term. He gives us an example  You know, what if we done this with Jeff Bezos and then he made sure that he he never made any money  He just borrows forever. So there's never a return because there's never returned  You still don't get paid he says that's the only thing you have to avoid is an investor  So he says I wish she starts I would rather the deals be forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If she starts her own company that becomes part of

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like if she becomes a lawyer and creates her own no, I suspect well, I don't know we don't be related  I think it's related to being a creator  She actually already has YouTube videos language learning companies she has a  Four hundred seventy five dollar course she offers on how to start a YouTube channel  So she's already monetizing. I would guess that there's  We don't know the contract but there's verbiage that kind of says in this area. Hmm  You know if you do anything in this area, we take five percent. It says this head specifically  but not if she quit YouTube or became a lawyer, so  It's a little it's a very interesting deal and maybe we should get Sam on and ask him  Oh, that'd be great. Yeah, really great to justify it. He's been on Twitter. Mr. Howe  Yeah  It's just a strange I  Don't know if I I don't know if I like it or not  I you know, I don't if if my son came to me and said hey, I've got this offer. I  Would say no, I would say no  I would say no

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would say don't do it because of the 30-year term or I'd say well, you doesn't need money. Well, he doesn't need money

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But he gave me that much money. He could grow he could grow the business faster Sam. Yeah  Yeah, it's money, but I think it's better to agree just  Psychologically just realize it's always over your head. You always owe somebody five percent of everything you do. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah  And and and I feel like it'd be better bootstrapping than than taking that money and then owing somebody  Some unknown unknown amount of money. You're not  There's no cap on it. It's not like once you've paid back 1.7. There's no cap  You could give them billions if you made that much money. So angel investing is a better idea  Yeah, I mean if somebody said I want to invest in a company that you're gonna start Hank and we'll share the equity out of that  That's sensible. It has a fence around it has a fence around and space

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  The idea of scholarships imagine if a scholarship fund were set up  Such that if you come out of school and you and you work in social justice as my daughter will and you never make a lot  of money  You probably don't pay much back, but you come out of school and you become a lawyer and you make a fortune  You pay a higher proportion back. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Higher interest rate, pardon me, but those are loans, right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, that's what we do now with with with with student loans and the poor students  Take I work. Thank God. I work at a state school  So we you know, we cost a lot less but as expensive live in New York our students leave with that, right?  And then they go out into a field where they're not gonna make a lot of money at first because that's the way it works  You know, you pay your dues, etc, right?  and and and so that the debt we leave students with is awful if we instead said  We're gonna invent we're investing in your future. Indeed  You're gonna have to report your income  You know figure out how that works too when you go you get off the clock  but let's just imagine you will and and and properly and if you make this much money you pay back this plus this much of  The loan have a sliding scale money will you don't pay back?  Yeah, based on the success that you get from your degree and now the problem with that is then you'd only give  loans scholarships to you know law students  So the university would have to have some role in here to say no, no, no, we want a rounded  Student body but there's something in here in what Sam has done. They've talked to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Education they've talked about doing this for it kind of like what AmeriCorps does right now  Which is it's it's not quite that way because AmeriCorps takes things like if you were a public teacher or social worker  You get a delay in paying some of your student loans and I believe some of them  are forgiven  It's it's a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like the Peace Corps. Yeah, but it's it's a program for kids coming out of college

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're working in America work in somewhere in America in a job that's necessary AmeriCorps actually funds journalists. It's a great idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love it. I'd love to see the Peace Corps come back. I'd let well, it's not gone anywhere  It's still there, but I'd love to see it be worth it. Yeah, but I'd like to see it be cut part of like I mean, I  Know  Three public service kid gets out of college and always two years to the guy to know  No, you don't like that idea. I love that idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Did you go into the army no

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I would have gone into the Peace Corps if I'd had to look no one's gonna do it unless it's compulsory  Not no one most people are not gonna do it unless it's compulsory if everybody Facebook you fool  Yes, that's my plan my evil plan to get rid of Facebook, let's take a break and then we're going to Iceland  Speaking of Facebook. We're going to the new metaverse  Wait till you see our Christmas card, by the way, I can't wait till you see our Christmas card  I'm not gonna wait our show today brought to you by red hats podcast command line heroes. I have been a fan of this  I can't believe it. They're in season eight  They do such a great job and I want to give a lot of credit  To the folks not only a red hat but to sir on your bar. I could does it the host it is all about  the stuff we love  the epic true tales of developers programmers hackers geeks and  Open-source rebels who are revolutionizing the technology landscape. It's a great way to both get a little history and  To hear the current trends you I think should listen to all eight  Seasons, but the new season eight is really a kind of a departure a little bit  They're gonna tackle one question from every angle. What is a robot season eight is all about robots  And so each episode kind of looks at robots from a different a different angle  Different way is a robot a servant. That's that's first the first episode of the season a factory worker  How about a prosthetic device a vehicle? Why do we make robots that look like us?  Can you trust robots or maybe we should be asking can robots trust us?  Science-fiction is all about robots, but actually that science fiction is here. There are robots already  serving our needs  Will they develop a mind of their own will they turn against us will they be the savior of our humanity or will they be our?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a open source project called paperless and an update of it at paperless dash ng  which is  Software that's designed to go with any kind of document scanner and the idea is just scan everything you you can you know  All the pieces of paper scan it to a server that you control control  Many printers will scan to FTP or Google Drive or whatever and then you can run this software on it  It will OCR it turn it in

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The post office with your incoming mail  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah  They do and then and then you now have you can use search to find whatever you want now you have a whole database  You have all those documents and if you need to you can just print it out and most people won't care that you  Took it scanned it destroy the original and printed it out. So I'm kind of  Way to go paperless. Yeah, get rid of it. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Went to the Columbia University rare book and manuscript library

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Two days ago because I love those like but we had binoculars Yale and I love rare book libraries

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Aren't they great? There's a couple books. I could only get there. There's one about the  The  death of  The last type foundry company Yale has a Gutenberg Bible

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I used to go and look at little knowing that someday I would meet mr. Gutenberg himself. Exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I used vflat. I'm gonna join you I used vflat  Which is a wonderful app that it's like my scan my wonderful Caesar scanner, which I love do you have a seizure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's so funny. We were talking about it to you this weekend  I had forgotten something else when he said vflat so Caesar is the coolest thing ever  Do you bring it to the library? I have to know you can't but I bring home and then the Caesar I could use  Library should allow you to bring a Caesar and it looks like a desk lamp

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It really does. It's it's minor, but you're you're in this it's the greatest and that's that's the that's the there's there's some that are  simpler and cheaper than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I this is 500 bucks. I mean that's less than a phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Much cheaper, it was much cheaper than that. If you go to the Caesar like a hundred hundred fifty or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just like the idea that this sits there like a desk lamp. It's got built-in lights  It senses the page turn so you can go a page every one and a half seconds. Hmm  So you just turn the whole book as it flattens it out and turns it into this and it does OCR

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, I think this is so cool. There are books  I can only get from the New York Public Library that are really expensive 250 $300  Academic books that I needed for my Gutenberg research and and so the Caesar is a godsend  so v-flat does the same flattening to the page and everything all from the phone and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it flattens the page. So can you take out your phone at these libraries and take oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They like they encourage you to they say don't spend too much time here  Because I got they reopened the library in November. We're in November now. So just now from pandemic. Sorry  Why don't we got in the first day?  Why are they saying don't spend so much time there because they want to get more people in to see more things  So they have a limited number of desks and limited number of documents  and so I signed up for an hour or two hours and  I found out that they're sold out through the end of the year  I was lucky to get in and so I just take picture to picture to picture with v-flat and then mark it all and it  Makes a PDF for the whole thing  send it to myself and  Print it out and I come home and it was beautiful

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, so you're right. Here's the the Kickstarter  This was 89 89 bucks Caesar Caesar CZ you are calm

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They are great the shine ultra I have yeah  I've actually got two of them is that one of one for my office so I could go to the NYPL get a book over  the office

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And and scan them there so but you can take a picture with this v-flat software  And I guess with a good pixel six phone even though your poor wrist  so  You could get a pretty good picture and then  Flat on the phone is it flown software is it yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's great. We have v-flat scan

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely love it so Caesar I recommend highly highly highly if you're gonna do it sounds like with v-flat  You don't really need it  No, because if you want to do a hundred pages, you don't want to hold your cuz your wrist  The Caesar is so smart as you say it knows when you turn the page  Yeah, it also has a foot pedal if you want that. Oh, wow, just stop my foot  That would be awesome  And if you want to stand over it the Caesar has a little a little TV screen on the top  That's so cool, but you can also go on the big screen  It's it's the only thing that Caesar should be is it should come with a memory card  So you don't need a laptop and I can't use it. I can only use it with the Mac  You gave me for the show. I can't use it with my Chromebook. Oh, that's an only problem with it  but thank you for the Mac I do think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Library should just let you scan the dang thing. I guess they  They may feel like that violates their agreement with the publishers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  upset

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, if that's very good  You know what you don't want to get you be glad how do you like your pixel buds?  Did you send those back you still in? Well, here's the other thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, because of Jason Howell I bought a pair which I actually they're fine  Occasionally they'll cut out a little bit I put my front pocket my back pocket because apparently I have ass  Steel that keeps the signal from going through whatever fine. At least they work most time. So then I buy the phone and  I end up getting a second pair  I figure freebie whatever right the freebie, but then when I returned the phone, of course  It was returned and said oh it's too late to return the pixel buds because they came earlier than your phone  Yeah, I'm not gonna probably not gonna return the phone now  But yes, as you mentioned it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, just be glad you didn't get the Samsung Galaxy buds Pro  there's a quite an extensive piece in Android Central Chris Weedle writing and a lot of people confirming and  Samsung even kind of by the back door confirming they're causing ear infections. Oh my lord. We're not sure why  Perhaps it's the nickel in the context. We know nickel can cause problems  Perhaps it's this new material the new plastic they're using acrylate  but there's something about these and  This guy this poor guy never had an ear infection his life. He I don't know. I never heard of this  He says I always but now get any earbuds. I clean them out of the box. I've never done never done that  Just stick them right in here  He says properly cleaning headphones earphones out of the box or after use can help you prevent residual germs another foreign matter from  Manufacturing getting in your ear. So he was a little bit more careful than we are clearly  He wore them for  15 20 minutes then same evening. My ears were a little itchy. That's all he got. Wait a minute  Yeah, 50 ear infection. He took him out went away, you know after treatment. He actually went to the doctor eventually  Try said maybe is it the ear buds? Let me just put it in one ear do some phone calls got it the infection in one ear  Now if you're at all squeamish  Close your eyes because I'm gonna show what his ears look like  This is before and this is after they were so okay. They were so  Swollen the ear doctor had to wait to look into his ear. It's over Jeff. You can look  And many others are starting to report this  So a Samsung may have an issue  Okay, if I know that nickel causes infections, but those are on the contacts, you know, that's just little

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know nickel is an allergic  Durotitis issue for like 5% of the population, right? I don't know. So would I even go that route?  Well, cuz it's cheap available and it's it's a common thing. So what they do now mostly is just tell people

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, this is just this it's just this little you know  So anyway, I I don't know. I just thought I'd mention this  You know, and I'm sure there are many many people using these I love the the old galaxy buds they were great  In fact, I was considering getting the probe but now I might wait and see what it's Samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I got an infection because because I was going out and they constantly in the in the pandemic  Yeah, and doing calls and stuff. So I finally stopped using wearing it too long. Yeah, this is the show  Otherwise, I use the computer speaker

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It reminds me of the Steve Martin movie the jerk when he invented the glasses  That made it very easy to put your glasses on take off  But what he didn't realize it was gonna make people cross-eyed because they'd be staring at them  I feel like we just all kind of said yeah put the headphones in your ear. What could possibly go wrong?  Let's just all stick our headphones in our ear. You know, maybe that wasn't such a good idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I wonder if I've actually had  Some sort of infection because just recently my left ear was having some issues  There you go, there you go because I wear these earbuds a lot throughout the day  Just listening to podcasts and books and whatnot.

Transcript:  Quentin Tarantino handwritten script for pulp fiction  He is gonna auction it off as an NFT  The NFT is pitched as secret means its contents will be viewable exclusively by the owner  You will get excerpts from Tarantino's original handwritten script for the film accompanied by commentary  Miramax company that made the film said whoa, hold on there  Tuesday they filed a copyright infringement  They want their cut  Well and Tarantino's lawyer said Miramax is wrong plain and simple  He has the right to sell NFTs of his handwritten script for pulp fiction  And this ham-fisted attempt to prevent him from doing so will fail  So apparently it's in his contract. I don't know that he can do that. That seems like a pretty tight line to walk. Yeah  Miramax attorney accused Tarantino's team of a deliberate premeditated short-term money grab  Oh God  I  Would buy I actually would buy that NFT, but I'm sure it'll be way out of my price range  I think that's a really cool NFT  Anyway, the suit is on the Central District of California  Shall we do a Google change log here already?

I didn't notice any change in the scanner's performance  Apparently now I'm not alone. I'll be very curious  You know, it could be just you know, Deeter bone said it's not so much faster or more accurate  But even best case is still slower than an s20  So yeah  There you go, there you go it will start rolling out today will continue over the next week and you got it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So is it just spin if it's not any faster or more accurate? It's just what you're taught from Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, how could you fix it in software if it's slow?  Well, maybe there is some software that takes some time or maybe they've improved it. I don't know. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm assuming it's like memory allocation or something to make it faster. Who knows who knows who knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They could have changed like the encryption scheme didn't they say there was some sort of encryption issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They said they implied that it was slowing down for security reasons. What would be more accurate or something?  Anyway, we'll see and let us know and if you've applied it.

Is to create structure and Jack came back in and said exactly  on Twitter  You get engagement from the boss and the boss the boss  Because this idea that this what I said was the speech layer becomes the commodity layer and the and the value add becomes where you  Do things so I wonder about the Twitter API eyes distributed futures said the verge  I'm not sure what's really that different  But but if they're going back to it'd be interesting to see Twitter returning to a strong API  What people could build on top of it? That's at the beginning the blue sky in essence

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You did miss a big important I think if I may be so bold in this non-democracy Oh dictator  important careful now  Tell me the first one  Because one of the things that drives some of us nuts about Twitter is you go you read a tweet then you go off  To do what it was which is to read the article then you come back and then it moves all the tweets  Oh, I yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have mixed feelings that I want you to explain this to me because on the one hand usually the tweet deck  I'll turn on the feature where it's a auto scrolling so I kind of I like it's like a ticker

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But you is that what this is this on the Twitter app itself and on the web  It would it would just suddenly refresh. Yeah, and you're in the middle read something. Oh, I don't like that  So now you have to which I've wanted for ages. Thank you, Jack  I wanted to explicitly say now refresh the top. So now it says  You know lots of new tweets above you want to you know, go there. Yes, click there pull me go up in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Time it's annoying. Maybe it does it on my phone, but not on the web or vice versa kind of a bug

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, what are you doing reading the articles Jeff I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Put that one in there  By the way, I thought a little trick Twitter  My very my if you notice the things in the rundown that have a space in front of them  Is because if you do that and then you  Cut and paste the headline in it'll pick up the style of the spreadsheet  I used to spend all this time trying to change the font  Really do that if you just put the space in first or anything in first type in first and then  Paste the headline in it fits in the format has changed my Twitter  Thank you, yeah, very nice for a rundowns and nobody else the world could possibly care about this but  I  Run down world.

Transcript:  Substack says it has this is actually surprising more than 1 million paid  Subscriptions this was also part of the revolution Twitter bought a newsletter company review  Review jazz. I think a lot of people are thinking that the next thing big thing is newsletters  Which I find difficult to understand. I agree. There's too many already. Yeah  But 1 million paid subscribers and it's they tend to be like five bucks, right top 10 writers on sub stack  Collectively generate 20 million dollars in annual revenue. Wow, that's up from last year seven million dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great. Yeah. Yeah  So so that's not all so the sub stacks taking part of that or is that the revenue generated for substance? Oh, that's good question

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's gross. I bet that's gross and sub stack takes some portion of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How much does sub stack take not very much right here or 15? I think it's 10. It's not a huge amount  It's a small amount, which is good  Meanwhile big media strikes back at sub stack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it's only a hundred and sixty two million, right?  So that's why I'm like how long will this last cuz they fart 162 million. Oh, oh wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is more complicated  There's an options agreement if Tesla's share price was at or above the strike price of five hundred sixty dollars on the day the warrants  Expired June and July 2021. It would OJP Morgan the difference between the share price on that date in five hundred sixty dollars  So the stock was worth more than six hundred dollars by June  So it would have been that forty dollar difference per share share but in addition they want 162 million dollars  Oh in addition in addition in addition because of  Elon's parents parents tweet that he might take Tesla private at 420 get it. Mm-hmm for 20 a share

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

They say is an exercise in awful  So, yeah, so, you know, it just I always like drawing attention to this because I think it's they evaluate both privacy  But they also evaluate basic security

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm gonna and I didn't realize this but the woman who does it Jen who does this?  She's a gadget head. We spent like forever talking about robots and the gadgets she uses in like so this is not just by  You can kind of tell like the person who did this is not just like  She evaluates things based on what they offer like hey if you give up a lot of data  What do you get in return?  so I thought that was actually kind of nice because a lot of times you get these things written by people who are like I  Will not share my data with anyone  Yeah, and yeah, they're just not realistic. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, this is good to know and and you know  Maybe you want to put your peloton in a sealed room

Transcript:  Foundation at Mozilla org actually if you just Google as I did Mozilla privacy not included you will find the guide

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good idea. Thank you. See does it put links in

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because she's all about privacy it hurt her wrist

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give her a break. Yes, my wrists are too floppy for putting in links

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It just it just wouldn't work now. I know why you type the way you do all the weight

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like a seal actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Punishes a keyboard  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wherever the fingers fall, you know, that's what I'll type that's it  Jeff number of the week my friend. I am so thrilled about this one. I am so happy about this one  I get to head to a gadget and a little bit of history too. Oh  the Logitech pop keys  keyboard has  programmable emoji keys  And you can pop them off. I guess you can pop them off and put on different emojis

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I hate that keyboard so much. It's really ugly. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those particular Logitech keyboards I freaking hate them they're so uncomfortable to type on but okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I know but this is still a great idea and what it says is now because my heart

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh look, it's kind of instead of the remember on the old IBM PCs. They had a function key row on the right  Now you've got an emoji key row

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's emojis. Yeah  That's awesome so what it says too is that emojis are a new alphabet, yeah the whole entire totally greater  Yeah, Gutenberg age  Right was all about the alphabet that we had and and everything that worked toward the book that I that I went to Columbia  To read was about the the last type founder in America that made alphabets and then came postscript  right which just may turn sludders into shapes and  Everything was kind of the same and then come emojis and memes which become new alphabets new structures for expressions  And so now they become they get  Honor next to the alphabet. I love this. It's also interesting that this which is the most industrial era

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Device for data entry has become now a fashion item. I  Also wonder if five emoji keys is enough. I really know this is a first step. I need more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need like the the numeric keypad. Hey Jeff  I was gonna tell you about this because I'm reading it now and it's pretty good and  This feels like something you might be interested in and it's called the writing of the gods the race to decode the Rosetta stone  Yeah, it's really good it's  Surprisingly interesting. I I don't want to give too much away  But it's it's about the race to figure out what it meant and decode it and it's really well-written  It's really engaging and you can see the Rosetta stone in the British Museum

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and it's really amazing because it unlocked these ancient languages because I can't remember what it was Sumerian and hieroglyphics and  I can't remember but I think was three or four languages the same thing in each language and knowing one you could  We were able to uncode

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Deciphering yeah, there's a lot of it  I mean there's a lot like I think of you Jeff with like Gutenberg on like there's just the subject of writing  Like and what it means to people in how it develops and what jobs it needs to perform for different people  I just thought it was really  I appreciate the recommendation  Yeah, and it's kind of like a detective. I love that kind of book actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I do too. Yeah, there you go. The other thing about about about so the typewriter, right?  Is what really brought the keyboard into our consciousness for writing and people at first didn't trust type documents because anybody could forge it  You don't know I recognize your handwriting. I don't know what this this thing is. You kind of make it up  It's the same as early printing people were distrustful at first because that's the reflex just like Leo and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so I want to name like Princess Floppy Wrists  I need a sober cave

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so so if you want you can have that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's different connotations it would be more insulting. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The anyway the type the type so the typewriter you think about it. I just read this recently  I can't remember who said it but the typewriter was the final nail in the coffin of the scribe  Interesting scribes kept working until the typewriter came along and then all bureaucracy switched to typewritten page

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They could do it themselves and that's the end of that except in the medical practice because doctors still have scribes

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Though now they dictate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some of them still do have them though, but you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They mostly dictate but want to go to a more modern doctor states

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When you go to the doctor, there's somebody sitting there writing down what the doctor says

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not most doctors, but my okay. Well that was 15 years ago my OB OB. That's cute

You grab them wildlife  So I wanted to give a shout out to David Lee on  Instagram and then I also wanted to shout out lens rentals as lens rentals has helped me with the show a couple times  And I got an email from them since I've been using them for years  They now have a keeper program to where you can rent your stuff rent some stuff from them  but if you decide to keep it they got in simple and easy way to buy it from them with a  Discounted rate and I think that's pretty dank. I'm good considering  Photography gear can be quite expensive and at least you can try it out before you decide. Hey  Yeah, I want to buy it. So shout out to them  next  I just wanted to say good luck to the squad the high school football team. They're going into round two  They want playoffs.
