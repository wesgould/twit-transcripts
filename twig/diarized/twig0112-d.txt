Because we've got two of the best commentators in the  business to talk about all of this stuff.  To my left, Gina Tripani of SmarterWear.org, founder of  Lifehacker and programmer for ThinkUpApp.com.  Hi, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi.  How's it going?  Great.  Good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Glee fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My favorite time of the week, Twig is.  Twig.  Right after Glee.  Tuesday night.  Well, it's not airing right now, so it's  Twig right now.  We're in between.  We're in between shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're absolutely right.  Soon.  Nothing wrong with reruns.  Also, to my right, Jeff Jarvis, who is a professor of  journalism at the City University of New York, the  author of What Would Google Do?  and a brand new book, which is emerging next week, right?  Public Parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the 27th.  I put the entire introduction up in text.  And watch out audio on Buzz Machine this morning.  Oh, awesome.  Buzz Machine's blog.  A few shout outs to Twig in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, thank you.  BuzzMachine.com, if you'd like to know more.  And I think to read the introduction's probably a good  way to, I always read the introduction to see if I want  to read a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually don't like introductions.  I never read them.  My editor thinks I'm nuts, but I did one in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's nice because it's a table setter.  It's a summary, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm instapapering this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook, my son Jake told me, was my favorite part of  high school.  And then you say, I don't think I had a favorite part of  high school myself.  This is great.  This is really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I cannot wait to read this.  So Gina, I came back last night.  I had a crappy day yesterday.  And I tweeted, crappy day, I need a glee night.  And I watched the New York episode, which I'd never seen.  And the great thing was people asked me on Twitter and all  around, did you start watching this because of Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, as a matter of fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mission accomplished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's the Gleek one, the vector Gleek, the original Gleek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had a few listeners tell me on Google Plus that they  started watching Glee begrudgingly and then got  hooked because of this show.  So I don't know.  They got advertised too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Chipotle.  Absolutely.  We did not do a show with you, Jeff, last week, right?  I can't remember now.  Were we missing Jeff?  No, we had Kevin.  We had everybody.  We had everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kevin, last week it was a year before last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we did talk a little bit about 9-11.  But of course, it was September 8 that you posted 9-11 in the  mirror, your blog post about both you and Gina have in the  past talked a little bit about your experiences because you  were both in New York and had some very direct experiences  from 9-11.  We did not do a big 9-11 thing on Twitter because I figured  everybody and their brother was going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to basically ignore it.  That's wrong to say.  I'm very conscious of the day.  But I was not going to write about it.  I was not going to do any more.  I was just going to say, OK, I'm moving on.  And that morning, on Sunday morning, I was sitting on my  bed and just tweeted, oh, gee, I would be on the train right  now going into the World Trade Center 10 years ago.  And then I did the next one.  And then I ended up doing all day, real time, my  recollections from 9-11.  And I got great reaction.  I got a few people who did not like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a large group on Twitter that don't like it when  you post anything.  They say, shut up.  And it's like, oh, you follow me because I don't post very  often.  Is that it?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So for the first time, I started blocking some people.  And all you're going to do is announce you don't like me.  Then fine.  I'll do you the favor of getting rid of me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Save you some trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But apart from that, it was really kind of amazing  experience.  And what it also threw into me, and there's a Storify there  somewhere, I think.  Oh, is there?  OK.  Because I was just going to go back and go through.  I should put up that link.  But what struck me again was, what if we'd had Twitter that  day?  And Catherine Weymouth, who's the publisher and family  representative of the Washington Post, said that  would be horrible.  It would be awful because it would be so graphic.  Well, that's reality.  Yes, it's not filtered by the journalists.  But my god, what would it be?  Now, the other thing that happened to me was I was rate  limited at one point.  And Andy Carvin was nice enough to get to Katie Stanton.  And they white listed me.  But you think, too, what if in the middle of this event,  people suddenly got rate limited as they're trying to  talk to their families.  They're trying to tell the world what's happening.  Twitter now has a responsibility as a platform.  And Dick Costolo did say in Twitter that that was a legacy  of a rather crude effort to deal with abuse.  And they know that they've got to be more  sophisticated about it.  But it was an interesting.  I didn't mean to do it.  I had no intention of doing it.  I ended up just kind of doing it.  And as always in these situations, I learned stuff.  What a nice idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I liked that.  It was a great series of tweets.  And it's interesting.  That question about whether or not Twitter had been around in  2001, if it had been, you wouldn't be able to retrieve  your tweets from that day.  Because they would have been beyond Twitter's ability to go  back and search.  Twitter's current state, it's not a good archiving tool.  And it's not a good tool for being able to do what you did,  post a long series of messages because of those rate limits.  So sorry, I just had to get in a little bit of a plug for  ThinkUp or for any sort of archiving, any kind of platform  that you own and that you can archive over time.  Your blog posts, I mean, you have all your old posts, right,  Jeff, from when you started your first blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, fortunately, the old design got hacked and I've got  horrible links in them.  And I don't know what to do about that.  I need to hire somebody to go fix it.  But yes, I have them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's interesting.  Twitter really is for things that are kind of fleeting.  At the same time, I watched your tweets all day.  I was feeling sad about the day.  And I decided not to write about it.  I tried to avoid most of the media porn.  But I watched your tweets going by and I was just like,  man, this is incredible.  And so I love that we have these kinds of real time tools  for having these conversations in real time.  But at the same time, I worry about permanence and archiving  and where these things go.  Where are those tweets that you posted this past 9-11  gonna be next 9-11?  I hope that Twitter kind of steps up with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a problem, Gina, in all kinds of ways, right?  In digital media at all.  When I interviewed Elizabeth Eisenstein,  who's the key Gutenberg scholar,  she came to an interesting defense of the book.  She said, floppy disk, I can be around in 500 years  like the Gutenberg Bible is.  That paper has much more permanence  and we do not have that kind of crypt of information.  Dave Weiner talks about how you have  your personal digital legacy.  What if I had been tweeting that day?  What if, God forbid, as I came close to, I'd gotten killed?  What's your legacy that lives on?  How does that live on online?  We're so fleeting in how we think digitally.  And there are some advantages to being fleeting.  Google Plus kind of going away is all right too.  But I actually think that Google Plus being fleeting  may be a factor in fewer, for me, fewer trolls there.  Because it's not worth it to schmutz.  Oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There goes your camera.  Boing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So where is the Storify of this?  If I go to storify.com slash Jeff Jarvis, will I find it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, if you just Google Jeff Jarvis,  Storify 9-11, you'll find it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's quite a few of these, holy cow.  You've used this a lot.  So Storify is a way to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, it wasn't me, it's-  Somebody else did it.  Those are ones I did, somebody else did it for me, yeah.  Yeah, if you Google Jeff Jarvis, Storify 9-11,  you'll find the first one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think, Gina, about, I mean,  look, ThinkUp app is great,  but not everybody can run the server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not a practical solution  for most users, for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so there's no, yeah, but eventually there will be,  I suppose, if you run a server and make it a public server  or something like that.  Is this another way to do it?  This seems like, I mean, so Mary Bjornaby did this.  This is highly manual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She did it by hand.  It's very manual.  It needs to be UI.  Yeah, it doesn't, it's a way to present  a conversation or a narrative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I like about it though,  is it's in chronological order.  I have to read Twitter upside down.  Right, she did that.  Yeah, so she cut and paste.  Yeah, and now this is preserved  beyond Twitter's ability to preserve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I guess you could liken it to,  if we have a conversation on the street  and it affects one of us,  one of us has to take the time to write it down  or store it someplace to remember it.  But a lot of conversations aren't remembered.  I guess Twitter is kind of the same way.  And I think Storefy is a great way  to take a collection of tweets and make them,  can curate them and make them readable.  And I think there are gonna be lots of tools  to do this kind of thing.  But I don't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use a tool, this is weird,  that puts my tweets into my Google Calendar  as a calendar entry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yes, yeah, that's cool.  I've seen that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I presume it stays there  as long as my Google Calendar doesn't wipe them off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's another cloud question, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of interesting.  It's not good for this  because you have hundreds of posts from one day.  But if you don't post to Twitter dozens of times a day.  This is nice because it also has the timestamps  which Twitter has now lost.  They'll just say September 11th.  So you actually sat there all day and did this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was in and out when I got rate limited.  I went out for my run and I came back  and then I filled in what would have happened  in the interim in Google+.  But there were large,  once the South Tower came down and I escaped that,  there were large chunks of time  of just nothing but walking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I find really interesting?  I agree with you on the media porn, Gina.  I thought a lot of the media coverage was self-serving.  There were some moving things.  Seeing Paul Simon sing Sounds of Silence at Ground Zero,  I'm bawling my eyes out.  But in general, a lot of it  just didn't seem like great coverage.  But this, which is a totally new medium  and a new way of, I mean,  who would have ever thought of this?  This is surprisingly powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When Private Parts was on cable,  Howard Stern did a real-time background,  back channel of the things that he remembered  and did at the making of the movie.  Which was a really interesting way to use Twitter.  So if you were watching the movie  while you were watching Twitter,  it became a new channel.  Now, meanwhile, The Guardian.  So that's like a DVD commentary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, through Twitter.  And text on Twitter.  It's a social experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could ask him questions and he'd answer.  And it's social, wow.  The Guardian did something else.  The Guardian created a new Twitter account  and did nothing but act as if it was that day.  And they had to stop it because people were so angry.  Because it's more of the world's problem.  Stuart, a plane crashes, what?  And it wasn't evident that it was past tense.  So it's really interesting that we're, you know,  again, via all these tools,  we're trying to figure out what they can do  and what we can do with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was some amazing uses of Twitter.  There's the diary of a girl from the 19th century  that day by day, the entries in the diary are posted.  There's, of course, the fake Darth Vader and all of that,  which I find quite amusing.  Stuff my dad says, which became a book.  But it's also temporary.  Which is the nature, I guess, of everything now and then.  I mean, that's what goes on.  Gina, I love that you've addressed this in some way.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think,  I've spent a lot of time writing on Twitter  just because it's so easy  and I've had some really good conversations on Twitter  and I've gotten some awesome insight  and interesting information on Twitter  and I just don't want to lose it.  And I don't know,  but yeah, I think that 9-11 especially,  this whole never forget, always remember thing,  I mean, it really made me think about,  I think that forgetting sometimes is good  and having conversations that just sort of dissipate  into the wind, into your memory are good.  But something like this, what Jeff did,  I was like, this is an incredible first person account  happening kind of real time.  This is something that,  I know that Jeff has written about this a lot  in other mediums, but I thought, wow,  I'd love to have this all in one place.  And I think it's great that someone put together this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope I never do this again now.  I mean, I've done it around the time I recorded something.  I've written about it.  I hope that's it for me.  I'm not trying to get away from 9-11,  but just say, okay, it's my litany.  I've done it.  I've lived in the past enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's time.  I mean, it's time.  I think the 10 year really was for me anyway.  It's time to,  and I can't wait, I'm coming to New York next month.  I cannot wait to see Tower One  and those beautiful triangles.  Did you make a reservation for the memorial?  I heard that they're booked through September.  I haven't made the reservation yet,  but we lost a family friend and I wanna see his name.  So I'm gonna have to make a reservation.  It's gonna be mid-October, so we'll see.  I can get in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go look.  Hey, Twitters, let Gina do it first, then you can go.  But you can go to the site,  and I'm seeing it on September 22nd.  That's when I got in.  And they give you every half hour.  There's a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you have to make a reservation  to even approach the memorial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To be inside the memorial, yes.  I came up the path station as I did 10 years ago yesterday,  and it's kind of wacky,  because I write in the Twitter feed  about how I came up that day,  and it was silent,  and it was never silent in the concourse  of World Trade Center, and it was a different sound.  And I came up then yesterday  up to the top of the escalator again,  and suddenly I heard water, which was really weird.  I don't even know why it was there.  It was the memorial, but that was very strange.  It was a whole new sound,  and it affected kind of the mood of everything,  because the memorial is now,  you can't see it, but you hear it around.  It's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, I don't know what to think.  I mean, of course, there's the 9-11 story,  which is powerful and important,  but there's also this new media  and social media story around it.  And Facebook and Twitter, as you say, weren't there.  Would Google Plus have been a better medium than Twitter,  do you think, for recording this, Jeff?  Why did you not use Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it's not chronological in any way.  It breaks the chron.  Because of the comments?  Not so much that.  It's just, I think it's just that.  You could have made it without comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could have turned off comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not that.  It's the lack of chronology,  because it breaks the chron and moves you around.  Oh, because it rearranges it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It wouldn't stay in order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's part of it.  And also, the funny thing is,  I don't know if you find this true, too,  if I just have that little Twitter-like observation  that's too little for Google Plus, don't you feel?  You feel like you gotta write something  or share something or some note on Google Plus.  Like a blog post.  I'm not gonna do a one-line blog post saying,  hey, did you ever, you know,  kind of a Jerry Seinfeld joke.  Did you ever think why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've done Twitter-length posts on Google Plus,  and I agree with you.  You don't see very many of them.  Oh.  I don't know if it's so bad.  Comments have been, you know.  I did a Jerry Seinfeld.  I said, why is it that they,  I was cooking breakfast, the smoke alarm went off.  I said, why is it they always put  a smoke alarm in the kitchen?  And there was actually some good comments  follow up from that.  Like my kids consider it their wake-up.  The smoke alarm goes off, it means breakfast is ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree.  I feel a little more pressure.  I feel pressure to write a little more on Google Plus.  I think that's why I haven't been as active,  because I don't feel like I can,  so I feel like I need to have a really good link  with an image and something clever to say about it.  It feels like a little more pressure  because there's more room.  But at the same time, the feedback is amazing  on Google Plus, and you just get so many comments  and such great conversations going on  that Twitter just can't.  It really is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is where photographers have a great advantage,  because they just post an image.  And that's enough.  That's considered enough, right?  Yep.  And you know, here's one that just says,  breathe, just breathe from Lotus Carroll.  And that's all you have to do.  And then she's got 15 comments, 37 pluses, three shares.  So they have a real advantage.  One picture is worth a thousand words on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I know we'll get to Facebook in a second,  but as interest, what fascinates me about the changes  that Facebook's been doing yesterday, today,  and a few weeks ago, and Twitter, and Google Plus,  is I think we're starting to come to kind of a consensus  of how we look at interaction online, right?  The notions of following of asynchronous.  Now Facebook's gonna be asynchronous too,  which we'll explain in a minute.  The idea of control at the point in time of sharing.  You know, these kinds of things start to,  we're seeing a commonality.  You could argue it's just copycat and theft,  but I don't think so.  I think it's, things are emerging as standards  and ways that we wanna share and use these.  Even so, we use all three of those services differently,  and probably will for a long time.  But there's a commonality in terms of expectations  that I find fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I totally agree.  Different cultures, but same kind of mental models  around actions, whether it's a like, or a favorite,  or a plus one, we all know that that's the way to say,  hey, this is something I like, or way to go to the user.  And even just sharing links, having the title,  and a description, and a thumbnail,  that those look very similar on Facebook and Google Plus.  So, and even Twitter's kind of getting there  with some of the embedded media.  But it's really nice to see commonly understood interface  mechanisms for users across these services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's take a break and come back,  and we will talk about the new Facebook,  but before we take a break, a word from the Winklevoss twins.  Hey, that's a good idea.  What?  Cracking it like that.  Could be huge.  Think someone will steal it?  The Winklevoss twins?  Who do that?  Do it cautiously.  That's one way to capitalize on it.  Who do that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Pfft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We shall return and just, I think that's just great.  Those pistachio nuts ads have been very clever.  Makes me want to eat one.  Let us take a break and talk about a brand new sponsor.  We want to welcome Vast Conference to our program.  It's always nice to have a new sponsor on our Twitch shows,  and Vast Conference is great.  It's a conference call system that's absolutely free.  If you go to vastconference.com,  and use the offer code twig,  you could set it up literally in 60 seconds.  And then once you start having conference calls,  two and a half cents per minute.  You can use a toll free number  for only another three and a half cents a minute.  These are great for audio conference calls.  Let me just show you.  I'm logged into my conference here,  and I'll just show you.  The dashboard's fantastic.  Now you see, I haven't made any calls on this account yet.  This is a new account I created for the show.  I didn't want you to see everything.  But this is how easy it is to do.  You can record the conference calls, which is fantastic.  You can give out a dial in number that's always the same,  makes it very easy to, you know, that's your number.  You can clear connections when you and your participants  call and the connections are very clear.  It's not VoIP based, it's phone based.  And you can have huge conference calls  from up to 300 callers at the same time,  which I think is very cool.  They use fiber optic lines,  high end teleconferencing equipment.  This is not VoIP, this is really good quality phones.  And the management information is just fantastic.  I want you to take a look at it.  Vastconference.com.  They're giving our audience an exclusive deal.  Two free conference calls, up to 300 minutes  to give you a chance to try out the service.  Now each, the minutes are per caller.  So two calls times five callers times 30 minutes  would be 300 minutes, you get it?  Go to vastconference.com, sign up for your free account.  And they'll give you a regular toll number  and an 800 number for people to call.  And you can start calling right now.  Use the promo code TWIG when you sign up  so that you get your 300 minutes free.  Vastconference.com, very nice.  So I'm afraid I'm not following all this Facebook stuff.  What's going on on Facebook?  They've added a subscribe link.  That's wild.  Is it, are we seeing it yet or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can go now and you can turn it on.  And this adds to the, they did new list stuff yesterday,  which of course follows circles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The subscribe link is really interesting.  And it's automated, the lists are automated, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are suggested.  Suggested.  I think, and you can manage them, right?  And so what this adds up to is that, you know,  Facebook is giving you more control  over what appears on your page.  It's giving you more control over whom you share with.  Slight grammatical violation there.  And it now gives people the ability to subscribe to you.  But there's new controls on both sides of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at this, there's poll questions too.  That's kind of new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So when you post something. Oh yeah, Facebook questions.  Yeah. You can say that this goes  just to the circle of friends  or you can say this goes to the public,  those who subscribe to me.  So it's a far more public Facebook.  But you have more control over that publicness.  Interestingly, the subscriber, right?  If Gina subscribes to me, she can say,  I really don't want to hear any more from that bozo,  but I want to see his pictures.  She could subscribe only to my Facebook.  Ah, that's interesting.  Isn't it, but what this becomes  is Facebook becomes asynchronous.  Right, it's always asynchronous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And this is a really big change to their model.  Exactly.  Of relationships, it's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you still have that and you still have the ability  to publish and share with just those people  in your synchronous world, but from the same platform,  the same profile, you can now share with others.  And they told me, and I went through the call  with them yesterday, and I said, you know,  what about like an author?  And their view is that if you're Leopold or an author  or someone who updates your own stuff as an individual,  you probably get rid of your fan page.  This now substitute for that.  If you're a company, you can't have a profile page,  so you have a fan page instead.  But if you're a person, people should be able to follow you  and this becomes your tool for sharing  in all kinds of new and richer ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is something you have to opt into.  You go to the subscriptions page  and you say allow subscribers.  Now people can, who are not in your circle of friends.  Exactly.  Anyone can now subscribe to me.  Allow anyone to comment on your public updates.  All right, what the hell?  And notifications get notified about these new subscribers.  Well, I already, by the way, Facebook kind of automatically  made me start to get digest emails,  which is actually, I would have done that anyway.  I don't like notifications,  but so I don't have to worry about that.  So now people could subscribe.  Have you done that, Jeff, to your Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I did it.  I did it so you can subscribe to me.  Well, let me do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me go to Jeff.  Now I'm a friend of yours, so presumably,  would I have had this subscribe message?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you a friend?  You could go to Brian Stelter, for example.  He just turned his on or Matthew Ingram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, because you're a friend, I'm already subscribed to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're unsubscribed, right, exactly.  But I don't know if you're a friend of Brian Stelter.  I am not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now I have subscribed to Brian's updates.  Now you can subscribe to him.  Brian allows anyone to subscribe.  Okay, so I subscribe to him.  So now does he just appear in my newsfeed  as if I were a friend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can say, you could also, I don't know where you do it,  you could also set a level for him.  You can say, give me everything Brian says.  You can say, give me the chosen amount  as you would in the newsfeed now,  or give me only certain media types.  I don't know where you get to those controls.  I've lost sight of that, but that's really interesting.  Now again, the problem with Facebook is it often  it could get way too complicated.  Right.  But as Gina said, what was that mental map you said,  Gina, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, just kind of a mental model of the UI.  So I'm Leo G. Laporte on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I have a fan page, which is TheLeoLaporte,  but you could also go to Leo G. Laporte,  and that's my regular page,  and follow all my private updates.  But now I have to rethink my private updates  because I've been putting in stuff  like what gas station I'm at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But people won't see that.  They won't see that.  They'll only see your public updates.  Post now, you can post to a circle,  pardon me, a list of friends,  or you can post to the public, see that's public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now everything I do is public,  so I'm gonna have to rethink that.  This is interesting.  Now let me ask another question.  Gina, are you doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, actually, you know, it's interesting.  I have a page, I have a Facebook page for me,  which is my public stuff.  And I told everyone, that's what you find when you find me.  But that, that you're looking at right now  is my private profile that only friends can see.  Right, so I don't get a subscribe button.  Which is the end of the whole world now, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nope, nope, nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, because I have myself set,  I have my user profile set.  So I was using Facebook as like,  there was my private profile and my page was public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And here's your public page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's my public page, right?  Which, by the way, I haven't liked yet.  Well, and that I kind of like.  I like that.  Blog posts and Twitter, you know,  tweets without hashtags or at times too.  So it's interesting.  This gives me the ability, it gives anyone the ability.  I mean, you really kind of, you can,  anybody who, any person, individual who has a fan page  can actually ditch the fan page,  except I don't wanna ditch my fan page  because I've got a few hundred people following it.  And you don't have to.  And combine it with your profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and then I have a fan page as well,  which is the Leo Laporte.  There's 4,000 people on that.  So you're right.  Now we got a question here, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the other interesting thing about Facebook  is that it automatically sucks in pages from Wikipedia.  So there's a Wikipedia page about me.  So there's also a Wikipedia-based page about me in Facebook.  So that means that there are two pages  and one private profile.  Did you do that or does that do that automatically?  That happened automatically.  I didn't do that.  That just showed up.  I'm sure the two of you probably have the same.  How would I find that?  It's called a community page.  Let's see, if I just search for Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really, okay.  By the way, this is all,  this is why Facebook has a problem  because it's so hard to keep up with this stuff.  Now I see recommendations in here,  which is kind of a LinkedIn style on my fan page.  Easy for people to recommend your place to their friends.  This is just-  Why, I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, let's learn more.  These are places.  How about your children?  This is places, I guess.  But I don't know how I have a place.  Oh boy.  This is why people don't like Facebook.  This is so confusing.  So engineering, yeah.  Now I gotta say one thing that I don't know  if I'll get this with the new thing  is notice all the stats I'm getting.  So the raw number of impressions on the story,  the number of comments and likes per impression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, you get that with your page.  That's really nice.  This is handy, exactly.  Because you are kind of a business in and of yourself.  Someone who's an author or a freelancer.  Right, so you wanna see that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, the biggest feedback I've received,  whose idea was it to put the smoke detector  so close to the kitchen?  More people fed back to that  than anything I've posted in ages.  So there you go, right?  I'm using a tool that actually cross posts  from Google Plus to Twitter and Facebook.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now has anyone given you crap for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, nobody knows.  Oh.  But when I post something, this is a,  you see I have this, I can also share it on Facebook  or on Twitter.  And I can even set the Facebook settings  and what pages I want this to go to.  This is actually a great little extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which extension is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's this one, Publish Sync.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, Publish Sync.  I just posted a link to your Wikipedia community page  in the doc chat.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  If you, I don't know if you haven't seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hide, yeah, there we go.  Hide the screen and I'm gonna now go to the doc.  Oh, it's in the doc chat.  Yep.  Yeah, cool.  Facebook.com slash pages slash leolapour.  So this happens, is this something Wikipedia does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is Facebook's community pages.  And from, I didn't do anything for it to happen for me.  I think it just pulls in pages from Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's weird.  I got more followers on this one than my other one.  You're kidding.  Yeah, it's interesting, right?  And I didn't even know it existed.  I also don't know who's posting to it.  Apparently it's not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's funny, I don't see posts on it, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I post related posts by friends.  Oh, Dick to a her.  Yeah, that's very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if the three of us are confused  by all these things in Facebook,  my in-laws are definitely gonna be confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Automatically creating a page on Facebook is weird.  That I didn't know about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, do you see that it says from Wikipedia?  And there's a description with your kind of Wikipedia summary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, at the bottom there's a Wikipedia summary.  Yeah, yeah.  But that was stuck in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's funny, cause I don't see the posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So does somebody, maybe the chat room,  does somebody know how this happens?  Yeah, related to posts.  Is Mark Zuckerberg in the chat room?  Yeah.  Magic, thank you.  MXX in the chat room explained this all.  And those posts are posts that mention me,  and that's why, because my name is mentioned in there.  And he probably used that automatic drop-down thing  to make that name show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  So does this, Gina, back to what you were saying.  When I said suddenly Facebook is async.  Explore that a little bit farther  about how this changes the model.  Is this a big deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's a huge deal.  Cause Facebook's whole thing was that you could only friend  someone who would friend you back,  and there was all these social implications of that.  And I had a hard time figuring out how to use Facebook.  And so that's why I made the public page,  and then I had my private circle of friends.  This makes Facebook a lot more like Twitter,  and a lot more like Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you turn it on.  I mean, you don't have to turn it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you turn it on, right.  So you can say, people can subscribe to me,  or not.  So it makes a lot more Facebook data,  Facebook content public facing.  So I guess my question is, if I'm not logged into Facebook,  and I go to somebody's page who has allowed subscriptions,  can I see public posts without logging in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good question.  Because before, even before all this, right,  you could post to public.  The thing was, nobody could find you.  No one was following you.  There was no structure for that, right?  Right.  I don't know what the legacy position,  I should have asked that,  whether the stuff that you had public before  is still obviously public, because it always was.  What's the definition of public before  and the definition of public now?  Even Kevin Rose is confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at this post on Facebook.  Anyone know how to convert Facebook fan pages  to subscribers?  He's got the same point we do.  Right, it's the same problem, yeah.  Well, now we have subscribers.  Let me just use that.  And then there doesn't seem to be a,  well, wait a minute, Facebook.com slash public figures.  Absolutely blank.  Thank you very, oh no, there it is.  If you are a business, you can only use a page.  If you are an individual who wants to share updates  with a larger audience,  you may want to use a profile with subscribers.  Public figures, like Malcolm Gladwell,  can use a profile with subscribe, a page, or both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, like he would.  Why do they use him as the example?  Why Malcolm Gladwell of all people?  Sponsored for prudence.  The guy who says all this is crap and not useful.  Why Facebook do you pick Malcolm Gladwell?  That's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was with irony, I hope.  I think there's a little irony there.  So this explains what the differences are.  You can download a subscriptions guide  or page's best practices.  Oh, this is, you know, at one point  does this become ridiculously complicated.  Now, admittedly- I think we're at that point.  Admittedly, if you're just a user,  you just, you have a Facebook page,  you don't even know that any of this is happening, right?  Or care.  Does it change?  Okay, so this is the question.  Does it change for just our average, you know,  the high school junior who is keeping track  of her friends on Facebook,  does this change her life in any way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Her default remains as it was, right?  Her default's describing still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's not, unless she inadvertently says,  you know, turns on subscriptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So wasn't the big difference between pages and profiles  that there was a limit to how many friends  you could have as a profile,  but pages you could have any number of-  So-  And it was async.  Right, and it was async.  Someone could like your page or follow your page  without you-  Doing anything.  Right, so subscribers, I assume that there's no limit  on how many people could subscribe to your public posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would presume as well, it's the same thing.  Let's look at the subscriptions guide.  Jeez Louise.  Allow people to subscribe to your personal profile.  Many personal public figures use profiles  to connect with-  Now when you allow people.  Unlimited number of subscribers.  And you can update them from your mobile phone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha ha ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How to get subscribers.  All right, should I use a personal profile  with subscribers, a page or both?  Okay, I guess this is an issue  we probably don't have to spend a lot of time on  because most people aren't going to worry about this.  This is for public figures, right?  Or would they?  Now that's a question.  The same kind of person who has a Twitter account  and a Google Plus account,  and I'm sure Facebook's considering this,  maybe they would use Facebook and subscribers instead  and say, just do it all on one page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe.  I mean, you can make the argument  that everyone's a public figure these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do I tell people, and this is a big issue,  how do I tell people where they can find me on Facebook?  You could personalize it.  Well, you get a slash Leo Laporte, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your Facebook slash Leo Laporte, you got that, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I didn't get Leo Laporte.  Which is better than your Google Plus profile.  Yeah, I didn't, yeah, that's right.  Google Plus, you don't have a magic name, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, so you can just share your Facebook URL,  which is nice.  You can choose your URL, and you can just say,  hey, subscribe to me here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let's see if they've changed that.  So my username is already set to Leo G Laporte  for my personal, and then they have pages,  but they don't have, boy, they should kind of  maybe update this to say somehow,  something to do with subscriptions.  I guess I could just change my username.  No, I guess I can't, they're not giving me that option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo Laporte and two other friends  have started getting subscribers.  Oh, did you get a note?  Oh, that's interesting.  Top of my newsfeed right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's very interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You turn on notifications?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For subscribers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't even enabled subscribers yet,  because I haven't decided.  Oh, you haven't, oh, I see.  I haven't, you know, I tend to.  You may not want to.  It's pretty quiet.  I think I only have notifications for  if someone tags me in a photo or sends me a message.  You may not want to.  But yeah, no, I have to decide whether,  if I want to ditch all my fan, my page,  you know, followers for subscribers.  And, you know, my profile has always been  this kind of private thing, so it's going to be interesting  to mix both public and private content.  But I'm thinking it's Google Plus now,  so that feels a little more natural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly, you can imagine being Lady Gaga  and actually having a, you know, a private area  and being public using the same tool.  That's what they want.  They want to be the platform for interaction.  Not publishing, interaction, conversation.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This, every time they do something like this,  it always feels like, you know,  Mark tells you, says what's, Mark knows what's best.  Do what Mark says and everything will be okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it feels like a really interesting,  I mean, not only do I like that there are becoming  these standards and these models for interaction,  you know, that are kind of standard across these services,  but it feels like a big admission on Facebook's part,  oh, like, oh, hey, you know,  this is a really good mechanism.  Something that we've avoided for a really long time,  but Twitter and Google Plus to some extent  have proved that people want to follow  versus have that two-way friending.  And the list thing as well, I feel like,  was definitely kind of a nod  in Google Plus's direction of saying, okay,  you know what people do?  People making lists is useful  and we want to make that action as fun as possible.  I think those are all good things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody has made a page for my shirts.  See, this is the problem,  is anybody can do anything, right?  Right.  Already I have 48 fans.  Or my, I'm sorry, my shirts do.  I like it.  All right, moving along.  By the way, we know that Facebook is incredibly sticky.  I mean, there's certainly that.  Nielsen, which is apparently trying to get the move  from the rating of television to social media,  put out a report that said that Facebook  in the month of July,  let me see if I can find these exact figures for you,  had a total of way, way larger than anybody else.  Yeah, it's really impressive.  Now, this isn't your number, is it?  Nope, nope, nope, you're safe.  53, every time I do a number,  53 billion total minutes in the month of May.  That's so far beyond the number two,  which was Yahoo at 17 billion minutes,  Google 12, AOL 11, and MSN Windows Live and Bing 9.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, so take Google out of that,  because Google is a utility, right?  The difference here is that those other three,  and mind you, all the media companies below  think their business is content,  whereas Facebook enables the world to make content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting, it is content, isn't it?  It's a content site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if I said this on the show before,  if I did, I think I hit the zap in my ear.  You didn't know we had that, did you guys?  You're the only one she ever uses it on.  Yeah, I know.  No, you just turned me off on the monitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I was like, what zap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Zap Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had lunch with a former network president,  news president some months ago,  and he said, Facebook and Google use our content  to make their stuff, and they don't respect our content.  And I said, no, they respect content more than you do,  because they respect the idea  that more people can make it than you do.  You think content is only what you make.  Facebook says, the stuff that everybody does,  yeah, that's content, and there's value in it.  In fact, we're gonna exploit it really well  for advertising and services and targeting and all this stuff.  And so, Facebook, but it's not a platform for content.  It's a platform for conversation,  and the conversation happens to be content, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very interesting.  We're gonna take a break, come back.  There are some Google acquisitions to talk about,  a new Google service that's very interesting  and a lot more.  Gina Tripani's here from smarterwear.org,  from buzzmachine.com, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  Before we go much farther,  let's tell you to back up your stuff.  It's so important, and Carbonite makes it easy.

Transcript:  Boom!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You gotta back it up to get it back.  I just can't believe I have a Leo Laporte shirts  on Facebook.  Google buys Zagat for $125 million.  I'm very happy for Tim and Nina, the owners of Zagat.  Why did Google buy Zagat?  Your theories.  First of all, I wanna say, I've been using Zagat  since it was the thin red book.  When I go to New York or any big city,  I'd pull out the Zagat.  Then I bought it on my iPhone, and I bought it on my Android.  It's 10 bucks, but it's worth it,  because anywhere you are, you say,  I used it in Paris and found great restaurants.  I am a Zagat fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's quite an old company, right?  It's been around for a long time.  It's a paper company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They make books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Much longer than Google.  Yeah, they make books.  It's crazy.  I felt like this had a lot to do with a story  that we covered a few episodes ago  about how Google pulled data from their places pages  that they pulled from places like Yelp  and other local services.  I think this is just about Google wanting to own  a lot of that data, that review data,  and to be able to enhance their local services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember that they tried to buy Yelp and rebuffed.  Right, that's true.  They tried to buy Groupon and rebuffed.  So I think, and boy, 125 million is cheap for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do we know who caused the dropping of the Yelp data?  Was that initiated by Google,  or was that initiated by a complaint of Yelp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think Zagat is a better brand name than Yelp.  You asked me that question.  Do I use Yelp or Zagat?  If I have the choice, always use Zagat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's interesting to me is my fear about this purchase  is that if it's viewed as a content company,  Google should not be in the business  of owning content companies.  It puts them in channel conflict  with all of the recipients of all the links they give.  And they will get accused of favoring this content company  over competitors, and so on and so on.  However, I think, I'm hoping that Google being Google  would look at Zagat as a platform.  It's a means to get better reviews,  reviews that are filtered more,  which is exactly what you just said, Leo, than Yelp,  that they have a system for doing that.  And if you could scale Zagat and its systems  out to reviews of lots and lots and lots and lots  of local things across all platforms,  which Zagat has too, right?  They have reviews of spas and other stuff.  I'm sure you use those often too, Leo.  Then, you know, Google can have a platform  for quality reviews of local places done by us, the people.  That, I hope, is where Google would head here.  If they just say, oh, well, they did a neat thing  of getting cheap content, and we're gonna put the content up,  screw Yelp, we're never gonna link to them.  That'd be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember, when they tried to buy Yelp,  I think if they were rebuffed, but I'm not sure,  they created Hotpot.  Do you remember Hotpot?  Oh, God, yeah, geez.  That's still there.  Look, here's my Hotpot account.  And if I go there, it says,  hey, because you like Central Market,  you might like Graffiti or Dempsey's.  These are restaurants in Petaluma with ratings, reviews.  Jesus, I forgot entirely about that.  So I think they might end up in channel conflict.  That's interesting, I hadn't thought about that.  I think that what this does is it gives a brand,  I think they're buying a brand name.  I think it gives a brand name  to what they're already doing in places, in Hotpot,  in, you know, other, remember, they had Yelp reviews  in places and then they were forced to drop them, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought that they had voluntarily,  I thought there was a lawsuit  and that they had pulled them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That they had volunteered to pull them out.  Yeah, I really wonder, I mean,  is this Zagat brand gonna go away?  I agree that this was a brand buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not the content, because they've got content,  but if you could brand their content with a quality brand,  might it not rub off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But isn't the way Zagat works  is that they have guides and like highfalutin foodies  and critics who give their ratings.  I mean, this isn't a crowdsourced, I mean, Yelp is-  No, no, no, Zagat is crowdsourced.  Oh, it is, it is totally crowdsourced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But in a controlled way, you've gotta,  it's a higher bar than just saying,  I hated the burrito, right?  You've gotta fill out a whole form, you have to get,  I don't know if you can get approved or not.  There's, you know, it's kind of Google-like.  I mean, they basically had a manual algorithm  of how people got in and how they ranked them  and did things back in the day.  It was a very old-fashioned company.  It was printing closed, expensive books.  I know from my days at Coney Nass,  they had to kind of get dragged onto online.  Then they got very appy and all that,  but they still sell products behind the paywall.  And at least at first, they're not gonna make it free.  They're still gonna be paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm curious.  I imagine at some point, Google will make it free.  So right now, if you go to zagat.com,  you get a directory, but not the reviews.  Those are all locked.  And to unlock the ratings,  you have to pay for it, essentially.  I have to tell you, the ratings are so good  and so valuable that I actually,  I do, wait a minute, I'm getting some ratings here.  Vino showed up for some reason.  Oh, it's a sample, I see, of premium content.  I absolutely trust it.  I trust it more in foodie areas,  for instance, in San Francisco or New York or Paris,  than I do in less foodie areas.  I won't name names, but Indianapolis leaps to mind.  You know, generally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But wait, wait, wait, it's all right there.  I mean, Carrabba's, see, it used to be that,  for zagat, you'd be at higher end restaurants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's not sorted.  It's sorted by relevance, not by score.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now it's become broader already.  Carrabba's is, I like Carrabba's, it's very good.  It's not fancy, but it's in a strip mall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's a chain, yeah.  So this is interesting.  Yeah, I don't think that, that's interesting, huh?  You know, notice we have a Google ad.  Google offers beta, right at the front, at the top,  which is their Groupon, right?  So it looks like what's going on  is Google rebuffed in its acquisitions, created its own,  and then maybe a less expensive acquisition,  buying zagat for the brand name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it'd be interesting.  I mean, they should keep the brand,  unlock all the reviews and build those zagat reviews  into Google Place pages,  and that will make Google Place pages extremely valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what about Jeff's point about channel conflict?  Because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good point.  It's a really good point.  I mean, we had kind of a similar conversation  around the airline data,  which we all have a big story about that.  Well, let's take a look at the Google Flight Search,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because, you know, that's really,  now this is the first,  this is the ITA acquisition that Google made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a really nice Flight Search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think if I were Kayak or Hipmunk,  I'd be a little worried.  Yes. Expedia?  Well, I don't know, because can you book?  I don't think you can book.  It's only a search.  What is the URL?  It's not Flight Search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's google.com slash flights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Flights, no urge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or you could just put a search in saying  flights from San Jose too,  and it would come up. Right, the Bing thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it decides...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It has so many nice UI elements.  Look at that, it knows where you are.  It has the drop down of where you want to go,  kind of already extended.  Look at this.  It's got all these really neat UI elements  that just... I can change the sliders here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I increase the price, can I reduce the duration?  You know, okay, let's get the shortest flight I can.  That's the shortest flight I can get.  And there it is.  It's very interesting.  It's very engineering focused, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, very much.  I mean, those interactive data visualizations  are super, super geeky.  And you can change...  Yeah, like look at that.  I love that graph.  If you change the dates, you can see how the fare changes.  So go on that calendar and move those dates around,  and you'll see how the median price changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going down, it's going up.  It's actually...  You know, you need this because the airlines,  it's so freaking complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because it's so hard, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're using out programmatic algorithms  to determine pricing.  You better darn well have a computer on your side  if you're gonna get the best price.  So Google is not booking tickets, right?  I don't think so.  Let's see, let's take this ticket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And let's imagine that it never will,  in which case it could really disrupt  this horrid industry. It books it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but it sends it to JetBlue.  Well, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's labeled as an ad.  Look, ads, JetBlue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it says airline site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So when you...  With that red book button.  Oh, it says ad.  Yeah, so I don't know what that means.  I don't know if JetBlue is getting...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So wait a minute though.  If I look, let's say, okay, let's change the parameters  to, I mean, are these only ad-based bookings?  Well, I'm getting JetBlue, JetBlue, JetBlue.  Maybe they are.  Oh, it's because it's Oakland and New York.  Let's go from SF5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've seen tons of other airlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just because that was the airline.  Okay, so let's see.  Let's book this Continental.  Let's say the return flight, book it, ads.  Maybe that's their way of saying,  look, we're gonna make a little money off of this  if you make this purchase, as everybody does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But here's the conflict.  So then what Google could do with this much data  is it could really do things like do alerts  when prices go down, tell us when prices tend to go down.  It could make transparent this horribly opaque system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Wouldn't that be great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  It would be beautiful, but if their bread  is buttered by the airlines.  This goes back to channel conflict in a different way.  The conflict they have in life now  by being in bed with Verizon  was that they went away against net neutrality  and they were not user-focused in that.  They were telco-focused.  In this, where is their interest gonna be?  Is it gonna be traveler-focused,  which would be the old Google,  or is it gonna be airline-focused  because they're the advertiser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now one thing I should point out  is that locations outside the US are not supported.  I can fly to Honolulu, so I guess it's just the US of A,  not the Continental United States.  Free-walling, Leo.  I am, believe me.  Believe me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff, that's the big question.  Is Google's customer the web user  or is it the advertiser?  And this is the continual conversation about Google.  The haters say that the customer is the advertiser  and that the folks who trust and love them like us say,  well, Google knows it's in their best interest  to get more users and that will draw more advertisers.  So it's interesting.  It's a really interesting conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would hope.  I think it would be short-sighted of them  to make it be about the advertisers.  I don't think there's enough pressure on them  at this point to do that.  So I did a search for SFO to NYC flight, got the ads,  but I also got this, which is very Bing-like.  And I-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that one box has been there for a bit.  Has it?  Flight's link is on the left-hand menu now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is no different.  I would have to click this link here to get the new.  Right.  Got it.  Okay, interesting.  Well, I think this is nicely done.  Yeah, it is.  This is why people were complaining  about the ITA acquisition.  This was the fear and-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This was it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've done it.  It's a beautiful tool.  And I actually feel a little bad for Kayak and Hitmonk,  which are really great products in their own rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know, because I think that that's so geeky  and engineering-looking that if you are used to using  Kayak and Hitmonk, Kayak's kind of horrible,  but if you're used to, frankly, all the,  that's pretty horrible.  But if you're used to using Hitmonk, it's much prettier.  I think that this is where they have to,  their value proposition now has to be,  well, it's easier, it's prettier, it's nicer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, one of my big flight search criteria  is whether or not the plane has Wi-Fi.  And I actually don't see that here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I always try to get the cross,  especially a cross-country flight is just so much easier  with Wi-Fi, I know I sound extremely entitled.  Virgin America, Delta, some Delta flights have them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cause I'm stuck with Continental United.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think US Airways, some US Airways flights have them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Google doesn't have a little cute little chipmunk either.  I think the visualizations on here are pretty good.  And by the way, note the little Wi-Fi links.  So you can see that on Hitmonk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep, yep.  So there's some value here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is what they have to do.  They have to make it prettier, cuter, you know.  You know, I've rarely heard the word cute used to Google.  No, and you will never see a chipmunk with goggles on.  And this thing's like sort by agony,  which is something Hitmonk does.  It's clever. Yeah, that is clever.  I don't know how you use it, but it's clever.  And that's the kind of thing you won't see Google do either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Android robot, I think, is the closest  they've ever gotten to, or kind of a really cute mascot, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which would you rather cuddle,  a chipmunk with goggles on or a robot?  Come on. Right.  Which is more cuddly. The furry chipmunk.  I think Hitmonk has a chance.  I think Kayak might be threatened  because they've let their UI become dated.  And that's a real threat to them.  Let's see. Google lets users opt out of location data collection.  That's obviously in response to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But explain this to me, because what I was saying was  you can opt out of your Wi-Fi being used there,  but it said Wi-Fi for use in mobile and cell phones.  I didn't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't read this straight.  This is the blog post.  At the request of several European data protection authorities,  we are building an opt-out service.  Making this opt-out available globally,  we'll release more detailed information when it's ready to launch.  Well, this just... I mean, they're giving you a checkbox.  And this is from the European Public Policy Blog.  Those guys have a lot of fun.  That's a job for a...  You know, if you get transferred to that, you're pissed Marissa off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Literally the French Four Allegiant.  Oh, no. What's your new assignment?  European Public Policy Blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to live in Brussels.  This does not tell you very much.  It tells you about the collection of data.  It says even though the wireless access point signals we use  in our location services don't identify people,  we think we can go further in protecting people's privacies.  At the request of several European data protection authorities,  we're building an opt-out service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If this is your home Wi-Fi and you're not identified with your name,  then how do you have the opportunity...  Oh, wait a minute.  Go and find your map, back number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This allows an access point owner to opt out.  So this is not for the... You already could opt out on the handset.  This is saying if I have a Wi-Fi... I do.  We have the Twitter Wi-Fi access point.  I can now send my MAC address, or probably that's what they'd want,  to Google saying, do not use that access point in future collections.  It leaves me out of it.  That's an interesting opt-out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then it says something about your mobile phone.  I don't get it.  Well, you could always opt out. You still can opt out.  I know that, but I got all confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this looks like this is for the access point owners.  It is for the access point, yes.  Once opted out, our services will not use that access point  to determine users' locations.  Wow, that's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, so what that means is that they did the drive-by, no longer themselves,  but what's that other company you always tell me the name of?  I always forget.  Skyhook.  Skyhook, thank you.  I don't need a brain. I have Google and Leo.  And so they use that so they know that when you come in from the Brickhouse,  they know where you are.  So what you're doing by taking your access point in data out of that list  is simply that they will no longer presumptively guess your location.  That's it.  Right. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  They won't use you in the determination of the location.  So I have opted out the Twit Wi-Fi access spots.  By the way, they don't have to be open access spots.  They just... See, this is why it's kind of weird.  They don't need to do this.  I'm broadcasting a signal from my access spots to everywhere within 150 feet of this office.  If you're driving by and you can see that signal, you can see the signal.  It's public information.  So they've got a GPS address. They see the signal.  They say, well, if you can see this signal, then you're within 150 feet of this location.  If you can see that signal too, then we'll do this subset and we know where you are.  So what I could do now, and this is very German, this is more Blerminey stuff.  What I could do as a access point owner is say, well, don't use me in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even though it has no impact on you at all.  It has no impact on me at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm broadcasting that signal out the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you've taken away the ability for the person going by with a handset to get better  targeted stuff.  Which they might want.  So basically it's just a selfish... It allows you to be selfish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now it probably is in response to the fact that remember Google, when they were collecting  these access point information, did store bits of data from those access points.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I went to... Last week I gave a talk at the Future of Privacy Forum, which is pretty much  an industry group, right?  But when I gave the talk, there were a few members... The faces in the room turned so  sour they could have garnished a baked potato.  And there was this one woman there who was a former FTC commissioner, recently former.  And she went on a tear and an attack against me about how Google was evil and using all  this data from this Wi-Fi.  And I said, there is no conceivable business model and she would not buy it.  Now mind you, I don't know if she was on the FTC when the FTC came to the agreement with  Google about Buzz, but this is a person, a government official, who is in very much position  to affect Google's business and affect how the internet works for all of us.  And ignorant as could be about this Google case, going with the emotional end of it.  Oh my God, Google was using all this data.  And I said, yeah, it was a screw up.  And I saw Mark from Epic at a panel yesterday and the same kind of thing.  Google the data.  Such a royal screw up because it's being used against Google and against all of us who want  some measure of openness.  Constantly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I'm just glad I don't have to work for the Google European Union blog policy  blog.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hey, let's talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come in the morning.  Who hates us today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Slovenia is having a rough day with us.  You have to be a special kind of person.  They probably put all the monks.  All the very enlightened people get to write for that blog.  Sorry.  I'm just turning the other cheek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead.  At this event I went to, and there are a lot of nice people there and good people, but  even the folks within a company who are dedicated to privacy, some of them, their job is so  much to scare everyone in their company.  In the industrial regulatory complex of privacy, you have the so-called organization of watchdogs  who scare everybody about privacy.  Then you have the regulators who make regulations about it.  The legislators make legislation about it.  And then the officials in the company who have to protect them.  And then the consultants who try to regulate against all this.  And it's all this big tower of fear that's out there.  It's a tower of fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis sits astride the top saying, it's okay.  It's calm.  Calm down.  Hey, let's quickly talk about Netflix.  Then we'll get our tip, tool, and number of the week.  But first, a reminder, if you're not a Netflix subscriber, that you can try it free for 30  days by going to Netflix.com slash twit.  If you already are, and I know most of you are, tell a friend, spread the word.  Netflix streaming, it's the best deal in entertainment.  Just look at, I mean, the conversation.  Gene Hackman, the classic Coppola movie.  Oh, what a great movie from 1974.  I just watched this documentary about Wilco.  I love this.  They're recording Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  I love kind of the making of.  Here's John Waters' one man show, celebrating the origins of trash.  Gotta love that.  These are all movies, TV shows, documentaries you can watch tonight if you go to Netflix.com  slash twit.  And great for the kids too.  It plays on your iPhone, iPad, all the Android phones now.  Or later.  They've added all of them.  Many tablets.  What else?  Or PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, many DVD players, most TVs.  I mean, everybody does Netflix now.  Because you like the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie, perhaps you'd like Buenuel's  Enchien Andalou?  Aren't you so classy?  That's probably my daughter.  Oh, maybe Eight and a Half or Jean-Luc Godard's A Woman is a Woman.  Les Bonnes Femmes.  You know, they actually have...  Uh oh, now we're watching Les Bonnes Femmes.  I'm sorry.  One of the great things about Netflix, they have a lot of international films, which I  love.  I watched all of the Millennium Saga, you know, the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the  original Swedish version.  Yeah, those were good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great.  They're a little hardcore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, they're like, boy, yeah, but they're true to the book, which I really liked.  Yeah, we're watching Les Bonnes Femmes.  So let's watch a little film and we'll get back to...  No, just go to Netflix.com slash twit.  Ce film est interdit au moins de 18 ans.  Just so you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The chat room is doubting that you're blaming your daughter on this.  You're throwing your daughter under the bus here on this.  You're actually the snob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually I think this is one of those sexy French films.  Claude Chabrol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like a winged victory.  I feel like I'm transported back to my sophomore year in college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, isn't this great?  Don't you love it?  You can watch this anytime you want.  I go home.  Look, de Chavaux.  I go home and I watch this stuff and I just feel so continental.  Netflix.com.  This is our new theme song.  It's about as down as the other one.  Have we replaced that horrible theme song?  No, because we thought maybe you really liked it.  If I really liked it, I would be the only one who did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am happy to change it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, didn't Gina's that suggest a better song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we've gone through some iterations.  We should revisit that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been a year or more.  My thinking at the time was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is the Losers song original to Glee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Surely they would give us the rights to use that.  Wouldn't that be the perfect song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The guy who does Glee's mixing is a fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's ask him.  Oh yeah, we can ask him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be killer?  That would be great.  Right thing for us.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be...  It's perfectly for us.  Loser, Like Me, that one?  Yeah, that's it.  That's it.  Yeah, that's us.  That's our song.  It was the first original...  I think it was the first...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not the song.  Oh, here it is.  Hey, everyone you wanna be  Darling, turn it up like me  You may say that I'm a freak show

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But hey, give it just a little time  I bet you're gonna change your mind  All of the dirt you've been throwing away  It ain't so hard to take that ride

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cause I know I'm on a date  I think this is our theme song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, some viewers are getting drunk right now on the drinking game.  Hopper Bosh, Trapolet, there you're...  There, now they're set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like that song.  All the dirt you've been throwing away, it ain't so hard to take  Cause I know one day you'll be screaming my name  And I'll just look away  Just go ahead and hate on me and run your mouth  It's a great song.  Damn, that's our song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the Loser's Anthem.  It's the Geek Anthem.  Yeah.  I'll get you back when I'm your boss.  Can we have that please?  We'll give you credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, Gina, your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  iOS users, iPad and iPhone users can now get to Google Music.  Android users had the Google Music app  But there wasn't a way to play back your music on iOS  But there's now a really kind of slick mobile web app for Google Music  You just go to music.google.com on your iOS device  Or I assume any device with a good browser  It's got this really nice artist  You can play your music back from the cloud  Nice mobile interface  So it works great  So you don't have to sync your iTunes  It's in Safari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in Safari, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a web app.  It's a totally web app  But it's a really nice interface  And you don't have to manually sync your music from iTunes to your phone anymore  Or your iPhone anymore  You can just play  You can just stream straight from Google Music in the browser  Neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you Google Music for doing that  Cause we know Apple didn't do it.  Right.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week, my friend.  I'm going to do two

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One is a follow up to last week's discussion with Kevin Marks about Orkut  And it turns out that in the meantime  Google has surpassed  I'm sorry, Facebook has surpassed Google's Orkut in Brazil  Oh, interesting  Facebook has 30.9 million users versus Orkut's 29 million users in Brazil  And what effect does that have on Orkut?  Well, a lot  Because 90% of Orkut's page views are from Brazil  So you saw that it's so big in India  Well, no, it's mainly big in Brazil  Brazil, I always  You should do a Brazilian show, Leo  All in Portuguese  It's the most fascinating country to me because things take off there online  It never gets credit for this  It's a very cyber nation  The first and only licensee of Blogger was Brazil  Photolog started by Scott Hyffman  It was huge in Brazil  Orkut took off in Brazil  The other number that I kind of love is Robert Scoble  His new job description in my mind is envelope pusher  As soon as subscription comes up, what does he do?  He goes for numbers  And he says, already 168 people have subscribed to me  But this is the part I love  He subscribed to 30 people and Facebook rate limited him  And said he was acting bad  And he's like, I'm not going to do that  I'm going to do it  And he's like, I'm not going to do it  And he's like, I'm not going to do it  And he's like, I'm not going to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Robert will break it  If it's breakable, Robert will break it  I love that  Somebody just in the chat room sent me this link  Is this a Chipotle ad?  What is this?  It's a radio ad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I've seen this  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh boy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Am I going to be sorry I played this?  No, I don't think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's about how Chipotle takes care of their animals

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's he going to take an antidepressant?  What's this all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's very strange  Aww, he's thinking about his pigs all caged

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aww, let them out, let them all out  Free them, free them  Free the pigs

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Free range pigs of my burritos  Only  Aww, look at that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They still squish them in his square pills before they send him to Chipotle  At least  They've had a good life  In the little Chipotle  I don't know, I think it's best for a food manufacturer to just kind of pretend the food doesn't come from anywhere  Because I don't really want to  I don't want to  Think about that  Cultivated better...  Good for you Chipotle  They still haven't paid us a penny but they just got a full ad

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I suddenly feel a little better about the free advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At least it's free range Chipotle  Exactly  So here is my tool  It's actually a site based on Google Maps  That I think you guys will like called What Was There  WhatWasThere.com  Let's put in New York City and I'll show you how it works  It ties pictures of historic places to their locale on Google Maps  So let's say the Woolworth building under construction  And what you can do, which is cool, is you can take the street view  And put superimpose on the street view  I can fade the picture out just a little bit here  Superimpose, there's the current Woolworth building  You can superimpose the picture on top of its actual street view  How do they do that?  Isn't that cool?  Hey, that is neat  City Hall Park  And if we fade it out, you can see it today  And in the past  Isn't that cool? I just love this  San Francisco has some good places  That's P.T.
