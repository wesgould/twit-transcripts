It's time for Twig, This Week in Google, the show where we  cover well.  It's not really about Google at all.  That's kind of false advertising.  It's about whatever we want to talk about.  Jeff Jarvis isn't here, so it'll be a little less on the  journalism side.  He's the professor of journalism at CUNY.  But Stacey Higginbotham is here.  Of course, she's the queen of IoT, IoTpodcast.com.  She's also the king of IoT.  I don't want to be sexist about anything.  You could still call me the queen of.  She's in charge of IoT.  And at Gigastacy.  Hi, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also joining us today, because we don't have Jeff, we've got  but I'm even more happy to say.  The next best thing from Gastronomad.net, Mike Elgin.  Yay, Mike.  Yay.  Long time news director here at Twig and writes for Computer  World and Fast Company and everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love doing this show because even when I listen every single  week, I'm always interjecting things and nobody can hear me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now they can.  Now you've got a mic.  Yes.  And by the way, speaking of Digital Nomad, you're going to  be starting next week.  You're going to be going to Spain to get set up for your  Barcelona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  My wife is spearheading a new business where we have  Gastronomad experiences, where we invite people to come with  us.  If anybody out there loves traveling and food, this is  going to be a unique experience.  So we're going to go out there and do the research.  So we're going to be doing the hard work of tasting  everything and trying all these different foods and wines  and things like that in Barcelona.  And then we're going to go off to Fez, Morocco, and we're  going to do the same thing there.  Somebody's got to do it, Leo.  Somebody's got to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How fun is this?  What a great idea.  I'm excited to do this.  Yeah.  It's going to be so much fun.  Barcelona's first.  And by the way, I hope Amira cooks a little bit for this  because she's the best cook I know, literally the best cook  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She is the best cook I know as well.  She's probably the best cook in the universe.  That's my best estimate.  And she is going to be teaching people how to make paella and  things like that in each location.  She does that anyway.  It's really funny.  We go to Greece, and then she masters all the Greek cooking,  and she's doing it better than the Greeks.  And it's going to be fantastic.  So much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now you know, Stacey, now you know why I want to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  I'm like, oh, I also would like to go.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're all going to do it.  Stacey, do it.  Mike, stop booking.  Everybody at Twitch is going to come.  The Barcelona Experience, September 12 through 17, and  then the Morocco Experience, September  25 through October 2.  You're going to do Mexico next year, and I'm sure there'll be  a lot more to come on this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  One of the places we're going to be, we're going to be  for 10 days in Prosecco, Italy.  So we're going to do a Prosecco one next year.  Lots of people haven't discovered Prosecco, but  obviously they know the wine.  But the region is just a fantastic foodie  area north of Venice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's where Jeff is right now.  He's in Italy.  He's in Perugia for the International  Journalist Festival.  Have you ever been there?  No, I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You went, right?  No, I've never been.  Ohm always goes.  And Matthew goes.  Matthew always goes.  I don't know if Ohm always goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ohm's gone a few times because I've seen his  pictures from Perugia.  OK.  Matthew, you're right.  Matthew goes every year.  Matthew Ingram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, because Lord help him if he can't post other things on  his, like, it's not Instagram, his Christmas letter or  whatever that makes you jealous.  I'm like, the Canadian Lake in the Italy pictures.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every summer I watch his Instagram.  He's always canoeing out in the lake.  It's like, oh, what a life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it was terrible working with him.  Stacey, I have to file this before too because I got to  get out of the lake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Big scoop from Jessica Lesson's The Information.  And they've got, they have so much good connections.  We knew the information would be really good on  covering Google.  And Amir Afrati is really connected.  But this one actually is from Kevin McLaughlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Kevin is really great.  He actually broke a really nice Cisco story a couple days  ago, too, about them separating their hardware and  software business.  And Kevin is a stellar reporter.  He is super good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Old school.  So this is interesting.  The headline is Google Plots New Hardware to Take on Echo.  But one of the things that's revealed in this is that Google  is considering making the Google Home, which is right  now kind of an Echo competitor's speaker, making it  also a Wi-Fi router, part of their Google Mesh Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this makes all the sense in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Remember when they were rumored to be coming out with  the initial router?  And they were also rumored to be coming out with Google Home.  And everybody assumed, oh, they're going to do  this great thing.  They're going to add the two together.  Every router, which will have two or three in the house or  more, will be a Google Home device.  And won't that be great?  And then they didn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the OnHub was practically dead on arrival.  It was a terrible router.  It promised all this additional stuff.  It had built into it.  Didn't have a Zigbee radio, a Stacey, built into it?  It still does.  Yeah, but it was never turned on, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you can actually control your Hughes  with the OnHub router.  I think that's actually a thing you can do.  And it supports your August lock with the Bluetooth in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  You could do two things with it.  But do they still sell that?  And if you have an OnHub, does it automatically join with a  Google Wi-Fi to make a mesh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The OnHub does work with Google Wi-Fi.  Let's see if I can still buy an OnHub router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had one ordered the minute they announced it and then got  cold feet when I read Ron Amadio's review of it in  Ars Technica.  And he said, the thing is slow as molasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Kevin likes his.  There's two versions.  There's the Google version, and there was the TP-Link version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they actually made the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The TP-Link one doesn't seem to be available.  You can buy the ASUS one.  I'm adding it to my Google Store cart.  Oh, I didn't know ASUS sold one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's this round black thing.  It's also $129, just like the Google Home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I love the idea.  And you're right.  Somebody's in the chat saying, this isn't hardware.  This is just software.  This should be an easy thing to turn on.  Maybe.  Well, no.  Do they have the mic?  The far-field microphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  And do they have a processor that can handle the always on  listening?  So those two things actually need to be there.  And there are a couple things here.  It makes all the sense in the world to do this.  And actually, I'm seeing a lot of IoT devices,  like light switches and even things like light bulbs,  that have Wi-Fi repeaters built into them.  So combining a device that's going  to be in every room with a Wi-Fi repeater makes tons of sense.  Or making it into a mesh, however  you want to think about it.  I know they're different.  But with this Google Home thing, I  don't know how many people put their router still  in a place that is accessible like a listening device needs  to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does that make sense?  That's exactly the right problem for this.  And I actually think that in the larger scheme of things,  15 years from now, 10 years from now,  we'll be looking back at this era  and say, remember that Amazon Echo?  What was it called?  You think?  This whole category.  Yeah, it'll be gone.  They own this category right now.  It's just a stopgap until we're all wired up with microphones  on our physical person.  And so one of the things Stacey's talking about  is the fatal problem with this, which  is that you tuck your router down behind the desk  and behind the, you don't put it out there where you can hear it  and where it can hear you.  And so that's a real problem.  Actually, the best place for this sort of utility  is in light bulbs.  Light bulbs always have electricity.  They're always in places where you are.  Like you think of a reading light or a lamp  or lights in the bathroom or lights over the dining room table.  If those were all wired up with microphones,  that would be much better because that's  where the human-centric activity is.  But ultimately, as soon as we have the ability  to interact with our virtual assistants  through our smart glasses and through our wearable devices,  then the behavior will be identical.  We'll talk and Alexa will talk back.  But then we'll be able to do it outside.  We'll be able to do it no matter where we are.  And that'll be better.  Ultimately, I think that's where it's going.  And until somebody like Apple comes out with smart glasses,  I don't think that's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so that's why I thought, so I wrote a big thing  when the EarPods came out from Apple,  how this is the beginning of kind of always  on listening potential.  So exactly what you're talking about.  I will say, though, I think Amazon,  we may forget the device, but what they're building  is with their AVS, so She Who Shall Not Be Named,  Voice Services, what they're building there  is basically the way you talk to any device.  So if they can win with basically the voice UI,  because that's what they're doing.  So if I talk to my thermostat, these  are the words I use to do it because I have a thermostat  with Amazon Echo integration in it, that's going to be,  that's what they're doing now.  So I can totally be like, oh, yeah,  there used to be a standalone device,  and all it did was listen.  But in the future, everything should have some sort  of voice capability, which is actually freaking  scary if we worry about hacking, because you can't turn the mic  off on all these other things as easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think people are, I mean, certainly privacy  has become a big concern.  Of course, President Trump on Monday  signed the bill overturning the ISP privacy regulations  that were promulgated last year by the FCC.  We've seen the CIA WikiLeaks dump,  and now a new hack that shows that almost all, something  like 95% of all smart TVs can be hacked remotely  to turn on cameras and microphone.  Do you think that the general public's awareness of this  is high enough, and their concern about privacy  is high enough to actually stymie the development  of these voice services?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, for sure.  I have tons of people who are like,  I'm interested in the Amazon Echo,  but oh, I don't want anything else listening to me.  I mean, I get lots of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  There was actually a new poll that came out yesterday  on this, and shockingly, 75% of adults  said they would not let investigators, the FBI or whatever,  tap into their internet activity to help combat terrorism.  This is way up.  This is up from 67% in June 2013.  So I think that all the news around hacking and surveillance  is starting to have an effect on the public,  which kind of surprised me.  Usually the public is willing to,  they'll give up all their privacy  if they can save $5 on something,  and they tend to not be aware of the larger implications  of what happens when you give up all your privacy.  But I think all the stories coming out  are chipping away at the resistance  and the lack of awareness in the public.  And I think we're getting to a point  where people are gonna really start seeking out encryption  in a meaningful way and looking for privacy.  And I saw a really interesting quote  that I retweeted this morning,  which I think was a fantastic perspective  on privacy and on encryption.  Encryption, according to this quote,  and I'm paraphrasing it,  is one of the only technologies  that radically favors the private,  the privacy of the person,  and it doesn't go in both ways.  Most technologies, hacking or anti-hacking,  it can benefit hackers,  it can benefit the surveillance crowd,  it can benefit both sides.  Encryption benefits only the side of the person  who's trying to keep their information private  and offers nothing to the other side.  And that's why it's fundamentally in the future  that we're gonna be tied to the question of human rights.  Like, do you have a right to have a private conversation?  If so, then you have the right to encryption,  end-to-end encryption.  So I think that's a really interesting perspective,  but I do think it's becoming a political issue.  The trust of the government is low,  the trust of companies are low,  and so people are gonna take that on in the privacy sphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if all that's true,  does that stymie this technology, though?  I mean, should Amazon say,  well, I guess we won't do the Echo now?  Should Google say,  well, we probably wanna add voice to our wireless hubs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So with Amazon, I think there's two things.  There's government efforts,  and then there's,  I don't actually trust the government with my data.  One, general incompetence,  two, surveillance efforts, that kind of thing.  I actually trust Amazon with my data.  Isn't that ironic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's super ironic.  But I've always said that.  What's the worst Amazon can do?  Try to sell you something.  What's the worst the government can do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This guy's the limit.  Yeah.  Like, oh, they could put me in jail.  They could kill you.  Or kill me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jail, killing me.  The thing is that Amazon itself is, hopefully,  a closed system,  whereas government surveillance,  what they're looking for, backdoors and things like that,  which can be exploited by others.  Like, having end-to-end encryption.  But that's the nexus, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because the government goes to Amazon  and says, you got that Echo in there.  Let's turn that on, if you don't mind.  And Amazon's helpless to say no.  So it is really the nexus of this stuff.  You may not trust government.  You may trust Amazon.  But if you've got an Echo in your house, Daisy,  you're giving the government that microphone, in effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In effect.  Now, I assume that Amazon pays attention.  Like, Amazon doesn't roll over like AT&T did  when the government was like,  hey, yo, can we tap into your major network  and spy on all your users?  So far, Amazon is not doing that, to my knowledge.  Yeah.  I've talked to people at Amazon about this.  They are not willing to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't mean they're gonna win that battle, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't.  But I know they're gonna fight it.  Yeah, they're gonna fight it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they'll probably lose.  So what?  Fighting is more a PR thing than it is a real,  I mean, I understand they don't wanna do it, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a recent episode of the show, The Good Fight,  which is a spin-off of The Good Wife.  And it's a very good show.  It's exactly like The Good Wife,  minus the two previous main characters.  And they did an episode recently  where there was an Amazon Echo-like device  in the office of one of the lawyers,  and it was subpoenaed or whatever.  They grabbed the device, whatever they call it.  And they got all this data and all these conversations,  and it recorded everything.  And that's just simply not accurate.  As Stacey's saying, I mean,  if the device doesn't actually record  when you don't trigger the secret keyword,  then there's not a recording for the government  or anybody else to get their hands on.  After the fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  After the fact.  But the government could,  I don't see any reason why the government  couldn't say to Amazon,  and maybe Amazon would fight it,  probably try to make it public.  But as we know, thanks to the Patriot Act,  the government has ways to not, to keep this private.  So it may even already be happening.  Well, like everything else, it's gonna.  Don't you think they could go to the Amazon  and say, turn on Stacey's Echo,  and just let's hear everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think that will happen  if that's possible.  I mean, it will happen if it's possible.  Let me just say it more forcefully.  And then once it does happen,  there'll be a court case,  and then it'll go to court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microphone and camera you happen to carry  in your pocket all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's what I was gonna say.  I'm like, there is nothing to stop that  from happening with my phone,  which is why people who are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The phone companies are absolutely  in the back pocket of the government.  So fight it.  Here, take it.  What do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, honestly, if I were reporting  on something really dicey,  like if I were Lawrence Wright,  the guy who writes for the New Yorker  and does all the Al-Qaeda reporting.  I'd be worried.  You know what?  I would not have an Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's.  So that's getting back to this original question,  which we still haven't answered,  which is, is this gonna stop this technology  in its tracks?  Do people care enough?  Are they worried enough?  Are they aware enough that they're just gonna say,  no, we're not gonna buy this?  It hasn't yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the answer is no, it's not gonna stop it.  Because the convenience outweighs it, right?  Yeah, nothing is gonna stop the inevitability  of a world in which we're constantly interacting  with a virtual assistant by voice.  That is happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And at the same time, I think it's safe to say  that there is no measure the government  or security professionals or companies can take  that will keep this stuff private.  So you will be carrying a microphone in your pocket,  wearing it on your head.  It'll be in your living room and maybe all three.  And if a government is determined enough  or a bad guy is determined enough, they'll get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's one of the lessons of the second  to the last WikiLeaks thing about the CIA.  We learned that they can hack TVs  and all that kind of stuff.  Really, the way that a surveillance-minded  or espionage-minded organization thinks about these things  is that, let me see, what microphones are already in place?  There's the phones, there's the TVs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have to put one in if they've already got several.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly, right, it's too crowded, too many microphones.  And so just hack one and you have surveillance.  And there will be people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's gonna be people.  My mom, she drives a car that doesn't have automatic locks  because she doesn't want any electronics in her car.  Really?  Yeah, she's a real interesting character sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But she didn't wanna turn it into Note 7  because she really liked that phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, right, see, I'm like,  people, they are made of contradictions, go figure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you make a great point.  The world, the pre-digital world was understandable.  And a perfect example is bugging phones.  When you used to have to bug a phone,  you had these big phones with a dial  or the rotary dial, the button dial.  And when that phone was hung up,  there was a physical mechanism that prevented you  from using the microphone built into the phone.  So what they did was they'd have to break into the house  or whatever and install a separate microphone  in the hardware of the phone  or inside the receiver of the phone.  And that was doable  because there was a lot of air and space in there.  But unless they, if they couldn't break in,  they couldn't use the microphone present in the phone  because of the physical mechanism.  You could take a phone apart  and see exactly how it was physically disconnected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this gets to not anything terribly newsy,  but something that I spend a lot of time thinking about  because right now I'm watching The Americans  because it's back on and it's an awesome show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we are watching this  and all of the shenanigans they get into  and we're like, God, it must be super hard  to be a spy right now with cameras everywhere.  And the ability, like, I'm like,  we were talking about AT&T got a contract  for an air force base to do, you know,  connected perimeter monitoring.  And I'm like, oh, you know,  think of all the times that you've seen your characters  in a TV show break into, you know,  some highly secure facility  by cutting through the chain link fence.  And I'm like, yeah, not gonna happen anymore.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tradecraft, spy craft has to have changed a lot, but-  Yeah, they won't tell you about it though.  Yeah, right.  I think the bad guys know  that if you wanna have a private conversation,  you go out in the field and you talk to somebody personally.  If you wanna have a private conversation over the internet,  you use PGP or something similar and encrypt.  The people who really wanna have privacy  know how to do it and it's not hard.  Even if, and we talked about this yesterday on Security Now,  Steve and I are both of the opinion.  The UK government is on the verge now  of banning strong encryption  or requiring a government back door.  Russia's already done that.  And I think Steve and I are of the opinion,  given the current climate in Washington, DC,  that's inevitable in the United States as well,  that there will be a law, Congress will pass a law  that will require either a back door  or make strong encryption illegal or both.  And it will make a difference in the cell phone manufacturers.  Apple and Samsung and Google will have to  weaken the security of the cell phone.  It won't stop people from using encryption apps.  You may be illegal to use,  imagine a world where it's illegal to use WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or WhatsApp has-  Can Kerry Docterow imagine this  for one of his little brothers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's little brother, exactly.  But nevertheless, because the math is out there,  the algorithms are simple.  You can write a public key crypto algorithm  on a t-shirt, literally.  So that means that there will be bespoke encryption apps.  In other words, bad guys will not be deterred  because they have an incentive to go the extra mile  to encrypt and provide themselves with privacy.  It will only be us, the good guys, the normal people  who will be surveilled and surveilled  in 100 different ways by 100 different entities.  And I don't see any way to really avoid that.  What really worries me is that the hackers  and malicious actors will also have this,  that we won't be able to protect ourselves any longer  against malicious actors.  If my phone no longer is encrypted,  then everything that's on my phone is available,  not just to government, but to anybody else  who wants to take the trouble to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the aspects about privacy violation  that I think is radically underappreciated by the public  is whether something is able to be done at a mass scale  or has to be targeted.  So, a perfect example is the recent CIA revelations  versus the NSA revelations.  CIA stuff was all targeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  NSA stuff was all a wide net.  Harvest everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And exactly, and that's a huge difference.  And I wrote a column recently about the nature of biometrics.  People think, well, biometrics, biometrics,  fingerprint, face recognition, iris, vein recognition.  There are all these different kinds of biometrics.  But the public needs to understand  that the one type of biometric is really dangerous,  and that is face recognition.  And everything is going toward face recognition now.  And here's why it's dangerous.  It can be done in mass.  You can capture somebody's biometric data, their face,  from 300 yards away with a camera.  Their face is on the internet,  and it can be entered into,  and is being entered into,  various algorithms for identifying face recognition.  There's a website, so there was an interesting hoax  that went around on Facebook the other day, last month,  called Facezam.  And it was a marketing, it was a bad marketing hoax,  publicity stunt type of thing.  But basically it was a story that circulated  that said that anyone could track you down  by just scanning your Facebook photos.  They could take your Facebook photos  and then find you elsewhere on the internet.  Well, what's funny about that is that actually exists.  That's totally doable right now.  So there's a website you can go to called FindFace.  It's a Russian face recognition site.  You can upload somebody's face,  and they'll show you their Twitter account half the time.  Half the time it doesn't work, half the time it does.  But the point is that face recognition  is something that is like NSA harvesting of metadata  on phone and email records.  It can be done by the millions.  And so face recognition really, really should bother people.  It's the least secure,  the most privacy-invading form of biometrics by far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should reiterate that Facezam,  which is by the way a takeoff on Shazam,  the music recognition tool, is a hoax.  It is a hoax.  Telegraph was fooled by this.  But FindFace is real.  FindFace is real.  Well, yeah, I mean we know this is actually  a fairly trivial thing to do, right?  Well, you can do crazy, oh, go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was gonna tell people about crazy contouring  to make their face not recognizable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're the queen of contour.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There again, this is another realization  we're all gonna get to at some point.  The only way to have privacy is through disinformation.  And good makeup. Not protection.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why I always wear heavy makeup  when I'm having my picture taken.  But I give my readers a step-by-step way to,  in about 60 seconds probably,  you can go from having somebody's photo  to having their home address.  Super easy.  Go to FindFace, upload the picture.  They'll show you the Twitter account.  You'll get the full name.  You take the name.  You go to Family Tree Now, run it through the database.  You have their home address.  You have all their relatives.  You have their age.  You have the gender.  You have everything.  Takes no time at all.  This is right now.  So these face recognition algorithms  are getting way better every single year.  They're actually better than the governments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the irony of it.  House Oversight Committee last week  released a report on the FBI's face recognition program  that said approximately half of adult Americans' photographs  are stored in facial recognition databases  that are accessed by the FBI  without their knowledge or consent  in the hunt for suspected criminals.  About 80% of the photos in the network  are non-criminal entries,  including pictures from driver's license and passports.  The algorithms used to identify matches are inaccurate  about 15% of the time.  By the way, that's not bad, 15% of the time,  and are more likely to misidentify black people  than white people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's because Silicon Valley trains  are facial recognition software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They all look alike, right?  No federal law controls this technology.  No court decision limits it.  It's completely out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Facebook's is really amazing.  Facebook's works.  Facebook's is good.  Facebook works, and one of the reasons it works  is it uses artificial intelligence,  and what it does is basically you can show a person,  so people upload lots and lots of pictures,  and they can process those, but you can upload,  so let's say Stacey uploads four pictures of herself  at a party, and her face is present in all of those.  You can take a fifth picture from that party  where her face is not even shown,  and Facebook will identify it,  because it also knows the sweater and the color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all candy, isn't it?  It's gotten very good.  I've noticed that several times on Facebook.  The irony is, as to your original point, Stacey,  Facebook knowing who you are, who you say you are,  is merely annoying.  The government arresting you, saying you match  the picture of the criminal,  and putting you in jail is a lot more than annoying,  so 15% failure rates is significant.  I was gonna say, you said that wasn't so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm like, actually, I feel like that's pretty terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, one in seven we screw up.  No big deal.  It happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you gonna do?  Once you end up in jail, they take your fingerprints  as part of the whole process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is all pretty grim.  Is there any good news?  If I were Amazon, I would say,  well, we better not do the Echo.  That was a bad idea.  If I were Google, I'd say, let's not put voice  on hub and Google Wi-Fi.  Or no, they're gonna go full steam ahead.  We don't have any control of this at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, voice and face recognition are different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but, right, no, I understand.  Voice is probably even more accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they're not able to authenticate on voice yet.  Right.  So we've got time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, Google does authenticate on voice.  I don't know how accurate it is with the Google Assistant.  You can unlock your phone.  So when you install Google Assistant on an Android phone,  it'll say, okay, I know your voice now.  By the way, you only have to say,  okay, you know who three times.  It says, okay, I know your voice now.  Do you want me to unlock your phone  when you ask me for something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, it does offer me that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how accurate it is,  but the point is they're doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is gonna be one of the benefits  of eyeglasses-based interaction with a virtual assistant  because it could be designed  so that it will only receive voice input  from the foot away.  And so you don't have to authenticate your personal voice  and be identified in that way.  Just the fact that it's on your face  means that you're the only one who can talk to it.  And then it goes through bone conduction,  so you're the only one who can hear it.  So there's a level of privacy  that's improved theoretically in one aspect.  Back to the face recognition thing,  there's good news and bad news.  You asked for good news,  but first I'm gonna give you a little bit more bad news,  which is that you really don't have control  with the social networks  because other people can identify you.  So for example, I have pictures of you, Leo,  and I can go in and say, oh, that's Leo Laporte.  And now Facebook knows who I am, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you had nothing to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no opting out.  So you're not allowed to talk to people  other than wearing a clown mask all the time  or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now the good news is this is-  Or good contouring, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Contouring, I was gonna say,  my good news is you can get good contouring videos  in cheap powders online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Next week on Twig,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stacy's gonna show you how to do the contouring,  and I'm gonna teach you how to talk like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, there's actually an artist  who specializes in that sort of thing.  And I'm gonna put his name in the column  that I mentioned a minute ago.  And let me see if I can find the name of this person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounding like Baskets the Clown before we're done.  And looking like Louie Anderson.  It's a designer named Adam Harvey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So a designer named Adam Harvey  has hairstyles and makeup that fools fake recognition.  So there's hair and makeup tips.  Yeah, show it, it's really cool.  Yeah, so Adam Harvey,  Adam Harvey also has fabrics  that fool face recognition computers  and does it in a crazy way.  There's a coat that he has that has,  it looks just like, kind of like camouflage or something.  It has this random pattern,  but face recognition algorithms perceive it  as having faces all over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the problem is you have to walk around  looking like this person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This could be stylish at some point in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, you saw it here first.  How long before this is the fad?  Everybody starts dressing and wearing their hair  in weird, holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so I would totally do some of this stuff.  Like this pixelated makeup the dude is wearing,  I think that's pretty cool.  Or this lady, this tiger lady down here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and would you do the hair like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I already have blue hair.  I just need to make it straight  and comb half of it over my face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Test patterns for stylists.  These block, this is not just like crazy style.  These block face detection algorithms.  OpenCV, eBlearn, VeraLook, and Apple face detection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What the what?  This is crazy.  They learn what eyes look like on a face.  They learn something that with a nose in the spot  and two eyes in this spot and lips,  that this is a person.  And then they track, they match against that.  That's why taking big blocks of color  and putting it in weird spots fools it.  Because it's like, wait, is that the eye?  No, that's the eye.  What's it doing on her cheek?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  The other thing you could do,  and we actually were gonna,  Colleen was gonna build this.  She now ironically works for Facebook.  We were gonna put a, build either a collar  or maybe a little tiara that has UV lights in it.  But you don't see them, human eye doesn't see them,  but blinds cameras, you look like a glowing ball to a camera.  You could, that's another fashion.  I could see people going around wearing headbands  with lights that block cameras.  That's actually probably a really good product.  Let's do the Kickstarter now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's a related thing, and I'm trying to find the video.  I think I saw it at South by Southwest.  It was an IoT device that somebody built  that had, it detected IR from surveillance cameras.  And every time it passed a surveillance camera,  it detected IR and it would tap the person  who was wearing this shirt.  And they would give them a half zip on their shoulder.  So it was like, twitch, twitch, every,  he was walking down the streets of London.  It was pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  If you are gonna do that, chat room's saying  it'd probably be better to use infrared than ultraviolet.  I don't know which would blind a camera.  Pick one end of the spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Clearly there's gonna be an arms race.  This is just bizarre, just bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, we're headed rapidly toward 1984.  I think it's interesting, by the way,  a number of movie theaters in the country  are showing 1984 once again  in a kind of a quiet political statement.  But we are really approaching 1984.  Remember the telescreens in 1984,  you not only watched them, they watched you.  It was a two-way device in your house.  Hey, we've got them now.  It's called a Samsung TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We installed them voluntarily.  And it's ironic that 1984 is one of the great novels  a lot of people are assigned it in high school  and therefore don't remember a word of it.  And so a lot of people are rediscovering it  and reading it again.  But it's ironic that this novel was brought to us  by England, by the UK essentially.  And the UK is essentially, and China maybe,  leading the charge into that very world.  There are more surveillance cameras per square foot  or per person or something in the UK  than anywhere else in the world.  And now they're trying to ban encryption.  So that's kind of like not learning from history  and not learning from literature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it goes both ways.  I mean, I think that maybe the reason 1984  and Brave New World were written by British writers  is because they were well aware of the tendency  in the British state to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyways.  The most surveilled big city in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  London.  So I promise some good news in all this.  And that is that as of today, I believe,  the Google Photos app has a new feature  that uses this in a more convenient way.  So when you open a picture in Google Photos, any photo,  there's always a little information,  the little eye, lowercase eye with a circle.  But that is existed.  But now when you poke that, it'll show you  a screen that shows all the people and what their names are.  And tapping that photo shows you  all the pictures of that person.  So it's a more convenient way to see everything Google knows  about you in terms of face recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, apparently I didn't know this.  Our sponsor Audible is also offering their audio version  of 1984 for free right now.  So highly recommended.  I did not see this Pepsi ad.  Let's watch it together.  This is the Pepsi ad with Kendall Jenner  that was pulled by Pepsi just today  because everybody was so upset over it.  And you're gonna, Stacey,  because you're in charge of Woking Leo.  You're gonna explain, I wouldn't be woke without you.  You're gonna explain why this ad is so horrific.  So we're on a rooftop, a guy's playing the cello.  It's a big city.  There's some sparks.  There's a join the conversation protest.  It's not exactly a protest.  It's join the conversation protest.  Everybody, oh, there's peace signs, okay.  So that's probably non-controversial,  though everybody likes peace.  And then somebody's drawing,  she's making her sign while drinking Pepsi.  And that's Kendall Jenner.  Is that by the way who that is?  Cause I don't, is that?  Yes.  And she's famous because she's Bruce Jenner's daughter?  She's famous cause she's a Kardashian.  She's a Kardashian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, she, yeah, she's the Jenner of the Kardashians.  So she, Kylie and Kendall and Kim and Khloe and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So wait a minute, a Kardashian interbreeded with Jenner?  Oh my God.  That shouldn't be legal.  Is that legal?  It's finessical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's Kris Jenner.  Kris Jenner is Kim Kardashian's mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God, my world is blowing up.  Okay, so she's wearing kind of a metal dress  and she's a model, right?  Which Kendall is a model, right?  Yes.  So she's posing, the photographer's taking pictures of her.  While the protest, oh, the protest is going by.  Join the conversation, the join the conversation protest,  which is a really, as innocuous a protest as you can have.  Yeah, join the, I'm not protesting anything.  I'm just asking you to join the conversation.  But wait a minute, Kendall Jenner has spottled this.  For some reason, there's still a guy playing cello solo  in his, now in his loft warehouse.  Wait a minute, his eye has been drawn  by the join the conversation protest or no,  by a can of black Pepsi.  He's drinking that.  Now he's going to his balcony  of his massive loft in New York City.  Beautiful people are having a cafe lunch.  There's an Islam woman who's wearing a burka,  what do they call it?  Just a little, the head scarf.  Head scarf, yeah.  And then there she is.  Oh, she's disappointed by her photos.  She doesn't like the pictures.  She's looking out the window.  There's the join the conversation protest.  People are very angry  that some people are not joining the protest.  She grabs her camera.  She's going to snap some photos of the,  oh, there's the guy with the cello.  Now he's walking in the guys.  There's somebody break dancing, playing the guitar.  And this is a long damn commercial.  By the way, Pepsi is getting more attention  from this commercial that they got in trouble for  than anything they've ever done before.  Yeah.  This is their, I like to teach the world to sing moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, even more than when Michael Jackson caught on fire.  Oh no, I'll say you're right.  You're right, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they could get this guy's hair to catch on fire then.  So apparently Kendall Jenner has locked eyes  with somebody in the protest.  And he's saying, come on.  Oh, he's the cello guy.  Join me.  Yeah, he's the cello guy.  Is that her?  Yeah.  Okay, she's like eight years old.  Okay, wait a minute.  Her hair has gone from blonde to brunette  for reasons we don't know.  She's wiping off her lipstick.  She's joining the conversation.  Now these are the most peaceful, happy protestors ever,  but for some reason there's a police presence.  Clearly not Berkeley.  So Kendall has decided that she is going to give this  stone cold Fox policeman a Pepsi.  Wow.  I'm touched.  This is the generations coming together.  And then the lady with the.  Hijab.  Hijab, that's it.  Takes the picture.  And the crowd cheers because everyone's hugging.  They're all drinking Pepsi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Leo, by talking about it,  aren't we in fact joining the conversation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have joined the conversation.  We're all joining the Pepsi generation.  Live bolder.  Yeah, there's nothing more bold  than joining the conversation.  That is a bold statement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Drinking Pepsi is pretty bold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Live louder.  Drinking Pepsi is bold.  There's a person with bluish hair in there.  Live for now.  So why is this controversial in the least?  So I think it's just co-opting what many people.  It's co-opting that one beautiful image, right?  Of the African American woman with her dress flowing  and the tech squad coming at her.  That image, right?  Why, it makes me.  I was just gonna say.  I'm just craving.  Oh, Lord.  A fine Pepsi.  Just listen, isn't this refreshing sounding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  That's what a beer sounds like when you crack that open.  That's refreshing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought you said there was only one ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not an ad if you're not getting paid for it.  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I just think that people who are engaging in protests  are awfully touchy about having the whole concept  of protesting being co-opted  by this shameless naked commercialization.  I'll go with you on that.  And so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's also, there's a couple things.  So one, it's co-opting with this stupid.  I mean, if you're gonna say something, Pepsi, say something.  Not a stupid join the conversation.  That's just BS.  And so in people today, they're smart.  They're cynical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would say this is, if before there was Twitter,  there would have been nothing about this ad.  Well, there wasn't had just like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  before there was Twitter and nothing happened.  It's called, I'd like to buy the world a Coke.  There's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the Twitter outrage mill,  which actually is starting to scare me.  Now I agree this is a dopey ad.  I don't think it's particularly controversial.  It's just dopey.  But what I find interesting,  and the reason I'm bringing this up on this show  is because this is Twitter at work, right?  It's completely the Twitter backlash.  When they say there's a backlash, it's all on Twitter.  Yeah.  It's on Facebook too.  Except nobody saw it because...  I really am worried about the power of Twitter  and Twitter outrage.  Yeah.  I wouldn't worry about that.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, good, okay.  Well, I mean, okay.  So people are upset on Twitter.  People are upset on Facebook.  These things come and go.  And I think it gives people an outlet for a time  when they feel like nothing is in their control.  And it also helps promote genuine social awareness  and change in a way.  I think you're just becoming more aware  of how people are different from each other.  And I think what's hard is we still don't treat  the internet like it's real people on the other end.  And I think that's gonna be something  that is decades of change, right?  And it'll happen, hopefully.  I don't know if that made any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does.  And I think it is a good and a bad thing.  I agree with you completely.  I mean, as we get sucked into virtual reality  and into the Twitter sphere and all that kind of stuff,  we have to always do a gut check  and think about what is the actual world  as we experience it like.  For example, I personally talk to lots of people  all the time and not a single one has been outraged  or cared at all about this issue.  Well, my point precisely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If we could just ignore Twitter  and it could just exist in a vacuum or whatever,  do whatever it does,  and it didn't then bleed into the real world,  I wouldn't have a problem with it.  But it's actually, that's the point, right?  That it's exerting undue influence on actual policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't think this is bad.  I don't think it's bad that people said,  hey, yo, Pepsi, your ad sucked  because it was offensive to people  who actually protest and do things they care about.  Used Kendall freaking Jenner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But who cares?  So people do care.  Ads are dopey.  All ads are dopey.  All ads use celebrities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, ads are not just dopey.  Ads actually are a huge part of the cultural conversation.  Think about it.  We still talk about certain, like the Where's the Beef lady,  or we all knew about Michael Jackson and his Pepsi ad.  Nobody would be talking about this Pepsi ad

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if it weren't for the Twitter outrage engine.  It would have just gone away without a trace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the outrage is partly based on the content  of protests nowadays.  So for example, yes, we have this trivialized culture,  but there are people out there  trying to affect meaningful change.  And people who are deeply invested  in the Black Lives Matter movement  see these protests as a kind of surrogate  for the kind of protests they've done.  And what they're marching for is,  I mean, it's a very big, heavy thing.  Or a lot of people are protesting the president.  So maybe this is a bad example,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but you guys, don't you agree  that the Twitter outrage engine  is given disproportionate power in the media?  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, because it's easy to find a story.  Like here's a great example.  It's lazy reporting.  Is the United kicking the girls off the airline  for wearing leggings that are traveling  on a travel trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of the instant outrage engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I could not believe that this story,  quote unquote, had legs.  Ha ha ha.  And made it over, I mean, granted it was a weekend,  so slow news, but, and yes,  I think United was totally in the wrong.  But I was like, what the heck is happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People, look, people always are outraged.  People wake up and they have outrage  before their Wheaties.  The difference is that now they have this outlet.  And most important,  that by itself would be meaningless.  And most importantly, the news media picks it up and says,  people are outraged instead of some grumpy people tweeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well then what about Fox News?  Fox News and public TV kind of news  is the original outrage machine.  I mean, think about, maybe it's slightly less trivial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've probably read this, Joseph Bernstein Buzzfeed.  Nevermind the Russians meet the bot king  who helps Trump win Twitter.  Did you read about this guy?  Microchip?  So this guy is a Midwestern, not a Russian, Midwestern guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't look it up on Twitter though, it's gone.  They took it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but they take it down all the time  and he comes back all the time.  He's been banned countless numbers of time.  The example they're giving  is the most recent Susan Rice unmasking.  He decided that, he decided,  this guy decided that was gonna be a story.  So he began blasting out dozens of tweets and retweets.  He tweets, it would be nice to get Susan Rice trending.  And then he did it.  Now this guy is apparently a web developer with good skills.  He hides his traces very well  so that nobody is really able to figure out his real identity.  He agreed to talk to Buzzfeed  because he's a publicity junkie as well.  Over 24 hours following his own call to arms,  Microchip tweeted or retweeted  more than 300 times about Rice,  including everything from a Photoshopped image  of Donald Trump eating her head out of a taco bowl  to demands that she die in jail,  almost always accompanied by the tag, hashtag Susan Rice.  And then he implored others to do this.  These are the tweets.  This is one, this Micro Magic jingle is gone,  but he'll have another account  because it's very easy to create accounts on Twitter.  By 9 a.m., the next day,  the tag was tweeted 20,000 times an hour,  was trending on Twitter, 34,000 times an hour by 11 a.m.  And then it got the most important retweet of all,  the retweet from the president.  And this basically, here's his triumphant tweet  that evening, starting with a single Cernovich article,  we knocked this one out of the park,  we can do this every day just like we did before.  And it becomes a story.  They know how to make it a story.  And this guy is one guy who's manipulating Twitter.  He says, so Buzzfeed News got an interview with him.  And he says, I feel like I'm a scientist  showing electricity to natives  that have been convinced electricity is created by Satan,  so they murder the scientist.  He says he's discovered how to manipulate and use Twitter.  He says, it's all us, not Russians,  and we're not gonna stop.  Now, I'm not bashing on Twitter again.  I know you don't like that, but I'm not doing that.  Because it's not Twitter's fault.  Twitter just exists like any social network.  It's really the fault of the media  that gives us all this weight,  because this is just a guy running a bunch of bots.  But it's given weight.  Twitter's outraged.  And actually, they don't ever say Twitter's outraged,  because they know that would mean,  that would diminish the importance of the article.  They say people are outraged.  Thousands of people are protesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Leo, I know that there's a certain amount of fatigue  around bashing Twitter, but why isn't it Twitter's fault?  We can't wait until every human being is virtuous,  because we've been waiting a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it wouldn't be a problem if it weren't picked up  and then covered by mainstream media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it wouldn't go viral if Twitter were able to block bots.  Well, Twitter could do a better job with this guy.  For example, you look at Google Plus or Facebook.  Facebook has a real names policy.  Google Plus used to.  Google Plus is totally closed outside, so is Facebook.  So doing bots and things like that is a little harder.  I think there's just a lot more,  there's so much damage that's done  for a nominal benefit by Twitter.  And so I think that the media's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, this guy has, he showed Buzzfeed  dozens of accounts he has ready to take over  when he gets suspended,  because he always does get suspended, but he uses VPNs.  He hides his name.  And this is the payoff quote.  Microchip says he has an ideal platform on Twitter  in which to shape a message.  Quote, Twitter is easier than other social networks  and more volatile, he said.  Emotions run high at 140 characters.  The chaos is perfect.  That is true.  So if you're worried about fake news, fine.  But these are perfect platforms for manipulation.  Yeah.  Microchip says I can make whatever claims I wanna make.  This is how the game works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is why I don't source my stories from Twitter.  Right, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all I'm saying.  Stop sourcing stories from Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But bloggers and journalists are not gonna do that.  So the media-  That's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the challenge is, here's one of the challenges.  You have to decide, like, the original people reporting  on this are media organizations with an agenda.  One.  Two, when you're a reputable news organization,  you assess, like, is this a tempest in a teapot  or is this part of a deeper issue  that's important to lots of people?  And that's how you should, I mean, you can't just say  I can't source anything on Twitter.  I have to ignore Twitter.  I think it's a good indicator of where the zeitgeist is.  But then you have to do actual reporting around it.  And I don't think that's like-  Hey, zeitgeist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, isn't Twitter a bubble?  Everybody always says, oh, Silicon Valley's a bubble  and they're not real people.  Twitter only has, what, how many active users a month?  300 million monthly active users.  Max.  And half of those are bots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the other half are journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't, it reflects a limited zeitgeist.  I mean, it's not how people in the real world are thinking,  or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, this is the problem.  So there are journalists and there are people in the public  who don't think, oh, there's this problem  that people are sending out these bots.  What they think is, oh, this is true.  This is the truth.  Getting past the dishonest media.  Right.  And it's a democratizing platform  and enough of it circulates to make it a phenomenon.  So even if the mainstream media,  some of these things are so viral  that it's actually a dereliction  to not cover the virality of the message  that's going out there.  I mean, the fact that lots of people are repeating  and sharing this information itself  is in fact legitimate news.  Which as you see on the main street,  on the cable news shows,  just covering the fact that something is fake news story  legitimizes the fake news story.  That's just the nature of that medium.  There was a great piece circulating today  pointing out why comedians are so much better  at covering fake news and false statements  by politicians and others,  because they don't have this sense of fairness  that the media requires.  The sense of fairness is being manipulated  by the fake news crowd and the propagandists  and they almost can't help it.  Whereas comedians can go right for the jugular  and say, oh, this is ridiculous.  I saw that article, it was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Although that's partly also because comedians  have no responsibility to be accurate or balanced  or informed or have facts or any of that stuff.  They just have to be funny.  It's a lot easier if that's the only requirement.  Newmark, founder of Craigslist,  has teamed up with Mozilla and Facebook  to launch a $14 million fund  to support, they say, news integrity.  They don't wanna use the fake news term.  The news integrity initiative will be,  it was created with the goal of increasing trust  in journalism worldwide and better informing  the public conversation.  I think they've already given a chunk of change.  By the way, this is, I should disclaim this,  that Jeff Jarvis is involved in this.  The CUNY Graduate School of Journalism  is administering the project  and Jeff is very intimately involved in it.  We're gonna ask him about it next week.  He asked me, to his great credit,  he emailed me when this was announced and said,  I'm really excited about this,  but if you feel that this disqualifies me from Twig,  I'll be glad to resign.  I said no, absolutely not.  I guess his concern is the relationship with Facebook,  but he says, of course,  and I'll continue to be skewer Facebook as much as I want.  It is being called the Facebook Journalism Project.  And who did they, they gave some money to,  so Arizona State's working out at the Center  for Community and Ethnic Media at CUNY,  the Constructive Institute at Aarhus University in Denmark,  Edelman based in the Edelman, interesting, big PR firm.  Lots of universities and schools.  Weber-Shandwick, another PR firm.  What are my PR firms are interested in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Having a credible media that you can talk to  is probably better for them than having.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, good.  I like that, I hope that's true.  Beta Works involved as well,  the Democracy Fund, the Ford Foundation.  And I'll be, you know what,  we'll talk about it when Jeff gets back next week.  I would like to understand what they're gonna try to do.  I guess what they're doing is giving out  some chunks of change to people that are doing good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And my guess also is that they're gonna try to figure out  what is the problem really,  and how can it be best addressed,  and it spreads best practices among journalists.  Now, one of the things that I think is interesting  is that there's, you know,  the fake news label has been thrown in the other direction,  by the president and others,  basically confusing like what's fake news,  and people now disagree,  it's a point of disagreement about  whether the mainstream media is fake news or real news,  and whether the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was always uncomfortable with that term,  fake news, and that's exactly why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but-  It's in the eye of the beholder.  It's interesting to see who's driving initiatives like this  and who isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I will say this debate over objective journalism,  over perspectives and where you're coming from,  has been around at least as long as I've been  in journalism, which is like 20 something years,  and probably as long as Leo's been in journalism.  Which is like a hundred years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I've quoted this before,  but the first fake news appeared  in the very first newspaper in 1832,  where there was a newspaper where New York City  and the Herald published a story,  apparently that there was a very powerful microscope,  and we've discovered life on Mars  and had a series of articles  about the Martians in order to build circulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that was the good kind of fake news.  You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You just have to be accurate.  The challenge is-  No, no, no, no.  Our world has gotten so complicated that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe an accurate news reporting can be fake news.  Okay.  I'll let you finish and then I'll-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm gonna try to be sincere and not cynical here,  but what's happening?  Our world is so complicated.  I can report a series of facts,  and because those facts influence things like policy,  people will interpret it different ways  or find ways to take what I'm saying.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be interpreted as polemic instead of reporting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is a challenge.  It's a challenge that's only gotten worse  with a president who has decided not to respect  the historical, accurate news organizations of our time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would go farther with a president  who has decided not to respect facts in any way.  Okay, well, that's true.  I mean, but this is really, it's not a trivial thing.  No, it's-  If the leadership lies to you that blatantly,  so much so that you start to doubt, it's gaslighting,  so much so that you start to doubt your own mental faculties,  that is a huge problem.  It's a much bigger problem than fake news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, I mean,  I talked to my dad who is a Trump supporter,  actually for the first time in like,  since Trump was inaugurated and initiated his Muslim band,  and it was astonishing the different level of facts  my dad is working with that is leading him  to the conclusions that he's been making.  Even which are the stories that matter?  I mean, we can talk about stories,  and his frame of reference is completely different than mine.  And I, of course, am like, am I crazy?  Where, wait-  It's inadvertent gaslighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is he crazy?  It is. It is.  And it's why we can't, it's why we have this growing chasm  in America because we aren't even talking  about the same things anymore.  His facts aren't your facts anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, and it's very frustrating  because there's no way,  because both of us can agree on things  not in the abstract, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like, so-  Is the sky blue?  Is the sun up?  Is it the sun down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, I was gonna, you know,  an issue is a friend of mine who is Muslim  and who is an American citizen,  he no longer can travel because he gets stopped.  Like, for business, it is inefficient for him  to leave the country right now.  It's shocking.  And it's distressing.  He is a CEO of a company.  It's truly distressing.  And my dad can agree that that is distressing to him  and feel bad that a guy he knows has that problem,  but he can't take that and tie it to the greater policies  because those facts are completely different.  And it's, it is,  I don't, it is, it's inadvertent gaslighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and I try to put myself in the position,  and I also have no friends and close to many people  who voted for Trump and who support him as president.  And I understand that what they really like  is the traditional conservative point of view  of small government and less regulation and all that stuff.  And they're kind of, I have to think at some point,  they're just kind of a little bit holding their nose  and trying to ignore the conflicts of interest,  the corruption, the weird tweeting,  and just kind of saying, well,  that's just what we have to put up.  Every president has got some skeletons in their closet.  Bill Clinton was no winner either,  but because they support my political leanings,  then I'm gonna support this guy  because in the long run, we're gonna get what we want,  which is a smaller government and less regulation,  and we're gonna get a more conservative Supreme Court,  and that's gonna be good.  And so the guy's a lunatic,  but they never wanna think that.  I'm sure your dad doesn't think  that there's something wrong with Donald Trump,  but they're just kind of willfully kind of saying,  just won't pay too much attention to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of Trump supporters know  that he's a shameless con man,  but they think, well, he's our shameless con.  Yeah, he's a salesman.  So one of the things that,  we talked about accidental fake news.  I'm really concerned mostly with the real kind.  This concept was launched by the KGB years ago.  It's called disinformation,  and the Russians have kind of perfected it.  And the way this works is that you have multiple  credible sounding versions of every single event.  And a perfect example was when that Malaysia Airlines plane  was shot down over the Ukraine some time ago,  and the Russian news had five or six  or 10 different explanations  for what caught John Podesta did it.  There were all these different.  Podesta did it, really?  There are all these, well,  I didn't read them, I don't read Russian,  but there are all these multiple plausible explanations.  And so depending on your political leanings  and your political loyalties and who you were.  I heard it was Don and Briseal, but okay, go ahead.  It was Don and Briseal.  And so you pick the one that you like the best,  and there's no truth.  And every time anybody tries to say,  well, no, the Russians shot it down,  they trucked in the thing.  No, no, no, that's what they want you to believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at people who think that 9-11 was an inside job.  Or, I feel so bad for the parents and families  in Sandy Hook who just this other,  this just yesterday said,  please, can you stop spreading the news,  the fake conspiracy theory  that this was a false flag government operation.  Our children died.  This was not a false flag.  And it makes me so sad, but go to YouTube.  There's, someone's just saying there's videos,  there's hours of videos about how the earth is flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Demonstrably false, but people believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess it's human.  I don't know.  I guess it's human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there are actually some really good books  about this right now.  I will come with a reading list next time  because I can't remember the names of them right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good.  Well, the big picture is that this is the great challenge  of our generation of journalism.  We have to figure out how to communicate the truth  and also take into account alternative perspectives  and find the difference between alternative perspectives.  There are things that are debatable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is God exists, that's debatable.  We can have a debate, we have a conversation.  But then there are things that are not debatable.  The earth is not flat.  That's not really up for coverage.  That's demonstrably, infactually incorrect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have, I'm a partisan for not only newspapers,  but also print newspapers.  And I've been subscribing to the New York Times  and other publications for many, many years.  And I think that we had the solution  and we are eager to flush that solution down the toilet.  When you subscribe to several newspapers and news magazines  that are of high quality and that run the political spectrum,  subscribe to Reason and the National Review,  but also the New Yorker and the Atlantic Monthly  and the New York Times and maybe the Post  or whatever it is, choose credible publications  and then read them from front to back.  You are, you're getting great perspective.  You're getting the legitimate,  and we're so eager to get rid of that  and get our news on Facebook, which is a terrible idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, by, I mean, people think that,  Infowars is a legitimate publication.  And the people who believe that sincerely believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Including our president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, I mean, it's one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is anybody watching Homeland?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they talk about Alex Jones on Homeland?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have an Alex Jones type person  who's in cahoots with a shady operative.  I won't give too many spoilers,  but it's Alex Jones on crack.  I mean, it is like so scary what they're depicting  in that show and it's kind of sort of  what's happening in the world globally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Has this always been, this is always,  I mean, this must always have been part  of the human experience, right?  And it's always been.  But we didn't have viral news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we didn't have a president who believed in it.  I don't know if that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, we don't know.  Maybe Andrew Jackson really believed  the Red Indians were to Satan's spawn.  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I believe that Andrew Jackson  actually probably thought that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did.  He killed, he created the Trail of Tears.  I mean, and by the way, the hero,  his portrait hangs in the Oval Office.  But I'm just saying that we just didn't know  because we didn't have all this electronic media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we know too much.  We know too much.  So many, so often, and I'm the worst person for this  because I read a thousand stories a day.  I mean, I'm like, I'm so into information overload  and reading all this stuff.  And sometimes I'm reading a story and I'm like,  you know, some kid lost his puppy and whatever.  I would never be reading about this.  I know.  Why is this of general interest?  It's all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's called using Facebook, Mike.  Why would I be reading this?  That's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I would never see this.  And then you go to the next,  and then it passes and you go to the next thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For a while, one brief shining utopian moment,  I thought that we were gonna live in a society  where facts had become commoditized  because they were so readily available  and everybody could agree on them.  And this would make for a marvelous future  where we didn't have to worry about fact gathering.  I remember my father-in-law, when he first saw an iPad  and he was looking, like he was one of the science apps,  and he was saying, man, if Copernicus had had this,  he would have had all the data he needed to come to  to figure out that the earth revolved the sun.  He wouldn't have had to grind all that glass  and spend his entire lifetime making telescopes.  And so we were gonna live in this era  where all of this information was available.  And then now the highest aspiration,  where humans could start to really excel  is to start to being data synthesis machines.  And we'd come up with brilliant new insights  and instead we just can't agree on the facts anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we can when it comes to technology.  I mean, like look at the toaster challenge  where you try to get people to build a toaster.  I mean, we're doing-  I know, that's hysterical, isn't it?  We're making really awesome things  based on our synthesis of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know why that is?  Because in technology, and this is why I love engineers,  it either works or it doesn't work.  Right.  It's very black and white.  So you don't ever have to say, well, I think I can fly  because you either can or you can't.  And if you don't have the technology, you'll never fly.  So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It also has to be said that today's Copernicus's  are not spending all their time  on Facebook getting fake news.  That glorious world where all the facts are available  to the Copernicus's of the world exists  and they're out there taking advantage of it.  It's a wonderful world and it's also a sewer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I hope that's true.  And I hope that maybe that's kind of what I was saying  in the beginning, which is maybe if we all spend  a little less time paying attention to what Twitter,  Twitter outrage, you know, storms  and Facebook happy dog pictures,  maybe we could start actually making some progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, cause it's outrageous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, maybe we wanna talk about like-  I wanna talk about something good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google TV, how about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I was gonna say Google Home has some cool stuff.  Yeah, let's-  Google TV works too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No more, no more a big-  This show is really an interesting mix  of big subjects like that and then,  hey, you wanna see the new phone?  This thing's cool.  So that's what's fun about this show.  You never know what you're gonna get.  Stacey Higginbotham is here from Stacey on IoT.  She's at the IoTpodcast.com.  Great show she does with Kevin Toffle,  writes about IoT and is a brilliant and inspiring journalist.  And we're thrilled to have her on the show.  I would say exactly the same about my good friend,  Mike Elgin, who has found a lifestyle that we all envy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Damn you.  Travel the world.  Yep.  And eat everything.  Oh man, gastronomad.net and you'll see his-  In fact, you wrote a piece on why YouTube TV matters,  which we will talk about.  They just launched it and I signed up immediately.  So we'll talk about shiny things.  Happy things.  Happy, shiny people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, shiny, happy people.  Okay, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got the facts wrong.  Waze is gonna be in Android Auto.  Nice.  Who's got Android Auto?  Nobody.  Just checking.  Well, we have our own, we're in our own little world.  Did you see that, both Stacey and I drive Teslas,  did you see that Elon has started a new company  to facilitate the brain, the bio chip interface?  I thought that was an April Fools joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it?  That wasn't Neuralink or is it Neuralink?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, did I get fooled?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hold on.  I thought I saw- I freaking hate,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I freaking hate April Fools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, no, no, it might be real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it's a fake, then he spent a lot of energy  on building the website.  I can't wait for the mental autopilot.  No, this is what we wanted.  This is what's in sci-fi.  I wanna jack in.  Forget the visor and the HoloLens,  Google Glass, the EarPods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're worried about government surveillance  because we have cameras and microphones,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you wait as it gets inside your head.  I don't care, it'll be worth it.  They can read my mind, I don't care.  I just want the metaverse, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like that guy in the Matrix,  I don't wanna remember nothing.  Plug me into the Power Plan,  I don't wanna remember nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give me the blue pill.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage  from Quicken Loans.  Great mortgage lender, the best in the country.  Just look at all those JD Power  customer satisfaction awards year after year after year.  And they put together a product for you.  If you're buying a house or refining  and you wanna do it all online, this is amazing.  Now I know some people wanna meet your mortgage lender,  I don't know why.  You wanna go through, you love the nostalgia  of going through your old bank statements and pay stubs  and finding all the paperwork.  Oh, remember that week, that was a great week.  We really got paid that week.  Be my guest, but if you would love to do this all online,  submit all the paperwork with a touch of a finger  and get it done in minutes instead of days, weeks, months.

I wish Rocket Mortgage had been around then.  Believe me, from now on, Rocket Mortgage,  go to quickandloans.com slash twig, do it all online,  friction free, it only takes minutes to get approved  for a mortgage that's just right for you.

I wish I were getting paid for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They would make you slurp it more quietly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little more slurp-a-licious.  Mike, I think you muted your mic there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There it is, yep, thank you.  Yeah, so YouTube TV.  YouTube TV was announced about a month ago.  Nobody knew when it was gonna launch or where,  and it has launched today in five American cities.  I think that everybody in the nation, in the US,  can sign up, but you only get local programming  from the area of one of those cities.  So if you're- New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bay Area, Chicago, and Philadelphia.  AMC is gonna be on the network.  It's kind of right now, it's kind of the sports  and locals network with a little news thrown in.  It's got all the news networks as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, but I believe that this is really, really,  really bad news for the cable TV industry  and a really, really big deal,  much bigger than people realize,  and I'm gonna tell you exactly why.  Now, just a quick roundup of what it is.  It's 40 channels for the basic-  35 bucks. Package, 35 bucks,  and that's five accounts, each of which has unlimited DVR.  You can watch three of them simultaneously.  You can watch it on a phone, on a tablet,  on a TV with Chromecast, et cetera.  It has ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, the CW, ESPN, USA, Bravo,  et cetera, et cetera, Disney Channel, on and on.  It does not have HGTV.  No, but it has Oprah.  What else you need?  It does not have HBO, AMC, MTV, et cetera.  It has Bravo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, at least you get Desperate Housewives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come on. Yeah, and some cooking shows.  HGTV is super hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It also has a DVR functionality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unlimited storage for the DVR.  And each of the accounts can have its own DVR.  So each of your kids can have their own unlimited DVR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's say I am an Archer fan, which I am,  and I wanna record Archer.  I could just click it to, boom, I press the plus button.  It will now record every Archer episode,  and I will have that available to me to watch Time Shifted.  Oh, this is for you, Stacey.  Total Divas.  You like that?  Let's add, I don't know,  but I think you're gonna wanna watch it.  Add Total Divas to my DVR.  The NCAA Championships, Modern.  So this, and it's got live locals, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is amazing.  Does it have live locals for sports?  Yes.  Because on MLB Live,  your baseball games are blocked out if you're...  Oh, it might, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good question.  Because that is a little bit of a problem.  That's annoying.  Sometimes they promise that they've got  Major League Baseball, but then you get blacked out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're probably going to be some of that,  but probably less than on other services.  The sports coverage is really pretty good.  This is the sports package.  ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNNU, the Big Ten Networks, SEC Network.  There's much better college coverage and coverage of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fox Sports, one and two, and NBC Sports.  Here in the Bay Area, we've got the Bay Area Networks,  so we can watch Giants Baseball, Warriors Basketball,  CBS Sports Network.  It's even got golf.  It's got the kids' stuff, Sprouts, Disney.  It's got-  Phineas and Ferb!  Phineas and Ferb, baby!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's such a funny show.  The thing that I think that movies and TV shows  are becoming more and more available on multiple places,  you name it, Hulu, et cetera.  But what's becoming more rare and valuable  is that we're seeing the same things  on TV shows, event television, including sports.  So the Oscars, the Olympics, the Super Bowl.  That's the missing piece from any court coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can get Netflix, you can get HBO.  This provides almost all of it.  And I can compare this to PlayStation Vue,  AT&T's Direct TV.  There's three or four of these services now,  but this is Google.  The UI is spectacular.  So here I am.  This is my cable guide.  So I hover over it and now I'm watching it.  It's actually playing as a preview.  I get a great, it says 17 minutes left.  I get a great description of it.  I can see if I wanna watch it.  I see what's next.  I can DVR it from here.  I can go full screen.  This is how, when Steve Jobs said, I've licked TV,  this is what I would have imagined Apple would have done.  And Apple is-  This is what he would have licked.  This is, Apple has not been able to put this together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the thing that's powerful about this  is that people under the age of 30 are obsessed with YouTube.  But as they get older and start families  and go to college and all that kind of stuff,  they're gonna wanna watch more mainstream TV,  but they love YouTube already.  And so they're gonna start watching their live TV  and their cable TV on YouTube.  This is very devastating to the cable providers.  I think one of the things it's gonna do is finally  turn phones into a legitimate and widespread medium  for live TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because this will work on my mobile device.  Might even sell some iPads, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It might.  It'll work on all these mobile devices.  The other thing that's really devastating to cable,  and I think it's really underappreciated  and underreported by all those fake news people,  is the fact that their advertising abilities  are through the roof.  The advertising industry has been championing the bit  for years to get, for Google and YouTube  to launch exactly this.  Their data on the users is amazing.  And they'll be able to very tightly target advertising,  and YouTube will be able to charge a fortune  for advertising because it'll be so tightly  and accurately targeted at the demographics of the viewers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't, the premium channel's a little bit lacking.  They have showtime, they do not have HBO.  You'd have to buy HBO now.  I mean, at 35 bucks, this is the least expensive offering.  This beats PlayStation's lowest offering at 39.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So for NFL fans, you'll fall under blackouts on mobiles  because Verizon has this.  I'm still trying to figure out the blackout situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, good luck, because it's terrible.  So look at this, though.  Here's sports on now, and I'm actually getting live  mini feeds of the Giants game, the athletics game,  the NCAA championships.  Here's ESPN, soccer, and Total Divas is apparently  a sports show.  I don't know if that's the case, but it's in there, right?  And these are all-  I'm not sure I'd like that show.  Yeah, these are all live.  I think that's what they call soccer.  Yeah, Total Divas.  Oh, that's right.  It's the drop and flop.  This is the UI that, you nailed it, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my God, Total Divas is a sports show.  I had to look it up, sorry.  It is a docu-series following the top female WWE superstars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, but it's wrestling, so it's kind of got  a little bit of both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like reality TV on reality TV.  Yeah.  This would not interest me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The title of this episode, season six, episode seven,  a win-wine situation, so you be the judge.  Now, I have to say, for the YouTube generation,  YouTube's mixed right in, including the YouTube originals,  right?  Shows on YouTube, YouTube videos.  I could see my son, my 22-year-old son,  who does not watch TV, he watches YouTube.  This is what he wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the beauty of it is that that family plan,  the kids are gonna be nagging the parents  to get the family plan.  The $35 a month covers five people,  so each of the kids gets their own separate account,  their own DVR.  This is big news.  This is gonna be really popular, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the big issue I see,  is this is a lean forward experience on mobile  and even on computer.  What is the lean back experience?  Do I watch it on Chromecast, Android TV?  I guess Android TV, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, and Chromecast, and Google said  that they're gonna be making announcements  this year of additional TVs.  So I have a shield at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This'll probably be now on my shield,  because I have YouTube on there.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I do think that the subtle play here  is a behavioral one, and I do think it's gonna turn  live TV and event TV into a lean back experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Getting the live locals is a big deal.  Now I'm in the San Francisco area of dominant influence,  but we are 50 miles north of San Francisco.  We can't over the air get any San Francisco stations.  So up in here in Petaluma,  but I am getting the locals.  I'm in the San Francisco Bay area,  so that's really interesting.  That's awesome.  This could replace cable for me.  This is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Bay area coverage seems to be much broader  than the other metro coverage.  Yeah, they call it Bay area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow, this is just in the nick of time  for baseball season to start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't have MLB live?  Not anymore.  I mean, it is expensive.  Not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's $149 for the season.  This is $35 a month.  I guess it's the same.  But I get a lot of other stuff.  It sounds cheaper though, doesn't it?  Even how long baseball season is.  Sounds and sounds cheaper though.  They should have a weekly rate.  That'd be really cheap.  Wow, and I have to say,  I played with, for iOS today, we did a review.  I did a review of all of the streaming packages,  PlayStation Vue, which I think was until now the best.  AT&T Direct TV, which did not work very well.  And a lot of people continue to complain  that it's not working very well,  that it's not playing, that there are bugs.  Who else?  Slingbox, Sling TV.  What are some of the other?  I think that's the big three right there,  Sling TV, Vue, and AT&T.  This one beats them up, down, and sideways.  It's in every respect.  Plus it's cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, here's another subtle benefit.  You can pause it.  So if you're gonna be out of the country  for a month or two,  you can not pay during those months.  And if you don't,  if nobody on your family account logs in for three months,  they automatically pause it.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is very anti-cable company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, this is where competition really,  we really benefit from that.  And so here's some movies.  Let's say I did wanna see The Matrix.  They know they're geek audience.  I click on it, it's gonna be on Syfy.  I just press the plus button and now it's DVR'd.  That's it, it's simple as that.  Wow, is right.  Now I'd be interested if I'll be able to skip commercials.  Then they also have- Yeah, that was not known.  Yeah, related on YouTube.  And here's all the YouTube content.  So this is a great cross promotion for YouTube.  And then there's more information about the cast.  This is exactly what the online consuming TV audience  is now kind of expecting, right?  Now, Leo, imagine- Unless it has a lot of advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, but it does- Imagine if they bought Twitter  and integrated Twitter into that experience.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How great that would be.  Oh, that's what's missing from this  is a kind of real time interactivity.  And outrage.  How dare they put Lauren Lake's-  How dare they put Lauren Lake's Paternity Court on at 4.30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, time doesn't matter.  Not anymore.  I still remember my daughter saying to me,  probably like when she was like six or seven,  she's like, I really, I feel,  cause we've been court cutters forever.  I feel really sorry for my friends  who have to watch television shows when they're on.  I was like, what are you talking about?  Also, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you get a first month's free.  So I'm on the free trial.  By the way, most of these other services,  in fact, all of the other services  have one week free trial.  So in every respect, YouTube has clearly paid attention  to what's going on out there.  Apple really wanted to launch this by the way.  But even if Apple does launch exactly the same service,  it'll be limited to Apple TV.  They don't have YouTube.  And they don't have YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh wait, I could do this instead of Hulu.  Sorry, my brain just clicked on it.  Although it's kind of more expensive compared.  Cause I use Hulu as my network TV,  but I get so irritated because they,  you know, they window things that if you don't catch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't know, see it's not in Austin yet.  So New York, LA, San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't get that or Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're gonna have AMC, which is,  that's the Walking Dead crowd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But again, Stacey, I'm pretty sure  you can just get the Chicago one.  Really, is that the case?  Pretty sure, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have to be in that area.  Why don't you try that right now, Stacey.  TV.YouTube.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TV.YouTube.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hulu is working on its own.  This is, these are called Skinny Bundles.  Terrible name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Try one month free.  Oh my God, but I've got to pick one  of my eight Google accounts.  I guess my personal one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's one month free.  Just remember to cancel it in a month.  What I did is I sent reminders  to cancel all of those other services  because I did not want to have this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh wait, hold on.  Now I've picked my account.  It's asking me about my location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They guessed my location wrong,  but it is not available in my area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So they're not letting you do it.  So what if you tell them that you're in Chicago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Give me a zip code for Chicago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the Spiegel catalog, right?  I'm not even going to get it.  Spiegel catalog, Chicago, Illinois, 60601.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Chicago era.  YouTube TV is available in my area,  but unfortunately you're going to have to wait  until you're home to sign up.  I can't fool you, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what if you use VPN?  Yes, I could.  VPN, but that's not going to be satisfactory.  The question really is how soon  do they roll this out nationwide?  And will they?  I suspect that they have to make these negotiations  with the locals in each market, right?  Or no?  You can't go to CBS and say,  hey, can we run KPIX, our local CBS station?  Let's see what the quality is.  It's starting off not great.  And remember, we have it.  Oh, but I can, the auto 360, I can go up to 480p.  I don't see HD.  That might be another issue.  So Judge Judy doesn't look as good as she oughta.  Is that Judge Judy?  That's not Judge Judy.  No, I don't know who it is.  You're asking the wrong guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Judge Judy said she's older and has shorter hair.  Who is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the People's Court.  This is the Wapner replacement.  Time for Wapner.  Judge Judy's coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay, yeah, that's Judge Judy.  I was like, that's Judge Judy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got fooled.  What are you thinking?  Close captioning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many pets when you're already in,  you're over your head and just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Audio track primary, I guess I can do,  let's see if that sounds in Spanish.  So then he-  Subtitles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He called me, he said he was unhappy.  He wanted to come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, watch.  This is the way to watch it.  I can watch it at double speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He said, in the meantime, while you're at your job,  you would have a kid, he'd-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God, that would be awesome for all those realities

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  when he shows that we replay everything a million times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish they would make the voices twice as high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then his behavior just became erratic.  He was, as close he would sit up, start talking,  rambling.  At one point he took a pack of frozen meat.  That's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why are you acting like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why are you acting like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why are you doing this to me?  That's really interesting.  YouTube TV.  Wow, I think this might be a killer.  And I have to say, I've seen Google do some stupid things,  but this is a killer product.  Yep, yep.  By the way, you can get a Chromecast if you sign up, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The $70 one or the $35 non-aged?  Oh, I don't know.  I mean, they're giving those $35 ones away.  Yeah.  Very interesting.  Hey, you know what else they're giving away?  What?  A Google Home if you buy an LG, is it 6?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah, let's go.  B6, the LG, those are the,  I have, that's what I have is a B6,  but they also make a, I think a G6.  These are the 4K LG TVs.  They're really nice.  By the way, can I say, completely off the subject,  but if you do get a 4K UHD TV  and you get a 4K UHD Blu-ray player, you need both.  You must get BBC's Planet Earth series, the new one.  They reshot the whole thing in 4K.  You're all invited to my house.  You have, it's incredible.  Thank God, I never have to leave the house again.  I don't care about the visa situation.  I could just stay in my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you have to come to the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's beautiful.  Oh yeah, I come here.  That's okay.  So far there's no border patrol between here and my house.  They're not gonna get  that extreme vetting thing through, are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, okay.  Hey, let's talk about something that's not political.  Okay, thank you.  You're gonna depress me.  I can't handle this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know, I understand.  I understand.  But really, I don't think we'll have,  I would never come visit the US  if I had to give them my social media passwords.  Your social media password,  you have to give them your Facebook and Twitter password.  If you're visiting, if you're a Frenchman,  now they're not gonna,  there's no way this gets through,  but this is what the White House is proposing.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Stacey.  But if you're a Frenchman-  Why do you think it won't get through?  Because it's insane.  No one will ever visit the US again.  Every academic conference will have to be canceled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's called the Trump slump.  They're facing billions of dollars in lost revenue  in the hospitality industry  because people are canceling their vacations to the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, imagine now, if you were coming,  and it's not from Muslim countries,  if you were coming from France,  an ally nation, the UK, in the United States,  the border patrol can say,  give me your social media passwords.  I wanna see your context list to see who you've talked to.  And by the way, tell me about your politics.  Do you like President Trump?  And if for any reason at all, at any point,  you say no, bye-bye, you're going home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And other countries will copy and retaliate.  That's the worst thing.  I'm worried about traveling.  Exactly.  So again, the best defense is disinformation.  Have a second Twitter account,  a second Facebook account that's really sanitized.  Don't lie to these guys, then they could throw you in jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we're, oh my God.  Anyway, don't get me started.  You're right, Stacey.  Sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm also concerned  because I'm gonna be flying to Morocco.  Morocco is one of the countries on the list where,  on certain airlines out of Morocco,  you can't have a laptop.  So I'm gonna check my MacBook Pro.  Morocco's on that list?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  But not if you fly American Airlines.  If you fly United, Delta, American.  Go ahead, because you're a good person.  So you can have a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But again, I think these things,  they spread globally to other countries, other airlines.  And so I just don't like the whole trend of passwords  and no laptops on the, it's all bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, we'll talk about this after the show.  Stacey, seriously, because I have a theory  about the whole thing that is very depressing.  Stacey, your turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  You guys can keep.  I'm just gonna go and cry into my beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just gonna go watch TV with Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a great TV.  Come to my house.  We can learn about the world by watching TV.  That's what they do in North Korea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speaking of TV, because Google added,  well, they added a bunch of partners last week  to Google Home.  Yay, including Wink, August, LG, not LG.  I'm sorry, Best Buy, Insignia brand stuff.  There's another big one that I was excited about.  Oh, TP Link.  But they also added Logitech,  which means, Leo, your Logitech Harmony Home Hub.  Now you can integrate it with your Google Home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I gave my Google Home to my daughter.  I need it back, Abby.  You know what though?  You have to get one of those phones.  I just want to point out,  Abby doesn't have a stereo system,  but the speaker's pretty good on the Google Home.  And I said, you can ask for music,  because it's on my account,  so you can play anything on my Google Play Music.  You can listen to podcasts, you can listen to news.  It's her stereo system.  She loves it.  It's a really great device for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm actually trading.  So we're moving the Echo, which sits in my living room.  I have an open kitchen, dining, living,  just massive space downstairs.  That's where Echo lives.  We're switching it out with the Google Home  now that the Google Home has all these integrations,  and we're moving the Echo upstairs to my daughter's room.  And she is freaking thrilled,  because all she does is tell it to play  the Pokemon theme song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Pentatons.  Over and over and over and over again.  In her room, thank God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, but now it'll be in her room.  So we're all very excited about that.  And so yes, Logitech Harmony Home,  a little bit different though.  So something to note.  Most things you ask for Google,  you just go to the Google Home app,  and then you add the device from there.  For the Logitech integration,  you actually have to tell it to,  you actually tell the Google Home,  okay, gee, open Logitech.  I'm trying to remember the exact words.  It's like open Logitech Harmony,  or connect Harmony Hub.  And then it's going to throw up a card on your phone app,  and then you connect through that.  So it's a little weird.  I had a really hard time because my phone kept saying,  I can't help you with that.  Because it was talking instead of to the hub,  it was talking to the home or the Google Assistant.  So I finally put my phone in another room  and then talk to the Google Home, and that worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So can I get the Pentatonix singing the Pokemon theme  on my home hub?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I don't know if they do the Pokemon theme.  They certainly do a wide variety of other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Inquiring Wines want to know.  Oh, hey guys, look who's coming in.  Come on in, let's hear the Pokemon theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who literally just busted into the doorway.  This is like that BBC guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's trying to pull a BBC thing.  Oh no, it's a dog.  Oh, but it's a cute dog.  Aw.  We don't blame you.  Now, if your husband comes and drags him out by the tail  while crouching below, ostensibly below the camera line,  then you've got a viral video.  That'd be awesome.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, my dog is not, but she did, the door was shut.  How did she open it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She has learned how to use the knob.  That is a problem. Be afraid, be very afraid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  Oh, now you got to meet my dog too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's her name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sophie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sophie is adorable.  She's part corgi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a little corgi in there.  Oh, she's adorable.  She, oh, oh, oh, look, oh my God, she does tricks.  Now she wants a treat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I'm sorry, I have nothing.  I have nothing for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just give her one of your toes.  She'll like that.  Gosh, that got dark too.  Is there something wrong with me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I brought you a dog that's totally livened things up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and you're like.  There's something wrong with me.  Even a puppy couldn't help.  Actually, I will be able to watch the NFL  on not Twitter this year, but Amazon.  And Amazon got the deal by spending 10 times  more than Twitter spent.  Five games, 50 million smackers.  That's kind of amazing.  And did it?  What a coup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, 10 minutes.  10 million again.  And it's free to Amazon Prime members.  And so, it's yet another case where anytime you try  to do anything with Amazon, it's always like, wow,  it really makes a lot of sense to have an Amazon Prime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did Twitter gain by streaming on Twitter?  Nothing.  What will Amazon gain?  A thousand, a hundred thousand Prime subscribers maybe?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll get new customers who will, in their lifetime,  spend a million dollars on Amazon.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, this pays for itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There used to be a service that you could link  your Amazon account to that would tell you  how much you've spent on Amazon over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I can do that.  I can text.  I have a, actually, it should be my pick this week.  It's a text financial messaging service  that sends you texts every once in a while.  And then if you want, you can say,  tell me how much I spent on Amazon or any other,  as long as all the accounts are tied in.  See, you can put your- Leo, I have one or two of those,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and I don't remember what they are either,  and so I can't cancel them,  because I'm like, which one is this?  I don't care that much, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't really want to know.  Mine's called, well, it told me, so, okay,  but it doesn't say its name.  Yeah.  Well, I was going to say, I can do it based on my-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's called Trim.  Trim, that's the one I have, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it just said, so it sent me a text a couple of days ago,  was this month's spending angel or monkey  with his hands over his ears,  because they use clever emoticons,  reply, spend Amazon to see how much you spent there.  So I had to spend Amazon.  You spent $3,586 on Amazon this month.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You win.  I think that includes, no, but that, no,  but that includes, it's you too, John.  It includes the whole network.  This is like, we buy stuff.  No?  No, it does, because it's got our business cards,  are also tied into this account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, tell us about your TV again.  How amazing is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got it on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can also say spend McDonald's.  Let me see how much I spent at McDonald's this month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Zero, please tell it to be zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's definitely zero.  Did you, have you seen the movie about,  called Founder, about Ray Kroc?  Oh, such a great movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I actually wanted to see that.  It's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if it's a great movie,  but it is very interesting.  He was kind of a jerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a jerk, but it's fascinating from the perspective  of thinking about Silicon Valley and startups,  and how, on almost all the biggest properties,  the thing they thought was not valuable  turns out to be the most valuable thing.  And in the case of McDonald's, it was real estate.  And they did a great job depicting that.  That was well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  BJ Novak, formerly of the office,  turns out, who knew, to be a business genius.  And he's at the bank, and he overhears Ray Kroc saying,  please don't take my house.  And he says, you're doing it all wrong.  Because I guess the original deal,  so it's fascinating how he basically screwed  the McDonald's brothers.  But then, Kroc is such a doofus,  he screws them and gets nothing.  He gets one and a half percent of revenue,  and he's like losing his shirt.  And so this guy comes over,  ends up being the CEO of McDonald's,  and says, you know, you got it all wrong.  This is a real estate play.  And explains it, and they do it.  And now it's a huge company.  But in the long run, what,  by the way, Ray Kroc is very nicely played,  I thought, by?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Batman?  I want to say Tom Hanks, Val Kilmer?  No, no.  The guy who was in Beetlejuice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the guy who was in the thing, you know.  What?  Yeah.  Michael Keaton.  Oh, Michael Keaton.  He's played by Beetlejuice, he's better.  That's Batman, yes.  Beetlejuice or Batman?  Batman doesn't narrow it down much.  Beetlejuice narrows it down a lot.  Michael Keaton, at the end, I don't know, this isn't,  can you have a spoiler?  No, everybody knows what happened.  At the end, he says, you guys thought  that the key to McDonald's was, you know,  the layout, the speedy service, all this.  I thought it was the bathrooms.  The bathrooms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The people traveling interstate highways  wanted to go into, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says, you guys never knew, all this time,  you never knew what was really valuable at McDonald's.  It's the name.  And Ray Kroc really did say this.  They show video of him at the end,  the real Ray Kroc saying this.  The name McDonald's, it's America.  He said, I don't like those gimmicky names,  Burger This or Jack and the That.  McDonald's, it's America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He tells the McDonald's brothers,  you cannot use the name McDonald's anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You won't let them use their own name.  Oh, it's good.  And Nick Offerman plays one of the McDonald's brothers  brilliantly.  The smart one.  The smart one, so good.  Yeah, he was good, he was really good.  That cheered me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, you didn't spend any money at McDonald's this month.  I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's good.  It was actually zero.  That also cheers me up.  It says, we couldn't find any McDonald's transactions  since the beginning of the month.  Try spend Lyft.  I also spent nothing on Lyft.  That's a nice service, that's Trim, it's called.  Yeah. Okay.  I like it, because it's all text-based.  So yeah, you can also just tell it all accounts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and it just tell you the balance of all your accounts  in one text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The way they get you is,  and actually this really worked with me,  is they say, you've got monthly subscriptions  to a bunch of stuff, find out how much it's losing  and we'll help you cancel it.  So you can say, my subscriptions,  and then it gives you all your subscriptions.  And then they say, cancel Audible,  which I'm not real happy about.  Got it, we'll cancel it.  And then they'll cancel it for you.  So that's what got me,  because I have a lot of monthly subscriptions  that I've lost track of.  We all do, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Well, my husband keeps a close eye  on all of our monthly subscriptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good man.  That's good, somebody's got to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I mean, because we have probably 30  or 40 monthly subscriptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are so many businesses that rely entirely  on people forgetting that the money is flowing  in their direction.  You think about gift cards, you know,  people get a gift card, you get one as a gift,  you forget about it, it loses it,  ends up in the trash or whatever.  They still keep the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's terrible.  Let's see, I have quite a few subscriptions.  Nevermind.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a great service.  They'd make a great advertiser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like Trim.  I do, I like it.  It's one of those things,  another one I signed up for,  but it's free, right?  It's free.  It's a terrible name.  Trim, yeah.  But it's one of the few messaging bots  that I actually like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Everybody's talking about messaging bots  and they're boring, usually, and useless.  This one is actually really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you could also take, I mean,  so I can pull from, I guess it's quicken  my spending habits from my credit cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you use Mint, Mint will tell you this, for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now imagine this as an echo skill,  so you can be like, hey, hey, hey, Lady A.  Yes.  What did I spend on Amazon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I like Lady A.  Let's call her that from now on.  Sure.  I like that.  Nice job, Lady A.  And then S-I-R-I could be Lady S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Siri, we call Lady A, Madam A,  but I'm thinking Siri is actually more like a Madam S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Madam A, Madam S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because Lady A sounds better, because the AA.  And then I'm still going with Hey G  until we come up with something better.  Hey G, hey G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mr. G, Sonny G.  OG.  Do we want to talk about, no,  because it'll depress everybody.  Online privacy rules, no.  Let's not talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did a story about what it means  for the internet of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does it mean for the internet of things?  Should you care?  Is there anything good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's some good news.  The Minnesota Senate, and I suspect this is what'll happen,  has voted 58 to nine to pass internet privacy protections.  So that may be the best side of this,  is that the states might get involved.  But then you'll have to move to a state  where your privacy is respected.  Texas is never gonna do that.  You're not gonna get that one, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think that's necessarily that terrible of a thing.  I think that, generally, I think that,  for example, California is moving heavily on,  more heavily than it would have  on environmental protections.  And they're probably going further than the nation would,  even if we had somebody, a president,  who was really into environmental protections.  And so if California does certain things,  it's very influential nationwide,  because there's such a big state.  And so the California environmental protections  are not only going to reflect the values of the state,  but they're also going to influence other states.  So I don't think it's the worst thing.  The states are more offensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, if a big state does it, then every other,  every company has to kind of adhere to it  if they wanna do business in that state, right?  Yep.  So Comcast is national.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is why everything I buy has a sticker  telling me things in it are classified as poisonous,  or cancerous.  It's because of us.  I'm like, oh, California.  The world's famous Prop 60 warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Prop 60, it's so ridiculous.  You can't go into a garage without being warned  that inside there are poisonous,  there are things known to the state of California.  My Christmas lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is another example, not only of a bad regulation,  and this was one of the propositions,  so that we have this proposition process that's really broken.  But it's also an example of,  and I remember this when I was a kid,  that we went to a power plant, a coal-fired power plant  in Providence, Rhode Island, where I lived.  And I was already, I was a trouble, I was, you know,  I said, why are all those dead fish in that cooling pond?  And the guy said, no, no, no, let's look over here.  But one of the other things I saw was everywhere  in the place they saw, I saw signs that say conserve,  save energy, green, and this was in the 70s,  early, maybe late 60s, green.  Ecology now.  Ecology now.  And I asked my teacher, this is a coal-fired power plant.  What, she said, because it dulls you to the notion.  So the more you see this stuff, the less it means.  So this Prop 60 warning, in effect,  dulls you to the idea that you're surrounded  by poisonous chemicals, and as a result,  you pay no attention to it any longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then that result is exactly like there are no signs.  Exactly. The eyes glaze over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not only no signs, but no regulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Damn them.  So did we talk about, I think we did,  but I don't know if we did the whole thing.  Ashley Feinberg's amazing detective work in Gizmodo.  Did we talk about that last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We did, we did not talk.  Well, I wasn't here last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so you don't know.  I don't know.  Were you here?  No, I wasn't here either.  I wasn't here.  Nobody was here.  So I apologize to all the listeners who were here,  but we didn't talk about it.  This is why privacy on the internet is so important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We know-  Oh, you didn't talk about it  because it came out on Thursday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, good.  We know that you can have anonymized search results  and go through them.  In fact, somebody did a study.  They took a pile of anonymized search results  and they were able to identify the searcher 70% accuracy,  the searcher of those search results  just by looking at the search results.  There is no such thing as anonymous stuff on the internet.  If you have the data, you can figure out who it is.  So Ashley Feinberg, who's a brilliant reporter at Gizmodo,  she does a great job, did some investigation.  And it all came from the fact that  at the National Intelligence and Security Alliance  leadership dinner, the director of the FBI, James Comey, said  he had a secret Twitter and Instagram account.  It was just an anecdote.  He's talking about stars.  And of course, if you're the director of the FBI,  you probably don't want, you might have a public account,  but if you wanna have a social account just for you,  you're gonna make it secret.  And of course, Ashley said, how secret is that?  Well, he gave out a few details that were helpful.  He said, for instance,  his Instagram account has only nine followers.  So Ashley says, who am I to say no to a challenge?  So the only hint he offered about Twitter  was that he has to be on Twitter now,  meaning the account would likely be relatively new.  And she learned a lot more about the Instagram account.  He says, I treasure my privacy and security  on the internet.  Ironic.  My job is public safety.  He's the guy Comey has taped over his camera as well.  Unfortunately, Instagram isn't conducive  to custom searching.  There was no way any of his five children or wife  would be using their full names.  Twitter, however, gives us a little more leverage,  she writes, after some trial and error,  I found his 22-year-old son, Brian Comey,  seems to have the largest online presence  as a basketball star at Kenyon College.  Go, Lords!  It wasn't easy to find Brian Comey on Twitter, though,  because his first name is also the middle name  of his father, B-R-I-E-N,  helpful to have an unusual spelling.  So after a few frustrated attempts,  I've tried the following Twitter search on a whim,  Brian Comey minus James.  So that would get all of the Brian Comey mentions  without any references to his father.  This led me to a tweet from the Twitter account  of Kenyon College, the basketball team,  showing Comey teaching basketball to some school kids,  and at-mentioned the now-dead Twitter account,  at Twitterfuzz.  That account appears to have been previously owned  by Brian Comey.  At least if you believe the folks on Twitter  congratulating Twitterfuzz for his dad's ascension  to the head of the FBI.  That seems like a smoking gun there.  That led her to this Periscope video of Brian Comey.  Clink through the linked photo,  you'll find that a well-wisher's left a comment  in which Brian Comey's tagged.  Now, our FBI director has trained his son well,  his Instagram account is locked down.  Instagram itself, however, offers a little loophole.  It is terrible for user privacy,  but wonderfully helpful for our purposes today.  She created a fake Instagram,  actually has a fake Instagram account,  which she keeps for tracking Donald Trump Jr.  and Newt Gingrich, I don't know why.  So using that anonymous account,  Ashley requested access to Comey's account.  As soon as I did, this popped up.  This is the really great one.  Suggestions for you, since you requested Brian Comey,  maybe you'd be interested in his mom, Patrice,  or this weird Reinhold Niebuhr account, among others.  Hmm.  Hmm, Comey is-  Thickens.  Hmm, the plot thickens.  Patrice is Comey's wife, so she knew these were Comey's.  Among these various Comey's,  only two of the suggested accounts  lacked both real names and profile photos,  and only one had anywhere near the nine followers  James Comey claimed to have, and that was Reinhold Niebuhr.  This account is private.  I wasn't sure it was James Comey,  but a Google search turned up this article  on Comey's time at William and Mary.  By senior year, Comey was a double major  in religion and chemistry, writing a senior thesis  on theologian Reinhold Niebuhr,  who, incidentally, I think, is also Barack Obama's  favorite theologian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thesis also covered Jerry Falwell, the televangelist.  It's a weird combination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Reinhold Niebuhr was a pastor who wrote  the Serenity Prayer, among other things.  He was also a prolific writer.  So she feels like, okay, I got it.  That's the Instagram account.  So she goes back to Twitter, and you know what?  There's an at Reinhold Niebuhr,  who tweets, among other things, last year,  what's the point of watching  Fully Clothed Beached Volleyball?  Okay, right there I would have said  that couldn't be James Comey.  Fortunately, there are only seven accounts on Twitter  currently using some variation of that name.  So she found all of them.  And only one seemed to be operating in stealth.  See, this volleyball one was one of the non-stealthy ones.  This one wasn't, though.  Project Exile 7.  Got an egg?  Joined in February 2014?  Project Exile 7 hasn't tweeted.  How to be sure there's only one person  currently following the account,  Benjamin Wittes of Lawfare.  Now, Wittes is no Twitter neophyte, she says.  He's an active user, 25,000 followers.  He only follows, you know, a thousand or more accounts,  which means he doesn't automatically follow everybody.  If he's following a random egg  and is the only account following it,  there's probably a reason.  Well, maybe it's because he's a personal friend  of James Comey.  Project Exile, remember that was the actual Twitter name,  Project Exile 7, turns out to be a federal program  James Comey helped develop  while he was a U.S. attorney living in Richmond.  Project Exile 7 follows 27 other accounts,  mostly reporters, news outlets,  government, law enforcement accounts,  and writers for the New York Times and the Washington Post,  all of whom have been covering the FBI investigation  into Trump's contacts with Russia.  Hmm.  Donald Trump is on there,  but Project Exile 7 seems to have begun following him  relatively recently.  His first follow was the New York Times.  There are two outliers, William and Mary News.  Ooh, Comey went to William and Mary.  And The Onion.  Good, I'm glad to know James Comey follows The Onion.  Oops.  Now what have I done?  I clicked something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're recording a bunch of videos now.  Your DVR is gonna fill up.  What is going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, I might be.  Help me, help me Mr. Wizard.  Okay, back to the story.  I'm sorry this is so long, but it's such a good detective.  She did such a good job.  39 tweets the account has liked.  See, you don't have to have any tweets  to leave a paper trail on Twitter.  Eight refer directly to the FBI or Comey himself.  So you can even find this all out.  It's really easy to find out.  These are all the things he's liked.  One deals with an active FBI investigation.  Four refer to the Trump administration in general.  Shit, boy, Ashley Feinberg.  None of this is proof, of course.  Take what you will from the fact  that the director of the FBI appears to have liked  a tweet from New York Times about Mike Flynn  and Jared Kushner meeting a Russian envoy in December.  We've reached out to the FBI for comment  and we'll update when we hear back.  In the meantime, Project Exile 7, I would love a follow.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, what did Woody say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Woody said, I actually commented earlier today  on Comey's Twitter account on Twitter no less.  Beyond that public statement, I have nothing to say.  He says, day 70, I've been ignoring all the speculation  about Comey's Twitter account,  but this one's pretty damn funny.  Let's see, and then he refers to this tweet  and she's just laughing at the tweet  that this is James Comey's Twitter account.  FBI's statement, hello, we don't have any comment, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But at least it wasn't we have spoken enough  about James Comey's Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know what you're talking about now.  So what do you think?  I think she's right on.  I think there's too many coincidences in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's.  I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can't definitively say for sure.  Right, but it's great detective work,  but it points out that there is this data cloud  around you at all times that tells investigative reporters,  government agents, marketers,  more about you than you might imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and Twitter is a wonderful tool  for finding things out  that you don't think you'd be able to find out.  And one of the best examples of that, of course,  is Nick Bilton's hatching Twitter,  where he's giving all these accounts  and describing the weather  and what people are wearing, all this stuff.  And he got all that data from Twitter by doing searches.  He's doing historical, like sort of painting a picture  of things and finding out who was where at what time  and who was meeting with whomever,  just by seeing what people posted on Twitter.  It's really a great repository of random data  about people that even the people who are using Twitter  don't realize reveals them to be who they are  and what they do and what they're thinking about  and who they're talking to and who their friends are  and all that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody, UOS DeWiz in the chat room said,  wait a minute, Comey and Project Exile 7  are never in the same room.  Oh, that's just silly, Lois.  Anyway, the point, I know there's a long way around  just to point out that this is why privacy  on the internet is important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think there is any such thing as privacy  on the internet with enough data mining  to be actually a better point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A better point.  Sorry, Leo.  If you put it on the internet, it's in public.  Even if you're James Comey, the director of the FBI,  who presumably has some skills in OPSEC, doesn't matter.  I know, I have a story that'll lighten the mood.  AOL and Yahoo have come up with a new name  after the Verizon deal.  They're gonna call themselves Oath.  What?  Oath, O-A-T-H, Oath.  You can't even say it in a way  that somebody knows what you just said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oath?  Do you have a lift?  I'll put the explanation point from Yahoo after it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oath, Oath, oh, shit.  I'm, I'm, hey, can you find that?  Well, I can't Google it, but maybe I can Oath it.  Yeah, that's not a good name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not a good name.  Why did they choose, did they explain why they chose that?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I mean, even if it's something like Alphabet,  whichever, it's not the actual name, which is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alphabet makes sense, because you got A, B, C, D, E,  that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Oath is an actual word  that presumably means something,  although Apple, they named it Apple because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apples are friendly, they're nice, they're fruit.  There actually is a long story about that.  Oath, what is an Oath?  It's a vow, a pledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They pledge to keep your data.  The enterprise version will be called Oath of Office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was, again, good,  again, I gotta give credit to the Business Insider  and Avery Hartmans and Julie Bort.  Good detective work, they found this big scoop,  and because of it, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong  ended up tweeting, yep,  billion plus consumers, 20 plus brands,  unstoppable team, hashtag,  take the oath of a rising company.  Not an exclamation mark this time, a colon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I kid you not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A colon, Oath colon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm gonna oath it, colon.  It should have been like oath, like question mark.  Oath?  And the same like, why her?  Oath?  Oh well, I have nothing to say about that  because it's just not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Marissa Meyer will not be the CEO of Oath,  and she's at this point, she's going, thank God.  Give me the 50 million, I gotta get out of here.  I can't take it.  All right, let's wrap it up.  Anything else anybody wants to say,  any stories that I missed that you,  we could talk about Uber?  Actually, the big revelation I thought in this Uber story  was that Anthony Lewandowski, who left Google,  the Google autonomous car,  eventually what became Waymo wasn't Waymo at the time,  but left, took documents and apparently,  or allegedly took documents and is accused  of trying to bring his entire team with him  when he went over to auto,  the autonomous truck startup was then bought by Uber.  Of course, Google's suing Uber, saying,  Lewandowski took everything.  One of the things we've learned in this suit,  Lewandowski was paid $120 million by Google.  And he still left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I had worked for six months  for $120 million, just be, all right, I'm good, thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hell, I worked for one month.  We knew Google paid well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would literally push the self-driving car  everywhere it went for that money.  $120 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he left.  I need to talk to you about my pay.  And he was unhappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said, I got a better job over here.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to work with a more ethical company,  so I went to Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, at a certain point in time,  money doesn't mean anything.  It's meaningless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's meaning, it's big numbers that don't mean anything.  But yeah.  I wish I could be in that group of people, though,  don't you?  Where $120 million, it's just numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I just, what would I do?  I guess I could donate a lot more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I read or heard somewhere that somebody calculated  that $20 million, anything above $20 million  doesn't matter because you live in the same house,  you eat at the same restaurants,  you do all the same stuff.  It's like beyond $20 million,  after the first $20 million, it's all just the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what comedian Dana Carvey said.  He made his fortune on Saturday Night Live  playing characters like George Bush.  And he said, really, after a certain point,  it just means you got a bigger bedroom to watch TV in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's kind of, didn't cheer you up, did it, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's not true,  because then you can just buy bigger toys.  Like at $20 million, you probably can't have  your own private jet and have it be economical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's true.  But you could have a yacht.  Really, for $20 million?  Well, not a big yacht.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, yachts take a lot longer than jets  to get anywhere. You have a little yacht.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right, see, $20 million's not enough.  I gotta keep working.  You're right. Inflation.  Inflation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What am I saying?  Okay, are we moving?  Are we going?  I'm getting hungry.  Yeah, we're going.  We're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are we doing numbers and all that stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're done.  Yeah, numbers.  You wanna do a number?  Go do a number, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got some quick ones, just to leave the minds boggled  when we close on a high note.  Okay, so comparing the market cap of Tesla and Ford,  Tesla is now more valuable than Ford.  $50 billion is Tesla's market cap as of about an hour ago.  And Ford's is $44.7 billion.  This is in part because Tesla had an amazing quarter.  Okay, let's compare two other companies.  Walmart's, of course, is a retail giant.  And their market cap is $218 billion.  Amazon's is now $435 billion.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  This is the power of the tech slash digital  slash algorithmly based businesses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even comes with its own soundtrack.  I like that about you.  Yeah, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then I have one last mind boggling number.  The number is 800,000.  What's that?  800,000 is the number of police officers  in the United States, roughly, give or take 100,000.  Axon, which is the company formerly known as Taser,  has offered to provide every single police officer  in the United States with a body cam  and with the training and other infrastructure  that would support that.  They offered every single police officer a free body cam.  How much?  For a year.  800,000 is the number of police officers  that technically would be covered  if every single one of them took them up on their offer.  So that's kind of amazing, I think.  Wow.  In other words, I think that because of this stunt,  I think we're gonna see a lot more cops with body cams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope so.  I think that already people are saying,  well, that's a Trojan horse.  We don't wanna take it.  Taser makes, I mean, Axon makes tasers,  which a lot of police officers use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I would love, I think I've even said this on the show before,  I would love for Taser to build a taser  that has a camera in it that shows the tased victim  in slow-mo as they're being tased.  But that's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For amusement purposes only.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tased.  That could be valuable for legal issues  because they like super tased.  But it's more fun to slow motion watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless it's a reporter on a nightly news show  doing it for ratings, it's not funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did it on the new screen,  on the old screensavers, we tased Yoshi.  We had the guy with taser who was like dressed  in a black suit with a black turtleneck.  He looked like a, he'd blown to black water.  Like a guy that worked at Taser.  And he shocked Yoshi.  Yoshi just giggled the whole way down.  See?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  Rrrr.  Rrrr.  Rrrr.  Rrrr.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Rrrr.  Rrrr.  Rrrr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rrrr.  Rrrr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Rrrr.  Stacey, what's your pick of the week?  So I have a bunch of devices, but they are under embargo.  So I have two things.  One you're not going to believe in,  but one is an actual app.  So I don't know if this has existed for a long time,  but I came home last week from being  at the Bluetooth World Conference  and this was in my house and oh my God, it is awesome.  This is a, it's a dish soap holder.  Don't hate me you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IOT dish soap holder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it is not an IOT dish soap holder.  There's nothing connected.  But instead of having our dish soap brush sit  on the countertop, which is where it's always sat,  there's a little stand for it now.  I know very low tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's only $11.59.  It's from Oxo.  Of course it's from Oxo.  They're so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yes, I know this is not high tech  and maybe this has existed for a long time,  but I have never seen one before and I was really excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was excited when I learned that you could put  the dish soap in the handle, let alone that there's a stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now you don't have to have it like, you know,  laying on the side, getting all grungy.  Anyway.  Hallelujah.  I also offer you a more tech thing.  And this is not a new app, but it is an app  that I've been really playing with.  So it's FitStar, which-  Oh, I love FitStar.  Yeah, FitBit Bottom.  I have totally like, I'm going to shell out the,  I think I might just go for the whole year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just want Tony Gonzalez on your smartphone.  I know you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, actually he is my preferred trainer  other than the other lady.  I know, he's cute.  But yes, this is great.  And I love the exercises and I can do them in hotel rooms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really good.  I really, and they time it and they ask you how hard it was.  And so they can tailor it to your abilities.  No, it's really good.  I love FitStar.  It's the best of all these apps, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's super pricey.  So I think I'm just going to do the $40 a year.  Cause otherwise it's like $8 a month.  Yeah.  Which I was like, what is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $40 isn't bad for a year.  That's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's great.  But $8 a month felt like a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I always say?  It's cheaper than a heart attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  I always say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's also cheaper than buying new jeans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's cheaper than even buying new jeans.  Exactly.  Exactly.  All right.  My thing is another internet of thing and it's just dumb,  but it comes from dev.to, a startup Andrew Buntine.  He figured out a way to have personalized theme music play  for all his employees when they entered the office.  So what happens is your phone joins the office wifi.  Turns out some routers offer a log of when people join  and leave the wifi.  And no, I'm playing it.  You can play it.  This is the guy's theme music.  He's coming in.  Listen.  He walks in the office and his theme music starts.  That's awesome.  And it's an easy thing to do because if your,  if your wifi router logs entrances and exits,  he just wrote a little script that grabs the log,  parses it and then plays the appropriate music  when somebody walks in.  You got to do that at Twit.  Isn't that a great, I know, I want to do this.  Maybe we'll get father Robert and Brian to do it on knowhow.  That would be such a great project.  Yeah.  Play theme music when you enter the office,  ladies and, and by the way, you could also use it  to do time cards, but I would never do that.  Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this week  in getting Leo really sad, but cheering him up at the end.  And I want to thank our partners, our team  for making that happen.
