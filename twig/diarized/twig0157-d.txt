And you know, I got to say this right up front,  because sometimes people say, well, you  don't talk enough about Google.  Well, it's not just Google.  It's the cloud.  It's Facebook.  It's Twitter.  It's what's going on in the new world.  I know, and I'm not going to say of social,  but I'm just saying in the new world up there in the space,  in the cloud.  Joining us from the cloud, via the cloud, Jeff Jarvis  from the City University of New York, blogger at buzzmachine.com.  And he's wearing a t-shirt of unknown provenance,  but maybe I could figure that man, woman, Android.  It's the Ben Casey.  From the Google gift shop.  That's awesome.  That is cool.  I love it.  Aaron Newcomb's also here.  He works at Oracle, but he worked his son before that.  And that's really the real, I'm not going  to mention the O word.  That's fine.  You don't have to while I'm here.  Yeah, you've seen him often on Floss Weekly.  Open source expert, expert on Java, and an Android user,  right?  That's right.  Absolutely.  Big Android fanboy.  All right.  Drew Allenoff is also here from thenextweb.com.  Tech journalist extraordinaire.  That Drew on the Twitter.  Hey, Drew, good to see you.  It's good to see you again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Welcome to the show.  Sorry, I couldn't be there in person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  But I understand.  Duty calls.  He's got a file or something like some sort of.  Happy nonsense.  That's stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He has a job or something.  You've got to make the donuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this just in, thank you to the chat room.  It is not in our rundown.  It is a rumor.  Frederick Lardonois and Alexia Tsotsis writing in TechCrunch  posted an hour ago, rumor Google puts a hold on new Google  Plus acquisitions.  The source from Google tells us Google  is weary of both growing the Google Plus team now  and providing the product with any additional resources  until January.  Could this be the first crack in the Google happy face facade  that Google, everything's going great.  Google Plus is fantastic.  The Google Plus Hawaii trip is apparently on the schedule  still.  They're all going to they're all going to Hawaii.  450 Google Plus employees for an offsite Maui in September.  How much could that cost though, really?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can afford it, can't you, Liam?  Maybe Larry and Sergey bought a yacht.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, 450 people is a lot of people.  Is that overly large for a team?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty big.  It's pretty darn big.  I mean, when you need that many developers,  I mean, there's a couple of reasons  you would do this as a company, right?  So one is, I guess the rumors here  would be that things are just getting too big,  or maybe Google is trying to deemphasize Google Plus  a little bit.  I don't think so.  The other reason you might do it is  because you've got some sort of big, something big happening  in the company, right?  So the execs come out and they say, you know what?  We can't hire anything else because something big,  internal is happening, and we can't do it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it might just be about money.  It might be.  Could just be about money.  But it also could be an organizational thing.  It could be a lot more.  Could be a lot more.  It's hard to tell what's going on.  Now, what were the acquisitions?  $100 million Mebo, $15 thereabouts million  for Milk, Kevin Rose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was more connected to Android, right?  Wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't they just acquire a, I don't know if this  is for Google Plus, but Wildfire app.  That probably is Google Plus, right?  It's a social media tool.  Yeah, because Wildfire is all about managing social campaigns

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for advertisers, and that includes Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that was yesterday or the day before.  That's very new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Mark Zuckerberg's sister works for it.  So now she's at Google and he's at Wildfire.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Randy is now at Google.  Randy's other sister.  No, it's his other sister.  Oh, it's not Randy.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Randy's busy doing the Silicon Valley reality TV show.  Right.  Oh, yes.  That's going to win her fans and friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Ariel, I think is her name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ariel.  The other sister.  The other one.  Are there more?  Is it just the two or three of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's it.  OK.  That's all I've ever heard about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, this is all Google as a whole, too, right?  I mean, Wildfire got bought by Google.  I mean, it's going to be used for AdWords,  and it'll probably be slices of it in Google Plus.  But it's a Google acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what Wildfire is.  Would you fill me in, Drew?  What is Wildfire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do they do?  Your favorite phrase, social media management tools.  So basically, if you're running all of the Twitter accounts,  if you're on Facebook, Google, Google Plus.  Like Hootsuite?  Like Hootsuite?  Bingo.  OK.  And monetizing and running campaigns and promotions.  So I mean, I wrote a piece about it.  It was a little bit of a Trojan horse.  Now Google's inside of Twitter and Facebook.  And that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  By getting Wildfire, this gives Google what?  Inside of Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It knows how companies' campaigns  are running on other social platforms  and how successful or unsuccessful they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, Drew?  It could be about gathering data about how companies  are using Facebook, Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Data or just making money off of other people's platforms,  which they do with acquisitions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is on the Wildfire blog.  We believe that over time, the combination of Wildfire  and Google can lead to a better platform for managing  all digital media marketing.  We continue to stay focused on helping brands run  and measure their.  Now if you're a brand using Wildfire  and it's now part of Google, does that make you nervous  about how it's going to work with Facebook and Twitter  and Pinterest and LinkedIn?  Or do you go, well, what now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  Is Facebook going to say, no, you can't buy an ad  on our service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's going to be the interesting point.  Is Facebook going to cut them off?  Right?  They're cutting off revenue.  That could happen.  Obviously, Wildfire says it's business as usual.  Google says it's business as usual.  We've heard that before.  But any number of those services, Pinterest, Twitter,  all the other services that Wildfire works with,  they could go, hey, hold on a second.  You know, we're going to monetize our platform.  Go away.  Especially if it's Google at the helm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I don't think so.  I think it's a service to advertisers.  I mean, I talk to a lot of people in media.  And when you get to some brands, they  need help and services in trying to manage  across multiple social platforms.  It's another advertising way.  And it's Google being rather, I think, lowercase c Catholic  about this in saying that we will now recognize advertising,  we'll place advertising elsewhere on the web.  We'll share the money.  We'll push revenue elsewhere where  it's good for the advertiser.  And I think that's a smart way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They also, I mean, it's kind of an interesting company  that was founded, according to its own about page, in 2008  by Victoria and Alain, who were New Zealand-based adventure  travel company.  They wanted to give away free trips to fans  and then discovered doing it on Facebook  required them to create an application.  So they built one.  It was a week-long side project that  turned into a venture of its own, its first product promotion  builder.  They had 10 clients by the fall of 2008.  Four years later, 16,000 businesses,  including 30 of the 50 top global brands.  Very interesting story, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what did it sell for, guys?  I think it was between $200 and $250 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, good for them.  Around $250.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good for them.  Yeah.  It's an interesting acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to think that there is something  that Google's thinking that, well, yeah, this gives us  a window into how these 30 out of the 50 top global companies  are planning social media interactions and purchases  and marketing on the other guy's site.  Right.  And I can see why Facebook may say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We shall see, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could be.  It could also be an enterprise play, not strictly enterprise.  But it seems like Google is always looking for a reason,  or a way to get into the enterprise space  because there's so much on the consumer side.  I just wonder if it's a way for them to have a bigger  play in this market.  Maybe they just see it as a growing market,  and they're like, you know what?  Let's scoop them up, and then we'll, hey,  who knows ads better than Google?  So now, Mr. XYZ Company, come to us,  and we'll handle all of your social media marketing efforts.  And let's not forget analytics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Analytics is a huge part of this, too, with Google Analytics.  Being able to track all those things in one place,  I mean, it's a huge plus for the brands.  I think Google adds a lot of value.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I've got to imagine the earplugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead.  One of the tropes in my world these days  is that media companies have to become agencies.  Everybody has to become a media company,  and the media companies have to become agencies.  It's a little bit overdone, but it's true that  rather than selling space and time to the advertiser,  you've got to sell return on investment,  you've got to sell services,  you've got to be able to help them  in their digital life all around.  And they're too busy to go to 10 different places,  and he or she who can offer digital as a whole,  wisely packaged,  and be able to optimize across these platforms  by having knowledge of what's going on  across those platforms,  is going to have something valuable.  So I think it's a very smart purchase on Google's behalf,  and I think it's something that doesn't exclude  other people from doing the same thing,  but it's something they need to offer.  And again, they're going to offer revenue to other players,  which is a really interesting counterintuitive thing.  Come to Google to buy Facebook.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if there were any question about Google's  commitment to Google+,  maybe this would change your mind.  Google has replaced those Gmail video chats  you might have done with Hangouts on Google+.  We continue with that slow movement  towards everything being a part of Google+.  Mm-hmm.  I don't think there's any doubt  that Google is totally committed to the success of Google+,  even though there's no evidence  that Google+, is anything anybody wants,  except for a handful of hardcore...  Well, did you see Guy Kawasaki?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Guy loves it. Guy loves it.  Guy did this whole thing this last week of...  He says that when Apple was down in the dumps  with consumer viewpoints,  he raised this whole thing to provide the counterweight  to all the arguments against Apple.  And so now he's basically written a cheat sheet  for how you can defend Google+,  against all these critics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so why do you need to defend Google+,  if it's doing so damn well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, let's think about what well means.  And what are we...  What is the cor...  Is this a Google+, versus Facebook thing?  It doesn't have as many users as Facebook,  therefore it's a failure,  which is a lot of what reporters...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't care.  Yeah, but I think that's obviously...  We know better.  That's not about the number of users.  It's about the amount of engagement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, how do you track the engagement?  That's the frustrating part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you don't.  And the only thing I'm reporting is, in my own experience,  that nobody I know or care about is on Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm there.  I've got some people there who are great.  Hey, yeah. Hey, hey, hey.  I'm there.  Mike Elkins.  I find good conversation there still.  And I put stuff up there.  It's mixed, but I find it's good and better than my blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I find way, way better conversation on Google+,  than I do anywhere else.  And...  I won't deny that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't deny that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the other thing I think,  I think the reason people like Guy Kawasaki  and other, I guess, Google+, fanboys like myself,  people that really love it,  want to get more people to come over.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've gave...  My problem is I give up too early.  Maybe.  I gave up.  Yeah, maybe.  And I love Google+.  I love Buzz.  I'm an idiot.  I loved Buzz.  But...  And I just don't want to waste energy on a platform  that is more abundant.  And I guess, you know, if we could make it work,  it's great.  But you know what my conclusion is  after thinking about this for a while,  is it's too complicated.  People want hit-and-run social media.  They want to go on.  They want to post a status update.  They want to scan pictures and then move on.  And Google+, you're right,  there's more engagement.  That's the problem.  It requires too much participation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know about that.  But I go through different things.  My usage of Google+, is extremely different.  I mean, the reason why I'm bullish on Google+,  is because it doesn't require a lot of my time.  I feel like Twitter needs that babysitting.  That's the groove I'm in with Twitter.  Facebook, for me, has so many features  and so many things going on,  I don't even know where to start.  So when I use Google+, I feel more comfortable  because I check my notifications,  I can add something,  I can do a search,  and then I can bolt.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the tagline for you is Google+,  the social network you can ignore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not a social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's not?  Ah, maybe I misunderstood that.  It's not a social network?  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a social layer.  And people want to say that's PR crap.  Google's never referred to it as a social network.  The idea of a social network,  people attach that to Facebook.  Facebook is a social network.  MySpace is a social network.  Well, guess what?  Neither of those companies have the footprint  that Google does in other verticals and areas.  Right?  So when you think about integrating these social features  in other products,  very successful products,  that to me says the company's just fine  with making their products social.  You know, you don't put plus features in YouTube,  which is an extremely popular and successful property,  and then say, well, it's not doing too well,  so we're going to have to yank it all back.  You don't do that.  It's not a zero or one.  It's not a turn on, turn off.  It's not buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have this vision of Prince when he changes his name to the Ankh.  We're soon going to say plus the site formerly known as Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is like that, isn't it?  It's the site formerly known as Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just put up guys down at the bottom of the rundown.  I put up guys post.  That's all of his arguments and links, if you care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I know people say,  oh, you know, I'm being hard on it.  I want it to succeed,  but I just feel like I get the feeling,  having been through this a number of times,  most recently with Buzz,  that it's going in the wrong direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't think so.  I think that for Facebook,  I feel like that's the place I go to hang out with family,  you know, family friends, things like that.  But especially for like what we do when we're building an audience  and we have people that want to follow us  and see what we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's nothing better than Facebook for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't. I think Google Plus is way better for that  because I have people that follow me on Google Plus  and they are engaged and they chat  and it draws them into what I'm doing.  I started a hangout.  In fact, kind of getting back to what we were talking about,  about adding the hangouts in.  There was an outage on G-talk the other day  and I wonder if it was when they were trying  to start some integration.  Yeah, I think they were starting to integrate at that point.  Maybe that's why the outage.  No, they haven't really said it, I don't think.  But anyway, so as part of that, I said,  I'm going to start a hangout to see if it's connected.  So let's see if hangouts actually work.  So I started a hangout and right away I noticed that like three  or four of the people that are always following me  or commenting on my post and things like that were like right  in there in the hangout and they were,  hey, it's so good to talk to you.  It's so good.  I would have never had that experience on Facebook ever.  But it's worse on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lauren Weinstein is just a brilliant user of Google Plus.  He just has great, great stuff.  Mike Elgin, obviously.  Something forgetting her name, the teacher who is the mother-in-law  of Sergey.  I'll remember it in a second.  But there are some people who are really masters of Google Plus  and they share things well and they use it in kind of a proper  form using photos using the kind of the right length,  the kind of right recommendation to share.  And it's an impressive platform in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is one Google product that is definitely dead.  Definitely.  I have no, well, we'll find out in just a second when we continue.  Our guest Drew Alanoff from thenextweb.com.  Aaron Newcomb, how should I, what should I,  how should I introduce you?  I don't want to say from, yeah, let's say The Source Show.  The source show.org.  Regular on Floss Weekly, all about Android.  Good to have you here.  Also, Jeff Jarvis from buzzmachine.com.  But first a word from our folks at squarespace.com.  The new Squarespace is here.  The new Squarespace, you know, I feel like Steve Martin jumping up and down.  But really, truly, this is something we've been waiting for for some time.  I've been a beta tester on Squarespace 6 for a few months.  I know there's people who've been working on it for a year or more.  And that's because Squarespace really wanted to get this right.  A brand new code base.  This isn't just, you know, a few new features.  This is a new code base.  50 plus new features.  Huge move into the 21st century.  For instance, things like the new thing everybody's talking about.  Responsive design.  When you put an image into your Squarespace page, Squarespace automatically generates  images of six or seven sizes.  So that when, here it is, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.  So that whatever device comes to that page, they don't have a special mobile page.  The page automatically resizes.  The images are appropriate for that specific device.  It's just things like that make such a difference to your users, to you.  The ability to drag and drop your layout to create a unique looking page.  Of course, of all the great templates, there are 50 plus new or improved features  in the new Squarespace.  Incredible.  The new layout engine.  You can share your social media accounts.  Plug that in.  Of course, if you're a blogger, it's awesome.  You can even drag and drop things like Google Maps into your blog.  I just think that is so cool to have that as part of the image palette in your blog.  I want you to try this.  Now, the nice thing, as always, with Squarespace is it couldn't be easier to try.  Just visit squarespace.com and you will see on there a try it link.  Two weeks, absolutely free.  Squarespace.com.  Let me close this video so you can see where we're talking about here.  It says get started now.  That's it.  Get started.  And two weeks, absolutely free of Squarespace.  If you decide you like it and only if you decide you like it, then get out your credit  card and take a look at the pricing because it's really kind of amazing.  Eight dollars.  This is now, this is if you buy a yearly plan.  They do have monthly plans.  It costs just a little bit more.  Ten dollars month to month.  But get the yearly plan because it really is.  That's the best savings.  Sixteen dollars.  And what do you get for sixteen dollars a month when you pay for a yearly plan?  Unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage, unlimited contributors, unlimited.  There's no limit.  I don't know of any hosting company that can offer this kind of value and the amazing  content management system that's Squarespace.  So give it a try.  Two weeks free.  If you decide you like it and you decide to buy, use our offer code TWIG8 and you'll get  10% off your first purchase.  That's why, another reason why the annual plan is the best deal.  And one more thing.  When you get an annual plan, they will give you a free domain registration so you can  have your custom domain and do all the back end hookup so that you don't have to.  It makes it very straightforward to create a custom domain.  Do the whole thing.  Soup to nuts.  Squarespace is the best.  I want you to try it.  The new Squarespace, Squarespace.com.  Give it a try today and make sure you use the offer code TWIG8 if you decide to buy.  We're talking Google, the cloud, Facebook and the queue.  I guess we don't have to worry about the queue anymore.  I guess that's it on the Google queue.  For now.  For now.  I don't know.  What do you think?  I think it sounds like it's dead, dead, dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it might be.  It's a little bit of an embarrassment.  I mean, I guess better for them that they pulled off.  And the news is, by the way, that the Google queue is not going to come out right now.  They heard the bad reviews.  They're going to kind of give away what they have to people who asked for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, more than that, if you pre-ordered it off, I don't know how many people that could  be for $300.  They're just going to send you one.  Yeah.  That to me sounds like they're not a dev version.  Yeah.  They're going to say, you know, we're sorry you ordered one for free on us.  Sounds to me like that's the end of the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I mean, we talked about this on All About Android a few weeks ago.  I mean, it's it was just too little for too much, you know, too little functionality for  300 bucks.  I mean, you've got products like the Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's well now.  Now.  Okay.  For 100 bucks.  Coming out or it got its Kickstarter money.  Almost no Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's almost no Kickstarter.  As somebody who's invested in over a dozen Kickstarter products of which I've only received  one coming out, it's a little ways from that.  But I agree with you.  Ouya will be an interesting product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's just say it looks like it's going to be very successful.  They've got a lot.  10 million plus dollars.  They've got a ton of people that have signed up and a ton.  Not only that, not just people that have signed up that want one, but partners, right?  So people like.  Oh, they have partners now for the year.  Even Vivo, whatever the movie, the music video.  Vivo.  Yeah.  They even signed up today, they said.  So they've got a game of Final Fantasy.  Oh, good for them.  Three is coming out.  I signed up for one, so I've been getting all the news.  They send you the newsletter about every other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Ouya was a Kickstarter project.  They raised an amazing amount of dollars.  Six million dollars.  They asked for less than a million.  In fact, it's not done yet.  They have seven days still to go.  One more week.  And the idea was it was an open source Android gaming platform for 100 bucks.  Right.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plugs into your TV.  I mean, much like the Q, plugs into your TV comes with a controller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this everything the Q should have been?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's everything the Q should have.  Now, of course, they're concentrating on gaming, but if it comes with the Android platform,  there's no reason you can't install Netflix and things like that, unless for some reason  they do something to lock those apps out.  But I don't think they will.  So you get all these great gaming platforms designed for the box and you get all the  Android functionality that you kind of like a Google TV experience like you like.  So you get all that stuff on a hundred dollar box.  And I think it's exactly what the Q should have done.  Unfortunately, they missed on it and that's why they pulled it.  I'm sure it was really hard for them over there to pull the Q.  I mean, they gave it a lot of airtime on the at I.O.  And I'm sure it was really hard for them to do that and then pull back.  But that's that was the right decision.  I think it was absolutely.  In fact, it shows a lot of product that I know where people walked away and were confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  We weren't exactly sure what to do with it.  And Google's response was, well, it's open and developers can build things on it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which is which is cool.  I mean, it was hacked right away to run Android.  I think it was four point.  It was hacked right away.  This was a very easy hack.  This guy hacked it and hooked it up.  He was like, look, now I can watch Netflix on my on my Q, which I couldn't do with the  way it was shipped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So maybe it'll maybe that's where the future of the Q is, is kind of a hackable device.  The monarch in our chat room is pointing out that we it comes with its own marketplace  does not come with Google Play, but you could root it.  But then you would lose the marketplace, but gain Google Play.  Right.  So really, the Q was an official Google Play device that had music sharing and some nice  features that an app built in.  I think the only thing if it had been 100 bucks, I think it might have been a competitive  product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it was a price.  They're selling on eBay for everywhere from one seventy five to five hundred.  Buy it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder how that's working out for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's heavy.  The thing is ridiculously heavy.  I think when I was on the show, when I was out of the, you know, we you brought yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the picture on the verge.  They have a picture of it as a doorstop.  They're using it as a doorstop.  Yeah, it's pretty clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a subtle.  They don't say that, but it's a very subtle way of saying, hmm.  Yeah.  I have to admit, when I heard the price, even at Google I.O., when I heard the price, I  said that's a that's a nonstarter.  That's that's just too expensive for something that has such, you know, kind of confusing  functionality.  And what the reason is heavy is has a 25 watt amplifier in it.  So it has to have a big transformer in there.  Yeah, it makes me a little bit sad.  Yeah, because there were some neat design stuff.  It was made in the USA, which is probably why it was a little pricier than you might  have liked.  True.  Consumers showing once again that both the choice between spending a little extra and  enslaving Chinese children.  Let's enslave the children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know that was admirable of them to do a, you know, USA manufactured, you know,  try to create some jobs here in the good old USA.  But yeah, it's just too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Created.  I don't know if it created any jobs.  Well, not anymore.  You know who's creating jobs?  I think it creates a lot of severance.  Yeah, right.  You know who's creating a lot of jobs?  YouTube.  They have decided, according to the Wall Street Journal, remember they had the hundred million  dollar fund for channels.  They were going to have a hundred channels.  Felicia Day's Geek and Sundry is an example of those channels.  Phil DeFranco has a channel.  They ended up seeding those channels with a hundred fifty million dollars.  According to the Journal, it's such a success.  Eight months later, the company is going to put another two hundred million dollars in.  Two hundred.  Not clear whether that's two hundred million going to the existing hundred channels or if  they're going to add channels.  I think this is very interesting.  That means it's a success.  Now, I have to say, I don't I there are a hundred channels and I don't I don't know where they  are.  Are you I mean, am I missing something?  Is Shaquille O'Neal launch his channel yet?  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's rather cook sputters.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, you know, there's a lot of people doing really well by creating and curating  their content and engaging people on the platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And well, I'd say where they're doing well is by cashing that check from Google.  Right.  I mean, people are getting anywhere up to five million dollars to start these channels.  Incidentally, I just want to throw my hat into the ring.  Google.  Actually, we are going to I don't know if they are going to open this up to new channels,  but we we've already decided as a company that that's something we'd like to assay.  What we realize is Google does not YouTube does not want us on YouTube or YouTube live  because we have our own advertising model.  Right.  And they want to sell ads.  They don't want to have to compete with our own interstitial ads.  So could we if they gave us, you know, a million, couple million, three million dollars, create  our own content specifically for YouTube?  Would it be worth our while?  You bet.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.  You know, and short form, maybe a little bit shorter.  It would be absolutely short form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The requirement, I'm told, is 50, no, 40 hours a year.  I think we could do that.  That's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not bad at all.  Give me a couple million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll make 80 hours a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we'd better, you know, just put the put together the package piece, the  best of and I would probably maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's one thing.  And we certainly would do that, but I think because it would help promote us.  But I think we'd also create new content for the YouTube medium.  I'm becoming more and more of a fan of the idea.  And I know people have always told me this because I used to cross post to Twitter and  Facebook.  Do it for the do something appropriate for that medium.  When you're tweeting, tweet.  When you're on YouTube, YouTube, when you're doing tweet, do eight hour shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's appropriate for YouTube, you think, Leo?  What makes it right?  Besides not pixelating the way I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  You know, we were talking before the show about how disappointed I was that we took  this really big chance and I thought made a great show, our gaming show Game On.  And it just we couldn't make it financially viable.  So I may not be a good judge of what people want to see.  I thought people wanted to see that.  But my guess would be on YouTube short.  I think I don't know.  I think what we're going to do is short how to stuff.  Yeah, I think that's really what we should do.  I think that's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, you know, there are other things on there like tabletop.  This is the geek and sundry stuff.  The tabletop gaming that Wil Wheaton does is doing well and is longer form.  I wouldn't call that short form.  Right.  So it has Wil Wheaton.  It has Wil Wheaton and occasionally some other stars of various sci fi programming.  So, yeah, I mean, maybe that's more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can send which, of course, Tom Merritt and Veronica do a show on there called Sword  and Laser has 16 million video views, 280,000 subscribers.  It's got Felicia Day.  It's really the Felicia Day channel.  So that helps.  They've got a lot of good things.  Actually, one of their breakout hits is written by a kid where a kid is going to be a  where a kid walks through a script and then they get the best, the biggest, the one that  was the most popular was the written link did a written by a kid episode.  That's hysterical.  It is.  It's called, let me see if I can find it, Goth Boy.  And they and what they do is they not only they get three or four videos out of it.  So they get the making of Goth Boy, Goth Boy.  But let me see how long these are.  They're not very long.  Now, those are short form.  Yeah.  So Goth Boy is two minutes, 55 seconds.  By the way, pre-roll on most of this, this does not have pre-roll for some reason.  Did you tell everyone your name, please?  And then the then the then the pop up of videos.  This is how Google's monetizing it.  What is it called?  And I presume because they made so much money, you know, they put in 150 million and they  got there.  If they're put another 200 million in, that tells me it paid off.  It paid off.  Right.  Unless they're doubling down on a on a on a weekend.  But I can't imagine them doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is the company that made the queue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And killed it quickly.  Yeah.  That's the Larry Page touch, by the way.  I think credit to Larry Page.  He is not going to suffer fools gladly.  He is not going to suffer weak products.  He's just going to go move next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this ties in with and I know we're going to get to this in a minute, but the  Google Fiber thing, right?  Because that is a story.  They want to provide content to their new audience, basically.  And and they're going to have a difficulty because they're competing with all the cable  stuff and they're like, oh, you're going to bypass the cable networks.  You know, they're not going to cable networks.  I don't know how much there is a little bit of programming they're going to get, but not  much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's talk about what Google is offering with this Google Fiber, because it is more than  we thought.  So you remember about what is it six months ago, a year ago, Google had a campaign.  What city we're going to pick a city would like us to wire it with fiber gigabit fiber.  And we tried to do it here in Petaluma would have changed my business model.  But we also many other cities, Topeka, Kansas renamed itself Google Kansas.  There was a really strong competition, but it turned out it also had to do with the utility  infrastructure, things like that.  And Kansas City, Missouri won.  And Google is now now they're not installing it yet, right?  They're the first thing they're doing is really smart is a campaign.  You have to say I will take it if you're in the affected areas and give them $10.  And then if enough people in that neighborhood, they call it the fiber hood, do the same.  Then Google will roll into that fiber hood.  So it's really brilliant.  Talk about good.  Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also a $300 construction fee to get the fiber from the from I guess from the curb  to your house as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But in some cases they waive that.  OK, good.  You have 30.  They have 39 days, seven hours and 57 minutes left to Kansas.  Oh, by the way, it looks like it's Kansas City, Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri.  Yes.  What?  What?  What's the bunny?  That's the fiber bunny.  It's got very hot haunches apparently.  And maybe that's not infrared.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't care where it is.  I'm moving there.  I know I want it.  I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you have to rally your neighbors to pre-register.  September 10th, they'll announce the results.  Now, what's surprising is how much you get.  Tell us about the pricing here.  Yeah, so 70.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So either package, you have two packages and either one that you get.  There's a free package too.  And there's a free package that includes five megabits per second down and one megabit per second up.  So the free package is better than your DSL provider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  OK, good start.  And then if you go with, there's a $70 per month package that gets you broadband only or $120 package that gets you broadband plus TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, let me say something.  When you say broadband only, you're talking about a gigabit down and up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, that's what they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A symmetric gigabit.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Which is, I mean, yeah, exactly.  You see Leo's response here.  That is, I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And those two packages, those two packages, they waive the $300 fee.  If you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you do it.  OK, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let me just say we have 150 megabits, one eighth as much coming into the Brickhouse for about, I think we pay four or five thousand dollars a month for that.  Jesus.  So it's a seventh of the speed for a lot.  I don't know.  I can't even do the math.  I think it's a little boggled.  40 times the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if you want the five megabit, then you pay the $300 installation fee and you pay nothing ever again.  And that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think for a couple of years it's guaranteed.  Although we know how Google does that.  They give themselves an hour.  Now, what do you get with TV?  Do they have actual contracts with cable company or whatever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It includes.  This is from The Verge.  This is what they say.  They have a fiber broadcast network, hundreds in quotes, fiber channel, fiber channels and on demand movies and shows.  But what I haven't seen and maybe this is in one of the other articles here, but I haven't seen actually how they're going to deliver this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you got a gigabit.  They have these three boxes.  There's a TV box.  There's a DVR storage box.  And then there's the network box.  You also we forgot to mention they throw in a Nexus 7 tablet as your remote control.  Right.  Right.  And isn't there a Google Drive tie in somehow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get a terabyte of Google Drive space.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure.  Why not throw it in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I'm looking at the Google.  This is the Google Fiber Web page and it says all your favorite channels and more.  And it looks like they have, in fact, they did the deals, done the deals.  You can pay extra and get HBO, Skinimax, Starz, Showtime.  But it looks like you've got.  Well, it says Google Fiber is always getting better.  We're constantly adding new channels.  So clearly they're you know, these are they've got the Discovery channels.  They've got Comedy Central.  That's good.  They've got C-SPAN 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like basic cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of like basic cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the grandmas, they don't have phones.  They don't have CNN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't have MSNBC.  They've got Bravo, but they don't have AMC.  So there's there are gaps.  You can't watch Breaking Bad.  They have MTV.  But I think this is early, right?  Who knows what will happen when they roll out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would get in the flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And with a gigabit up and down, you've got plenty of room to have very good HD content and still have unlimited, virtually unlimited bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I'm wondering, and again, I should have researched this a little bit more, is are these boxes Motorola boxes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't look like it, but that's an interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if the technology inside came from Motorola.  They own them. Might as well.  That's what I'm thinking.  Maybe there was a little bit more to this Motorola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The TV box looks a lot like the Sony Google TV that they just announced, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've got to make a do to handle that speed.  I mean, don't forget, cable boxes are the dumbest piece on earth.  This is purpose built.  This has to be new.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, some some known card throw into the box and the loss, the loss on this hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The network box also has three by three MIMO antennas and A02 to 11, ABG and N with dual concurrent radios.  I mean, this is state of the art.  It's a serious equipment.  Not AC, but but at least in.  Yeah.  Well, I all I could say is what my real question, though, is is this a business for Google that they plan to put in other cities?  Or is this a neener, neener, neener to ISPs warning them you ought to do better or we could?  You know, Google's never going to say if it's not really a plan to go to other cities, they must be a huge money loser.  We don't know.  I think it's the latter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I think you can see the future stories coming.  It says, wow, look what they have in Kansas City and everybody gets jealous.  And we have yet another reason to be really mad at our cable companies, not that they care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's an experiment.  I mean, I really think it's you don't think this is a business.  Experiment or demonstration?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a difference there.  I would say I would say it's an experiment at this point.  I would say it's still in the experimental phase.  So what do they want to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If it's an experiment, demonstration is neener, neener, neener.  Experiment is they want to learn things.  What do you think they want to learn mostly?  Well, I think that they're learning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they already started deploying a lot of fiber between their own data centers, right?  So they've got a lot of experience in doing fiber.  I think this is an experiment to say, look, we think we can take this to the next stage.  Let's pick a city and see if we can actually deploy it.  Number one, right?  So you've got the technical requirements.  Does it work?  Can we deliver the service?  But then the big question is, does it make money?  Does it pay off?  And I think that's the experimental part.  Is this going to I think this is a experiment to see whether they can actually do this at scale and turn it into a business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do have I might make a trip.  That's right.  I got to check tickets to Kansas City.  They have opened the Google Fiber Cafe where you can relax and enjoy refreshments and discover your fiber hood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have a couple of Chromebooks there.  An old fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did they make that word up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did.  It says it.  Discover your fiber hood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, this feeds into all of their products and all of their services connecting the world's information.  You know, if they can wire everybody up with super fast Internet, the peer to peer capabilities are just crazy, insane and mind boggling.  Does it make them money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not the issue.  The more people use the Internet, the more Google makes that.  Before it's just plain true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just use it and we'll worry about the rest.  Next is seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're losing money on it for a reason.  It's a signal generator.  They are more we use it.  And by the way, I love it.  The more they make money.  Period.  That's the rule.  That's a good business model.  I like it.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  Just eat as many as you want.  We'll make more.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm just it's makes it's no question that there's kind of general widespread awareness of this even among the regular public that it makes people want it.  They're getting very, you know, antsy.  They're saying, well, why can't we have that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google really should do when it's in.  They really should do a junket like Hollywood does and bring in tech people and have them come into homes and talk to little Johnny and then grandma and what they're doing with it.  Hi, I'm George Clooney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How is your fiber hood?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every tech conference automatically being Kansas City now.  Like, can we move south by southwest to Kansas City?  You know, it's not going to be you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, I mean, it's pretty clear.  I guess it's pretty clear that everybody wants it.  It's unclear whether Google can is making money on this or it is there is a business model that makes sense.  It's also unclear whether Google's plan is to extend this anywhere past this area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can expect cable companies to come in and and argue that this is a an oligarchic move on Google's part and trying to prime the notion the economics are unrealistic and impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know what I haven't seen is any counter programming from other ISPs yet.  I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're stuck because because they know Google is not going to move right now.  And so they don't move.  Right.  I mean, they airline model.  Keep your prisoner.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they were I mean, I remember they fought pretty heavily against some of the other cities that were trying to to do, you know, implement their own fiber services in towns.  Wasn't it Pittsburgh or Philadelphia?  Maybe that was that their own fiber.  Right.  And I don't want to house do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And well, the other thing is that it is happening, though, I'm wrong on this.  But God, the pixelation.  So Verizon is now offering, you know, the higher speeds and the competitors to Verizon are stepping up there.  On the one hand, that's good news.  The other hand is bad news because it does start to create this precedent of having to buy the tiers.  And what's interesting about Google is beyond the basic level, once you buy the hundred or the gig, it's unlimited.  They put no limits on you.  And that's a fundamentally different model from where the cable companies are headed, which is to try to tear you in speeds and then probably in usage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's it's I'm just surprised that.  It might make cable companies must believe that Google is not a threat or they would be counter programming this maybe.  Yes, I just think they they feel like they're such a big lead right now.  Let's wait and see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's wait and see.  Let's see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I bet you they're preparing ads right now.  What would an anti-Google fiberhead say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you see it right now.  You see it with what could possibly say Verizon.  Well, but they see they argue against you in my market.  You watch cable vision argue against Verizon and see people come back or they have this frustration or they don't have this.  They don't know that.  And then you see the argument against satellite and dish.  So they do a lot of negative political campaign against each other in this market.  Right.  Right.  So I'm in an overbilled market and I have Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or does Comcast Verizon AT&T go to their man in Washington?  Because this is what they did against civic Wi-Fi.  Right.  Right.  In Pennsylvania, Philly, they rolled out the Wi-Fi.  Well, I don't know.  It doesn't matter.  You just make one up.  And so Verizon and Comcast went to Congress and said, you know, so here's the story they made up for this one.  They said, well, you know, if these governments get into the business, that's very anti-American because they're kind of undermining big businesses ability to make money in a market and government shouldn't be competing with us.  And they got laws.  It's actually they got laws in almost every state of the union.  They didn't do it in Congress.  They did it locally saying you can't have civic Wi-Fi.  Google is not government yet.  Well, you know, Google is an as a trust is a monopoly and they're using their monopoly on the Internet to foster to get into a business that is they do not belong in.  And I think the FTC should investigate this.  It's probably a dumping argument.  How long before the FTC investigation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The second it gets in someone's house in Kansas City, Missouri or whatever.  Why am I giving them ideas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  The FTC or the FCC?  Well, the FTC is gets involved in antitrust.  What could the FCC be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the FCC would be completely for this, right?  Because there's the whole competition plan is their national broadband plan.  Exactly.  Not only that, but, you know, basically these cable companies have a monopoly in these markets.  It's not nationwide, but most places you can only get one cable.  I can't get two different cable companies.  Right.  And then in other places you get Comcast or you get Time Warner or you get something else.  Now with Google coming in, you get, oh, not only are the cable companies in DSL, but now I've got this Google thing.  I mean, competition is good, especially for this type of thing.  Oh, we want it.  I think the FCC would say, yes, this is actually good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was the FCC that gave these companies their monopolies and duopolies.  That's true.  Saying, well, you know, if you're going to install copper in the ground, you have to own that market forever and ever and ever.  So who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they've turned around at least with this administration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope so.  Yeah, they've got the national broadband plan.  They recognize the need to get Internet everywhere, even in rural areas where there's no money to be made.  And they recognize the need for competition.  I think the FCC perhaps even recognizes that they blew it.  Yeah.  And they need to right that wrong.  I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, here's where you're right.  I think you'll have Congress, somebody in Congress will come and do a Saturday press conference saying that this is unfair competition.  Competition and dumping of technology on a market by the monopolistic Google and they'll ask for investigations.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why you see this play out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dumping. That's it.  It's dumping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at the list of who gets the most money from the cable companies.  And that's who we call in the press conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room said they saw on Google Plus that somebody in the area was already is already being offered six months of free showtime.  If you don't switch away from our fine cable company, interesting.  Let it begin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  Weeds is worth holding on to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, God, I'd love to live in Kansas City.  Even if you don't get the fiber, you're going to have people throwing money at you saying, don't switch.  We'd hate to have a happy neighborhood of fiber hood users.  Here's the ad.  This is the fiber ad that they were airing in some of those markets.  We're looking at street guys coming down it on a little moped and he stopped in front of a home.  He's looking around.  He looks kind of like the guy from Breaking Bad.  Oh, really fast broadband is the guy that's the really fast broadband guy.  He's going to.  Here comes a motorcycle.  Motorcycle.  I would guess this would be even faster broadband.  Google fiber.  Fiber.  Oh, Google fibers on a motorcycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Comcast is on a moped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they're going to race.  They're going to race.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there goes the moped putting along motorcycle.  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's kind of a low production.  Kind of a pedestrian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really wants a fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hops don't like motorcycles though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that really the ad?  Google Fresno?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, this was no.  Oh, this was not a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was not.  This was Fresno.  No wonder.  That was part of their bid to get into.  OK, cut that out.  Forget I mentioned it.  I was misinformed.  Google Wallet overhauled support for major credit and debit cards.  Ah, big news.  Big news.  Now a new remote disable feature as well.  So somebody steals or you lose your phone.  You could disable a Google Wallet.  That's certainly be a concern for some people.  So it's an NFC enabled app.  And for the first few months it was Citibank only, right?  You had a Citicard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or the Google had their own gift card basically type thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I have a Google account, but that wouldn't work, right?  No, it wouldn't work.  So now MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Discover, Credit and Debit Cards.  All supported.  Wow.  I'm going to download Google Wallet.  Do I have to have a Nexus phone?  Can I put it on a regular Android phone?  As long as it has NFC, right?  It has to have NFC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they actually announced several different phones that this would work for now that it wasn't working for before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have my Galaxy S3.  Can I put it on there?  It's got NFC.  Yeah, I believe so.  And by the way, it says now anything you use with Google Checkout will work.  So if you have Google Checkout and it's working for you, good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's the big difference is that before they were kind of like two separate systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't even bother downloading it because I don't have a Citicard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. One that you could use before.  And then you got that free $10 Google card.  And so I was putting money on that.  And then I had my phone broke actually.  And I got another phone while the Google Wallet is tied to your phone.  So I actually had to call a special number and get that money transferred over.  Luckily, I thought about it before I sent the phone back because your account number,  the only way you can get that is on the phone.  Just a heads up for those of you replacing your phone using Google Wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you lose your phone, so you should write your account number down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's a way to get it back.  If you call them and you're like, I don't have my phone anymore,  you can go through the trouble and get your account number and everything.  I think I have my snapper.  There's ways to do it, but it's just a hassle.  But this is great news.  And the fact that they allow you to remotely disable, unfortunately,  Google Wallet is not yet available for your device or mobile network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is the unblocked Galaxy S3 on AT&T?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's probably why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you mean that's probably why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if it's the unlocked version.  Did you get that overseas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are you searching for, Leo?  Google Wallet?  It won't work.  I just installed it.  It says I'm not supported.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You probably have to have the official one.  I have to have like an official one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the unlocked European one.  And that's their punishment.  Yeah.  I spent $650 on this phone and they're punishing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's ways around that, Leo, if you want me to help you out.  Should I root it?  Yeah, you can root it and make it work.  But the thing that's cool about this is the fact that you can also remotely disable.  That's a big feature, a big security feature.  And they've really needed that for a while now because people lose their phones all the time.  They get stolen.  I think it's one of the more common things to steal right now.  Oh, it is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We talked about this a couple of months ago that in New York taxi cabs,  if you leave a phone in a taxi cab, the cab driver could return it,  could call the police, give it to them,  or could drive it to this guy who stands there on the corner waiting for cab drivers to drive by with phones.  And if you've wiped it, he'll give you whatever, 20 bucks.  If it's unwiped, he'll give you 50 bucks because all the data that's still on there is really useful.  So just a word of warning.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'll definitely get consumers more comfortable with the idea of taking money from.  Got to be able to wipe it.  And mine is rooted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a unsupported version.  Mine says unsupported device, but it actually works.  And the new app is out now.  So I'm going to have to go.  Now you have a Nexus redo this.  Yeah, this is a Galaxy Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you would think that that would not be a problem at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is Verizon's Galaxy Nexus.  So you have the opposite problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have a carrier phone.  I have a non carrier phone, but neither of us can run it.  Neither of them work.  So if I root this, I should be able to.  I believe it will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to do a little research.  What about your Nexus 7?  Yeah, it's available for the Nexus 7 as well.  That has NFC?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it does.  All right.  Well, there you go.  It's Wi-Fi only.  So it's going to be completely useless when I go to the coffee shop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it'll still work.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It will still work without internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I believe it'll still work.  Because what it does is it tells the chip on the device how much money you've got.  And then it keeps.  So there's two tracking mechanisms, one in the cloud and one on the device.  Dr. Mom is confirming what you said.  Say again?  What am I looking up?  Google Wallet?  Wallet, yeah.  Yeah, Google Wallet.  There's a post in the...  It comes up with somebody else's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Show notes.  Oh, you know what?  Oh, wait a minute.  On the Nexus 7, they don't offer it.  It's not showing up in the store on the Nexus 7.  It doesn't show up at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dr. Mom in our chat room who has an official AT&T Galaxy S3 in a brilliant, beautiful nail-polished  red, by the way, says it does work on hers.  Yeah, it says it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It found one customer.  Congratulations, Dr. Mom.  The balloons are coming down from the ceiling right now.  I want the red one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd buy the red one.  All right.  One more time.  Here is the official, I hope so.  If this is from the city of Peoria, I'm going to really be peeved.  Google Fiber.  Is this for Google Fiber?  Google Fiber ad.  One more time.  Let's see.  This is the official one.  Modem sound.  That's good.  Always a good sign.  Oh, these...  You know what?  This little car model is actually at the Fiber Cafe in Kansas City.  You can go sue it.  So there's a train going by with a song downloading, moving fairly slowly.  Maximum speed, 56K.  So that's the old days.  That's modems.  These cars are moving around.  They're little play cars.  I'm describing this for the home audience.  And they're waiting and waiting and waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they're still at 56K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the green light that's loading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's hilarious.  Loading, loading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then the highway that you get on the information super highway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's moving in a very...  Oh, there's a telephone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is cute.  This is actually a physical real model that you can go see if you live in Kansas City.  In Kansas City, Missouri.  Speed limit, 10 megabits per second.  Oops, things are speeding up.  We're getting broad now.  Things are getting better.  Still a traffic jam, but your inbox at least is moving along.  Little Gmail cubes there.  Spam.  Uh-oh.  Draw a bridge up.  One gigabyte, one and a half gigabytes, two gigabytes, 2.2 gigabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little container ship carrying data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now we're going to the tunnel.  And here we go to Fiberland.  Isn't that happy?  Whee!  Your speed, one gigabit per second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is cute.  Yeah, that's pretty good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just fun.  And the song is what?  You got just what I needed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The next chapter starts here 100 times faster internet, 100 times the possibilities.  Google Fiber.com.  Google.com slash Fiber.  That was cute.  Yeah, that was good.  I was going to say, just you got what I needed.  That's subliminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Subliminal messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, for some reason I feel like that's just what I needed.  I don't know why.  Me too.  We all do.  Fast, fast, fast.  We all do, my friend.  Google has partnered with NFL.com for Google Hangouts.  Just another one of the, I tell you, this Hangout thing.  It will power the NFL.com fantasy football experience.  Yeah, I think this is one of those things that if you're wondering whether Google is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  bullish on going social or not, I think doing a deal with the NFL and embedding Google Hangouts  for fantasy football is a sign they're sticking with it.  So you're going to see this everywhere on NFL.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe Hangouts might be the real success of Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I don't find people are just spontaneously hanging out, which is what Google always hoped  for.  They're pushing it with these deals.  The few times that I've gone in and said, I'll be trying to hang out right now, nothing  really happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who really wants to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's hard to believe.  I mean, someone like, I mean, like I was saying before with my experience was I started at  one up, just made it public and all these people came.  I'm surprised, Jeff, with your, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't done it in a little while, but you know, yeah, I've just found that it kind of  just sits there.  Maybe it's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I would expect the opposite.  Yeah, you'd think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not like you're enough of that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The idea with this deal is you provide the context and the reason for chatting.  They've expanded it to 12 people so you can get your whole fantasy team in there and chatting  and talking smack and doing all that stuff.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what do you think about that, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I heard you, it was yesterday on Marketplace.  I think you were talking about something similar with Twitter.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the whole Twitter kerfuffle.  Oh, well, we haven't even gotten to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hashtag NBC fail, folks.  That and then the Twitter fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the huge thing that the NBC fail hashtag has been is magnificently amusing.  It's almost better than a badminton match.  And people complain about about the opening ceremonies, about the tape delay, about stupid  commentators, all kinds of things.  And I got into a huge discussion about that.  I've been in a huge discussion about this in terms of the models that, of course, people  say, well, you idiot Jarvis.  Obviously, NBC has to force the audience to prime time because that's where the money  is.  Well, yeah, and no.  The thing is now that Twitter is a gigantic spoiler network and everybody knows what the  results are long before.  Yet, NBC's ratings have still been record.  Now, they would argue this because they're forcing us there.  I think that if people could watch the things they want to watch when they want to watch  it, they would talk about it more in social and they'd have an even bigger audience.  And in any case, NBC is not giving the people what they want when they want it, which is  very disturbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So a Guardian reporter named Guy Adams, an independent, independent reporter, independent,  sorry, did what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He went along and he he fetched.  I'm actually a few of us are very mad because then he was labeled the number one NBC fail  and my God, I wanted that gold medal myself.  But Guy went and complained and complained and complained.  And then finally, he said, I don't forget the guy's name.  He put in the email address of the executive in charge of NBC Sports.  Gary Zelnick, is it?  Zinkel.  Zinkel.  And he put in an email address and the email address is was pretty straightforward.  It was first name dot last name at NBC UI dot com and uni dot com.  And next thing you knew was account was just killed.  Now, then there was a lot of forensic effort to say, well, OK, well, did he violate the  rules?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The terms of service say you're not allowed to reveal personal information, personal email,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  personal email, unpublished personal email.  The argument here was number one, it had been published before.  Number two, it was fairly standard.  Number three was corporate.  And then number four, Twitter, by its policy, is supposed to come to the user and say, there's  been a complaint about you.  Will you take this down before?  And instead, they just cut it out.  Then it comes out that Twitter said this was a result of a complaint from NBC.  But then NBC said, no, no, no.  Twitter came to us and told us to complain.  And so we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, because NBC and Twitter are, of course, in bed together.  In fact, if you've watched the Olympics, you'll see full screen and, you know, hashtag Olympics  with a Twitter logo and everything.  I mean, there's definitely a nexus between the two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So then the chief counsel of Google did finally they finally reinstated Guy Adams.  Oh, they did.  Yes, they did.  And they admitted that what had happened here was someone in the commercial team had gone  to NBC.  And then the complaint team was not aware of this.  When a complaint came from NBC, they just automatically just did it.  They still violated it.  And I think there's probably more lines of communication there than Twitter is admitting.  So we're at stasis again now.  The problems are that I don't think that I think that Twitter started down the road and  did apologize and apologized for basically censoring content.  And Twitter has done honorable things politically when it came to the Arab Spring, of course,  and WikiLeaks and Occupy Wall Street.  But when it came to a commercial relationship, this is the first test of their principles  in church versus state.  And they fail.  And they fail pretty badly, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me underscore that he was not in violation of terms of service.  People might say, well, it's still an email address, but it's in the terms of service.  And the state does say specifically if information was previously posted or displayed elsewhere  on the Internet prior to being put on Twitter, it is not a violation of this policy.  And that email address had been published.  He offered to Twitter the link where it was clearly visible.  So he did not, in fact, violate the terms of service at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they still haven't admitted all that was wrong.  What they said was wrong was that we went and we proactively looked at content and then  initiated this complaint.  But I think there's a much bigger discussion here, obviously, about the responsibilities  of a platform.  And some people say to me, Jarvis, this is a business.  It's not a free speech platform.  No, it's a speech platform.  And if speech there is not free, then we're not going to trust it.  Then it's not a platform anymore.  And it's not just used for silly complaints about tape delays on the Olympics.  It's used for revolutions.  It's used for journalism and information.  It's used for people sharing information in crises.  It's now something that we depend upon.  And if we cannot trust Twitter to put us paramount above those sponsor economic relationships,  then we can't trust it.  And it's not a platform.  And that is a discussion that we still have to have.  Twitter went a long way, but the discussion ain't over, folks.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's no us.  There's no tweets.  There's no sponsors.  Right.  NBC came to Twitter because we're all there talking about things and, you know, mentioning  things.  You can't decide, oh, we only want it when it's good, when it's bad.  It's naughty and you should take action.  And plus, there was already precedence on the site.  Celebrities have tweeted people's phone numbers and email addresses because they were being  stalked.  And their accounts never disappeared.  So this was clearly a sponsor over a user decision, like Jeff mentioned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And what that means is they've got to come up with the culture.  The irony here is I think that they've got to learn the lesson that newspapers had to  learn long ago when sponsors came in to free us from ownership from political parties and  sponsors gave us independence.  But we had to have independence from the sponsors in turns.  We built what we called church state walls that you couldn't do certain things, that  you guaranteed no influence from the sponsor.  Now, of course, newspapers have lost most of their trust.  They've lost for all kinds of reasons, like putting up crap and killing the products badly  and not bringing the digital age and so on and so forth.  So I'm not saying the newspapers are pure.  But I am saying that this is a discussion that's been had.  And the question becomes really, is Twitter just a tech company?  Well, no, Twitter is more than that now.  It's something we depend upon.  And this is where people like Dave Weiner will come along and say, well, you're getting  what you sow here, folks.  You're putting your lot, including journalism itself, in the hands of a private company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is the whole thing with Bear Hug Camp.  And we talked about this a lot.  That's why I quit Twitter in the beginning, was I really felt like it was a silo and they  didn't seem like they really cared.  And that's why I supported Evan Prodromo's status.net, which was an open source federated  version of Twitter that wasn't controlled by any one company.  We signed up for it.  Yep.  We signed up for Twitter.  Is there a precedent, Jeff, for I wonder if there's a historical precedent, and as our  resident historian, maybe you can invoke Habermas or Gutenberg, but is there a precedent for  a private company becoming so critical, is it AT&T perhaps, critical to the nation and  to the commonweal that it is suddenly held to a higher standard and is no longer able  to act as a private company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  But then there's the danger that I'm going to sound like a libertarian now, which I play  one on TV, though I vote Democratic in the voting booth.  And I also want to be careful about that.  I don't want government to come in and say, aha, now we have to take over and we have  to have a role in this.  We're going to start to manage Twitter and Google and Facebook as public utilities.  I don't agree with that either.  I want to keep government out of this.  So that is the precedent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  AT&T, private company, created long lines, created a way of communicating that became  universal and the government said, okay, now you're a utility and we regulate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The difference was that they were granted government polls and government space and  franchises and so on.  And Twitter has not been.  But I do think that what has to happen and I think it was Anil Dash who said, let's have  a constructive discussion about this.  And I agree.  There needs to be a discussion with Twitter about what the principles are.  What principles do we hold them up to?  What standards do we hold them up to in our community?  Because we're the ones who have to do this.  And this is the argument I made, pardon for the plug, in public parts, that we have to  have a discussion about the principles of the tools of publicness, what we're protecting  from government, what we're protecting from the companies and interests so that we also  give companies something to hide behind.  They can say, well, sorry, this is what we have to do.  When I worked on newspapers, it was very convenient for a publisher to be able to say to a pissed  off advertiser, I wish I could do something, but I can't because here are the rules I operate  under and you got to understand our asset is credibility and that's why it has to operate  this way and I cannot go and influence that.  Well, Twitter has to learn those same lessons and I think we in technology have to hold  some kind of discussion, some kind of sessions to be able to have that discussion so it doesn't  just happen inside Twitter.  It happens around Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really feel like, I still want to get back to that idea of status net, that we really  ought to, okay, granted we might need some sort of internet based signaling system that's  as important as a phone system, but should it not be an open source federated system  that no one company owns?  That's what I've always thought.  But of course people go with what's convenient.  Nobody else is aware of this issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the problem.  I mean, Twitter is one of a handful of companies I think is so ripe for a competitor like this,  an open competitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well status net was really well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so hard for them to get a foothold.  I mean, Twitter has such a handle on all of their users.  It's the network effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Once you have that critical mass of users, it's very difficult to unseat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well now you see why they're spending so much time and they have a team that works with  NBC during the Olympics.  I mean, they've been building that relationship for years.  So they have that relationship.  to come along and say, Hey guys, you should put our hashtag or our symbol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And NBC is going to if they see somebody else become as I mean, NBC is just following where  we're going.  Yep.  So really it's not NBC you have to convince.  They're not going to march into some social network where nobody is.  It's the people.  Yep.  But you know, somebody asked me, I think it was Tanya actually a couple of days ago.  Well, is there going to be a somebody that replaces Facebook as MySpace was replaced  by Facebook or that replaces Twitter?  And I'm starting to think that we are getting out of the size where you will not see somebody  come along.  I think the same thing happened with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But here's the question.  If you were Marissa seeing this, I think you start to see an opportunity.  But I think that there was this, you know, on the lineup earlier was was Microsoft changing  online mail.  I think mail was essentially broken.  I think Twitter needs a next generation.  Is there an opportunity there to take the critical mass that she has and rethink?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How is that any better than it's just another?  Private company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's competition, at least it's competition.  Now, Bill Gross has come along and full disclosure, I'm a nano investor in what he's done in  Uber Media.  But he's basically he would never put it this way.  But he's kind of created a bit of a shadow Twitter hasn't taken off.  But it feeds Twitter.  It's another place where you can put things that have a life outside of Twitter.  And I think that's still possible.  But but but what's Twitter is going to do is it's going to keep shutting down its API.  It's had all the statements about shutting down the developers even more.  Zuckerberg also said we may we may develop more things in house.  So what happens to the notion of a privately held platform?  Is it even possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I would bring up Craigslist as another example, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  They're shutting down right now.  And story this week.  You want to tell about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't I mean, the fact that they're suing the the developers of these third party  apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That and then they're also putting new conditions on when you give them content that you're  basically licensing it to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.  Yep.  And all their Web 1.0 goodness.  Wow.  I mean, I don't know why there isn't another Craigslist.  I mean, I love Craigslist.  You know, I use it.  It works.  But I mean, why isn't there an alternative?  There's so much I was thinking just after reading some of these third party stories about  the third party developers and what they're trying to do.  I mean, these are all things that Craigslist should be doing.  Right.  And hold on here for a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So instead of compete, instead of improve, instead of innovate, lock down, right?  Shut down.  So what competes with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I said there's a few examples of this.  Netscape was going to own Web servers way back in the day.  What came along?  Apache.  Microsoft was going to own browsers.  What came along?  Mozilla and Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be nice.  And it took Mozilla a while to get to get traction.  In fact, I remember thinking this is a failed open source project.  They gave away the code.  Nobody did anything to it for years.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they don't need to win the whole market to have the good influence that they have.  Now what are the what are the names of the kids who did the Kickstarter project?  Diaspora.  Diaspora, which of course going anywhere on Facebook.  Is there a way to create something that's big enough to keep Twitter honest and even  give them cover to say, well, you know, folks, stockholders, we have to do this because look  at our competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I guess the market's big enough you could divide it in half.  We tried.  We did.  We created a status net.  I think we still have a status net stream called the twit army.  And it just it didn't get traction because you go where people are.  And even if it's your twit crowd, it wasn't enough.  You go where the people aren't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The interesting part about this is and might seem off topic, but you understand.  So Lady Gaga has Lady Gaga has her own social networks, little monsters.  Yes.  I thought that was a really good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's an opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a brilliant move.  Bring them in.  She can market to them directly, talk to them directly and not rely on all this noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what if for that to succeed, I believe I don't think people are going to be on two  different places.  So people are going to abandon Twitter for Lady Gaga.  That's only the hardest core Gaga fence.  Good for Gaga.  Doesn't really make a difference in this in this in the realm we're talking about.  People have limited time.  They have little bit of tension.  They're not going to participate in four different Twitter like social networks.  This is not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the irony is Sarah Ross, who is part of the new waywire company that Cory Booker is  involved in.  I met her recently.  She helped as I understand it.  She helped really build little monsters and she used Twitter to do it.  Yeah.  You find you exploit Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that network effect to get really huge, you're going to have to get the mainstream  consumers over to it, right?  Because you can get the people that started on Twitter very early.  And it took years for us to be loud enough to bring people in, to bring brands in, to  bring interest in.  How do you replicate that again?  How does Facebook replicate what it created with starting with colleges and keeping it  closed?  Can someone come along and do that again?  They really nail it.  I don't believe that innovation is over and it's them forever.  But boy, it's not as easy as replicating technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think Google Plus has shown that.  Bringing it full circle, Google Plus has shown that as good as it is and as much as us technologists  like it for the conversations we have there, it's got a long way to go to get up to anywhere  close to where Facebook is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.  How do we find out how well Outlook.com, Microsoft's new email venture is doing?  On Twitter, they tweeted, 1 million people have signed up for a new modern email experience  at Outlook.com.  And there's the growth chart, which when you go from 0 to 1 million in a day, it pretty  much looks like a straight line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Microsoft keeps fighting yesterday's battles though, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they say we're going to reinvent email, but really it looks to me just like a skinned  hotmail.  Which is actually what it is, isn't it?  It's just hotmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you're going to reinvent email, you have to have a structure that gets me relevance  and gets rid of spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well they have a Jockmail filtering, as I see my spam.  Yeah, I know, but it's still not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not just spam, it's also people who can bug me, who I don't want to bug me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems like mail is ripe for reinvention.  Exactly.  It's going to sound crazy, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's AOL.  AOL mail just re-skinned itself.  It's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the deal with Outlook.  It does integrate into Office 365.  For instance, I see in my quick views in my folders, I also see SkyDrive documents.  I see photos that I have shared.  I think that there is some potential there for somebody who's really sold into the Microsoft  ecosystem, but it does not reinvent email.  It's the same exact thing as any email client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is Bob Lyman from Google.  He sat me down one day and said, and I'll tell you, Jeff, when email was broken, we  talked about this some time ago, it's when the decision was made to allow the sender  to control.  And that's what broke email.  And so you need a recipient-controlled infrastructure, which is an entirely separate infrastructure  I allow you in to have conversations with me under these terms to violate your route.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just said a guy at Google told you that.  What have they done to make it happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll tell you exactly what they did, Leo.  That's the architecture of Google+.  Google+, it's recipient-controlled.  Well, it's not replacing my email.  The only thing is that we're not.  The only thing we're not, it became spam, were the things they've eliminated.  And so you are in full control of what you see on Google+, and you can get rid of people,  you can get rid of messages, you can get rid of other things.  The only thing that comes in is some measure of comment spam, and they made it very easy  to deal with.  Otherwise, it is fully recipient-controlled.  So I think that Google+, is the beginning of a whole different architecture of communication,  but that's not the way they've set it up.  They've set it up as social and be everywhere.  But I think there's an opportunity to rethink in recipient control and take a subset of  that.  The irony is, Google+, it's actually fairly hard to send a direct message to someone,  and you're afraid they're going to miss it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and it really just turns it into email.  Exactly.  Direct messaging is not...  It's an email message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you guys see the video for the new Outlook.com?  No.  It was kind of interesting because I signed up for this because, well, now I need to replace  my Hotmail account, which is where all my junk went.  But it was kind of interesting because they show this video of a chalkboard, right?  And they draw basically a picture of Gmail, and they cross out all this stuff, and they  say, oh, we want to get rid of this, we want to get rid of this, we want to get rid of  this.  And then you get to the Outlook page, and it looks like what they just crossed out to  me.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gmail.  Why every picture...  Here's the picture.  Watch the picture.  So it's Gmail, obviously.  Here's the stuff they cross out.  And they cross out that.  A little bit of fluff at the top.  Yeah.  And they cross out, okay, a lot of sidebar stuff, which, by the way, they replace on  Outlook with ads.  Yeah, exactly.  Clean UI, intuitive, modern devices, Office, SkyDrive, Sweep.  And there it is, ladies and gentlemen, the brand new Outlook email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got the blue paper engineered from the ground up to be completely different.  You're right.  It does look the same.  It looks exactly the same as what they just crossed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  By the way, this is...  By the way, they went with a blackboard, not a whiteboard, and a blueprint, not cat.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is, to me, why Microsoft seems like they just...  There's something wrong in Redmond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What the heck?  That's the exact...  You're exactly right.  That's crazy.  I watched the video, and I'm like, are they crossing themselves out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, look at mine, because what they replaced, they crossed out all those things on the right,  the calendar and everything.  They replaced them with context lens commercials.  It's like, I don't know why I'm getting glucosamine for dog ads, but this is not what I want to  see in my email, to be honest.  And I don't think that that's really solved any problems.  And as for the left part...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft's going overboard with the Metro thing.  They're like, we're going to slap this Metro design on everything, and you're just going  to love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they need to, because they're trying to...  This is their antidote to what everybody else, particularly Apple, is doing.  And so they need to go all in.  You can't just say, we'll do some Metro at some places.  This is the culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Even their website looks like it.  From its very beginning, right?  From CPM to MS-DOS, from WordStar to Word, from Google search to Bing.  Yeah, you're right.  The great copiers.  Microsoft has never, ever, ever innovated an entirely new product.  And I'm not criticizing that.  It's kind of the Jason Calacanis model, too.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ow!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, this is the new Microsoft website, by the way.  And even this, they stole from the Dutch subway system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there you go!  Hey, Leo, did Microsoft tweet out how many of those million users are still active with  Outlook.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you had to switch.  I switched because we're on Hotmail, right?  So Hotmail, by the way, is bigger.  I'm pretty sure it's still bigger than Gmail.  I mean, it's huge.  Because lots of people like Aaron use it for their spam address.  Everybody who has a Microsoft account has a Hotmail account.  I wanted to get my name at Outlook.com, so I immediately signed up.  But I'm not going to use it for anything substantial.  But you've got to have it.  Well, not only that.  There are some side benefits.  You get a free Office 365 account and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I thought I saw it.  I mean, one of the ways I think they got to this, maybe not.  I mean, I could be wrong.  But I think that everybody that had a Microsoft Live account or an existing Hotmail account  automatically was in the system.  So I mean, that's one way to get a lot of users is you just take all your existing users  and say, boom, now you got an Outlook.  You mean like Google Plus?  Something like that?  Well, OK, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why these numbers are meaningless at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think that's the way they did it.  Now, one thing I will say that's good about this, I mean, as I looked at this, was I think  that it needed rebranding.  Everybody kind of used it.  Like I said, everybody kind of uses Hotmail as their spam email.  It's an embarrassing email address.  You don't want to be a Hotmail.  Right.  I'd never give that out to a potential employer or something.  So I mean, I think that they needed to rebrand, which is good.  And the tie in to Office 365 is also key for them.  So as far as business strategy, I think that this makes sense.  But yeah, we'll see.  It doesn't look very innovative to me yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fred Flintstone in our chat room says the top three email, webmail email clients are  Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo!  So Gmail has built up.  It is now number one.  What are you, Fred, if you can get me the numbers on those, that'd be great.  I don't think Fred Flintstone is his real name.  It could be Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo!  Mail.  But then another, as you said, Jeff, opportunity for Marissa Meyer at Yahoo!  Yahoo!  Mail's big player could easily impress everybody.  I thought Yahoo!  was number one.  I thought Yahoo!  I thought it still was big as well.  I thought they were at one point.  So maybe Fred.  Maybe it still has stuff.  Maybe Fred's living in the past.  It's bad.  Maybe.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fred's giving me a link to emailmarketingreports.com, often considered the definitive source for  email and web statistics.  Google has, according to a blog post in June 2012, 425 million active users.  Comscore says Hotmail is 350 million.  That was in October 2011.  Yahoo!  Mail, according to Comscore, 310 million.  So these are numbers not official.  Right.  But I guess it would make sense that by now Gmail would finally have surpassed Yahoo!  and Hotmail.  Thank you, Fred Flintstone.  Hey, we're going to take a break.  Come back with more.  Drew Allenoff is here from thenextweb.com.  Great to have you, Drew.  Thank you.  So nice to have you.  Your sound is excellent now, by the way.  Thank you for fixing that.  Oh, good, good, good.  Yep.  Also, Aaron Newcomb from...  The Source Show.org.  The Source Show.org.  And so many programs here on the Twitter network.  Yes.  We love having him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, for me, I'm carbohydrate.  I challenged a donut, bagel.  They look exactly the same.  I can't tell the difference.  They got a hole, they're round.  I don't know.  What's the difference?  Also, you're Jeff Jarvis from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm just teasing you.  Just teasing you.  Let's...  So, hey, that was a great Maker Faire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was.  It was a great...  And I got an interview with the Architect guys.  Kind of interesting.  Oh, that's cool.  How they do their shows.  See, there's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty cool.  Maybe we should help you with this.  Well, maybe you should.  Maybe we should.  Because we want to do more hacking, more making.  Yep.  Maybe this is the way to get that in there.  That's what I do.  You and me talk.  That's my thing.  I'll have my people call your people.  Sounds good.  And you can find out a little bit more.  T-I-N-G dot com slash T-W-I-G.  So, what is Ting?  It's an MVNO.  But don't let that confuse you.  It uses the Sprint network.  So, if Sprint works well for you, Ting will work well for you.  And what it is, is you get your phone, you look at...  You create a plan.  But the beauty of the Ting plans is you pay for exactly what you use.  You pay no extra if you go over.  And if you go under, they give you a refund.  So, when you look at these plans, these are just to give you an idea.  You start with the phone.  How many phones do you want?  It's great for a family or even a small business because you pay $6 for phones.  Let's get three phones.  Let's say among those phones, we've got 2,000 minutes.  We've got 4,000.  This is a month, text messages.  And let's get all the data we can afford.  Total cost of all of that is $124 a month for three people.  But, get this.  You don't use all that?  They give you the money back.  You use more?  No problem.  They just charge you at the same rate.  And, absolutely free voicemail, picture, video messaging, three-way calling, caller ID.  And I know you really want this.  Tethering and hotspot included free.  And great phones too.  Just go look at the devices and you'll see you're not making any compromise when you  get a Ting phone.  Ting's the thing.  I want you to try it.  T-I-N-G dot com slash twig.  You will get $50 off your device purchase when you use that website.  So, please do.  If you want to take a look at the savings calculator, this might bring it home.  You know, get your bill.  Go get your monthly bill.  And fill in all these forms and you will get a direct comparison of what your bill would  be versus what the Ting bill would be.  It really is kind of spectacular.  Ting dot com slash twig.  A great company trying to bring some clarity, some sense to mobile phone service.  And I know you're going to like them.  Ting dot com slash twig.  We continue on with this week in Google.  I think we're going to wrap things up.  There are so many.  There are always more stories on this show than we have time to talk about.  FCC has told Verizon you cannot block tethering apps and find them.  $1.25 million.  Yay.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because they bought Spectrum that had that condition on it.  However, it does not affect my AT&T unlimited account where I still can't tether or other  things.  Important clarification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of a bummer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Good reason to root your Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  Amazon has updated their cloud player to make it more like iTunes match.  Automatically when you have a matched file, get a 256 kilobit MP3 with no DRM.  They're going to be on Roku and Sonos soon too.  So another reason.  I use Amazon and Google and iTunes.  I don't care.  I'll use all three of them.  The new dig has launched.  Part of the news.me service.  Looks pretty.  It's nice.  Yeah.  I'm just kind of glad that that name is not just gone.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's very rare for something to hit, go away and then rise in front of our eyes.  It's going to be interesting to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They apparently, they say BetaWorks, they rebuilt it from scratch.  Yep.  Roundup.  Wow.  I'm not sure why they needed to do that.  It's hard to believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pardon me?  I was saying it's hard to believe that they would, I mean why, so they basically just  paid for the name and the developers?  Well, no.  They didn't get, that's the funny thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they didn't get the developers.  The developers went to the Washington Post.  Oh, that's right.  So new team, and I guess they didn't want to deal with the old code.  So they said, well, it's not that complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's funny because is this the right page?  Is this the old dig?  No, yeah, it should be.  Because it's got an interview I did with Matt Williams many moons ago.  Is that cached?  I don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it's, do you think it's cached?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, if you go to dig.com it should be okay.  It's totally new, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dig.com, maybe I have a cached version.  Let me press the shift key and then go there.  That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm the new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, yes.  I must have had a cached.  Oh, this is pretty.  Isn't it?  It's a little bit more Pinterest-y.  And it's kind of selected on top and then river below.  Say again, Drew, what did you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm bummed that commenting is out of it.  Oh, you can't comment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you dig?  You can dig.  I wonder if I have to create a new account.  Success, your digs will appear in your Facebook timeline.  Uh-oh.  I guess that's the only way I can do it, huh?  Oh, well.  NBC accidentally broadcasts a bare breast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I guess the dig is not so new after all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, moving along.  Okay, moving along here.  Let's see what else.  I just want to make sure we don't miss any monster stories  that are breaking in the world of the Google and the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or which goes even too far for me, Mr. Public,  is going to have a new structure to post what you've read publicly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why?  Again, with the dig like that.  It makes me, because I read a lot of guilty pleasure stuff  and I don't want it on my social timeline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And there's some exceptions, but the default is that.  I think the sharing should be an explicit action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you mean, because I have a Quora account,  if I go there now and start reading stuff  without my approval or knowledge, it will start to share that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sure of the exact structure.  If you come in from a link, it won't, but from within Quora,  yeah, it's going to appear next to stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's only going to appear on Quora, what I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I believe so.  I believe so, but I have not studied this in depth,  so I'm sure the chat room or someone or their PR company  who already emailed me will come forward and say something else.  Well, let me just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I'm wrong, please do.  Let me just read a Quora question.  OK, I've read this question.  And now is it showing up that I read this question  for people who are following me?  I don't even know.  It's some algorithmic thing, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This week in Quora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't really use Quora that much.  I don't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  O'Malek posted a way to get rid of views,  but I don't know if this is the way to get rid of the stuff you view.  But he says there is a way to go into your profile,  hit the settings, find views, and then choose no,  and views are turned off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This article does say,  thanks to Quora, you cannot read anonymously, which is...  I agree.  The lead on this is Quora,  which I believe is one of the most over-harps hyped startups.  I always thought that.  Initially, when people are excited and it's fresh  and they want to spend time and answer questions,  it's great, but how long before people go,  I'm not going to pour my heart and soul into this third party website?  Commodore 64, 30 years old.  Yay.  Did you start on a C64?  I did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I started on a Trash 80.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Trash 80, model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was the 2, I think.  The 1 or the 2.  Actually, it might have been the 1.  It might have been a modified 1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Drew's so young, I bet he started on an IBM PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I did have a Tandy machine earlier on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Jeff's so old, I bet he started with an Abacus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have my Osborne 1 in the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Osborne, I loved that.  That was an awesome computer.  Great machine.  I coveted an Osborne.  It is my pride and joy.  We have one here.  It's non-functioning, but we have one.  It's going to have a bit of history, isn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got a Commodore here too, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, we've got a Commodore.  We've got all sorts of stuff.  There's one back here.  I think there's a Commodore right behind us.  There's a pet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a great video.  I don't know if all of these links get put out on the show notes, but there's a great  video that the BBC did where this guy took a Commodore 64 and brought it into a classroom  or brought some kids in.  They go, what do you think about this?  What do you think this is?  He holds up the old Commodore joystick and the girl looks at it and she's like, is that  a remote control?  No one knows.  She's like, is that actually connected to the TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No one knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was great.  Some of their responses were just classic.  They didn't know what a tape was because he had a tape to load some programs.  They didn't know what the cassette tape was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People are very nostalgic about it.  I have in my office a joystick that Jerry Ellsworth designed for sale.  It was the idea was, and you've seen these since, a joystick you plug into your TV and  you can play Commodore 64 games.  She put a back door into it that if you do up, down, up, down, left, left, left, it unlocks  a full Commodore 64 with Commodore Basic.  The whole thing is in there.  Isn't that awesome?  I love it.  I love it.  She's so great.  That's sweet.  Isn't that sweet?  All right.  Let's get to, now this is something we normally do and I don't know if you were prepped for  this or not, but normally Gina does a tip of the week.  Now I know, Aram, you could probably do an Android tip or you could do a Google tip.  You want to do one?  I've got an Android tip actually.  All right.  Fire when ready, Gridley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  So the tip of the week is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How to get Google Wallet on your Samsung Galaxy.  Close.  Very close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How to get Wi-Fi tethering on your Android phone.  So if you have an Android phone and you want to, you're one of the people that has to,  there's a paywall usually like I have with Verizon, and you want to get Wi-Fi tethering  working.  Lifehacker has a pretty good article on this that they just put out and it turns out there's  a number of applications in the market.  Some of them require routing, some of them don't, but you can actually get Wi-Fi tethering  to work.  A lot of people don't know this.  You can get Wi-Fi tethering to work just simply by downloading an application.  I've got an application.  I probably don't have a camera behind me, do I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but I can, maybe can I show, Chad, can you get him a camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me check.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The magic Chad.  So this is the camera that I have.  Oh, there we go.  Look at that.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Great.  Sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me see if I move this over.  It's a little awkward.  It doesn't look bad, but it feels very awkward.  Okay, so here we go.  So here's Wi-Fi tethering.  This is actually one of the applications that does require routing your phone.  That's what it looks like.  And once you have it installed, you turn off Wi-Fi, the automatic Wi-Fi service is running.  You click.  It's actually sharing now.  You can probably get it from your laptop.  So it's actually sharing a Wi-Fi signal now.  And when someone connects, it gives you a little warning that says, hey, this person  connected to your Wi-Fi.  And then you can click the button to authorize or don't click it and they won't be able to  get any internet access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me just see if I can get on your Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See if you can find it.  It's called Android tether, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, here we go.  Tap the Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a little ping here.  Somebody else is trying to get on you.  That's not me.  Oh, Colin's phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oil stop, free Wi-Fi, Android tether.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll give everybody access.  There I'm connecting.  Because I'm a nice guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at that.  We're all getting on his Android tether.  Because you, wasn't it?  Here comes some more.  Everybody has access.  Here comes some more people.  We're all connecting to his phone.  No one's going to get any bandwidth now.  Let's bring it right to its knees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are all people internally and I trust you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now some Android phones have tethering just in there.  Some of them do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course you can buy it.  You can pay for the service from Verizon or from AT&T.  So you can do that.  But actually there are other applications out on the marketplace where you can get, which  basically this one completely rewrites the functionality inside the phone.  Like I said, you have to be root.  There's another service on the marketplace.  I think it's called Elixir.  Or Elixir 2.  Yeah, here it is.  Elixir 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is an app.  Sorry, I misspoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is an app you can buy.  And this one actually does a lot of things.  Elixir basically monitors all the sensors and everything on your phone, giving you all  kinds of stuff.  But one of the other things they do is they have a Wi-Fi hotspot, which allows you to  basically get around that message that pops up from Verizon that says you must pay for  Wi-Fi tethering if you want to use this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is it illegal to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess not after the FCC ruling.  Not after the FCC ruling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I don't know.  They can't stop it.  I'll just say use it at your own risk.  I don't think there's really a whole lot they can do to stop you from doing that.  But anyway, so if you are kind of in that group of people that want Wi-Fi tethering  and you keep getting blocked, there are a couple apps out there and you ought to take  a look at them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jonathan says that there's one called FoxFi that does not require rooting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, FoxFi does not.  And I believe that this Elixir 2 does not require rooting.  But I like the one that actually uses the root system.  I trust it a little bit more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now we know that Verizon is no longer allowed to block these.  That's right.  Well, can they charge you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can still do it, I think.  Actually, I think they can still block on some of their plans.  I think the unlimited plan, I believe they said they were still going to block the unlimited  plan, but some of their tiers they're not allowed to because of this acquisition they  had.  So that's my tip.

Transcript:  Jeff Chavis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I want to do two quicks.  First is a plug.  The number is 7,000.  That's how many people are going to campus party in Berlin.  7,000 people.  What is it?  It's incredible.  They hold it normally down in South America and they're going to have one in Berlin.  Next year they're going to have one in San Francisco down at, I think at NASA.  They're going to do it at the Tempelhof Airport, which is a closed gigantic airport from the  And 500 hours of programming, just really unbelievable.  They've asked me to come over and keynote on the last day about freedom of the internet.  And so I wanted to give them a great plug.  It's really an amazing program.  There's a slight chance that the transportation may not work out, but my hope is that it will.  And I really recommend looking up campus party for Berlin.  And if you're in Europe, it just looks amazing.  One thing they're doing is they have-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You seem to go like for the weekend all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just going to say egotistical, but I have more of a brand in Germany than I have here.  What? Really?  Yeah.  I know.  It's really weird.  I'm people's-  Oh, you are.  It's Jeff Jarvis.  We love you.  That Bozo American who talks about us being naked.  He's a David Hasselhoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is it that your brand is in Germany?  What are you known as?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I complain about their privacy in government and that kind of stuff.  So I'm crazy American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so crazy American.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So anyway, I just wanted to give them a plug.  So campus party in Berlin and then next year when it hits America, I think it's really-  I love the name.  I got this rundown from Lisa Lange and it's incredible that they gave 3,000 scholarships  and they're picking buses to campuses around Europe and then bringing in 3,000 people and  they sleep in tents at Temple House.  It's like the world's biggest food camp.  Oh, that sounds wonderful.  It'll be quite amazing.  So for a number, let's see here.  97% of the conversations that occurred about the opening ceremonies, according to The Telegraph  in London, occurred on Twitter, which goes back to our earlier conversation where I think  that that's an important thing in terms of its power in there.  That's where our conversations are and that's pretty amazing.  So that's me.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wish we could do something about that.  My tool of the week is just a note that if you have not tried Spotify and you use Android,  this would be a very good time to try it.  We've made it free for all Android users.  That means you get all the Spotify premium features without paying a monthly fee.  Spotify is worth the 10 bucks a month.  I use it on every device.  I think it's my favorite music platform, but maybe you want to try it and see whether you  like it.  This is Spotify running on the Nexus 7.  They have a very nice tablet interface and one of the things you can use now that the  full version is free is their radio, which is really cool.  You know, it's kind of Pandora style radio.  Let's listen to some black metal.  And unlike Pandora, if you like the song that you're listening to, you can actually save  it and put it on your device and have it there even offline.  So Spotify is really cool.  So if you like a song, give it a thumbs up and then it's saved to a like from radio  playlist on your desktop so you can listen to it wherever you are.  I don't know how long Spotify is going to offer this for free, but it's really my favorite  music service.  There's a lot of playlists on there.  The ability to share and save playlists and share them.  If you go to Google+, you'll see a lot of Spotify playlists.  Andy Iannacco did a fun thing on Google+.  He said, if you could just pick one song, the song, what would it be?  And I subscribed to that playlist on Google+, because it's great.  It's called the Andy Iannacco's One Song Playlist.  Now it's 161 tracks of songs.  People say this is the song in my life.  And so that's fun, right?  I mean, what a neat idea.  And it's a social playlist.  So it could even grow some more if people find that posting and add some more stuff  to it.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Spotify is really neat if you've never played with it and you have an Android device or  phone, here's a chance to try it for free for however long they continue to offer that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who knew?  I think some of the fun went at it when I realized that once it was under 60 degrees  Fahrenheit, they could cover up the bikinis and the beach volleyball.  That's when I just lost interest.  No, I'm kidding.
