It's time for Twig this week in Google, the show we talk about the latest from the Google verse with Stacy Higginbotham from Stacy on IOT.  Hello. How are you?  We should mention if you're watching the video and it suddenly just looks so crisp and clear that we are moving away from Skype on this network and over to a WebRTC technology called OBS Ninja.  Your audio is now using the open source agvoribus codec, VP9 codec from Google.  And I think it looks really good.  It looks better than it's ever looked.  Thank you for putting up with that because it took us a little while to get it all going.  Now, on the other hand, Jeff Jarvis.  It still looks like crap.  At least your your color is better.  He's the Leonard Tao professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  And yes, he's still a little pink.  Buzz Machine dot com.  What's the matter, Jeff?  They look ridiculous.  I can't get it to focus.  Have you already forgotten that you were 10 out of 10 on Rate My Skype?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I live on my laurels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, the Rate My Skype room guy never saw Ant Pruitt or he would have suddenly had a new rating 11 out of 10.  Ant Pruitt from our Hands On Photography and Hands On Well- Well, Ant, there is some pressure on you because as the photographer, you got to look good, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Damn right.  Damn right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Damn right.  So we're going to try that.  We did it with Windows Weekly.  We've been slowly incorporating OBS Ninja.  Thank you to Steve Seguin, who is the author.  It's an open source project using open technologies.  And I think it's better than Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So and Mr. Jammer B working really hard on it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Jammer B's I charged him with figuring out how to make it all work.  And he's done a great job.  He's the wizard.  He's the wizard.  He is the wizard.  He says, pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.  We got to get you a curtain shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's actually- The real test will come when we do the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Will the changelog be unbroken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this be- can I hold on a second.  So I'll run this topic.  I can use the snap camera or the eyeglasses camera or anything I want.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can use any source of the camera that you would like.  I will switch it right now.  You want to give yourself reindeer horns in honor of the upcoming holiday.  Speaking of holidays- I love reindeer horns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like real ones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, they're stuffed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're adorable.  I'll wear them for the holiday episode.  They're not like a stuffed deer.  They're- never mind.  Poor reindeer.  Jesus.  They're plush reindeer horns, y'all.  So you really stuff the reindeer a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's plush.  Did you take them from Swamport Teddy Bear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of holidays-  Poor Rudolph.  Let Leo have a segue, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't care.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My segues is nothing.  My segues is nothing compared to your reindeer horn hat.  It's true.  How was Cyber Monday, by the way?  We talk about Black Friday.  Nine billion dollars online sales.  Weirdly, more than a third of that on smartphones.  So I mean, every year people spend more and more of their shopping time on a smartphone,  which kind of is wild as far as I'm concerned.  Smartphone sales-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would consider that wild if they're spending more time in general just holding the phone.  Sure.  It seems like that's the norm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of hard to shop on a smartphone.  Maybe that's just me.  No, it's just-  That's old folks.  I actually do most of my shopping now on a smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Because a lot of it's just like, oh, I see an email or I-  Yeah.  Oh, I need to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a click.  You know what has transformed it is the easy payment systems like Apple Pay or Google Pay.  Yes.  Or Amazon.  You know, the best one is Amazon Pay because they already know my address and everything.  And if I just push a button that says, okay, log in to Amazon and you're done, you're right.  It's the data entry on the phone that really is no fun.  But if you don't have to do that-  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So do you want to know how Cyber Monday went?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Do you have those numbers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which by the way, I'm taking issue with you calling it a holiday, but I will tell you  that Americans spent a record $10.8 billion on Cyber Monday.  Even more.  Even more.  And according to Adobe Analytics.  So I purchased one thing, but I actually did all of my Christmas shopping.  And ready, y'all?  Ready?  Yeah.  Let's see if I can show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go on.  Go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I've even brought most of the presents.  Oh my God.  I hate you.  I hate you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hate you.  Don't you hide them from the family?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My daughter's 14.  My husband has no interest.  I'm the only person who actually unwraps presents to see what people got me before I'm supposed  to.  But everyone else in my family is so boring and not of all this genius.  That's so funny.  I'm very disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's so funny.  Holiday shopping, independent sellers on Amazon.  Amazon says it was the biggest holiday season ever.  Traffic to traditional stores, according to Adobe, was down by 52%.  That's not a surprise.  That's COVID.  It'll come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's higher than I wish it were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Amazon said, well, is this a surprise?  Because Amazon has said in the past about half of its stuff on Amazon is sold by third  parties.  And so 42 cents of every dollar spent this holiday season, let's see.  On Amazon.  On Amazon.  And of that, about half of it went to independent shoppers.  So that's the third parties on Amazon.  But that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is a way to say too, don't accuse us of being a monopoly because we share all this  wealth and wonder where everybody else is.  See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See?  We power the nation's economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I have spent probably more than half of my stuff on Shopify.  And does Etsy use Shopify?  If Etsy uses Shopify.  I actually found a lot of presence on Etsy this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Etsy is a great place to shop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  My kids have been saying the same thing about Etsy is looking there versus Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't burst my bubble.  But is there any reason to think that Etsy has the veneer of earthy, crunchy buying from  people who are making real stuff, but it's actually Chinese sweatshop labor or something  like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So a lot of things on Etsy are resellers for the stuff you'd find on Wish or Alibaba.  Drop shipping.  There are, yeah.  And there's plenty of, I purchased a lot of unique t-shirts for people that fit their  personalities.  But those are basically, if not cafe press, but cafe press like retailers.  But they are like, one of them is, I purchased for my daughter a hockey, St. Louis Blues  shirt.  It is totally unlicensed.  But this person basically took a quote that she finds hilarious and stuck it on the shirt.  And she is going to love this thing like nobody's business.  Nice.  So I like Etsy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I just, I want it to be like what you get the impression of is just like grandma  selling stuff and then selling it online.  And look, grandma's found a whole new life making stuff.  There's some of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Etsy, the company is a mission oriented company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's, what do we call it?  So they're trying to do that.  Oh, what are those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A B corporation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a B Corp.  Oh, interesting.  Yeah.  So for public benefit.  I know the former attorney who did all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a public benefit corporation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know the founder and CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was one of the first exciting companies I covered way back before I even was at GIGO.  That's nice.  But super controversial, like in the very beginning days and still controversial now.  What was the controversy?  He was a character.  It was, yeah, there was a character.  They had to make money.  People hate when you try to like optimize for profits.  It kind of boiled down into that.  And it also, there was a lot of controversy as more people who weren't actively crafting  and making things coming on the platform and trying to game search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See that's so funny.  So what is Rob Kaelin up to now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's 40 years old now.  Isn't that amazing?  Oh, wow.  He was a kid starting this.  I don't know what he's up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He might not be up to anything.  He may not need to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  He doesn't need to be.  He's probably just counting the stacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually as we learn more details of Tony Hsieh's tragic death, we're learning that it  isn't good to be too rich too early, too young.  I don't know if you've seen the story that's come out.  No, I didn't see the follow up.  Is it what I think it is?  It's not good.  And I have to say, I'm just quoting a news source and it could be scurrilous, but it  doesn't sound like it is.  Remember, Tony Hsieh, who's the founder of Zappos, 46 years old, retired from Zappos  earlier this year in August.  And I just assumed everybody loves Tony and I just assumed, oh, you know, he made his  money.  He's retiring at the age of 46.  Now this is from the Daily Mail.  So consider the source, although, yeah, watch out because they're a rag.  They're quoting firefighters and people around him apparently had a drug and alcohol problem  and he had barricaded himself in a shed.  He had an affection for burning candles and nitrous oxide whippets.  And it was hard for the firefighters to get to him.  And so they broke down the walls to the shed.  He had suffered severe burns.  He lingered for, this we didn't know either, for nine days before he passed away.  So kind of a tragedy, really.  Oh, that is.  And of course, being on the burn unit means those nine days were extremely unpleasant  for him, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They usually put, I mean, if you were that badly burned, you might have been in a coma  because they're pretty good about that.  So isn't that sad?  Heartbreaking.  Yeah, it's really heartbreaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the gratitude to him for reinvigorating Las Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was a beloved figure.  Everybody, you read O'Malec's beautiful obituary for him.  Everybody thought very highly of him.  And so that's double, it's a double tragedy because I think that's what maybe happened  is he made a lot of money.  young and, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't sound good.  So nobody buys your company, Leo.  Yeah, I'll never have that problem.  I'll be working on, however, 900.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, no, I didn't.  You didn't?  Oh, I put it in there just to depress you.  Amazon is looking to buy a, where'd it go?  I put it in there.  I swear I put it in there.  Yeah, there is under podcasting.  Oh, Jason's being organized.  Amazon's talked to by Wondery for 300 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I've seen this.  Spotify was apparently in talks.  Apple was apparently in talks.  300 million dollars.  Wondery was started.  40 million in revenue.  40 million in revenue?  Yeah, that's not bad.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By which calculation?  Yeah.  And they said it was the, the, the, the Wall Street Journal said it was the last large  independent podcast on the market.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, not that large.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're larger than most.  Wow, 300 million.  So Wondery was, it's interesting because it was started kind of started by Hollywood.  And one of the things that made Wondery unique for a podcast network is they had a lot of  deals to license their shows to TV.  And I think that's probably where some of the revenue projections come from.  Seventy five percent of their 40 million came from advertising.  The rest from licensing to TV subscription services like Audible and Stitcher Premium  enter their own subscription premium subscription service.  So that'd be interesting.  In talks though doesn't mean it's happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, it is the last.  Is it the last?  I think even if you please exclude us.  We're not anywhere near that size.  But there are other big independent podcast companies out there still that haven't been  acquired.  I'm sure Spotify is is probably looking down there next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody has them up on their little dart board right now.  Yeah, yeah.  We take out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Speaking of acquisitions, Slack, Salesforce, big deal.  Twenty seven and a half billion dollars Salesforce is going to pay.  I think it's a half stock, half cash deal.  Stuart Butterfield, another big payday.  He sold Flickr to Yahoo.  I guess it was Yahoo.  He sold Flickr to Yahoo for 40 mil for 40 mil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And some of the investors were unhappy with him that that was too that he sold too soon.  Yeah.  But he said he and Cotterina Fake when they were married said it was a life changing amount  of money.  It was.  You're only going to have one chance in life to get that much money.  Well, he got a second chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you know, it's you know, it's right.  You know, it's a life changing amount of money.  Twenty seven and a half billion dollars.  That's a life changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish they put out the cap tables on these stories.  You have some idea of who's making one out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, yeah, they don't want to tell people that nobody wants a public company.  Oh, Slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If Slack's public, they've got a cap table that'll be in their proxy statement in their  What is it?  What is that SEC filing?  Every year you do one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The 10 Q or 10 K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the proxy.  It's the proxy.  It's a.  That's all right.  I know what you mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I guess.  Twenty seven.  It actually is twenty seven point seven billion, according to the Associated Post.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's a couple hundred million between friends?  Really?  I honestly think that feels like too much.  But you know, obviously, Salesforce, you know, Mark Benioff's no fool if he's if he's willing  to pay that much.  Well, it is more than it was its current stock price.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Much more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the argument is they went down.  There was Microsoft was seen as a huge competitor.  And and they were the ones that didn't really advance in covid, though I think they should  have but for various reasons.  So you can argue that they were underpriced in the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or I would argue that while Zoom and teams capitalized on the work from home trend over  the last nine months, Slack seems to have done the opposite.  There's some evidence that their monthly active users went down and I think it would have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  been just plateaued because it seems like the whole Slack platform is is a little niche.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's still an opportunity.  Mitch missed when Zoom is through the roof and teams is through the roof.  And and the reason I think Slack might have gone down is because they did not would not  reveal their numbers in the face of Microsoft's every month saying and now another 40 million,  another 40 million.  So I'm I'm wondering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Slack didn't have video either.  Oh, I guess I'm frozen for a while.  So without video, I think everybody who came into the pandemic wanting to like see people  face to face, they chose these other platforms and people might actually use Teams and Zoom  and Slack.  That's not crazy because they in many people's minds, they serve different purposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Salesforce cites the success of past acquisitions as key decision to buy Slack.  This is from CBS Market Watch.  They say that we did so well.  What did they buy?  What did they buy before?  Tableau was Salesforce's largest acquisition at fifteen point seven billion.  That was in twenty nineteen.  From Youlsoft six point five billion in twenty eighteen.  Mark Benioff said when you look at what we've learned, our ability to integrate companies,  that's a big deal, by the way.  Apple has said we don't acquire big companies because we feel like it's too hard to integrate  two big teams and we don't want to change our company culture.  So maybe Salesforce has figured this out.  Our ability to integrate companies to make one plus one equal three.  We look at this and we say, wow, this is a game changer and we know how to pull it off  and we have a lot of our former executives, for example, at Slack already.  So we know a lot of those players.  So maybe they do have a better idea as what's going on inside of Slack than obviously than  we do.  And they're not telling people what's happening to their user base.  One thing I've noticed, we use Slack, we're a Slack company, is it's very hard to change.  Once you use something, it's it's not a thing that companies regularly say, oh, there's  something better, let's try that.  So if you already are decided on Slack, it's unlikely that you would just say, we should  just try Teams unless, I don't know, maybe the CFO is going to say to you, hey, you know,  we're paying for Microsoft 365, Teams is included in that.  Why are we paying extra for Slack?  We should just be using Teams.  Teams is also, we looked at Teams when we left HipChat, HipChat got sold when we looked  at leaving HipChat.  We looked at Teams and Slack and we chose Slack because it had the integrations we needed  with things like Panopta, our server monitoring software and stuff like that.  And at the time, Teams didn't.  But over the couple of years since then, Teams has come on strong with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But wouldn't Active Directory play a big part in that as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  If you're a Microsoft house, but see, we're not.  So you're right.  That's who's going to use Teams.  The other thing that Salesforce gets, remember Salesforce wanted to buy LinkedIn and was  really upset when Microsoft bought LinkedIn.  They said, Microsoft's going to use all that information they get from LinkedIn and anti-competitively.  And that's one of the reasons a company like Salesforce buys Slack is now they've got a  foot in the door from a lot of new companies, perhaps they didn't before, plus data that  they didn't have before.  So I'm sure Mark Benioff knows it's worth that much, but boy, that's an awful lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was funny.  I got the daily as Tritertiary and Ben Warren at the top.  This is a long one.  When he warns it's long.  Yeah, it's long.  It's going to be epic.  It's going to be good.  But he said, you know, Brett Taylor, who's the COO, who's really smart, really good.  This is this is kind of can't be talked about how it's the operating system for the new  way to work.  There's some truth to that.  How people collaborate.  Slack did did pioneer that and Salesforce's resources.  Now what Ben proposes is that Slack is that like a company like YouTube was trying to  charge before Google bought it, Slack's been trying to charge.  He says that Salesforce should make it free and addict everybody to it.  And then it's the it's the glide path into Salesforce.  That certainly it doesn't make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean.  People who had no business or need using sale to use Salesforce use Slack.  So and I think there is still demand for it.  I mean, we we went from social cast.  So you all were on hip chat.  We were on social cast and then that got bought and killed.  So then we switched to Slack and it became our like communication platform.  But I don't see it being an entry way to Salesforce for a lot of organizations, because  you're already on Salesforce if that's something that's appealing to you.  And if it's if you're not on Salesforce, you probably don't need to be on Salesforce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, though, Stacey, the thing is, I find there's funny uses of Salesforce these days is  that newspapers are using it as a CRM for not just their ad customers, but their readers.  Yeah, no, I mean, everybody's tended to be used at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, I've got so many CRM companies pitching me right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, it's a hot category, isn't it?  Yeah, we actually we use Salesforce.  Ironically, we use Salesforce and Slack.  So maybe this will be good for us.  Maybe maybe something something like so.  It's funny that Ben should say that, because I think that that's what Microsoft is doing  with teams as well, turning it into in effect, a business operating system.  Slack is exactly what he says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounded familiar.  Yeah. Oh, we're going to get to that.  Yeah. OK.  One more point on this is that is the Ben points out that many off has said  that he would love to buy Zoom at one hundred fifteen billion right now.  It's a little too much.  I find Zoom.  But the question is, does a vaccine what does a vaccine do to Zoom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good question.  Zoom is zooming, by the way, its stock price has gone through the roof.  I wonder, let me look at this P2E.  It's P2E is 287 bucks.  Actually, Zoom just took a little a little nosedive  last couple of days, but it was maybe it may be vaccines.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Maybe that maybe you're right.  But I think that's just the stock.  That's very typical of the stock market.  I don't think vaccines are going to change how  Zoom's fortunes because people are now using Zoom.  You watch you watch TV now.  Everybody's on Zoom or some Zoom clone.  And but but the term is they're on Zoom.  Right. And I feel like that and I hate it.  You hate it because I don't think it's going away.  I think we're used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have turned into the the Xerox of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the fact that the yeah, the fact that the word is.  Oh, I see. I'm sure they hate it, too.  Nevertheless, they're still getting the lion's share of business.  You know, CNN has to deal with what Cisco WebEx and things like that.  But honestly, when you see those those windows, you think Zoom.  We're going to do a Zoom Christmas card this year for Twitter.  But you know what? It won't be in Zoom.  It'll it'll probably be in Google Meet.  But but nobody's going to say you're doing a meet Christmas card,  because that sounds disgusting.  You're we're going to say it's a Zoom Christmas card.  Right. And that's what everyone's going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meanwhile, speaking of that, who's left out to say virtual?  We mentioned this discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's that Google?  That's right. That's what we're not.  We're use Google Google workspace.  Nobody talks about. Yeah, we use meet, but Google Meet.  But we're and that's what we're going to use for the Christmas card, I'm sure.  But it's not going to nobody's going to think meet.  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I was going to say maybe Google will buy Zoom.  And I mean, the the problem, I mean, the technology there isn't.  Isn't crazy.  It's not difficult.  In a hundred and what would you say they're trading at one hundred and fifty  billion, one hundred and five million.  Million. No.  It's billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got a million. I'll tell you that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's too much for a brand, I think.  But maybe I'm wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are current their market cap is one hundred seventeen billion right now.  Yeah.  So and this, if you look at their year to date,  it just took off and that's all because of pandemic.  But I don't think my point is, I don't think it goes away  after the pandemic goes away.  I think companies will be using it more than ever before.  It's really been a boon for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and also you pay for like I pay for my Zoom subscription.  I pay it. I re up it every year.  So I just paid for the next year.  Right. I like two days ago.  And so you love these people.  Not everybody's on an annual plan, but it's also not the sort of thing  you change very often unless you're, you know, how often the companies  audit their subscriptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  Well, that was my point with Slack.  There is a real barrier to changing.  It's like too much trouble.  You were all in it. What are you going to I got to now call  everybody in the company, say, OK, stop using Slack.  We're going to we're all switch shifting to this.  Everybody has to figure it out.  You have to recreate all the things you're doing.  It's just that nobody's going to do that.  It's too much trouble. There has to be a strong incentive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, the folks out there listening used to be that we if we can now talk over  each other, which we really could just awesome, so which is awesome.  And the one way we're talking, I can talk and if you don't like what I'm saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't care because I just keep talking.  Oh, see, he stops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Before wouldn't let you in, which was kind of better.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google engineers anyway, toyed with the idea of acquiring  two years ago.  Oh, what was it then?  I don't know. They should.  That was the one that got away.  You bought Zoom to win 2018.  That would have been a good deal.  Now, I think it's too expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when the pandemic hit at school, they tried to get us all on Google  chat and nobody used it.  And we said, well, we just use Slack.  We use Slack. We use Slack.  No, no, no, no, no. Nobody used it.  So now it's Slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, I was on Windows Weekly.  We were talking about what's the Google alternative to Slack?  Is it meet? Is it chat?  Is it Slack? Is it hangouts?  Is it what is it?  And that's the man.  This is Google's problem in a nutshell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's anything from a messaging standpoint is a is a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's completely unclear what they're up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's like isn't messaging.  Slack is a virtual.  I mean, it's like it's IRC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But now Slack is everything.  We use Slack for phone calls, for video calls, for messaging primarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We yeah, we used it as a I mean, we used it more like IRC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. But it's changed to over time.  It's it's yeah, it has now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We still have we still have our old giga ohms Slack and every like  now it's down to like once a month, you'll pop in.  Someone left a message for the year afterwards.  We actually paid for it.  Because we were like, we want to hang out so much with each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is Ohm on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, he's way too busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When Ohm was in our Slack chats, he would just come down  like this cranky man and just crush the conversation.  Just be like, this is dumb.  And we'd be like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the thing is, he has such he has such weight, carries such weight.  Everybody goes, OK, yeah, you're right.  OK, sorry. Never mind.  We sorry we were talking about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, sir. We mostly rolled our eyes, but it was that that was his.  He thought, you know, we were wasting too much time to work, you know,  bonding his culture, team culture remotely and he just be like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  honestly, that's what's wrong with Slack.  If you ask me is it's it's really too much fun.  And it really isn't about getting work done.  It's more about socializing and hanging out.  And and I'm the cranky I'm the ohm guy, right?  And I go into our Slack and say,  we have a general channel or I think it was general.  I said, no more animated GIFs in the general channel.  I can't figure out what the hell's going on here.  Facts. Yeah.  So we created a random channel that's full of nothing but animated GIFs.  Slack lends itself to kind of to keep screwing around and screwing off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because that fortune we had Slack and then we had Trello  for like tracking stories. Right.  And that was useful.  But I will say, as someone who has been virtual since  2005, Slack is a godsend for someone who.  Yes. Like I would never meet my coworkers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's great for work at home.  Absolutely. I agree with you.  Or for somebody like you, a distance worker,  you know, from the old days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's fantastic.  Leo, would you downsize your offices?  We can't. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I didn't have the lease, are you kidding?  That's what we said, lease aside.  We're stuck here for five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet you were asking him to do Lisa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. That's what I thought, too.  When you meant you didn't mean my wife, you meant our lease.  Leases aside. Oh, yeah.  No, we don't need this.  There's two people in the office.  And most of the time,  it's there's really no reason for all this acreage.  And this is this is my point, is that you say all the vaccine  and everything is going to go back to the way it was.  I don't think so.  I think companies have learned we don't need to do this.  This is working perfectly fine.  We were crazy to rent a studio.  I could do this out of the house.  I don't need I don't need all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that I think that's true for some things.  You know, there are a lot of meetings,  pitch meetings and things like that  that won't have to take place anymore over lunch  or anything like that, because you can all do it virtually.  But and yes, I'm an employee,  but I still think there is a place for the studio,  you know, or any studio, because, well, it's the energy  and the actual final output of the product.  And let's not forget birthday cakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's the difference between you and me.  You like people.  And so I didn't say that.  No, no, no, no, no.  I honestly I'm happy at home.  I don't need to come in.  Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is my this is my happy place, my domain.  Yes, I love coming into the studio and notice like Miss Stacey.  I've worked from home for many years.  And I know it's comforting and I'm productive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, that's why we have a studio,  because when I first started doing the radio show remotely,  I tried it at the house and my energy level was terrible  because I would slob out of bed and slip slide in this.  My slippers into into the studio.  And it's time for the tech guy show.  And I realized I need a place to go to work to get up for the show  to kind of like make this distinction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some people are like that.  Yeah, totally get that.  And notice some people are like that.  I'm not I'm not like that way.  You know, fortunately, I've had the the ability to have a room  or a corner that's dedicated to work and getting things done.  And, you know, and I also practice actually getting up,  getting dressed and going to said corner of the house  or whatever to do what I needed to do.  But I know there's a lot of people that just can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I honestly think that there's two different kind of go to the corner.  Yeah, I do think that there are some people who,  as soon as we open the offices, will go, yeah, and come running in.  And and there's some people who won't notice, though, and I am still  coming into the office to do the shows I do.  So I actually maybe I'm misunderstanding my own feelings about this,  because I do this. I do come to the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You come in because you feel you feel that's where you need to be.  I think the shows are better.  You care about the product that you put out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I think the shows are better if I'm and it's not merely  the wearing your slippers to work thing.  It's I just think it's better if we at least do some of this stuff  out of the studio as much as we can out of the studio.  And I don't like it when I see as you're paying for the damn thing.  Well, that's the other problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. Yeah, there's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't like it when I see  all all Skype shows.  I feel like it's better if it's anchored by somebody in the studio somehow.  It's in my mind. It just seems like that.  And the same thing even on watching the news channels.  When Anderson Cooper was coming out of his house, interviewing people over  Skype, I just it felt a little amateurish.  And yet when he was in a studio and everybody else is on Skype, it's fine.  Or Zoom or whatever is fine. Yeah.  Actually, that's what I think that's what they're doing.  So remember on MSNBC, Rachel Maddow was quarantining  and she was doing it from her barn.  It looked like it was very weird.  I did. It wasn't great.  And I think what they do, honestly, is a lot of these people are in their house,  but they just put a green screen up in a background to make it look like they're  on set and that's all it needs.  But there is some psychological thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has been. Yeah, I think Nicole Wallace is still at home. Yeah.  And but they make it look like it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you have a good camera, good lighting and a good microphone,  it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see, I kind of liked it when you when you could see this is room  raider, right? I love seeing people.  I like seeing the stars that way. Yeah, yeah, I do, too.  And it was Ben Rhodes today.  Major points.  He had Christmas decorations on the bookshelf behind.  Oh, boy. New competition.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should I decorate for Christmas behind me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yes, Stacey. Yes. Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have we talked about Google yet?  I feel like we should have some Google stories.  Look at this. Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  Happy decorations.  Now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that is the it's just about those of you listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ever see Rhodes Schmoe just decked the halls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What did that take? Three seconds.  He shoved up a Noel sign and a garland, but he didn't unfurl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got more. I got more over here.  No, actually.  So I don't let anybody come over on this side of the studio.  This is like a cordon sanitaire.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a force field there.  When you walk in, you literally bump into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I said, get the decorations out and I will I will decorate.  So it's on me.  And as you can see, I'm a real talent with the decoration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Let's take a little break.  We got Google. We got Microsoft.  We got commercials. We have lots to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We got stuff to do. And Stacey's got to eat.  And actually, I want to show you, I know you talked about your Remarkable,  which is this new E Ink notepad, the second generation of the Remarkable 2.  I just say I got mine yesterday and I'm kind of liking it.  So I want to kind of give the you're sending yours back.  But I'm kind of liking it.  But we'll talk about it.  Pros and cons. That's coming up to our show today brought to you by LastPass.  Boy, I don't know where we would be if it weren't for LastPass this year.  Thank you, LastPass.  And I mean that in a couple of ways.  First, of course, of course, they bought studio naming rights and advertising.  But also, maybe much more importantly, we've got all our employees working at home.  And I am I am feel so fortunate that we started using LastPass  Enterprise some years ago because when the employees started going home  and they have they have the logins to everything, our bank accounts,  our websites, our databases, everything, our QuickBooks.  When they were going home, I wasn't worried because I knew we had LastPass.  We'd already had it set up. They were used to it.  They love it. And it really has protected us in this work from home environment.  Thank you, LastPass.  No matter where employees are working, I mean, companies are facing those  cybersecurity threats.  But it seems like I know maybe psychological when they're working from home,  it's just that much more risky.  And gosh, the last thing you want is a data loss or data breaches or ransomware.  You've got to have a solid cybersecurity strategy,  arguably even more so while employees are working from home.  LastPass, let's our IT team, our security team take back control of password security.  They can see what's going on from a central dashboard.  Businesses can customize admin privileges so that I love this feature.  You know, the people who run the business office, we have an admin.  They should be able to control that.  But that doesn't mean they should have administrative rights anywhere else.  The bit, you know, the ops, the engineering, the studio, the producers,  all of them have exactly the right level of access to do their job.  No more, no less.  And one of the things LastPass makes it really easy to do is to onboard new users,  to sync groups, to revoke access when that's needed.  You'll also get in your dashboard security scores.  So you know how your team is doing with their password hygiene,  with shared accounts, you can monitor group memberships.  You even get dark web monitoring so you can see if your passwords are leaking out  and you can let employees know when their credentials are at risk.  LastPass uses the state of the art zero knowledge security model.  That essentially means assume everybody is a threat,  make sure authentication is in play everywhere.  And because they support multifactor authentication, geolocation,  an IP address, in addition to fingerprint and face recognition,  it's the best authentication standard out there.  Strong encryption algorithms.  All the data is only decrypted on device.  And by the way, every device you use supports LastPass.  There's even 1200 single sign on apps and integrations.  And employees love that because they don't even have to enter a password.  They just click yes on their phone and they're in.  Don't wait till the year is up to get strong security.  Now's the time to invest in upgrading or adding security technologies  to make remote work safer and more productive.  LastPass is the place to start.  Go to lastpass.com slash twit, lastpass.com slash twit.  And thank you, LastPass, so much for your support all year long.  It's been a great 2020, at least when it comes to LastPass.  LastPass.com slash twit.  OK, boy, yeah, there are a lot of stories.  Amazon, we mentioned Amazon.  Wow, have they been hiring?  We talked about this on Sunday and this week in tech.  Amazon has gone on a massive hiring spree this year.  And I guess on the one hand, great, right?  They're there.  They're people are getting jobs.  But on the other hand, Amazon workers sponsored a Black Friday walkout.  There's a lot of, you know, people who feel like these aren't the best jobs.  But four hundred twenty seven thousand employees in the last 10 months.  Massive growth.  I mean, they have one point two million employees compare that  to something like a Walmart, which is, you know,  significantly smaller.  Last Walmart, which is the largest private employer in the United States,  has two hundred thirty thousand employees.  Amazon is two point two million.  OK, OK.  And most of those were added  in the last couple of years.  It's this big New York Times.  You know what this says to me? What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that as much as we want to like emphasize  how digital has changed everything and bits are, you know,  bits are easier to move than atoms when you have when you have the atoms,  we still need people.  And, you know, as we talk about automation, as we talk about all of these other things,  we really need to think about  functionally, how much can we offload to tech and boost our productivity?  Because right now we're boosting productivity by  running people into the ground.  And I I'm not going to call it wage theft, but you're not paying them.  You know, Bezos, he traded the $15 minimum wage for,  you know, benefits for a $15 minimum wage.  So we have to kind of think about that, because a lot of times in tech world,  we just we don't we don't think about the humans behind  what we think of as digital, but they're still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me by the way, I got the numbers all screwed up.  So let me fix this.  Walmart, Walmart has two point two million.  They are bigger than Amazon with one point two million.  But the growth that Amazon has had this year  is more than double the biggest year Walmart ever had.  And that was decades ago.  So this growth at this rate, Amazon is is pretty much eating the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Amazon doesn't.  I'm old enough to remember  when Amazon was going to have like two warehouses and that was it  because it could avoid sales tax.  Yeah, that doesn't matter.  And now to Stacey's point, not only do you need the people, Stacey,  but you need the real estate near people so you can deliver it promptly. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Karen Wise, who's writing this article for The New York Times,  also points out it gives Amazon because they are in every state,  suddenly gives them some political clout as well.  They they employ a lot of people in every state.  What are these jobs, though? Are they good jobs?  You know, this is a debate we have all the time.  Some people say it's the best job these people can get,  but it's not a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we have to define and we have to think about what a good job is, right?  Is a good job like we have good jobs, right?  We got great jobs. Yeah.  A good job used to be like in manufacturing,  which is the holy grail of good jobs used to be great  because you could train someone on the job.  So you didn't have to come with like a college education.  So that's good. More people can do it.  And then it was also a good job because you had employment for life  and you had a pension or something associated with it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it used to be a Ford worker had a great job.  And let's not forget, a lot of that was not because of Ford,  but because of unions, the United Auto Works. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So a good job pays well,  has job security and also is something that a wide variety.  You don't need a special skill set.  I think good jobs like Amazon's jobs, a lot of them,  you don't need the special skill set. Right.  But the job security and the way they treat you is terrible.  And we can get into the how's and why's of how we got there on that.  But I wouldn't say it's because it's half a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, the number of employees, one point two million,  does not include the nearly half a million delivery drivers  who are contractors, not Amazon employees, half a million.  Nor they include the Amazon's going to get unionized.  Well, that's the question.  I mean, the thing that made remember Ford busted unions,  hired Pinkerton's to, you know, for the longest time,  hired Pinkerton's. I know. Isn't that ironic? Yeah.  That I think Pinkerton's was still around.  When I saw that, I thought, wow, that's interesting.  But that's a different story.  They hired Pinkerton's for a different reason. Yes.  We'll get to that, actually. It's a really interesting story.  But Ford was, you know, went kicking and screaming into a union.  But I think you can argue that the UAW  made a big difference for for Ford workers on the on the lines.  And I don't think that the Amazon workers are getting those same kinds of protections.  I don't know.  You know, Bezos is going to hire whoever he needs to hire to keep the union out.  Remember, they were doing they were using technologies to to kind of  monitor for union organizing activity and all sorts of weird things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're hiring analysts to track union activity. Yeah.  I mean, it's I don't blame them.  And if you ever decided to unionize, unionize, you'd be out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just don't get any ideas.  I think that's like I know I didn't say that.  I didn't say that.  And I'm sorry, I was joking.  You knew that, right? It is illegal, isn't it?  You can't then that's the funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it had gone up right now and left to go on strike, that'd be funny.  That's it. I'm out. We're gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Amazon has managed this is an article from October CNBC.  Amazon has managed to keep unions out of its ranks since the company's founding.  A recent string of events appear to show the extent of Amazon's efforts  to avoid unions and track workplace unrest.  And of course, remember, they famously hired  a guy for organizing and then attempted to smear his intelligence.  You know, so, yeah, they and it's not just Amazon, it's Whole Foods, too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's that conscious capitalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You nailed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon posted a job listing, according to CNBC,  for two intelligence analysts who could monitor labor organizing threats  and report their findings to internal stakeholders up to and including  executive leadership.  They later deleted that listing and said, no, no, no, that's that was inaccurate.  That was inaccurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Recouped. Meanwhile, they're giving three thousand dollar sign on bozos  and three hundred dollar holiday bonuses and turkey cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm always I, you know, I'm always I've mixed feelings about this,  because if you're unemployed or underemployed, having a job is a blessing,  especially right now.  It's tough. And maybe a bad job is better than no job.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's that it's that  thinking that keeps people in kind of this  right, dead end indentured state, because, I mean, yes,  even a bad job is better than no job, especially because you don't have any  access to social services.  But we should be thinking, what are the types of jobs we want people to have?  And even for Amazon, for people to be able to buy our products and use them,  you know, we should be.  I think you're building a market.  Anyway, I I am like basically a socialist union driving person here.  So my are you in a union? Are you?  I have my own company.  So I guess I could be in the union.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's a union of one.  I'm in the union. I own this company.  So I'm obviously not.  I'm a capitalist here.  But in the radio show, I'm a sag after and pay union dues and all of that.  I I like the union.  I like the unions. Are you a union guy from an hour ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that says that Amazon's effort to thwart an Alabama union  suffered early defeat at the NLRB.  Uh huh. Amazon was trying to delay hearing on unionization votes,  but they failed with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So and apparently they're according to NPR, they're using Pinkerton  to surveil workers who try to form unions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Pinkerton, that's what they do.  We bust your unions.  You got strikes.  We come in and beat the heck out of those people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what happened in 1941.  400000 I'm sorry, 40,000 Ford workers  conducted a 10 day sit down strike.  And Henry Ford brought in the Pinkertons  and quelled the unrest  in what they sometimes call the Ford Massacre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I look at this stuff and maybe I think about it all wrong,  but it makes me think back to one of the first corporate companies  that I worked for and a conversation I had with a CEO.  And he says, and the department you work in, you all work very hard.  And we're trying to put some things in place that's going to require you  to do a little bit more brainpower on your day to day task  instead of being more like a machine and just hitting a button  and watching the widgets go where it needs to go.  And some people took offense to that, and some people was encouraged by that  because they felt like, OK, well, maybe this is going to be  a better opportunity to push me up in the country.  I'm in a company.  But then also, there were the people that took offense to it.  They realized, you know what?  I can't do those higher, more brainpower ish jobs and things like that.  For example, I will never ever be an application developer.  I just can't. That's not in me.  I could probably do some other things.  I could probably do the QA stuff, which is what I used to do.  But I'll never be a developer.  And I think these companies like Amazon, Google or whomever,  as long as they're giving people opportunities to try to do better  and get more and earn more, I think that's fine.  I just feel for the people that are struggling and feel like that,  you know what, we're being screwed over by this company  that's making a gazillion dollars off of our efforts.  But at the same time, I'm like, you know what?  You can sit down and try to learn a new skill.  You can sit down and try to make yourself  more of a important piece in the company and give yourself  a little bit more value. But that's just how I think.  Some people think that's a bit of a jerk on my part, but that's just how I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There will be one of the biggest issues like, you know, climate change.  Huge issue. Breaking up tech, less of a huge issue.  But one of the biggest economic and people challenges  ahead of us as a country is figuring out how to train and upscale workers  because jobs change so quickly.  And like you said, and someone can learn a new skill.  But I would I would argue some people can.  Some people don't have the time outside of work.  They don't have not the interest.  They just don't have the mental bandwidth or maybe even the ability  to learn a certain way.  So I think that's why I said I would never be an application developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not a I don't think I'm a dumb dude or anything like that.  But I know my limitations and telling me to sit down in front of an ID to figure  out how to build some type of app for iOS or whatever.  It's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's an ID? See, I'm worse than you.  An integrated development and development.  You see, you're ahead of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At least he knows what an ID is.  Yeah, I think, you know, you hear for a while.  I don't hear this anymore.  There was this movement to get everybody coding.  Remember, Obama said everybody should learn to code.  And not everybody should learn to code any more than I should learn to do woodwork.  It's just there's just things that we there's I don't know.  But the modern world is gig focused, isn't it?  It's not you don't get a job in a gold watch after 50 years and retire anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't have to be gig focused, but you do have to provide  you can't just say like we are very in especially the tech world.  We're very focused on build your own job.  Right. Work to the job you want.  But a lot of people that that requires a lot of hustle and bandwidth.  And I don't think people who don't have that for various reasons,  maybe they're older, maybe they're tired, maybe they're caring  for their elderly parents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why are you why are you dissing me like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  But the point is  you have to both find a way to train people, incentivize them  to want to be trained and pay them.  Through that process, because what we have now is just like  you're just basically wagging your finger, go do this if you want to be successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And that's what do you tell your daughter?  I mean, your your goal, I'm sure, with your daughter is to encourage her  to find something that she loves, that she should that she could succeed  in and make a living at. No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My I want her to be happy and I want her to understand the tradeoffs  that come with being happy from like being fulfilled in your work  versus being, you know, wealthy or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm not saying wealthy, but we all need to make a living.  And ideally, you'd want to make a living doing something you enjoy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think like she wants to be her.  Her she wants to be a writer in her backup career right now as a poet.  So we have to do that, too.  We have to level set a little here.  Let me talk to her. Let me have a.  I'm like, I think, but I do think there are plenty of people  who actually like having a nine to five job that doesn't  doesn't fulfill them because they find other things fulfilling in our  our economy and the way we laud certain types of entrepreneurs  really doesn't value that. Right.  So it's it can be kind of hidden.  I. This is hard.  I think we should have  we should make the tools available to people we should have.  And we should we should start setting an expectation.  I do this with my daughter for continuous education in a way  that means she's probably not going to have the same job for her entire life.  And I think that's really important to do.  I don't know how she's going to get from job A to job B to job C.  I hope it's it's planned as opposed to like.  You know, you get fired and you're like,  well, there's no more demand for this poetry writing stuff.  Or I got to tell you, Stacey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well, so Stacey, I went to the Bread Loaf Writers Conference one year.  I was privileged to get in there.  And if you walked around you and you met people, oh, I'm a fiction writer.  Oh, I'm a nonfiction writer.  And that stood over poet.  And you'd never be asked, oh, and what do you do for a living? Yeah.  Because there was no job there.  But it's also Stacey, I think, about being open to opportunity that comes along.  There were things that I wanted to do when I was young in my career.  But I worked in when I was in newspapers.  They were highly structured.  I amaze my students when I tell them they used to be full time,  career long, caption writers.  That was your job. That's what you did is you wrote captions.  You were expert at writing captions or you were a page layout person.  You knew how to read upside down and backwards or or or right there.  There was a structure to these kinds of jobs and you had skills around them.  Now, whether it's gig or in a company.  Things change, those things change and the new opportunity comes up.  You say, well, if I can learn that real fast.  The thing that amazes me about my son, Jake, and about developers is.  Oh, we got a new language. Oh, we got to worry about Ruby.  OK, well, I'll play around with it and I'll look up online and I'll learn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I love code, but their job.  Not everybody loves it and or is good at it or wants to do it.  And for some people, maybe maybe you're one of them.  If you had to sit down every day at a computer and write lines of code,  you'd be in a living hell.  I would. I would.  For me, I'd be I'd be a pig in mud.  I'd be very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did try because I enjoyed the the.  You like to aspect of writing.  You know, just trying to figure some things out.  Yeah, that's fun.  Which is why I still ended up  dinking around with SQL in my my previous job.  That was all I did all day.  I was able to stare at some source code to find a problem.  But then my solution was involved in SQL, some some fixing the database.  But just building the the application or service from scratch.  No, I'm just not that talented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got to know what you like and what you're good at and what you give me.  I guess that's what we should teach our kids is to to find something you love.  And you're good at it.  I don't know. I don't know.  I really don't know. I mean, I don't know.  I think it's important to say I'm a failed father because both my kids are screw ups.  No, Abby, Abby wanted to be a poet  and is very smart and very talented.  For a while, she went to work in PR.  And what she learned is she hates sitting in an office at a computer.  Yeah, it's not for her.  She got a job at Trader Joe's. She's super happy.  She loves that kind of work.  And she's not making a huge amount of money to make a minimum wage.  But she loves it. She's very happy there.  And I wouldn't want to force her to do brain work  if she doesn't want to do the brain work.  Henry got a degree in broadcast journalism,  despite my every warning that that was a terrible choice.  But it's something he loves and he's trying to find his way doing that.  It's hard. I realize how lucky I was.  I kind of stumbled into what I do.  And I've been very fortunate.  How did you come to it?  Oh, I just you know, I was in college and I was a Chinese major.  And I thought this is a dead end.  What was I wrong?  Well, you're wrong.  Well, it would have been a dead end for me.  First of all, that was 1975.  But secondly, I would have been I bored to tears  sitting in the State Department or something like that.  It would have been boring, probably. I don't know.  I'm very happy. Pretty exciting now.  Yeah, it'd be more interesting now. That's for sure.  But I I went to the radio station, the campus radio station.  And that's I really kind of fell in love with that.  And it's been very I've been very fortunate.  I've been able to continue to do that for, you know, all these years, almost 50 years.  But I don't think I could I could I don't.  This is the problem is my kids look at that and say, oh, I want to do that.  And it's like, I think I was just very fortunate.  It was very lucky for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no path to that.  There's no path.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The way we do education for most of us,  you're either vocational or you're like kind of humanities, right?  And if you're vocational focused, you have to choose when you're 18.  Right. You think you're going to do it.  Which is way too easy. Yeah.  And if you if you embrace the kind of creativity or the the no plan plan  and stumble upon what you do,  I think our education needs to help provide those opportunities  to stumble into things a little bit, just expose you to all this stuff.  Yeah, a little bit more easily. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you know, I think it helps if we if we enhance the education system  as parents or as mentors to these children and let them know, hey,  you're you're trying to figure out what you want to do professionally at age 18.  You're going to change your mind 50 times between age 18 and 20, 21.  So just just accept that.  I've been dealing with that with my boy.  He's a high school senior and he's been pretty consistent.  I'll give him that.  He's been pretty consistent far as what his goals are education wise.  But I'm still just sort of nitpicking at him a little bit.  Say, hey, you're going to change your mind at some point.  So don't be surprised.  And it's OK if you do, because you don't know squat right now. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you want to expose them.  They want them to have a chance to see every as many venues as they can  to see if there's something they fall in love with.  I mean, I fell in love with radio at 20.  And that was the right thing. And I never stopped doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would have probably been an engineer had I  been exposed to it in a good way or been had it been made accessible to me  at that time. But I did.  Is that a sexism issue?  I don't know. I mean, both my parents, my dad was an engineer.  My mom was a geophysicist, so they were both in technical fields.  It's just a.  Going to school to study engineering just seemed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've daunting school lets us down.  I feel like the school system doesn't.  Not fun.  Doesn't really serve to do the.  I mean, it was only 100 years ago you would just do whatever you were.  Your father did or whatever your family apprenticed you to do.  It wasn't like you had a big choice in the matter.  And there really and there weren't any choices.  The imperative was you had to make you had to make a living somehow.  That's it. Now we live in this weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bill's son or daughter.  That's what it brought down to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We live in a weird world where there's this kind of expectation  that you will find this magical thing and will turn a key and  you'll have success and joy and happiness in life.  And I think that's letting a lot of people, young people down because I don't.  But we haven't given them an alternative.  Remember the book What Color Is Your Parachute?  Jeff, you remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. My mom had that book.  It's so it's you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is serendipitous.  I arrived at Claremont Men's College that was then called  not called Claremont McKenna.  I was going to go into law school and go into politics.  I had my own plan ahead of me.  I get there and I said, three more years of this.  No. So what do I what do I do?  What do I do? I panicked. Right.  I was on the school newspaper. Same thing.  So I like doing that.  Good move.  Bad move was that I left Claremont and went to Northwestern to go to journalism school.  This is going to sound funny for journalism teacher,  but I teach graduate journalism school in undergrad.  I wish I'd stuck with liberal arts.  However, I wouldn't have gotten the job opportunities I got  because I was at McGill. Oh, yeah, you're good.  I got hired for stuff and I got internships.  And so, yeah, we're at a point now where you commit your life too early  before having the chance to discover things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I just think we should.  That's why I think education is such an interesting issue, because if you  just think about it for a second, what if we had people like for 10 years?  Do something and then we had a path for them to go back to school,  like for six months and train to do something else after they've experienced it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or Peace Corps or, you know, there are.  Yeah. Yeah. These.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. There's like after you make your first million and you've sold your tech company,  maybe you go to AmeriCorps or. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AmeriCorps. Yeah.  Honestly, I think we just really throw people to the wolves  and just hope that they can figure it out.  And it is every single story is somewhat serendipitous. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And sometimes that's OK, too, sir.  Yeah. Well, it's all we got right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a very odd world we live in.  Biologically, we're not prepared for this high tech world that we live in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an interesting time for the moral panic sign.  Yeah, we're going to get back to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to get back to Google in just a second.  I've got the changelog to do, but first a word from my sponsor.  I want to talk about bad data.  I want to talk particularly about bad data in your customer list.  Every year, about 30 percent of customer data goes bad.  People move, phone numbers change.  And then there's the whole problem of customer data that was bad to begin with.  Fumble fingered data entry, whether it's your customer service rep  or your customer herself accidentally putting the wrong zip code  or leaving out a phone number, things like that.  Melissa solves these problems to make sure your data is accurate and current.  And that gives you a couple of benefits.  One, you don't bother people who don't want to be bothered.  Two, you get your information to the right people at the right time or products,  whatever it is you're sending out to them.  And three, you're not wasting your money  on sending information or products to people who don't want them.  And remember, we had the masks.  Our old fulfillment company, we offered twit masks.  And they ended up somewhere in Florida, right?  Somehow this company, and I'm not going to name names,  but got every order wrong.  They got the addresses right, I guess, but the city wrong or something.  And we got a box a couple of months ago from the guy in Florida  who got all of the twit masks.  And in that box were masks from many other companies.  This was a complete scrub.  We've changed fulfillment houses, by the way, since then.  But that's an example of how this can go wrong.  And it costs you money, costs you your reputation.  We had a lot of twit listeners.  I felt terrible who said, I ordered a mask.  They took my money. I never got one.  No, I'm sorry. Joe in Florida got your mask.  I'm sorry. We'll give you your money back.  That company lost a customer, us, because they weren't using Melissa.  Melissa started doing this a long time ago.  35 years ago for zip codes.  Now they can verify addresses for 240 plus countries.  They can add demographic information like property and mortgage data,  marital status, social media handles.  They can make sure that the address is correct, the phone number is correct.  They can add emails.  It's really amazing.  And it can do it in a way that works for you.  They've got an API.  So if you're building a customer service portal,  build in Melissa.  Your reps will love it because they start typing an address and it just fills it in.  In fact, you might have experienced that on another page,  often back in provided by Melissa, where you start typing the address and boom,  it just fills in. Isn't that awesome?  You can use Melissa on prem.  You can use it as a web service.  They have a secure FTP processing site.  So if you've got, I don't know, a holiday card list you want to check,  upload it to them.  They'll clean it and send it back to you.  You can do it software as a service.  Just choose the way that meets your business needs.  One thing, though, you can be sure of no matter how you use Melissa,  they are safe. They are secure. They are private.  They continually undergo independent security audits  to reinforce their commitment to data security, privacy and compliance.  They have the utmost dedication to your data security,  implementing strong controls and safeguards.  They're SOC 2 compliant, HIPAA compliant, GDPR compliant.  No wonder over 10,000 businesses trust the address experts at Melissa.  Now is the time with the holiday season approaching  to take control of your customer data.  Trust Melissa to be your foundation for data driven success.  And by the way, Melissa is supporting communities  and qualifying essential workers during COVID-19.  If your organization qualifies, you'll get six months of free service.  You can apply online, Melissa.com slash twit.  Thank you. That's a really cool thing to do, Melissa.  Don't put up with sour customer contact data.  Try Melissa's APIs in their developer portal.  It's easy to log on, sign up and start playing in the sandbox 24 seven.  And this is a little thank you.  It's easy to get started right now with 1000 records cleaned for free.  Melissa dot com slash twit.  I love it. It says, welcome, twit army to the developer portal.  I love it, Melissa. Come on, army.  Assemble. Visit Melissa dot com slash twit.  We thank Melissa so much for supporting us.  We thank you for supporting this week in Google by using that special address.  That way they'll know you saw it here.  Melissa dot com slash twit.  Really great, really great service.  I think it'd be good to do the changelog since you want some Google, Stacey.  Let's do some Google.  Let's play the Google changelog game.  Whoops. Oh, it's.  Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's here somewhere.  It's a go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they hit it again.  I love John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How long have you? John has been with us more than a decade.  Thirteen years, twelve years.  Here's an example.  Perfect example. He started in 2009.  You were an IT guy, right?  Working at an L.A. at where?  L.A. Cal State, L.A.  Retired. Retired.  He's got a pension and everything. Retired.  You like doing IT? Yeah.  But for some reason, he didn't want to take it easy.  He said, some reason he didn't want to take it easy.  So he said, I like twit.  I'm moving up a move next door.  I didn't we didn't have a job.  We had just started.  We didn't have a job for him.  We moved next door.  Lisa said, you know, you actually would come by on the weekends.  Just hang out.  Lisa said, we only give this guy a job.  And and I think at first you were just getting my salad  and welcoming visitors and stuff like that.  Worked his way up to probably our most important employee at this point.  He manages the whole studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he goes on strike. You are screwed.  No, if he wants a union, he gets a union.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whatever you want, John, whatever you need.  No, he's a little bit.  He wants to enter his union.  He can have his union. He can have you all in his union.  I don't care.  You all join the union. That's fine with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's like, I don't know if we need a union.  We're not employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't have it.  Yeah, because your contract employees are contractor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey, you could at least get a lunch break, then.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Poor Stacey. I feel that if I want a lunch break, I will take the lunch break.  Take my gosh lunch break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just try to stop me.  Actually, this is Scooter X's change log.  I like to I'm going to just from now on, Scooter X, he's our chat mod,  one of our chat mods.  I'm just going to let you pick all the stories.  Google Authenticator for iOS gets a dark theme redesign  and bulk two factor account transfers.  I don't I don't know what.  Oh, finally.  Does that mean it saves them?  Oh, yeah, you could transfer accounts.  It means, yeah, you transform when you because remember device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, because you never used Authenticator.  You always use Authy because Authenticator.  Yes. Whenever you switch your phone, you were like, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The new sharing transfer is done device to device.  No data goes to Google's servers.  So that actually is preferable because Authy you do upload it to Authy.  They keep it. It's encrypted, but they keep it there and you download it  to new phones. Google actually you put one phone next to the other  and there's a QR code and it copies it over.  So that's cool. I didn't realize till lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I'm sorry. I don't want to switch on my QR codes now.  Talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, you don't have to switch them. It'll copy it over.  All it's really copying is that secret number that is really what  the source of all of this is, is a secret number.  So Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jarvis was saying I hadn't realized that Coinbase got rid of Authy.  And so I had used Coinbase in ages.  Oh, well, check and see how my bitcoins do.  And I got a few hundred bucks and, you know, I took days to get in  because there's no Authy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The more long you sit on Bitcoin, apparently the better.  Did you see it's almost twenty thousand dollars now?  It's at a new high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nineteen thousand.  Closure, folks, I have sixteen hundred dollars in Bitcoin.  Leo, did you ever get into your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I have one hundred forty thousand dollars in Bitcoin,  but I don't know what the password is.  I got I got a worse story.  Actually, I always feel bad until I think about Steve Gibson,  who when Bitcoin was in its infancy, he was talking about  he did a whole show on Bitcoin explaining because he was he loved the mathematics.  He thought it was really cool.  And he said, well, put a Bitcoin miner on this old computer.  The next morning, he wakes up 50 bitcoins  coming out of the Bitcoin miner.  Now, at the time, 50 was worth five bucks.  So he didn't pay much attention to it.  And in fact, that machine eventually got decommissioned and the hard drive erased.  That would have been one million dollars today.  Oh, so I don't feel bad.  I still have my Bitcoin.  And I just it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you really? That's kind of like the new tree falls in the forest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, and that's what I do.  What is it a wallet you can't access?  I know. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He brought it up the other day and I said, look, Steve,  you probably would have sold him by now when it got to, you know, five hundred dollars.  You would say, oh, great, I'll cash in.  That's the problem with this stuff.  You never know.  You know, when do I cash in?  How do I know?  Google Health has a new tool that helps you plan medical visits.  It's going to roll out to search.  This this is you remember, they added a covid-19 alert earlier this year.  They're now piloting a general tool to help you plan visits.  It's it's they've worked with HHS  and the HHS Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.  It's essentially a checklist.  So here's some examples.  Step one, get started planning for an upcoming visit.  Step two, build your checklist.  What do you want to ask?  Oh, so kind of planning for your doctor's visit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Step three, I do this with my daughter before her well visit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You go now, Google take over mother Google.  Remember to bring the names and amounts of any medications,  your insurance card, any lab.  So that's kind of cool. It's a health planner.  The suggested questions were developed by the HHS  as part of its questions are the answer initiative.  Not yet everywhere to roll out more over time.  So when you do health related searches or in search or maps,  you'll see at the bottom start a checklist.  But you can also go right now directly to it  by going to health.google.com slash visit to plan.  It's it's kind of rudimentary.  Let's be honest, right?  It's not like I mean,  this is the kind of thing you teach your daughter, but you're not you don't.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google is the last thing I think of that stuff.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see, boy, there's a whole lot of  Google is pulling the play on something,  pulling the plug on something you probably love.  It's 3D model sharing website, Polly.  I never even heard of it.  Never heard of it.  That's why pulling the plug  launched in November 2017.  I guess if you're into 3D models,  they're going to shut it down June 30th, 2021.  But you can I guess you can get your assets  and download them if you do it right now before that time.  So hurry up, get get Polly off of the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder what what was the tool used to create these these models?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe Sketch. I don't know that they have 3D tools here.  Even necessarily if you go to I'm moving on because it's who cares.  I'm moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't throw a frozen turkey into the fryer.  Anytime we mention frying turkeys, we should just say that your turkey must be completely  thawed before you fry it or you will burn your house down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And dry if possible, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't matter if you burn your house down.

Transcript:  This is the insurance video, isn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is like a fake house.  And they're far, far away, slowly lowering the turkey in via crane.  I guess.  And by the way, can I point out?  That's the turkey fryer Google is listed.  This is it.  That's the one.  Let's see what happens.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  It was frozen, wasn't it?  Holy cow.  Yeah.  Don't do that.  What happened?  That's the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Company holiday cooking safety press conference.  This is just all the different things you can do wrong.  We go down the rabbit hole.  It's a frying pan.  And don't leave a paper turkey decoration on the stove because what's going to happen  to that paper, turkey decoration?  And by the way, the Safeway bag right next to it.  You know what they're doing?  They're trying to turn it up some more, Joe.  It's not catching on fire.  Oh yeah, there you go.  Throw some grease on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly what you want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good.  Actually, I think it's probably just water.  You never put water on a grease fire, right?  Right.  Oh, you know what you really don't want to do?  Put flour on a grease fire.  Okay.  Now a guy with gloves is blowing on it.  Don't blow on it.  Okay.  That was that was that's the video.  Cook up safety this holiday season.  I hope you all enjoy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I put a note in the chat room for everyone on why deep frying a turkey, a frozen turkey  is instant flame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But is it because it's wet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry folks.  That was my fault.  Cooking up safety this holiday season and that's the Google change lock.  What a pro.  John is such a pro.  There, of course, Twitter has said, and I don't know why they even had to announce this  that Jan come January 20th, 12 noon, the at POTUS account will, will go to the president  who unless everything's gone horribly wrong is Donald Trump.  No, no, I'm sorry.  I got that wrong.  It's perfect.  What is Joe?  It's Joe Biden.  But ladies and gentlemen, there's already a Twitter account for the first dogs at the  first dogs.  And I'm not sure what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is because because Major was the dog he was walking when he broke the bones in  his foot.  So there's a picture of Biden in his boot boot and Major says, see, he fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they they issued a press release, didn't they?  Oh, yeah. Go to the account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, you're following.  Go to the account. Leo, go up to the account.  Click on. Oh, jeez.  OK, now what?  If you scroll down, you know what?  That you don't do that. Yeah.  You're going to see a press official.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Probably should just do tweets instead of in Twitter, tweets and replies, because  there's a lot of replies to this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So keep going.  People love dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Champ and Major Biden.  Why do we give dogs our last name?  It's not like we married him.  What's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like because there are children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there are children.  Here's the press release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the press. Here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see, that's what socialism can bring this country.  Yeah. Humor, humanity.  Yeah. Socialists got got fun.  That's hysterical.  Isn't it? Yeah.  Yeah. It's a bad time.  We had a dog in the in the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So and you know what else is happening?  What else? The Doggos aren't happy.  He's going to get a cat, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw that. Why? What's wrong?  What's that's crazy. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's well, he's trying to he's trying to, you know, be the be the president for all animals.  He's the uniter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have to stop the division in this country.  And meanwhile, the current president,  50 days and counting, threatens to veto a major defense bill  unless Congress repeals Section 230.  I at this point, I presume people are just going to go, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How much power does he really have?  Well, he's still the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He could launch a nuclear attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Spending on. Yeah.  I mean, Republicans who used to be hawks are now all doves, apparently.  Because he has a war against Twitter. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The very dangerous and unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated  if it is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act.  Of course, that's where you should put that.  Defend me against Twitter.  I will be forced to unequivocally veto the bill when sent to the  this is completely gratuitous, very beautiful resolute desk.  OK. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As opposed to saying in the little kitty desk  he was sitting in when he got in trouble on Thanksgiving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. I shouldn't laugh.  All right.  Chances of that happening.  I would hope near nil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But who knows?  That's what I would have assumed.  If you ask people.  Really isn't newsworthy because it just won't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's newsworthy if the president of the United States says  I'm going to veto the National Defense Authorization Bill.  Well, unless you do something for me, if you do something for me,  I'll do something for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's just a small favor.  Couple of years, too.  So it's sort of like normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We need Microsoft surveillance on him.  That's what we need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You did you say we talked to that story?  That's a wild story.  But before we do that, sorry, this is Evan Greer's tweet of without Section 230.  This is what Twitter would look like.  Thanks for submitting your tweet.  Your tweet has been sent to our legal department for review.  This process usually takes five to seven business days.  Please note the tweets with controversial opinions may take longer to review  or may be rejected due to liability concerns.  That sounds like a joke.  I don't think it's actually.  Every newspaper is pretty true to me.  Yeah, we'd be we'd probably be shutting down the chat room and  taking comments off of all of our pages and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also, Evan has more has Wikipedia without Section 230.  We're sorry, due to ongoing litigation, this article currently is not  available on Wikipedia.  As a reminder, because of the repeal of Section 230,  all new entries and edits are currently frozen to prevent our volunteer  editors from facing criminal liability for editing posts.  We apologize for the inconvenience. Yeah.  Brilliant. Thank you, Evan. Brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So  Microsoft has added a feature to Microsoft Office  that lets the boss monitor your productivity.  Is that the story you wanted to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, I wish I mean, that's that's what I thought we were going to end up  talking about, just because it's not awesome.  It's actually relevant. People will have opinions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Microsoft Productivity Score  allows managers to use Microsoft 365 to track employees activity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it does the amount of time that you have your camera on on Zoom.  It does things like how quickly you respond to emails.  And basically, it sends all of that.  It's a nice little data file to your boss.  And your boss can elect to use that as like it's kind of like China's social  score. Right.  And it depends on what you think.  I mean, what you do and what you think is productive and how you measure  someone's job. But most people would probably say this freaking sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Because, yeah, we've all had bosses who, you know, people like O'Malley,  who are just complete dicks.  And no, I'm kidding.  It's wonderful.  Like Leo Laporte, for instance, who, you know, instead of actually managing  you and, you know, trusting you and so forth, wants to keep a  stink eye on you because he knows you're not working, especially if you're working  from home. Now, Microsoft, in their defense, Jared Spataro,  the corporate vice president for Microsoft 365, said, let me be clear.  Productivity Score is not a work monitoring tool.  Oh, no. Productivity Score is about discovering new ways of working,  providing your people with great collaboration and technology experiences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, so what's the difference between this and companies doing what they call  workforce management, where they are analyzing the amount of calls coming in  during a specific time of year, time of day, the amount of email  submissions and things like that.  All of that is good data to figure out what type of workforce is needed  for a particular time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's different. Because then you're not looking at an individual.  You're just seeing, do we need more people to handle this call volume, things  like that? But what if we...  But the way this is to be used is to get some idea of how an individual, if an  individual is productive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many entries has Jason put in the change log in the last hour?  Yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and it depends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Strictly tied to their particular Office 365 account, not just to go, OK, all right.  I misunderstood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And, you know, depending on your job, you're going to have different metrics.  And like our job right now, we're not, I guess, having our camera turned on  would be important.  Responding to emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am monitoring everything you're doing right now, Stacey, and I'm not happy.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like if my boss is like, hey, you're not responding to your emails fast enough, I  might be like, well, dude, that's because I am, you know, participating in a  virtual conference and writing a story about it and checking emails really  disruptive in that process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The guy I work for who runs I Heart Media, Bob Pittman, is legendary for if  you don't respond to an email from him within an hour or two.  And there are a lot of executives like this.  That is a black mark on you.  And so his executive team is up.  They respond any time of the day or night.  Email response is very quick.  And I think that fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Steve Jobs is like that, too, right?  He expected you to be working every hour of the day.  And I don't know, you could say, well, look at the great results Steve Jobs  produced, but I don't think it's a great experience for the employee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I worked for the Robert Baron, Robert Maxwell, the New York Daily News  in 1990, that's Glenn's, my Maxwell's father.  They issued all the top editors a brick phone or those huge old phones and a pager.  And I remember I got in big trouble with him because I was in the Lincoln  tunnel and it wasn't wired yet.  And I missed his call.  And no, you were to call and whenever he called day or night, 24 hours a day, you  were to answer that phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a lot of bosses like that.  Good.  I was like that, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, no, I was a great organization.  He was a tiny, lovely human being as a boss.  Sometimes he was demanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think a boss should be a little demanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's demanding of himself, too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Man worked himself to a heart attack.  Not something I aspire to, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I guess what I, my feeling on this is there's just some really jerky bosses out  there. We've all worked for somebody's a jerk, not own, but somebody's a jerk.  And those people will use these kinds of tools to harass you effectively.  And I don't think it's I don't think it's up to Microsoft to give people tools  like that. But on the other hand, kind of that is their business.  And so they're going to do stuff like that because there's demand for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, well, but the company can decide whether to enable that behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't. I think it's enabling bad behavior, frankly.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  It's nonsensical, as Stacey says.  You can't have criteria that are universal.  Right.  Makes no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And you should judge someone based on their output.  Yeah.  And I mean, that's how they get to that.  Yeah. How they get to that point.  You know, who cares if if I answer emails once a day, but I'm still producing good  work that's insightful, then why would you want to change that about someone?  You know, you know, I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, here's something Americans don't like.  Government tracking of their cell phone activity.  Really? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was a great story.  So The Wall Street Journal on the Friday after Thanksgiving, don't ask me why they  chose that date, did an excellent story about people selling data or companies  grabbing data from your applications and reselling it to the government.  And that's a follow on story from that, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Seventy seven percent, according to the Harris poll, 77 percent of Americans believe  government should have to get a warrant to get the kind of detailed location information  that currently is not does not require a warrant.  In fact, that cell carriers and others have portals for law enforcement that sell this  at fairly low cost to any law enforcement agency that wants it.  Where was Leo last night?  It's right there based on your smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like Microsoft. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you have these apps.  So I think the key here is we need to guess government should have to get a warrant.  But right now, we're just leaking that data left and right because we're downloading  apps and things and we don't check it.  So we need to have some transparency and accountability, not just for the government,  but for these app makers.  The government's just doing the loophole that we have.  We need a data privacy act that actually has teeth.  And we don't. Why do we not have this yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's interesting because in 2018, the Supreme Court said cell phone carriers.  The law enforcement would need a warrant to compel cell phone carriers to turn off a  location. But so that's gone away, I guess.  That old thing of you could buy it on a portal.  But you nailed it, Stacey.  It doesn't apply to apps.  So the Supreme Court hasn't addressed whether consumers can have any expectation of  privacy or due process and data generated from apps other than from carriers.  So the Supreme Court did prohibit that with carriers a couple of years ago.  I did not know that. But the problem is this apps data is constantly packaged up and  sold to brokers and bought by law enforcement, according to The Wall Street Journal.  Several U.S. law enforcement agencies are buying geolocation data for criminal law  enforcement and border security purposes.  And there's zero court oversight.  People don't like that.  Problem is, I don't think people generally know.  If you went and asked somebody, they'd probably say, oh, you need a warrant for that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you do. You do need a warrant or yes, you actually do need a warrant to get  information if you go directly to like Google to get location information.  But if you're savvy, you just say, oh, hey, let's let's see if this company has  information on this particular person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is it? Was it was called a pen warrant or pen register is what it was called.  Right. And I guess that that's no I thought that was still a practice.  But I. But I guess maybe the Supreme Court has limited that.  I did not realize that.  So. This is where Denise Howell would be helpful.  You want to see the top TikTok videos of the year and then we'll take a break and  wrap this thing up. Yeah.  Celebrating the community of videos that brought joy across America.  If if if there's no cranberry juice and Fleetwood Mac in this one, I just oh, it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  number one. The rewind TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tick tock rewind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. YouTube was too depressing, but not TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube's canceled theirs, but TikTok.  No. Who had cranberry juice on their pandemic bingo card this year?  Twenty twenty saw an astounding number of videos go viral, entertaining millions and  changing the lives of creators who made them.  These are the top 10 viral videos.  You're ready.  B to the B's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  M to the B.  Some to the B.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Some to the B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had no idea.  This was huge.  That's it right there. That's all that was number one.  That was Bella does M to the B.  Bella porch.  OK, then the next one is number two.  Yeah, that's the guy with the cranberry juice.  You want to play the music or get in trouble.  Yeah. Yeah. This is the coworker you love to hate because working from home is hard  by its.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I saw this. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is by is Caitlin.  It's Caitlin. Hello.  You ready? It's Caitlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I just wanted to let you know that I really appreciate your time and guidance  during this time. You've been an amazing group leader.  Yeah, and to piggyback off of what Matt said, if you guys are struggling working from home,  you're not being creative.  This is too real.  There's a lot to do right now for the company.  I've been very, very busy giving myself projects.  So you just need to be thinking about the company and be creative and have a positive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mindset. You'll find something you do during this time at home.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the smile is perfect.  Perfect.  I have been with this person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Diane, I've noticed that Jeff is not here.  He has not checked into the meeting.  I'm here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love the I love the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had a feeling you were going to bring that up.  I actually made a PowerPoint on that exact topic.  I emailed everyone the PowerPoint.  If you guys want to check your emails, we should be always checking our emails.  You can look at the PowerPoint so we don't have to ask questions during this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love the nod.  The nod is I love the nod.  You're not watching the nod.  Yeah. Yeah.  That's the coworker you hate during a Zoom meeting.  That's the number three viral video.  Should we do more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  The last week you missed Leo, we did.  Oh, you did this.  Ratatouille. No, no, no, no.  We did Ratatouille, the musical all on TikTok.  It was brilliant. What?  Yeah. The whole thing.  Let's only do two more.  That's a torture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. All right.  I won't do any more.  I'll just say NBA got one with Jalaya, who shows us how it's done at the All-Star game.  I remember that one. That was pretty good.  Will Smith wipes it down.  An obscure serial jingle that isn't bread becomes a woman.  I got to watch this becomes a bread sensation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can stop now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What language is this?  Is it Spanish?  It's a llama dancing to this and it's a serial commercial.  But because it says me pan, people think it's about bread.  I think I must have the weirdest sense of humor because none of that did anything.  I'm going to watch the rest of these at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We played musical stuff last week in the privacy of my own home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They call him Alexander Hamilton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. You don't like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, do it.  No, he hates it.  This is how you can torture him.  Okay.  Hamilton would be great if it wasn't a musical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Add, then, things.  Let's do it.  Things. Our show today brought to you by that hot stuff on the plate.  The green ball.  They call it wasabi, but that's not what it's brought to you by.  It's hot, but not wasabi.  Hot cloud storage.  That's what you want.  Hot cloud storage.  If you're in a company like ours that makes data, we make a lot of podcasts.  We know we're going to make a certain amount of data every month.  We know we've got to save that data, store it somewhere.  If you're buying hard drives, every month terabytes of hard drives, stop the insanity.  You need wasabi.  Wasabi hot cloud storage.  Now, this is not your grandpa's cloud.  This is not Amazon or Google or Microsoft cloud.  It's 80% cheaper than Amazon's S3.  One-fifth the cost.  It's faster, up to six times faster than Amazon's S3.  And I would argue it's better, more secure, more reliable than any on-prem storage.  In fact, wasabi is so affordable, it costs less than the equivalent amount of just the maintenance fees  for the equivalent amount of on-prem storage.  It's less than the maintenance fees.  Now, you're going to go to your boss and say, boss, look, I got this great thing.  It's affordable, flat rate.  We know exactly what our budget's going to be.  It'll save us money.  And he's going to say, but it's not secure.  You got those hard drives in the corner.  I know where they are.  I know what's going on.  I said, boss, those aren't secure.  You ever hear of ransomware?  You ever hear of human error?  Those aren't secure.  Wasabi not only is more affordable, it's more secure than on-prem storage.  First of all, 11.9 is a durability.  Wasabi has active integrity checking.  Every object stored on wasabi is checked for integrity every 90 days.  And because wasabi hosts in premier tier four data center facilities that are fully redundant  and, of course, fully secure, if one bit goes south, well, they can get a copy from the other data center.  And you haven't lost a thing.  By the way, secure by default, all the data on wasabi's cloud is encrypted at rest.  Even if you don't specify it, that's just automatic.  It's because they follow industry's best practice for security and design.  They have access control mechanisms, bucket policies, ACLs.  But the best thing of all, and this is a thing that you cannot promise with that on-prem in the corner,  you've got a hard drive in the corner and it's on the network and ransomware gets into your system, you're gonzo.  But if it's stored in wasabi, it's immutable.  It cannot be altered.  It cannot be erased.  It cannot be changed by ransomware, by human error, by anything.  You're protected from hackers' malware and yourself.  It's the best way to archive data in the cloud, better even than a local hard drive.  It's, of course, HIPAA compliant and FINRA compliant and CJIS compliant.  It's exactly what you're looking for.  Wasabi is a highly secure disruptive technology that's turning the industry on its ear.  Storage is 80% cheaper and up to six times faster.  The only question is why you're not using it.  Calculate the savings for yourself.  I know your boss says, well, what about Amazon?  No, just say, boss, this is less expensive, more secure.  It's the best solution.  And by the way, if you know how much data you're going to use over any given time,  there's a flat rate, but you could also pay as you go or you could also pay one time with reserved capacity storage  because then you save even more.  It makes buying cloud storage a natural addition to your on-prem storage.  If you're thinking about buying more hardware storage,  just compare the price against five years of reserved capacity storage.  You know you're going to use it.  You know you're going to need it.  Book it ahead and you'll save.  You could purchase in one three or five year increments.  And you get, of course, bigger discounts for the longer you go and for the more capacity you buy.  So it's even a better way to save.  I just think Wasabi is a must.  Go to wasabi.com.  Try it today.  W-A-S-A-B-I.  It's Amazon S3 API compliant.  So you already have stuff, you know, all the software you use on S3.  It works.  They never charge for API access.  Oh, here's another big one that'll save you tons.  You know, you store stuff in the cloud.  That's how it was fun.  That was easy.  It was cheap.  But then you want it.  They charge you.  Not Wasabi.  There is never a fee for egress.  No fee for egress.  None of those complicated S3 tiers either.  Wasabi.com.  You could try it today.  Do me a favor, though, if you do use the offer code TWIT so they know you saw it here.  Calculate the savings for yourself and start a free trial of storage for a month.  Join the movement.  Migrate your data to the cloud.  W-A-S-A-B-I.  Wasabi.com.  Offer code TWIT.  We thank Wasabi so much for supporting this week in Google.  Stacey, pick O the week.  Oh, you're muted.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.  No, I came back.  She's back.  OK.  This I did my gift guide last week on Friday.  Oh, I missed it.  Oh, nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's on the web.  Stacey on IoT.  It's on the web.  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  So the number one item, but I got to see how well it performed on my newsletter.  And the number one item on the gift list that people were excited about is this guy right here.  This is the.  This is a.  Did you take that out of a plant?  Yes, it is a plant sensor.  Sensor.  So one of the themes of the gift guide was basically plants because I bought a lot of plants.  Post-COVID.  So this particular sensor is the on Amazon, it's the all of an OLL IVAN plant monitor.  You pop this into your plant and you download the flower care app.  And what it does is it tells you the humidity, sorry, the moisture, the light, the fertility and the temperature of your house or the room.  And they they have a database of all the plants.  So you pop it in there, you tell it what kind of plant it's in and it'll basically give you the data about that plant.  Does it tell you it's time to water it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that really that's because that's what I need.  So here's the plus and minus here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is cheap.  It's 30 bucks.  Right.  But it is only Bluetooth.  So you do have to check in nearby.  I see.  It's well.  So there's no Wi-Fi.  If there were a Wi-Fi hub, it could actually tell the hub and then the hub would be like, what are we?  Right.  So, you know, make it a point to go visit it.  But if you're like me and I have I have watering days.  So every three days or so I check and I'm like, hey, does he do you need water right now?  Plant. Yeah, because I have some.  It's not under watering for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of times over watering for me.  So this would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So my plant journey has been I over water and then I get fungaled at my underwater and I get spider mites.  Right. And it's just terrible.  But this is helping.  So I recommend this.  It's a fun thing.  Be careful, though.  I have seen this for sale in the U.S.  under the brand name Kale.  And that one is ninety nine.  Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Please don't pay.  Get the cheap Chinese.  This is perfectly fine.  And you also have.  I mean, it's the exact same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have in your guide an Arduino automatic smart plant watering kit, which will do the watering.  So you have some other you have some other solutions.  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's my favorite thing.  That thing you see right there.  You all the Meyer lemon tree plants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a light.  There's a sunlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a full spectrum grow light that is attractive.  If you see, I mean, it's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, and is it is it enough light to light your room like it could be one of your house lights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  We use it actually as a wall sconce.  We have two, one on each side.  And it's fantastic.  And it's made in somewhere outside of Pennsylvania or Philadelphia.  Sorry.  Don't know if he's inside of Pennsylvania, but it's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Close.  It's close.  Yeah.  You got a lot of this is a great gift guide.  Stacey on iot.com.  Oh, a whole bunch of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was my desk for everyone who was who was wondering about desks right there.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You guys spent a whole show on desks last week.  Actually, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yet we talked more about Google on that show than we did on today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that amazing?  Isn't that amazing?  You want Jason Howell back?  He can be, he could be arranged.  It can be arranged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I just heard Jason's tire squealing as he peeled out.  Now tell me, does this work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This Ember wave bracelet that says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Kevin tried it and he had his wife try it and he, it does work.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the theory is it warms your wrist and then you feel warm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It apparently lowers your body temperature or raises your body temperature as needed.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that's old news.  Kevin doesn't lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes he sugarcoats things, but he doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know all about this Ember, you've been here, done that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, not necessarily that product, but it's fairly common for when you're trying to cool someone off.  You take cold, icy rags or something like that.  You put it on their temples.  You put it on their forehead.  Or you put it on their wrists to help them cool off if they have a fever because of the temperature receptors and sending the signals to your brain.  And that's all that looks like to me.  I'll just turn the heat up if you don't mind.  Yeah, or that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  So the pick of the week from Stacey is the Ollivan Plant Monitor.  Thirty dollars at Amazon except no substitutes, especially something with same thing for 90 bucks.  That's good.  Good, good, good.  A number, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, a number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which one?  This is kind of a number.  It's kind of a thing.  So CAPTCHA, which we're all tortured with.  Yes.  Prince Eden's blog points out that it doesn't prove you're human.  It proves you're American.  That's a good point.  He fought face to CAPTCHA that said show us the taxis.  Right.  Well, where he's from, the taxis are black.  Yeah, I know our yellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's really culturally biased.  Very much so.  Yeah, that's interesting.  So I make a quick one so Stacey can eat.  That's very annoying.  Bert Pruitt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My pick is just something that I do as far as helping with my sleep habits and patterns.  I know you all have heard me talk about how bad my sleep has been.  Oh, me too.  Over the years.  Help me out.  Quite frankly, it's slowly getting better because I've been practicing some different things.  And one of those things is I turn on an old audio book that I've listened to in the past just to sort of help me wind down.  And recently I've been listening to Bert Kreischer's book, Life of the Party.  And it's such a funny, he's a funny comedian, but his story, his life story is hilarious.  He was a college student for like six years at Florida State.  Oh, boy.  Got a book deal.  The college professor, I believe it was some literature or whatever.  The professor wouldn't pass him because he got a book deal and he didn't even deserve the book deal.  So the professor was like, on principle, I'm not going to pass you.  You're just going to go without those three credits.  But he has a lot of funny stories and the audio book is the best way to go because he reads it himself and he's not very good at reading it.  So he does a lot of stuttering and a lot of funny jokes and anecdotes in between.  I laugh so hard at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the best part of this is if you do go to Amazon and find Bert Kreischer's Life of the Party, it will then recommend a series of other equally wild books like  Steve-O's memoir, A Professional Idiot, Tom Segura's memoir, Thrilled, in which he proposes like Michael Jackson.  Oh, Tom Segura is hilarious.  And Kevin Smith's cover, Doug Stanhope's Digging Up Mother, a Love Story, and Kevin Smith's Silent But Deadly.  So there's some really great literature here for you to choose from.  Once you get, once you start down the Life of a Party stories of Rachel Mansfield.  There's no Gutenberg, but it's still good.  No, it's not Gutenberg, but it's still good.  Still good stuff.  You know, we didn't mention and I probably should have mentioned because it's really actually one of the most important stories of the week.  Apparently, many of our listeners have done folding at home, the gene folding program that would run in the background on your computer and help solve one of the most thorny problems in medicine.  The issue of protein folding and how to predict how a protein is going to fold is apparently very important to making medicines and understanding how the world around us works.  And deep, what is it called? Deep thought, deep space, deep something, deep blue.  Deep mind.  Deep mind.  Deep mind.  Has apparently solved it.  I don't know what this means for things like folding at home, but this is a huge discovery and I really, I feel bad that I didn't.  I'll make it my pick of the week because this is a very big deal.  It was discovered by a London AI lab.  Researchers at DeepMind say they've solved the protein folding problem, a task that bedeviled scientists for more than 50 years.  Proteins make up everything, viruses, bacteria, all living things.  And for biologists identifying the shape of a protein, bread can take months or years or even decades of just trial and error, experimentation.  But now DeepMind can do it in a few hours, maybe even in some cases a few minutes.  DeepMind is a lab owned by the same parent company as Google, in other words, Alphabet.  And its system is called Alpha Fold.  Alpha Fold, it has effectively solved the protein folding problem.  If you give it a string of amino acids, the system can rapidly and reliably predict its three dimensional shape.  Huge breakthrough.  And it's solved by artificial intelligence.  So I thought...  Outstanding.  Yeah, very important that we bring this one up because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This vaccine took, because of machine learning and data, took two days to create and then nine months to approve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These mRNA vaccines are really innovative.  It's a whole new way of making vaccines.  This is also created by artificial intelligence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So no moral panic, people.  Technology is good.  Could be very big.  No moral panic here.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Technology can be used for good, but if we should always question what else it could be used for.  And when we ask those questions, Jeff, it is not moral panic.  It is our ethical duty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should also mention, because we talked about this a couple of weeks ago, the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico is now fully collapsed.  They were hoping to take it down before the collapse.  It was severely damaged in a series of storms.  And the hope was to get the towers down, which weighed many, many tons, before they could collapse and hit the dish.  But they have actually fallen and hit the dish and severely damaged it.  So it's the end, I'm sad to say, for one of the most important radio telescopes in the world, the Arecibo Observatory.  57 years old.  And this is another one.  We talked about folding at home.  I remember SETI at home, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, it was being used for that, among other things.  You might have seen it in the movies or on TV.  So pretty damaged.  That's sad.  That's bad news.  I don't mind to end with bad news, but sometimes you have to.  It is NOEL, which spelled backwards is Leon.  Just saying.  Today I learned.  Today you learned something.  You know, well, if I, you know, that's the thing.  When Christmas is over, I just get up and I just turn this around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's going to turn it around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says Leon.  So I'm just saying.  No, actually, it really doesn't.  It says nothing.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  And looks like one of those captures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you see the taxi in that?  It's not yellow.  Stacy Higginbotham, Stacy on IOT, subscribe to her newsletter.  It's free and you must because it's full of good stuff.  You should also listen to her wonderful podcast that she does with that Beatles fan, Kevin Toffle.  It's called the IOT podcast and she joins us every week.  The God of Chromebooks.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one tell Kevin if I'm going to get him this.  I haven't decided yet.  What?  Is he watching?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He usually I ams me if he's watching.  Okay.  So we'll see.  So what are you going to get him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You didn't say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now I'm not going to say I guarantee you people noticed if they if they if they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  were paying attention, Leo, did you show something on the screen that I missed?  Oh, man, I missed it.  All right.  We won't say a word about it.  Oh, well, we talked about.  Oh, yeah, I was here for that.  I think the thing is, you're going to get a woodcut out that says Leon.  Is that right?  That's right.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is what I'm getting.  I don't like this.  Dude's a surprise.  Good.  I don't like that.  He'll really enjoy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  He is ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.  He is it says it right here.  The director of the townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate  School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Thank you, Craig Newmark.  Without Greg, we would have a man, Jeff Jarvis.  Anything you want to plug coming up?  No, no.  You'll be back next week.  Yep.  OK, where am I going to go?  Yeah.  Where am I going to go?  Can't go anywhere.  Gonna be here.  Jason, I'll be taking over the show starting next week because apparently you like him  better.  Mr. Ant Pruitt, he is a host of Hands on Wellness, Hands on Photography and a fine man.  Oh, I didn't get to talk about my remarkable.  That was actually my pick of the week, but we'll save that for another time.  Actually, I want to give it a little.  I only got it yesterday.  I want to give it a week and then I'll try.  Try doing some PDFs.  Yes, because you said the round tripping of PDFs is not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that could be a problem.  Unless you tell me that I was stupid, then I'm going to feel very bad.  You're not stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're Jeff.  Anything you want to plug?  You're going to be on the Smug Mug podcast tomorrow, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, sir.  I'll be on Smug Mug Live at 11 a.m. Pacific time, December 3rd, 11 a.m. Pacific.  I'm just sharing some insight on my background and so forth, then just hopefully inspiring

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  some folks to get out there and just...  With the wonderful Alastair Jolly.  It should be a lot of fun.  Smug Mug Live.  I'm looking forward to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm really excited about this.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  But also, folks, just go out there and share Hands on Photography and Hands on Wellness  and just let other people know about the show.  I really enjoy doing these shows.  I bet.  Yeah, yeah.  Thank you, Ann.  I didn't have to say that a minute ago.  I got a big notification from all of the family members here in the house.  Hey, what's wrong with Xbox?  Did you pay the Xbox Live bill?
