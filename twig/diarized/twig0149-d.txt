Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina is an author.  I don't have her lifehacker books so I brought a stand in games diversions and pearl culture.  Just pretend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that'll hack your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just pulled this off the shelf.  That's a I don't know why I even own this book but good read.  Let me tell you.  Pearl culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pearl culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The pearl culture.  That's why I bought it.  Pearl culture.  And it's got a flying crazy monkey on the cover or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's got a whole section dedicated to beard grooming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it?  It probably does.  Neck beard grooming.  That's Clay Johnson.  Clay A. Johnson, author of The Information Diet at information diet dot com.  We've had him on triangulation if you want to know more.  On the back of his book, it says, I've decided to be much more selective about what information  I feed my head.  Gina Trapani, project director at Expert Labs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Clay is my former co-worker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Little log rolling going on here.  Huh?  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Clay is my man.  He's my man.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're former cohorts.  Also, Baratunde writes on the back, 80% of Americans suffer from information obesity.  That's not true, but it could be.  It's time we get an healthier information diet.  I love that.  It's great to have you back, Clay.  It's great to be here.  Thanks for joining us.  And of course, as long as I'm holding up books, let's hold up Jeff Jarvis's book, Public Parts.  Jeff is, of course, a professor of journalism at the City University of New York and the  author of a number of books, including What Would Google Do?  and this new one, Public Parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'm going to blame my 10 pounds of added weight on information.  Google is flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Your head is stuffed.  Jeff Jarvis's Public Parts are a healthy part of an information diet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.  How many diet jokes do you get by you poor guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's made two already and we just started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm in.  I'm in for the long haul.  He's from Washington, DC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want low protein information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm all about cutting information carbs.  No more processed information for me.  Hey, Top Story isn't really a big top story for normal, but because we are big friends  and fans of Kevin Rose, we now know what he's doing at the Google.  It was kind of a mystery.  Kevin, who found a dig, he was actually an IT guy at Tech TV when he discovered a major  bug in Windows and we put him on the air on the screensavers.  He became the dark tipper and later took over my job.  Thanks Kevin.  And then was a regular on Twitter for three weeks and decided to found Dig Nation.  Thanks Kevin.  Kevin and I are old buddies, good friends and certainly not rivals in any respect.  He's done pretty well for himself.  In fact, he was on Businessweek as a $60 million man.  He then...  Oh well.  Oh well.  Easy come, easy go.  Maybe not.  I don't know.  It might be.  If you look at the investments he's made, he of course founded Revision 3, founded Dig,  left both companies to start MilkMI.LK, which was kind of an app incubator.  His plan at Milk was to fail fast, to keep creating products and fail fast until he found  a hit.  He made one, canceled the product and sold to Google.  And now we know what he's doing because he wouldn't tell anybody.  Turns out he's a partner at Google's investment arm, Google Ventures.  I don't think that's actually what he planned to do somehow, but maybe.  It sounded like he was working in products.  But this makes sense.  I could see you would leave, frankly, I could see why you would leave your own career as  an entrepreneur if you could support entrepreneurs.  And he's always been like an angel investor.  Listen to the companies that he's invested in.  And you might think he probably is the $60 million man.  Not bad.  I would hire him as an adventure partner.  He was apparently originally a senior product manager at Google+, according to Liz Gaines  writing in All Things D. And then the rest of his team joined the social team.  The milk deal, according to Liz, was worth $12 million upfront with $3 million potential  earn out according to a source involved in the deal.  But now he's at Google Ventures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which has good people.  Rick Clow is there.  I love Rick.  Rick's a great guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is wonderful.  Yeah, Rick is great.  Rick started Feedburner, which was acquired by Google.  And that's how Rick got in the game the same way Kevin is, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I met Rick on the Dean campaign in 2004.  He worked with the Dean campaign?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he sure did.  We should mention, Clay was responsible for Dean's digital strategy, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was a software developer.  I was his lead programmer.  There were other people that were doing what we called on the Dean campaign strategy, but  it was really throwing noodles on a wall and seeing which one stuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of interesting that a presidential campaign needs a programmer, but I think that  that's probably the case now.  That would be a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you work with Zach Rosen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Zach was in my cube.  Did you write Mitt Romney's iPhone app?  I know how to spell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you see this?  I think that would be a great way to sabotage them.  You should take credit for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's actually appropriately spelled.  It's just Latin.  It's AmeriCIA.  It means love the CIA.  And it's a photo taking app that sends your face to the Central Intelligence Agency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, at first I was a little puzzled because I was seeing on Instagram all these  people saying, I'm Mitt for America.  And I thought, this is kind of odd.  Why are all these people suddenly coming out as Romney supporters?  And then I realized what the problem was.  It was misspelled.  This is a Romney app they put out for the iPhone.  It was an app that would take your photos and add Mitt Romney slogans to your pictures,  including one that was misspelled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What it should do is take your picture and make it look like an Etch A Sketch did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And what's interesting is it's going to take them a while to recoil from that too because  they got to probably issue a bug fix and go through the app store process.  Apple has to approve it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How did it get passed?  This is Apple's company.  I don't understand how it got passed to Apple.  This is the company where they were complaining about colors and icons, but they allow A-M-E-R-C-I-A.  AmeriCIA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're big fans and supporters of AmeriCIA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A-M-E-R-C-I-A. Holy cow.  Apple loves A-M-E-R-C-I-A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was the death of the copy editor.  As a journalist, I was supposed to insert here how the world is falling apart with no  copy editors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A-M-E-R-C-I-A is the greatest country on earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are times when you do wish you had a copy editor.  You're right.  Now they have to wait for...  This could take weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can ask Apple for special consideration.  You can say it's an emergency bug.  I don't know if Apple would consider this emergency an emergency bug.  It'll be interesting to see how long it takes to get fixed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to download it right now before it gets fixed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And never update it.  It's called Wismit, which by the way is not the most propitious name to begin with.  I'm Mitt Mitt.  In German that would be Mitt Mitt, right?  Mitt Mitt.  So, there you go.  He has a programmer.  Is that the kind of thing you're doing for Howard Dean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I suspect that that was probably outsourced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Outsourced to Taipei or somewhere.  Maybe Mitt, you should use American-made programs.  A better America.  Although you're right, it is kind of a Freudian slip.  CIA.  I'm downloading it right now.  I'm going to take a picture of myself.  Get started.  Okay.  Choose a Mitt message.  Take a photo.  Share with friends.  That's one that's America's spelled properly.  Believe in America.  Mitt 2012.  Day one job one.  I believe.  I'm with Mitt.  I'm a mom for Mitt.  Oh, what a hokum.  Obama isn't working.  I stand with Mitt.  The America we love.  No, they changed it.  Oh, that's a...  No, no.  It's a better America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me see what you're finding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a better America, yeah.  Believe in America.  Maybe they did fix it already.  Oh, dang.  I think they fixed it.  That pisses me off.  How dare they fix it before I could download it.  So, is it...  You think it's common that...  When Howard Dean did it.  He was famous to be the first internet candidate.  He raised all this money from the internet.  It was really a big deal.  Was he, do you think, the first candidate to have a staff programmer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I was the first programmer, I think, a real programmer hired by a presidential  campaign to my knowledge.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was in 2004.  That's eight years ago.  Would you guess that they all have programmers and writing apps right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They all have some form of digital staff.  They either use...  Both Romney and Obama have a campaign staff that is digital.  I saw on...  Somebody told me, this is totally offhand, but somebody told me that about half of the  Obama campaign staff is actually digital staff now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we talked about this in your interview on triangulation.  I was excited four years ago because Obama really reached out to the internet and was  very active and I signed up.  I gave him my text message number and stuff and then he got elected and nothing.  It was like...  But you explained that when you go to the White House, they're still running Windows  XP.  You can't have a Twitter or a Facebook.  You can't use Skype.  You can't use Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Every computer inside of the White House, especially amongst their digital staff, every  desk has two computers on it.  One that the government gives them and that computer is used to display a screen saver  and then the computer that the employee brought from home that they use to do work on.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are they allowed to get on the network with the home computer or are they using cell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's touch and go.  I haven't pressed too hard on that because it's like pulling the Jenga piece out of the  puzzle there could cause the whole thing to collapse.  But they just announced some really interesting things this week.  They have this sort of digital initiative that Todd Park released and one thing in it  which I think is really interesting is they call it an EZRFP program and they're basically  trying to reinvent what's called small acquisitions, acquisitions under $150,000 to say can we  make those happen faster, better, cheaper without companies having to go through the  kind of rigmarole that they normally do.  What they're doing is they're trying to find a program manager and two software developers  to actually come in and be White House fellows to sort of revamp that process.  I think that's a really cool step.  It's amongst a whole slew of other projects that they announced along those lines to sort  of have a larger innovation program inside of the White House.  It's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Leo, I think back to your point, you're right that if you have this whole relationship  with people out there, you push that and then you get into office and you don't continue  it, it kind of gives lie to the notion that it's a relationship in the campaign.  I asked Cameron's video guy in the UK some years ago whether he would continue doing  videos because Web Cameron was really pretty good.  He's washing the dishes on video.  He did all kinds of things.  And the guy said, well, if he didn't continue doing it, it would be cynical what we're doing  now.  So it reveals what I think is rather cynical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's do some contrast here.  Three years ago, there was no blog on WhiteHouse.gov.  Three years ago, no federal agency had a Twitter account.  Three years ago, no government agency had a Facebook page or very few had a Facebook  page.  These guys, the We the People site is pretty amazing.  There's a petition on there now that's getting a whole bunch of traction saying, it looks  like the president's going to have to respond saying, we want free access to taxpayer-funded  scientific research.  That's a big deal.  None of this existed three years ago.  I think that they're doing the best that they can.  I mean, obviously, I'm biased, but the contrasting where we were three years ago to where we're  at today, it's pretty remarkable.  Yeah, I'll agree.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My favorite moment in campaigns was when Rudy Giuliani made his MySpace page private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want you to know what I'm drinking.  I have to admit, I knew Campaign 2012 had launched when I started getting text messages  again from President Obama.  It was like a bad boyfriend or girlfriend.  It was silence until he wanted me again.  There's rules, right?  It was like a booty call from the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The president's not allowed to take his text messaging list into the White House.  That has to stay with the Democratic National Committee or the campaign or whatever.  There's all kinds of rules and regulations about the assets of everything that make it  a little bit trickier.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So I'm being cynical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which should also get updated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The White House released a video about Obama was tweeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was answering questions on Twitter.  One of his staff, one of his staff at the White House was explaining to him what the  perfect tweet was, which was that he had tweeted something that was exactly 140 characters.  She was explaining that that's a twush, a tweet swush, like playing basketball.  He was laughing about it.  I mean, that's pretty incredible.  Well, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's got fun.  You know, that was something we were all talking about in 2009, but I'm glad he's caught up.  So twush.  Does anybody even talk about twushes anymore?  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's perfect.  140 characters, president, Mr. President.  POTUS did a twush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's the twush master.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  POTUS the twush master.  He can also catch flies with his bare hands.  But that's so I like the petition thing.  I just wonder is now maybe I'm cynical, but I just feel like nobody's paying attention  to these.  This is a we petition the Obama administration to require this is from the chat room require  free access over the Internet to scientific journal articles arising from taxpayer funded  research is scandalous how these scientific journals charge tons of money for access to  publicly funded research and provide no value for it.  Yeah, no value.  It's all there.  They're close to their 25,000, which is when you get 25,000, then it's I don't know, it  turns into a pumpkin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  When you get to 25,000, the White House has to respond to it.  But really, Clay, they're going to respond in one way or another.  I did one a while ago.  I only got 5,000, but it was and more hate mail than I've ever gotten for anything that  I've ever done.  What was your let me use my Kindle during takeoff and landing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  That was a great one.  Yes, by the way, that was wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  I tried really hard to get Alec Baldwin to join it.  I even did an op ed in the USA Today.  But these people came after me and were like, you're trying to kill us.  You're a terrorist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, come on.  The Kindle.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's like, man, yeah, people are really people are really afraid of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when we know how the people pay attention, the question is, does the White House and  now come on, Clay, we talked about this in the interview.  I kind of gave you a softball on this one because it was when we talked last, it was  your opinion that really the only upshot of these petitions is to gather email addresses.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  But the White House, that's for the most part.  But I haven't seen the White House actually do anything with these emails.  Right.  So I've created a petition.  I've signed a few.  I've never received an email other than sort of the verify your email address stuff from  the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not allowed to.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can still send you can still the White House still has a list and they can you know,  they can send out an email saying like, check out the latest presidential weekly address  or check out the.  I never get that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I only get stuff saying, remember when you gave us money four years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's from the campaign.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The campaign.  I get stuff from the campaign.  I never hear from anybody else.  Never got a tush.  No tush is for me.  But I'm not cynical and I'm just I'm just pointing it out.  I mean, I would, you know, I know, I know he likes gay marriage, but I don't care.  I think this is more important.  I know he's our first gay president, but I think this is OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, my son, Leo, if you really, really, really, Sergey Brin gently harassed Gavin Newsom on  television.  I'm pissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, I'm pissed.  So so we've been trying to get anybody from Google on this show, you know, above Matt  Cutts.  That's that's fine.  I love Matt.  But we'd like to get an executive like maybe Sergey or Larry or somebody.  No nothing.  They don't even respond to us.  But Gavin Newsom on his current channel, which has four viewers, not only does he not only  does he get Sergey, Sergey wears the glasses and gives Gavin a huge scoop because he's  not a tech reporter and lets him wear the glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And of course, I have a home.  I have a homebrew version I made myself.  Yeah, let me see.  All right. Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very scared now.  He's got the phone taped.  And by the way, it's an original droid, I might add, taped to his glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My wife is is 37 weeks pregnant and she made me go see what to expect when you're expecting.  Oh, dear. You need the movie.  Half is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Half is J.Lo.  Half is bad. Yeah.  Which half?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Prop comedy here on.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are prepared for that.  This is the carrot top of information policy.  I tell you.  Wow, I'm impressed.  So I don't even you know, this is the problem is Sergey is not going to come on a show like  this, because then if one of us wears these glasses, we'll have something to say about  it. But apparently he could he swiped him.  To scroll, apparently, we don't know.  Gentle caress of the temple, a gentle caress of the temple to scroll through the pictures  and then the supposition is the down swipe took the put the gallery away.  He apparently took a picture, but it's not clear how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like that wasn't clear. And also, I don't understand.  We had the glasses over to Newsome.  He was still manipulating the cursor pad.  Yeah, he see what was on the screen.  You know, it's been something in his pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's clear. So it's not projecting.  It's I think it's an it's a it's a clear LCD screen.  So he could probably see it on that.  He could just probably see it in reverse on the other side.  I guess we can watch a little bit of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was it was just it was just the frame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is from Current TV, the Gavin Newsome show.  Gavin, we got the way.  Gavin, Gavin is the lieutenant governor of California.  So I'm glad that not only is Gavin scooping me, but he's getting paid by the state to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it. He is really good on Up All Night with with Christina Applegate, by the way.  He's got a lot of personality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've always liked I've always liked Gavin Newsome.  Are we not getting audio on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Doesn't he look like Job from Arrested Development?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He does. Oh, I get it. That was the joke.  I thought he actually did work on Arrested Development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I picture of you and you're making eye contact with me in the picture.  You know, if I had whipped out a phone, you know, like this and then this  like would have been very different.  Yeah. Well, I don't know. You're not making that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll email it to you after.  So you're able to mean so literally you're able to see the image you just photographed.  Yeah. Yeah. Right back on it.  What does it reflects on the?  Let's take a look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is the first non-Google executive to ever wear the glasses.  You don't have to somebody says the Trey Radcliffe.  No, no, no, no.  There was a prop Google glasses they had at the G plus C conference that everybody was wearing,  including Trey. I believe those are props.  These are actually working ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or so says Gavin Newsom, if we can believe them.  That's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here, that's that's me.  See that? And you zoom right in.  Yeah. Amazing. Yeah.  So this is I mean, so this is something you guys have been working on at Google for how long?  Yeah. Now he's going to ask the hard questions.  So, you know, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Gavin Newsom, for nothing.  Sergey, I challenge you.  Come on this show and show us the glasses.  Let me wear the glasses just for five minutes.  Was it an Android operating system?  You know, he I guess he didn't get to control it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you want to borrow my my homebrew version,  you know, I'm the I am the talk of the town walking in downtown D.C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  with these. I bet you are like I do.  Project X glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I dedicated myself to information diet X labs.  I'm trying to really see the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe we'll be you know what?  This is the hope we're going to Google I.O.  When is that next month, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, in a couple of weeks.  Right. Yeah, the 27th of the end of next month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm still hoping they'll be under our chair.  But Sergey implied in that interview that wouldn't be till next year at the earliest  that we would even you're going to get a tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds like we're going to get nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I think I'm supposed to stay here.  I think they're making me stay here. Really?  Yeah. And Jeff, you're not going after all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't family health thing. I'll explain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's quite all right.  And I think Jason Howell's going from our TNT show and all about Android, of course.  So. Will you bring my tablet back?  Nexus tablet pops up on the benchmark site.  According to Android police, the tablet named Nexus seven.  Looks to be a quad core Tegra three.  Seven inch, much like the Asus, I believe.  Is it the Asus that they're saying it's the same?  I think it was. I think it was.  It was a basis who helped build it.  It says manufactured in the in the device.  It says manufactured by Asus.  Seven inch, 1280 by 768.  That's a nice resolution for seven inches.  With the next OS.  Yeah. Quad core A9.  Clocked at 1.3 gigahertz.  NVIDIA ULA GeForce GPU.  Android 4.1J.  That's the Jelly Bean.  Peanut butter jelly time.  Which actually be interesting.  Maybe it's not 5.0. It's 4.1.  Not that that matters. What does that matter?  Why do we even care?  Why do we even care?

Transcript:  That's what's important.  That's what's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now that's what the journals said in March.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm taping that sucker to the other side of the glasses.  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seven inches is just about right to hide J.Lo's butt.  I'm sorry. God, I can't believe I went there.  Is she actually expecting  or is that just the name of the movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is the name of the movie.  But my wife is expecting.  June 19th is the due date. Any day now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's great. And you've read the actual book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I don't know how to read.  Oh, that's a great book. Thanks for bringing that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know how to write.  Of course. That's how you go on an information diet.  Illiteracy. Sure.  No, Every Future Parent.  You read that, Jeff, right?  Oh, yeah. Oh, God, yeah.  What to expect when you're expecting.  I don't know how they make a movie out of that.  They only do it for the first kid, though.  Right. Second kid is like...  It's not...  Somebody told me changing a diaper,  not exactly a steep learning curve  or maybe not a shallow learning curve.  I guess it would be a quick.  Sources speaking to Techno Buffalo,  which is apparently a blog of some sort,  indicated the tablet would be made by ASUS.  This is coming from Casey Johnston  writing in Ars Technica.  Would be priced at $200  and would be announced at Google I.O.  Didn't they give us a Galaxy Tab last year, 10.1?  Yep, they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a special Google I.O. edition, though.  It was the one that bricks every three months,  like as a feature.  I gave that to a visitor the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like we'll get the hardware samples  of the new device.  So we'll get the early...  The ones that brick.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, you're a developer. Deal with it.  Yeah, I'll tell you. Hey, I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the whole point is that they want developers  to start making their Android apps tablet-sized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For people who say,  hey, you guys are getting free stuff,  it's not good free stuff.  It's kind of wonky free stuff.  It's for developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The day that it happens, though, everyone,  you can feel the jealousy on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never got that 4G MiFi card to work, ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you? Oh, really?  Yeah, mine worked for a little while.  Well, it expired. It was only a few months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe that's why. I didn't use it, and then it expired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm still getting bills from Sprint,  from my Evo 4G I got two years ago,  even though I haven't used it in six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's another thing, is if you get a phone, then...  Now, do you think there'll be a phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. I don't know.  This tablet is more than enough.  Yeah. What phone is there on the force?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The only phone that's coming out as soon as that Samsung...  What's it called? Three.  Why am I blanking on that?  Three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the Galaxy S3. I came out today.  The Galaxy S3.  I came out today, but it's in such limited supply  because they got so many pre-orders  that it is very difficult to get.  I got an email, because I ordered one from ExpanseS,  which is, they have their fingers in the pie in Britain,  and they said they hope that they can get us,  get it out to us sometime soon.  June 20th, it's believed, will be the ship date in the...  What carrier?  The US.  I believe it's AT&T T-Mobile.  Is it AT&T T-Mobile, Jason?  For the Galaxy S3, AT&T and T-Mobile?  All about it.  I don't have Eileen to ask anymore.  I have to ask Jason.  AT&T and T-Mobile.  Certainly T-Mobile, definitely T-Mobile.  I know there's T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So when I was in Seoul, I went to the Techno Mart,  which is floors of these booths selling stuff.  It's the second largest one,  and I thought I was going to buy a Note.  They were much more expensive there than they are here.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody, our IT guy, Russell Tammany, was in Japan,  and he said I didn't buy anything,  because it was more expensive,  because the dollar's so weak.  The reason Samsung is having trouble getting S3s  into people's hands today is,  apparently there was a problem with Pebble Blue.  Phone comes in two colors, white and Pebble Blue,  and the battery cover of the Pebble Blue didn't match.  I'll take a second.  I don't, you know, you found that out today.  It's like they opened the boxes and said,  oh, these don't match, send them back.  I don't, that doesn't, I don't get it.  Now available in the UK, France, Dubai, Saudi Arabia,  and some other countries in Europe,  the Middle East and Africa.  By July, 145 countries, 296 service providers.  They already have preorders of nine million.  It is widely agreed this will be the most successful  non-iPhone ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The features do look pretty good.  I was dubious, but when I went through the Samsung site,  through the list of features,  screen after screen, it's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they have a new pen.  It's not the S Pen as it is in the Galaxy Note.  It's now the C Pen.  I think C, what letter do they pick?  C.  It's got a good size screen, pen tile,  which I'm not crazy about.  It has its Siri.  It does, it comes with a Samsung version of Siri.  It comes with a lot of those  kind of interesting customizations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It knows whether you're asleep,  if you're chatting.  It knows when you're sleeping.  It knows when you're awake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It knows when you've been bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That or good.  That or good.  And Samsung is launching a new music store  to compete with iTunes, the Music Hub.  That's what the world needs.  19 million tunes.  Yes, we don't have enough.  Another music store, oh boy.  The Music Hub is based on technology from M Spot,  which Samsung just acquired.  Users can store as well as buy.  It's one of those things like iTunes Match,  where if they don't have the song, you can upload it.  But they do have a lot of songs.  It's very much like iTunes Match,  in that it will scan and match the music,  but not upload it if they have it.  Nine euros and 99, what is it, pennies?  What is a mini euro?  9.99 euros per month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it sense?  Yes, it's sense.  Euro sense.  Euro nerd in our chat room says Euro cent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Music stores are so 2008.  I want app stores.  New app stores are the thing today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's so 2012.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true.  Well, Samsung has an app store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what I think would kill is bookstores online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Samsung.  Too much information, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Too much information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the new Apple refrigerator,  the iFridge is gonna be huge.  Let's start the rumor right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think he did say he's not gonna do a toaster.  We've got some actual news.  Tim Cook said that?  I think so, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're gonna get to that all things D interview last night  because that boy, that was the top story of the year,  frankly, I mean, this was like,  not for me, but just like the tech journalists  went crazy on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's his big coming out, right?  Like it's his time.  It is, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And apparently he held his own.  TJ Kang, senior vice president  of Samsung Electronics Media Solutions Center says,  with the new music hub,  we're bringing the joy back to music.  Thank you, Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's about-  I wasn't getting enough joy with my music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was gonna say, my music acquisition  has been joyless for so long.  Oh my God.  And now the Samsung is swooping in here to help out.  That's not too egotistical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're bringing the joy back.  And they say, we're gonna put the music hub  in everything we make, including the refrigerator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm bringing the ecstasy back to books  with the information diet, just FYI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Information X.  Just, you know, hydrate or die.  That's all I could say.  They are gonna have a scan and match cloud locker,  100 gigs of storage for unmatched songs.  That's a good amount.  19 million songs is as big as any of them, I think.  They are gonna do radio, Pandora-style radio.  They have a recommendation engine  that is every bit as good as the Apple Genius.  I'm glad they're aiming high.  Optimized for mobile, web player.  So they didn't have to make this a smart idea.  They didn't have to make desktop apps.  They just opened the website.  But you have to have a Galaxy S3 phone.  Oh, also there's Flipboard for Android.  And then the first appearance of Flipboard for Android  will be on the S3 as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this-  Why they've been so, I mean, they make a big deal  of being slow and doing it right.  Flipboard is one of the few, some will love it,  but I haven't used it in a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I use it every day.  But you don't use an iPad.  Do you use an iPad?  Yeah, I do, no.  It's kind of how I browse my news.  And you know, they've added audio now,  which is kind of cool.  You can listen to fresh air while you're browsing.  That's interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So-  Oh, I got the new Logitech keyboard for the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, did you get that?  Isn't that nice, the ultra thin cover?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's nice.  It's one thing, right.  So it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're all buying those, Jeff.  Everybody's flipped over those.  It has the magnet, right?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Ah!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You need to tape that to your glasses, I think.  It's just the right size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, that looks really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, Jeff, you muted your mic.  The falling iPad muted you.  No, he broke his mic.  Okay, no, it's okay.  Oh, good.  Right back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it has a magnet in this-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's supposed to be able to pick it up.  Well, there goes the Logitech sponsorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What a brilliant design.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm gonna re-box this thing.  So you could pick it up like this, which is nice.  The problem is, so there it is closed, right?  And now what I wanna do, I wanna use this as an iPad.  I wanna go like this.  But then it just goes slippery, slidey.  It doesn't go away.  That was a really great product by Moen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you certainly demonstrated the slippery, slidey part.  Definitely.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Next time, no, I'm not gonna say anything.  So I got an email from Expansis,  which is the British company that I ordered the Galaxy S3.  See, now I've said all those things,  you realize now I have to have a Galaxy S3  because I have to demonstrate all of this stuff  on the show, right?  Right.  That's for IRS purposes.  As you may already know, Samsung has delayed the launch  of their highly anticipated Galaxy S3.  As Samsung has stated, there was a manufacturing issue  on the blue units where the battery door color  did not match the color of the device itself.  As a result, there are only a very small number  of white devices being allocated to retailers in Europe  with US allocations to follow.  What did you order?  White.  Blue or white?  White.  Thank God I had the good sense not to order the pebble blue  because the pebble blue just looked like gray to me.  Yeah, the white looks nice.  White look, you know, I'm doing all white now.  This year, the year of 2012, white is the new black.  All my, and then I'll know,  I'm gonna have a different color every year,  so I'll know, oh, that was this 2012 pile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I wonder what the UI is gonna be like  with the Samsung hub as a default music player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I don't, that's a good question.  You mean like for the music hub, yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, like as the, you know, when you wanna buy a song,  is it setups that you immediately go to the Samsung site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good, let me look on the note.  That's a good question.  I guess it must be.  Right?  They say it'll work fine with iTunes.  I have, because I have the Galaxy Note with 4.0  and TouchWiz 4, I have the Samsung music app.  They call it a music hub, in fact.  So let me just see if, oh, wow,  looks like I've got a new user agreement.  Maybe I am getting the special top tracks, new releases.  Yeah, this is a store.  Seven Digital, this is it.  So I guess they turned it on.  So what should I buy?  The new garbage album?  I think so.  I feel such joy.  Such joy for me.  My joy has come back.  A dollar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  your credit card number.  I mean, do they have your payment details?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, let's buy it.  It's $5 to buy, not your kind of people.  Not, oh, you have to have a Samsung account.  Oh, jeez.  You have to have a Samsung account.  So take it off of me,  because I think I made a Samsung account,  but I don't want anybody to know that my secret password  is string cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's basically gonna be what Amazon does.  Yeah.  Replace the store with their store.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just when I need another store.  But you know, what it didn't say is what the format is.  I presume it's MP3.  Is it AAC?  I don't know.  And I presume it will work with the,  they said it'll work with Amazon Music and all that stuff.  Let me see if I got the right password.  I've never used my Samsung account.  Nope.  Well, I'll have to try to remember what that was now.  But yeah, that looks like, so there you go.  So you don't have to have a, it's here now.  Does anybody have a official Samsung,  like a Galaxy S2 that they, can you look at any of the,  just curious chat room.  Have you got the store yet?  Look on your, would you look on your special Google goggles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's not here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I've got the Nexus S here,  but that's not gonna get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, yeah.  Anyway, there you go.  So Flipboard, I don't have Flipboard though,  and that you'll have to get a Galaxy S3, at least initially.  To use.  I like Flipboard.  I'm surprised that you, well, it's a little magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's fine.  Yeah, it's fine.  I just, I just.  How do you check news?  What do you do?  I use the New York Times app and then I go to sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still see the whole thing.  Do you do, maybe you're on an information diet.  Yes.  Clay Johnson.  I'm starved.  Published by O'Reilly Company.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also use TechMeme.  You still use TechMeme?  You still go to TechMeme?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  I go to, what's it called?  What's their media version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, MemeArandom is good.  Media Gazer, brother, yeah.  Yeah, I like Media Gazer, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the woman who does that is very good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're gonna take a break and we will look at what is,  what owns TechMeme this morning when I got up.  Tim Cook at the D Conference,  article after article, bit by bit.  Everything he said parsed a thousand ways from Sunday.  We'll let you know what it means.  Also, Google Places is gone.  I was, I woke up to find Google Places gone, shocked.  Google has made it now a part of?  Google Plus.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shocking.  Oh dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look forward to discussing that with Leila.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I can't wait.  First, a word from our friends at Citrix.  Gina Trapani is here, Jeff Jarvis, Clay Johnson,  author of, in case you didn't know, The Information Diet.  I'm not paying you.  No, I like giving plugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, he's good.  He's very good at that.  I challenge you though to make an Information Diet glasses,  Clay.

So Tim Cook, they saved it.  All Things D conference is going on right now  and it's in the LA area, right?  It's, yeah.  Usually it's in New York, isn't it?  Is this New York?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, it's always in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  West Coast, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  So they saved Tim's appearance to the evening,  which missed the news cycle for the night,  but it certainly caught the morning news cycle.  I mean, nonstop.  Among other things we learned that a Google,  I mean, a Apple, iPhone, Facebook integration  was not out of the question.  He said, oh, I saw Cheryl in the lobby.  We're good friends, we're buddies.  So maybe Tim Cook has,  he said, we differ, each company has its own goals  and of course that's what makes life interesting,  but there's no reason we couldn't work together.  He said, stay tuned about Facebook integration,  which I thought was kind of interesting.  I think it was-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He also said that they missed the mark on Ping,  that like most people didn't like Ping.  He admitted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said, there are a few people who really like Ping.  He also said, and this may be telling,  he was talking, I think he was talking about Apple TV,  but that we try stuff and if it fails, we kill it,  which is interesting.  And the implication being that maybe Ping wasn't the thing.  Apple is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He said, Apple doesn't need to be social,  which I thought was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he's right.  I think that was a good lesson, a lesson learned  that they don't know how to do it well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apple is antisocial.  I mean, it defines the antisocial company.  Right.  Yes. It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one of the things he said.  He said, we're going to double down on secrecy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's your next book, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, every rule I ever write, Apple is the exact opposite.  And people say, well, how could that be?  And I say, if you're that effing good,  you can violate all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, only, yes, you're the exception that proves the rule.  So Dan Fromer writing at Read White Web said,  well, of course no new product announcements were made  because they've doubled down on secrecy,  but the way Cook was acting,  his illusions, his commentary about the TV business  and some nervous chair twisting suggested  he was hiding something.  That's exactly the level of analysis we're getting  because he's basically said nothing, right?  Right.  He said, stay tuned.  We might be doing something with, well, he didn't,  no, wait a minute, he didn't say,  Cook gushed about how Apple has great respect for Facebook,  how he thinks Apple could do more with the company  and even laid out a logical explanation  justifying why Apple should work with Facebook  and said, stay tuned.  So I guess that's kind of really an implication that,  yeah, we're gonna work with them.  When an ABC news journalist,  this is all Dan Fromer writing,  when an ABC news journalist asked Cook about Ping,  Tim said, I don't think we have to own a social network,  but does Apple need to be social?  Yes.  And he gave an example how Twitter is integrated into iOS.  We tried Ping and I think the customer voted and said,  this isn't something I wanna put a lot of energy into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, just like Larry coming to Mac and taking over,  one of the things you do is you clean house  of things that don't work.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Tim showed himself to be a CEO.  He can stand on his own.  He's rapidly leaving behind the shadow of Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He said in there that Steve said,  don't ask what Steve would do.  There goes my next book title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Carmine Gallows way ahead of you.  He's written like eight books on what Steve do.  He's a little cottage industry on Steve.  You know, I think he acquitted himself well.  He said the Apple TV business is still not very big,  even though it's doubled in sales.  And implied that it probably wouldn't be around  a lot longer.  The S in iPhone 4S stands for Siri.  He confirmed that like we care.  He basically said,  we don't have any real strategy for naming.  We just make up a name when the time comes along.  Kara asked him what the next iPhone was gonna be called.  He said, and does somebody else have a question?  He just kind of passed on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, WWDC is in 11 days, 12 days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We will hear a lot at WWDC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this wasn't his stage, right?  This was Kara and Walt's stage.  I mean, it's kind of refreshing that he was forthright  about things like Ping.  I mean, it's not news to anybody  that Ping didn't get big uptake.  Good for him.  But you know, he's gonna be owning what's going on.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you integrating Ping into ThinkUp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, she's integrated into Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I think that Tim can be pretty gracious  about Facebook at this point,  even though of course the story this week was that  a number of former iPhone engineers had gone to work  at Facebook developing a phone.  And I'm sure Tim's going, be my guest.  You wanna do a phone Facebook?  I don't think that Apple's too threatened  by a Facebook phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel like Facebook making a phone is just a terrible idea.  They're a software company that they should go  for all phones.  Everybody's got a Facebook app on their phone now.  Absolutely.  They're already in the phone, right?  Right.  The iPhone is a Facebook phone.  The Android is a Facebook phone.  That's what they need to be worrying about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nick Biltman writing in the New York Times this week  quotes a Facebook employee saying,  Mark is worried that if he doesn't create a mobile phone  in the near future,  that Facebook will simply be an app  on other mobile platforms.  Sounds great.  Yeah, what's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the funny thing is that Facebook gets a bad rep  for its mobile app, which I don't think is bad.  Google Plus mobile app, even the one on Android,  I don't think is very good.  The hilarious thing, not to jump way ahead,  but the hilarious thing to me is the company  I make the most fun in in life actually came up  with a decent mobile app today.  What's that?  Can you guess who it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute, the company he makes the most...  Chipotle?  Oh, NBC has a good mobile app?  That was bad.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  G-E-C, you know, that's the notes G.

Transcript:  Yahoo has a good mobile app.  Who?  Yahoo has a good mobile app.  Oh, Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That sounded like the NBC chimes.  I know what they are,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they're gonna Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy, that was bad.  He's trying to give you a hint.  So you like the axis, you like this axis browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, on a glance, it's really kind of,  it rethinks how search operates.  I'm at least somebody's even thinking,  it's the fact that somebody's thinking, Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what's really interesting to me is  is Yahoo doesn't even have search.  So I'm presuming this is using Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's even weirder.  But it's, you know, you look up Leo Laporte  on what's it called?  The, it starts with an A.  Axis.  Axis, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, here, let's do it.  Here, I'll show you.  No, I actually like it.  I don't know if I will ever launch it  because you already got a browser and it's doing,  but as you can see, the first thing that happens,  I don't know how well you can see this,  this is on an iPhone, is I looked up Leo Laporte  and it puts up thumbnails of all the pages  and it's accurate, by the way.  Associate with me.  These are all accurate.  It's got my Twitter feed, Wikipedia, the KFI page,  the Twit page, and my personal blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go to Leoville, go to Leoville, put on that.  Yeah.  So now it's gonna launch it in a browser.  And now you can move down the screen  and your search results are still there.  Oh, if I scroll down, right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of nice, this thumbnail.  You know, you're right, actually, I'm gonna say,  yeah, kudos.  This is a nice-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's all I'm saying is, you know,  I'm not sure why mobile is so fluxing.  Companies as big as Facebook and Google  and that Yahoo of all companies,  they're a decent mobile app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That amazes me.  Well, Yahoo still has some good people there, right?  There are a lot of good people there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Google does this thumbnail preview  in their search results, right?  That nice pull down when you choose that,  that I really like, but the thumbnail preview,  that's not anything too new, right?  I mean, Google does it on the web page,  on the google.com web page.  But they don't do it on mobile.  But yeah, here's the thing, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they made it the schtick for mobile  so that they use what's appropriate,  that a list on mobile isn't as good  as something you scroll through.  You swipe, right.  Yeah, you swipe through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Piece of trivia there.  I am the inventor of the patent,  the software patent, and I did it for Ask Jeeves  of thumbnail previews of web pages and search results.  Dude, you ought to be suing.  No, I'm the inventor, not the assignee.  The assignee is Ask Jeeves,  which probably does not know that they have it.  Until today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just created a huge opportunity  for whatever remains of ask.com.  So you're an engineer at Ask, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I was their syndication and distribution engineer.  My job was to take Ask Jeeves search results  and put them on weird places like dictionary.com.  That's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm searching for Leo Laporte,  and you're saying, Gina, that there's thumbnails?  No, I don't.  This is the Google app.  I don't.  The Google added this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or maybe it's image search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I remember.  Maybe it's in the image search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, it did just work for me.  Yeah, Google does it for image search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have the thumbnail stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me do images.  Yeah, you have to tap on,  so I'm looking at just regular search results  for Leo Laporte, the list of blue links,  and then there's a little magnifying glass  kind of next to one of the links.  If you tap on the magnifying glass,  then you can swipe through the web pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, the thing that Access does that's good, though,  is it makes it so that you don't have to do that  search, look, don't find what you want,  go back, hit the back button,  go, you know, that sort of rinse, rattle, repeat stuff.  And that's good, but I think it's gonna take  a lot more than that to really compete with  the Safari browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I was ready to just make holy hell fun of them today  and say, I'm fun.  Another search engine, another, well, yeah, yeah.  But, you know, give them credit where it's due.  And it does sync really well

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  amongst the different platforms, too, which is good.  Oh, that's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, let's give them credit, then.  I mean, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're doing something.  So back to Facebook and the phone,  you know, I think that's a sign of being flummoxed by mobile.  Right.  Well, what's going wrong?  Okay, we'll make a phone then.  Right.  This is where I think Facebook should buy,  should go ahead and buy Foursquare  and get some good mobile developers there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of which, Places is now Google.  So now I have, okay, so.  It's no place.  I have a Twit LLC entry for Places in Google Places.  It is now.  It's a Google Places.  So now it's no longer in Google Places.  It's in Google Plus, it's a Google Plus page.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With Marissa Meyer making the announcement.  Oh, because she's local.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's local.  She's local.  And there's a new button in Google Plus that says local.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But not for my browser, it wasn't.  Oh yeah, it's hidden under more.  I couldn't find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I moved it out of more.  You know, they have this extra stuff down here.  So I moved it out of more and put it up top.  I don't have it there.  You don't have it, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you just go to plus.google.com slash local,  you get to it though.  Yeah, that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then it made me sign it.  Then it did this whole sign in again bozo thing.  Right, they did do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is so atrocious.  Of all the information out there about local places,  the thing that Google can do  is tell us what restaurants to eat at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the main thing I'm getting is restaurants.  If I scroll way down, I get bridal shops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the other announcement that came out  is that the Zagat is now free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This I kinda like.  Yeah, and Zagat's built into this.  So if I'm seeing Chinese restaurants, not Zagat rated,  here's one that's Zagat rated.  I could see the Zagat rating for food and overall.  No, no, it's on my computer.  And that's free, yeah.  Although they haven't made the app free yet.  It's still $10.  But I think they're gonna, I don't know.  I mean, but you don't have to,  I've been paying the 30 bucks a year for Zagat.  I love it.  It's worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As Matt Cutts said in a tweet to me,  the great thing about this is that  it'll probably also encourage being free  more people to contribute.  Right.  And so it will make the asset more valuable.  It's a virtuous circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unfortunately, it is their restaurants,  bridal stores and stuff,  but I don't see anything that would include Twitter.  So you'd actually then have to do a search for Twitter  to have it show up here.  And here it is.  And then when I click on this,  this is, we now have a page.  Wow.  That's our Google Plus page instead of our Places page.  And this is all the data that was on Places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that happened all automatically, Leo.  They took the data that you had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.  So Leo, go to Maps and search for Twitter  and see how it displays your page now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good.  That's a very good idea.  So let's look for Twitter.  That's the most powerful way to get to a Places page.  Right, that's how people are gonna do it most of the time.  So now I have a link.  I gotta fix the spelling.  And there you go.  And it still shows up as a pin  at just pretty much exactly as I had set it up for Places.  I did the whole Places thing,  but now when I click the link, it goes to Google Plus.  So it doesn't change the Maps presentation.  This isn't a huge loss.  It's really the same content in a Google Plus format.  And people can like it here.  Now there's a plus one.  They can reshare it.  They can add pictures.  I think this is okay.  I could live with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got a great score.  Is that the Zagat score?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, my Zagat score, 29 out of 30, baby.  We have the best food here anywhere, 124 reviews.  29 is extraordinary to perfection.  How about that?  Boom!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm just, I'm incredibly disappointed by this  because I just, I was at a conference last week  and I gave a talk and I asked the audience  two things in a row.  It was in Canada, so they were extra ashamed  because the Canadians are extra earnest people  to begin with.  So I asked, who is Kim Kardashian?  What is Kim Kardashian's ex-husband's name?  And everybody in the room knew the answer.  And then I said, what's the child poverty rate in Toronto?  And no one knew the answer, right?  And part of the reason behind that is because-  That was unfair, teacher.  Totally unfair.  But part of the, it's actually 39%,  part of the reason behind that is because  people like to hear about the Kardashians more,  but another part of the reason-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't, by the way, can I just say  I don't know the answer to either question.  No, I didn't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's great, I don't either.  But the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I totally did, I knew the answer.  I'll admit it.  Anyway, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Part of the reason is because we have,  actually Google is becoming an accomplice to bad news.  And the reason why is because reporters are using  Google Trends to find stuff to write to.  And they have this incredible opportunity  with local stuff especially to say,  here's local information about your community,  comma local reporter, comma whatever,  that you can actually now write to  and actually improve local news a lot.  If you search for Petaluma, California,  it should tell you way more than  what restaurants to eat at.  It should tell you who your representatives are,  what the police-  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Phone numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What the child obesity rate is,  everything about a community.  But the fact that the best that the internet can do  at telling people about their local communities  is what restaurants to eat at or what houses to buy.  No wonder we're obese and in debt  because we keep eating at restaurants and buying houses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if I do the new search knowledge graph  on Petaluma, California,  I do get the Wikipedia link  and I do get found at 1858 elevation,  29 feet area and all that stuff.  So I'm getting some information.  That's in the search as opposed to the places thing.  According to Marissa Meyer,  the recommendations you get in places,  the plus places, the new, what do we call it?  Local, the new local page, come from your friends.  So places your friends mentioned, so forth, just for you.  So I'm getting recommended places, Mystic Theater,  then places from your circles, Lagunitas Brewing Company,  then just for you, Dempsey's.  I mean, it's apparently these recommendations are coming  from my friends' recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's where the plus side really does come in  as it makes it social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's local plus social.  It's the classification of everything  and that's what I don't like.  But you raise an interesting point, Clay, which is,  but it's not Google's job.  In fact, Google's never wanted to be put in the position  of deciding what information you should know.  It should all be crowdsourced, right?  It's what people are interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, people search for restaurants,  ergo, Google serves up restaurants.  That seems completely fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In other words, should Google be making  an editorial decision about what people should know about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, if Google says that search is akin  to the New York Times, which they've said.  Yeah, that's true.  Then yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I don't think you want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the problem is that you can't have it both ways, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they do make editorial decisions all the time.  Matt cuts his job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  The decision they make is algorithmic as opposed to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's based on what we want  rather than what they think we should want.  And that's the same media prejudice  that Eli Pariser brings to this argument of saying,  well, I want these gatekeepers, I want these curators,  I want these editors, I want them to tell society  what they should think.  And Google is the opposite of that.  And it's a different philosophy.  And I kind of like their philosophy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel like what they're doing right now is saying  the only thing that's useful about,  only useful information about a community  is what restaurants are there,  what places are there that are popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't blame Google.  That's the audience saying  what people most search on locally.  And the thing I most search on locally,  I don't, I'm not, listen, I live in my community.  I'm not every day saying, hmm, what is the population?  I think it's a chicken egg.  I'm saying, where do I eat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's chicken and egg.  I think that's a chicken and egg argument.  Like you're saying you're using the internet because,  to do that, because that's the only thing  that's there for right now.  But if you look at, if you look at citydata.com,  city-data.com, they rank for every zip code  pretty much in the country.  If you type in a zip code,  they're at the top of the list on Google  for most of the zip codes in the country.  And it's a ton of data about local communities.  That's a different job.  Apparently it's in the top.  That's not a search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a media data site,  and that has a whole different job.  A search engine says- Oh, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So a search engine site is also,  a search engine's job is not,  is also not to help you book movie tickets,  but Google does it, right?  I mean, to- I don't,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm glad we got rid of the tyranny of editors  saying what we should know.  I'm very happy to be without that, and I was one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not, I'm not suggesting that Google  start determining everything  about what it is that we should know.  I'm suggesting that there's more that people want to know  about their local communities than restaurant reviews.  So, so hold on.  It's a huge gaping hole.  All right, so I go to Google-  And if it wasn't the case,  then city data wouldn't be in the,  I think they're in the top 1,000 websites  in the United States of America.  It's a crappy website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But when you go there,  you're sending a signal,  this is the kind of information I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and they're at the top for every,  for nearly every zip code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When people want that particular kind of information,  actually, I'm surprised they're at the top  because I didn't even know they existed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I type in Toronto childhood poverty rate.  Third listing is one day ago,  the UN ranked Canada 18th out of 35 industrial nations  with child poverty rates, right?  If that's what I want to know,  Google's going to tell me that.  Sure.  But if I'm looking for pizza-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess Clay's point is that the default is pizza.  Because that's what we ask for.  But I think if we all started asking  for childhood poverty rates,  wouldn't that start showing up there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, blame us, not Google.  Google's a mirror that's putting back,  it's trying to intuit our intent  and give us what we're going to ask for.  And the way it does that is by-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is an argument that's very familiar to me.  This is the exact argument I make in the book.  And it's an argument, I agree with you, Jeff.  It is, we are being given what we're asking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And TV, on media, everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Everywhere, that is the case.  We are in whole agreement there.  My only claim here is that as a user of this service,  I wish there was more than restaurant reviews.  I wish that a search engine  was providing more information to me  than restaurant reviews. But I think  of a local community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is it you call that box that brings up the Wikipedia?  What's the thing they call you all that?  The Knowledge Graph.  The Knowledge Graph, yeah.  Knowledge Graph.  I think that's their first step  in going to where you want them to go,  which is that they are serving up stuff  you didn't ask for that is  canonical knowledge about a topic.  And so I think they're headed the way you want them to head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is exactly why we should give  the United Nations more control over the internet.  So that child poverty stats will come to the top  of all Google searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh no, it won't.  Oh no, it won't because governments will say  we don't want to put bad news out.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good point.  It is, by the way, something the United States  House of Representatives is considering.  But I can't imagine that that's gonna.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that'll fly in a Republican Congress.  Yeah, I think that's not gonna happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Trilateral Commission will next take care of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, the UN conference coming up in December,  that's in Dubai.  They'll be voting on it then.  I think Dubai should be in charge of what's on the internet.  Okay.  This is the same argument that we get about television.  Why is television such crap?  But if you do surveys.  But it's not as bad as it used to be.  But if you do surveys,  people say, oh yeah, I love PBS.  I will watch Public Brack.  And they don't.  They just say they will.  And then what?  Then it's Desperate Housewives of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I see, all right.  Now you're making my argument for me.  In the days when we had nothing but gatekeepers  controlling TV, we had three channels,  we had Gilligan's Island,  which might be cute and campy now  when it's all you had kids.  Right.  It was awful.  It was pretty bad.  When we got more choice  and there was a better chance to listen to what we wanted,  we got better quality.  More choice yields better quality.  It's a paradox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's more niches.  It's like us.  We can do this because  we because digital technology's made it cheap enough.  The internet gives us distribution.  We could do something that's defiantly niche  that could never be broadcast on mass media  because too small an audience.  And there's probably too small an audience for,  look, Mad Men, only a million people watching.  Minus Jeff Jarvis.  And I'm not one of them.  And yet it's very culturally important,  but I don't think it would make it  on broadcast television  because the ratings would be too low.  Aaron Sorkin's new show is on HBO  because it's far too politically charged  to be put on the network.  So they'd never run it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and that and two out of three of his shows  have failed on broadcast television, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I rest my point.  Studio 60 failed.  Which is one of the greatest shows of all time.  Oh.  You hated it?  Oh, no.  Oh, it's a great show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually ran a petition thing  called save studio 60.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You and me, Clay, I'm with you now.  I'm on your side.  Throw this Jarvis guy off the show.  Doesn't like Mad Men.  I'm gonna go back to being a TV critic.  Beat it, Jarvis.  Beat it.  You're a TV critic.  It's your fault that we got all that crappy TV  in the 90s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To this day, to this day,  every once in a while, every six months or so,  somebody will come up and stir up the fact  that I gave Babylon 5 a bad review  and I'm about to get killed for it  by saying it with this audience.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I shouldn't have.  Either one of you should have.  Don't go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't go there.  I didn't like Babylon 5 either.  But I don't, see, I am on record as saying  science fiction on TV is a bad idea  because the budgets are too low.  And anyway, but that's, let's not go there.  I'm gonna get in trouble too.  I didn't like The Avengers either.  Did you like The Avengers, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Loved it.  Yeah, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was incredible.  It was Joss Whedon.  You can't not like Joss Whedon.  That's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not Joss Whedon.  It's Joss Whedon cashing in.  Big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're a sexist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  You're a sexist and a homo-tard.  If you don't like Joss Whedon, you're married.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Joss should be allowed to marry anybody he wants.  All right, we're gonna take a break on that note.  God, the sponsors are going,  please, Leo, can you have Gina read this ad?  Please, Leo, do not endorse our product now.  No, Leo, no, don't go there.  Cooties.  I've got cooties.  That's true, Buffy the Vampire Slayer  wasn't exactly high culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  Okay.  Are you out of your mind?  Now we're going at it because Buffy was a great show.  It was a great show.  And I know it was low budget and kind of insane,  but it was a great show.  It was a feminist show.  It was interesting show.  I had such a strong following.  I love Buffy.  I love Buffy, sort of like Angel, Firefly, Serenity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Loved Firefly and Serenity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, all right, so now we're getting somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, that actually contradicts my point  that TV sci-fi is bad  because that was very good sci-fi on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was, Dollhouse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't watch that.  I'm not interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dollhouse was a great show.  Sexist.  Dollhouse was a great show.  No, Dollhouse was not sexist.  It wasn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was, yeah, it was the opposite.  It looked sexist, but it wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looked sexist.  That's why I didn't watch it.  Because I'm a champion of females.  It was feminism wrapped in bacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was feminism wrapped in bacon.  It kind of was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  God, that sounds good.  I'm gonna have to watch Buffy and Dollhouse.  I didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you watched Buffy?  Have you given Buffy a deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I'm gonna admit, I saw the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no.  Which is horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was terrible, man.  Truly horrible.  Did Joss Whedon have anything to do with the movie?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Joss, no, no, no, no.  He wrote it?  That movie was total.  Okay.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then I think I might have watched the first episode.  I should watch it.  I'll watch it.  It's good.  for the old age home.  Because I know that when I get there,  there's gonna be shows.  Like Seinfeld, I haven't seen every episode.  So I'm saving it up for when I have time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dr. Horrible, you're a musical guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like Dr. Horrible.  I like Dr. Horrible.  No, I think a lot of things Joss Whedon did were good.  I just, okay, nevermind.  I'm just digging it deeper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are, you're digging deep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is bad news for you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Avengers had boring bits, admit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a crappy movie.  It was a comic book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It had fun bits, but it had boring bits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The fun bits were all just Whedon bits.  Like the Shakespearean moment between Loki and Thor.  Now that was good.  Yeah.  And then Iron Man shows up and says, what is this?  Shakespeare?  That was good.  And that was pure Whedon.  And Hulk going back and forth, that was good.  Oh, that was the high point.  Right, right.  Yeah, the way Hulk treated Loki was a high point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exposition up in the sky thing was just terrible.  Oh God, horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Horrible, I didn't even understand it.  The humans, we are, excuse me, the Thor and their culture.  Okay.  And it was, that's what it sounded like to me.  Ulster, Thor, kill them.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was, I took it to be like,  here are a bunch of really different characters.  They're evil.  I watched all the movies, kind of leading up to it  and all the different characters.  I mean, the fact that they were able to,  you know, have those characters interact in a way  that was kind of fun and entertaining and team up.  And the dynamics between them, I thought were good.  There were a few lines that were pure Whedon  that I really enjoyed.  Anyway, I'm, this is so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there were moments, what was nice is Joss attempted  to write each, like when it was Thor,  like this is like the Thor movie.  And Robert Downey Jr. really had Iron Man lines.  And so he was trying to follow the genre,  which I thought was kind of interesting,  an interesting exercise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought Black Widow was great.  Black Widow was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Black Widow was very good.  Rubber Suit Girl, she was very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The interrogation scene was fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was good.  That was total Whedon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where she says, I'm interrogating them.  Yeah, I'm interrogating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going really well.  It's going really well.  It's like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was, that was, that was class.  All right, all right.  That was straight up Buffy right there.  Yeah, 100% of the movie was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Straight up Buffy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  100%, admit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, I actually, you're right.  Now I'm trying to think of,  I'm trying to think of anything bad in the movie  and I can't.  So I think you're right.  I think I actually enjoyed it.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  What a great show that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You went 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you turned me around on this one.  Flip-flopper.  Yeah, I am a flip-flopper.  I'm, but I'm in charge of a Marissa.  So there, or whatever he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Immersia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Immersia.  It's good for Immersia.  With Immersia, time for an Immersial.  Hey, do you go to the post office?  Probably it's by stamps, right?  Or to bring packages in.  You know what I hate going to the post office  when I've got to do the international mail thing.  You know, you want to mail something to Canada or Australia.  I do a lot of mailing to Canada and Australia.  And every time I do it, it's like, oh gosh,  I got to fill out the forms and the whole thing  and the special postage.  You don't have to do it anymore.  Stamps.com eliminates the need to go to the post office  because everything you need is right here at your desk,  your computer, your printer, your special USB scale.  Stamps.com lets you print official US postage  and international postage right from your desktop  and with your printer, no postage meter.  I don't know.

Exactly the right postage because you got that USB scale  for letters, for packages, for anything you're mailing.  It is fantastic.  If you use QuickBooks, it'll take your Quick,  and you do an invoicing, boom, it's like a button press.  And it prints right under the envelope, by the way,  if you want.  You can have stickers or you know,  but you can also print the postage right on the envelope.  And it looks very professional.

Google complied.  But good news, if you're looking for Xbox piracy information,  there's a search engine called Bing that has it all.  They claimed a copyright violation  on 500,000, half a million infringing search results.  If you use this Google transparency tool,  which Techdirt did, they found those links related  to pirated Xbox content.  Microsoft asked Google to take them down.  Google did.  But they forgot.  I guess nobody at Microsoft uses Bing.  Oh.  So anyway, just a tip if you're looking for Xbox piracy,  you know where to go.  Gmail was down.  I didn't know this.  Did anybody have trouble with Gmail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I miss this.  I have trouble with Gmail every time I click on a message.  I'm bored of that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to play the grump now.  OK.  Every time Gmail goes down, people act like it's a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, now that I love Josh Whedon so much,  you are the focus of our approbation.  I like the Hulk.  Mark Ruffalo is a great choice for the Hulk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're the big brother of me.  I'm going to get my Hulk.  Don't make Jeff angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Don't make Jeff angry.  He's already pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My secret is I'm always angry, especially when  Leo says he doesn't like Joss Whedon's work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no.  I didn't say I don't like Joss Whedon's work.  You just said you didn't like the Avengers.  I like Joss's work a lot.  Actually, you're right, Jeff.  This is 0.11% of the users for.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Imagine if we did a, well, of course,  we actually did do a story every time Twitter was down.  But we used to.  We stopped.  We stopped, right?  So you know what?  Google's not perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The headline is Gmail was down for 400,000 users.  The headline wasn't.  Gmail was down for 0.11%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That sounds worse, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Hey, here's something you don't hear every day.  French court backs Google.  A court ruled that Google is not responsible for filtering  content on YouTube.  French broadcaster TF1, which, by the way,  broadcasts our friend.  What's his name?  He's my close personal.  Plaine Cren.  I can't remember his name.  I'm so sorry.  It's in French, that's why.  TF1 wanted damages for copyrighted sports and movies,  which were ending up on YouTube.  Claimed 141 million euros in damages.  They, in turn, ended up paying Google's legal fees to the  tune of 80,000 euros.  Same thing happened last year with Dailymotion.  So that's good news, right?  The defendant is not responsible in principle  for the video content on its site.  Only the users of the site are.  This is actually going farther than the DMCA.  Google has no obligation to police the content before it's  put online, as long as it informs users that posting TV,  music, concerts, or advertisements without prior  consent of the owner is not allowed.  Actually, I guess that's similar to the US.  TF1 is deciding whether to appeal the decision.  Did it get quiet in here?  Are you still thinking about Joss Whedon, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm still thinking about the Avengers.  I'm still thinking about all the reasons why Buffy was such  an important piece of content.  I'm going to watch it.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't say anything about Buffy.  All I knew about it was it was high school girls murdering  vampires.  I don't know how good it was.  It's not Loic.  It's not Patrick.  Cedric and Glenn.  Planet Crane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were in college too, just as an FYI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they were in college too?  It went on for so long they ended up graduating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right.  That's right.  At the end of the second season, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the vampires thing is weird, but Joss's whole concept was  like young girl and monster walking to a back alley and a  girl walks out.  Yeah, he's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I saw the pilot.  I think I saw the first one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I never judge a show on its pilot.  Pilots are always terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's always like a caricature of what the show becomes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sometimes pilots are great.  If you watch the pilot of the West Wing, it is absolutely awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the Studio 60 pilot was very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I have not seen Studio 60, so I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's such a good show.  How could you not like it?  You're too young for it, Gina.  No, it's not that long ago.  It was recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, oh, six or seven?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I was a critic then, I think.  No.  No, it was 2005, 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was recent.  It was actually like 2006, 2007.  Because I used the Blue State tools to run my petition site  and I got them for free because I was working at Blue State.  Oh, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's cool.  So Aaron Sorkin, by the way, who we were just talking about  because he's got that new news show,  has been tapped to write the Steve Jobs biopic.  I don't know if we mentioned that.  But remember how critical we were of his treatment  of the internet geek's technology  in the social network?  I wonder if he's the right guy to...  He seems to have some antipathy towards it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's not up to speed on technology.  It's not that hard to get up to speed anymore, Aaron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The good news is that there's a bit more factual source material  for Sorkin to work with here  than there was with the social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He said that the way he writes it  is as if Jobs is asking to get into heaven.  Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no.  Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sounds terrible.  That sounds like a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they're not going to have an angel named Clarence, are they?  Oh, jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This isn't the Ashton movie, right?  So the Ashton movie is a different one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is a different one.  The Ashton movie is just for the early years.  We're going to ignore the Ashton movie.  Sorkin, also speaking in All Things D,  said, I'm at the earliest possible stage  with the Steve Jobs movie adaptation.  It'll look more like watching ESPN,  which seems to the untrained eye  to look like watching college football.  It's a process of procrastination  where you try to figure out what the movie's about.  Walter Isaacson wrote a terrific biography,  but in making movies about these kinds of things,  it's difficult to shake the cradle to grave structure.  That's true.  He did that with the social network, remember.  In fact, one of the things that discombobulated me  a little bit, there was a lot of flash forward, flash back,  because they would do the trial  and then the flash back and then the trial.  He's looking to make an interesting structure  instead of just making a good movie.  So I'm probably not going to write a cradle to grave.  Instead, I'll probably identify the point of friction  that appeals to me, then approach that.  He says he didn't know Jobs.  One of his hesitations was that he was a little like  writing about the Beatles.  There are so many people out there  who know him and revere him.  It's true, it is a minefield for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hopefully when I'm done.  Like Josh Whedon draws Whedon for you, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now, Josh Whedon wrote the bio pic, that'd be good.  Or JJ Abrams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steve Jobs suddenly starts throwing people around  in medians, yeah.  Right.  That'd be the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If it was all, if it was written by Josh Whedon,  it would be told from the point of view of Jobs' daughter.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  True.  That'd be interesting.  Or that one engineer who stood up to him,  that one female engineer who basically stood up to him  in the early days.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So her name was Norma Ray, ladies and gentlemen.  Interesting.  Moving along.  Australia also giving Google a pass  on the Street View Probe.  They were thinking about a privacy probe.  After looking at the US decision not to prosecute,  they said, okay.  They dropped the case.  Ooh, there's a new Chromebook.  This is interesting.  It's a Chromebox.  It's a Chromebox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they're both.  Looks like a Mac Mini.  Yeah, they have a box and a book.  The price is still high.  The price is still $4.49.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's too much, because all it is is a browser.  I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  The new interface is really nice, I think.  I mean, it's got like a desktop background and Windows.  Oh, all right.  It's got really interesting window management.  The problem, it seems, is really that they're really suffering  from a still local storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but they're changing that.  You're going to be able to pin...  You're going to be able to store documents locally  and pin documents to your local machine,  so they don't die.  It'll have the N number of most recent documents  you've had open,  and then you can pin documents permanently.  And if they can get offline document usage  and offline mail and that kind of stuff,  I think the Chromebook starts to become somewhat serious.  But of course, then I said that before.  They've replaced the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you seen anything about Google Drive  with Chrome OS?  Is that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I presume that that's built in, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're pinning things within Drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Okay.  Replacing the Atom processor with a Celeron processor.  I'm surprised it's still around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, when I heard that too,  I was like, really?  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess they had some in a box somewhere.  Hey, we got some...  Joe, we got some of those Celeron chips in the basement there  that we had left over from...  Yeah, we could give you some of those.  Cheap.  12.1 inch display, 1280 by 800,  starts up in seven seconds, weighs 3.3 pounds.  Six hours battery life, 449 for the WiFi only,  549 for WiFi plus 3G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm surprised it doesn't have LTE.  That's a little disappointing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Google says it's two and a half times faster  than last year's models.  And then the Chrome Box, the Mac mini version,  three and a half times faster  because there's no battery issue.  That one's cheap, 329.  Of course, you need a keyboard, mouse and monitor.  I can see getting a Chrome Box for schools and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I was talking to another school  about working with them, let's put it that way,  and much larger than the one I'm at now.  And it occurred to me that we're very close to the point  where as a journalism student,  we require ours at CUNY to all get Mac laptops,  every student could use a Chrome Box.  And you could do all the tasks you do online.  Whereas we video, you could edit video online,  you could edit photos online,  you could certainly obviously do text online.  And it's very close to the point  where you could legitimately do that  and have an incredibly powerful tool for a very low price.  So compared to buying a MacBook, 449 ain't bad,  but for what you're getting, it still seems high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's still kinda high.  I wouldn't buy this yet.  I still can't get over the whole,  it just feels like just all I'm getting as a web browser  and browsers are free.  I think that starting up in seven seconds, awesome.  Not ever having to update my operating system, awesome.  But I don't think that that's what people,  when they're buying a new computer,  are thinking about, like how long is it gonna start up?  I mean, that's the kind of thing that does create friction  in your usage over time.  But you think like, how powerful is this thing?  What programs can I run on it?  And I think just getting that message across.  Like, this is just a browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I gotta update my Chromebook  because the Aura, I guess, was pushed out  to all the old Chromebooks as well.  This is the new windowing interface.  This might help a little bit.  Because I think it's not so much that it's a browser,  it's just that it's one full window.  Maybe if we can have windowing,  you think, Gina, that the appearance of a desktop  that might make you feel better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It feel a little bit more like a real computer.  I still feel like I'm paying real computer prices  for a browser, for basically a terminal.  Especially if Google's coming out with a $200 tablet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like, I'd much rather surf the web on a $200 tablet  than a $500 laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But is this for you?  Is this something where you can suddenly have  thousands of your employees using the machines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  I think it's about business and schools, right?  Business and schools, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because there you want constrained environments.  You don't want to mess around with playing games.  You want security.  I have to put Aura, you have to enable the developer channel.  I apologize for not having done this.  I have a Chromebook in the other room  and I will turn on the developer channel  and get an unstable release.  And we'll put Aura on there.  Next week I'll show you Aura.  It looks pretty good.  I mean, I think it's all an optical illusion,  but giving you windows and icons at the bottom  that say these are your apps might be sufficient.  They're-  It's somewhat ironic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it looks like Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's pretend like this is a computer with a desktop  and apps on it.  It's a play computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My first computer.  Google Docs is going to be enhanced  so that you can have offline editing  and they're going to bring that back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's June.  That's critical.  June is the rumor on that.  So that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then of course Google Drive implementation also.  I don't know.  I think this could be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One of the reviews was talking about  some of the limitations of this are,  you can't, if you're listening to music on it,  you've got to sort of hunt down the tab  that's playing the music in your browser  and then press the pause button in the browser  and stuff like that on your laptop.  And I think we take for granted  all the sort of shortcuts we have on our computers now  such that that's kind of stuff  that's going to be really inconvenient for the end user,  which is again why I think this is really about business  and schools and that's about it.  I can see decking out a school in school classrooms,  maybe not their computer science labs,  whatever of those we have left,  but decking out classrooms with Chrome boxes  sounds like a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, even better than decking out classrooms with them,  deck out students' homes with them.  Right.  You start to see the one laptop per child philosophy  starting to become possible  where you could have a truly powerful machine  that has the entire internet  with every bloody app and function  you could possibly imagine there now available.  You start to get that down to a price of 200 bucks or 250.  That becomes very, very powerful for education,  extremely powerful, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the sad part for me is that they're really not,  you're not going to give somebody,  they're not tinkering machines, right?  I learned how to write code in part  because I had a computer that I could tinker with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Neither is an Apple, is it Clay?  I think a Mac is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, in fact, Apple comes,  Caution comes with a free development environment,  Ruby, Perl, Python, it's all included.  I mean, it's begging you to hack.  Right.  In fact, why a lot of developers use Macs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A Chromebook is not.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the Chromebook does have that switch.  There's a terminal, right?  Yeah, and you can go in a crash,  yeah, the crash terminal,  and you can play with it a little bit.  You can have stage. There's no language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got bash, does that bash?  It's crashed. Well, how about HTML5?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's called the Chrome show.  So, Gina, try and check out ThinkUp off of GitHub,  make some edits, and check them back in on Chromebook.  I don't think you'll be able to do it  and have a decent experience with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you're speaking as a truck owner.  You want your car to be a truck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's exactly right.  But two things there is one,  when we talk about education,  for me, a very important thing to me  is that we don't have computer science education in schools  and we ought to.  And a Chromebook isn't gonna help enable that, I don't think,  or a Chrome desktop isn't gonna help enable that.  It's gonna be very hard for people to tinker  and write code on iPads and Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But schools have servers and you SSH into them  and you play at that command line.  You know what I mean?  I code on my iPad.  I just bought Diacoda, which has an SSH client.  It's not on the actual local computer,  but the good thing is schools have the network.  It's good enough for Bill Gates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His mom held a bake sale so they could timeshare  and have a terminal in the closet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, I mean, right.  When I was in college, we had a partnership with IBM.  We had these terminals going into the IBM mainframe.  God, you're older than I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, crazy.  Remember punch cards?  I used the mainframe.  No, not the little one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, last story and I know you'll all be relieved.  It's very exciting.  I just went to my Orkut page  and it looks like they're finally moving it over  to Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Link your Google Plus and Orkut profiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What am I gonna do?  What are the Brazilian readers  of the information diet gonna do?  How are they gonna get in touch with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  Are you on Orkut?  Good, let me add you.  Finally, I only have six friends here.  Clay A. Johnson.  Orkut user.  Now, here's one problem.  I searched for Clay Johnson and I got Tony Tai,  Melissa Meyer, Becca Gillespie.  None of these people actually have Tony,  I mean Clay Or Johnson in their name.  Oh, there's Melissa Clay.  There you go, is that you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's me with Howard Dean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With Howard Dean.  Oh, that's how old your Orkut profile is.  Jeez.  Look at how young I look, God.  Yeah, okay, I'm gonna say hi, Clay.  I'm gonna include you in no group and there you go.  So now when I move to Google+,  you'll just come right along with me.  Oh boy, that's it.  Push all, basically this is, we're linking them, baby.  That's it for Orkut.  Bye bye Orkut.  It's now Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the Atlantic did a great piece  on how Google should get rid of Google+.  That Google has created Google+,  in order to get more signals,  which is what Jeff has been saying this whole time.  But what they should do is take the communities  that they already have and sort of nurture them, right?  So like Orkut, what was big in, what, Brazil?  Is that? Yeah, Brazil.  Brazil and India.  I mean, YouTube had a really,  Arden has a really strong Arden community, Google Reader.  And like all these little communities are now being  sort of taken over by the, you know,  the classification of everything.  They're kind of retrofitting all these existing communities,  small communities throughout Google's products,  into the Google Plus structure.  And how that's really a bummer because, you know,  that's about Google trying to get standardized, you know,  structured data from all its communities, you know,  so that it could get better signals  and provide better search results.  And that the argument was like, you know,  Facebook makes social tools,  so that help to help people connect with one another, right?  Google makes a social tool  in order to connect with its users better.  So it was a really good piece and it reminded me  the Orkut transition.  Facebook makes everything Facebooky.  Right, well, I mean,  Facebook's whole approach was different, right?  Because it was a standalone product,  but the product was built with the idea of like,  people should be able to connect and share  more efficiently, right?  Whereas Google Plus, it's kind of the same mission,  but really it's like, we just, we wanna collect Plus ones,  we wanna know your social graph,  we wanna be able to give you better signals  and get you better content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was appalled-  Deliver you better advertisements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And better advertisements.  New York Times.  It's slightly different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't, well, I still like Plus.  I don't like- I still like Plus too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually like Plus too.  I don't know, these stories about how it's a ghost town  annoy me, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and the New York Times really irritated me yesterday.  I know I'm not gonna find it in the flash,  but they had a story about something around social  and they just did a slap,  parenthetical slap to Google Plus, you know, the still,  oh, I know, here it was, it was their Google Chrome story.  Ah, on my iPad.  Last thing I read before I got pissed off and I closed it.  And then dropped it.  It says here-  And fumbled it.  Stop doing it.  Turned into the Incredible Hulk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, it's an open question  whether the changes are enough to make Chrome,  which is also the name of Google's browser,  more than a marginal player,  but the system is impressive and designed to work  seamlessly with Google products like Android phones  and the parens still underwhelming  and parens Google Plus social network.  And that's in a news story.  And I found that was going over the line.  New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So much for the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Back up your own underwhelming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Paper of record, they probably didn't like  the Avengers either.  That's right.  We're gonna-  We're having too much fun and we've gone way over.  So we're gonna take a break,  come back with our tool tip and number of the week  as we wrap things up this week on This Week in Google.  But first a word from our good friends  at Ford Motor Company.  The Ford Focus Electric is finally here  at an EV certified Ford dealer near you.  You can find out more about it at ford.com slash technology.  Ford was, I admit there were others  that did electric cars sooner.  And I asked Alan Mullally about it, the CEO of Ford.  He said, look, we wanted to do it right.  We still wanted to really take our time and think about it  so that we could put electric vehicle technology  in all of our vehicles across the board.  They have plug-in hybrid and all electric vehicles.  The new Focus is out and it is amazing.  I mean, it is best in class,  most fuel efficient five passenger vehicle in America.  Best city rating in its class 110, 110 MPGE.  Best in class driving range 76 miles.  Charges in three to four hours on the 240 volt charger.  That's the best in class.  That's actually half the time of the Nissan Leaf.  They did it right.  They did it best.  And now it's here and I'm so excited.  I want you to take a look at the 2012 Focus.  You could drive it at a Ford dealer near you.  Take a look at the new in-car electronics,  the new MyFord Touch and Ford Sync updated  just for the Ford Focus Electric.  Really, really cool stuff.  The dashboard, I mean, you know what's,  the temperature of the battery,  the conditioning of the battery.  You can precondition to the car with your smartphone,  say, hey, warm it up, I'm about to get in.  The mobile app lets you monitor your battery,  but also schedule when the charge goes.  So you can actually charge it at the lowest rates.  Android, Apple and BlackBerry.  I'll tell you what, you're gonna be very happy  if you get a 2012 Ford Focus.  You will be joined the many people now  are just flipping over this thing.  Check it out, ford.com slash technology  or drive one in an EV certified dealer near you.  And then next year, early next year,  the 2013 Ford Fusion Energy Hybrid Plug-in.  Well, we'll talk about that next year.  I'm excited about that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't wait for that.  I can't wait for that.  I want one.  That's the car.  I was gonna get the Focus and I thought,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  oh, boy, the plugin would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I need one.  I wish they'd do the SUV one  because I need four wheel drive.  Well, stay tuned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you make that happen?  Well, what he told me is every car we make,  eventually every vehicle we make,  we'll be able to get it in gas, diesel,  electric, hybrid, plugin hybrid.  And it's the same line and they just change  as demand ramps up from one to the other.  This has been the problem all along  is you build a line for electric vehicles  and nobody buys them.  What do you do?  That's why Chevy stopped production of its Volt  because they made as many as they needed.  So what they're doing, it's very smart.  They can change minute to minute.  That's really smart.  They're making.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they also know how to use Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unlike a certain other company.  Unlike a certain other company we shall remain.  Oh, by the way, by the way, just on that note,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so GM dumped Facebook.  A story came out this week that said,  actually what GM wanted to do  was to do one of those huge obnoxious ad takeovers  of all of Facebook's gigantic ads.  And Facebook said no.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good for them.  I do want to replace the car key with my phone.  I don't have to use keys.  I can open up the doors to my house with my iPhone now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that'll loop to my car too.  Let me check that.  I bet you could do that.  You know, it's a push button start.  That's an interesting idea.  I like that.  With NFC you could probably just tap the dashboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see Clay just hitting a button on his face,  on his glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll make your car easier to steal.  There you go.  And those glasses, nobody's going to steal those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, he's turning left.  I just took your picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me see it.  Can you share that with me?  Our tip of the week from Gina Trippani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google voice users already know  that you can set up different rules  depending on what contacts, you know, who's calling  and what contact group they're in.  But Google voice just added two new contact groups  which are automatic and pretty useful.  You can say, follow this set of rules  for all the people in my contacts.  So you can say, you know, play my greeting  or forward any call from anybody in my contacts to this phone.  And that's just everybody  and that's already in your contacts list.  And you can also set up new rules for anonymous callers.  So people who don't, you know,  that your phone doesn't recognize the phone number.  So you can say, don't forward any anonymous callers  or give them the standard greeting.  So if you go into in Google voice,  if you go to settings and in groups,  in the groups and circles tab,  you'll see those two new groups,  anonymous callers and all contacts.  And you can set up a different call screening,  greetings and forwarding rules for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My, I have a call greeting for family members only  that says, I love you.  And Jennifer said, do you say that to everybody?  I said, no, I have a very sophisticated phone system.  I only love the people I love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's one of the best things about Google voice  that you can do this.  And I really wish that Gmail had this filter.  I would love if Gmail said, you know,  if I could say, do this with emails, you know,  with messages for anybody who is just in my,  in my Gmail address, anybody who I've emailed ever,  and you know, in the past,  I'm gonna assume that I wanna hear from them, right?  So do something special with them, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a spam, that's kind of a spam field.  I think we're gonna have authentication filters  where if this person's authenticated,  it's good if not put them in a suspect folder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we're gonna get rid of the phone number.  As soon as we can get rid of the phone number.  Thank God.  What would you prefer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody suggests the next book I should write.  I think the next book you should write is The People Diet.  The People Diet.  Too many people, there's too many people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's too many.  That's actually a cookbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To serve mankind.  That's for the guy in LA who was eating the face.  I know, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh God, don't go there.  Oh, ooh.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I was gonna go with 28.19,  which is the price of Facebook stock in closing today,  which by the way, gets the market cap down to 60 billion  and already bumped Zuck off the list  of the 40 most rich people in the world.  I'm not gonna use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not gonna use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually made my Google glasses with sold Facebook shares.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's a report that he didn't tip a waitress  in Italy on their honeymoon.  I think the problem was he just gave them a share of stock  and by the time she cashed in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I was only worth 28 bucks.  Hold on to that.  It's going back up.  I have faith.  Actually, this might be a buy signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The real number, I think it is.  The real number, because I like this a lot,  is that Stella's service did a survey  of how companies are using Twitter customer service  and out of the top 25 online retailers,  Zappos and LL Bean are the most responsive on Twitter,  answering 100% of customer tweets within 20 hours.  Wow, that's amazing.  Really impressive, I think.  Other top performers included Overstock at 98%,  Dell, my old friends at Dell at 98%,  oh, how they learn wonderfully, and Best Buy at 89%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My tool of the week, I'll just go quickly.  We already showed it on the iPhone.  Finally, Android has the Google Plus app that I...  Now, you said you don't like this, Jeff,  but I think it's just spectacular.  What it really does is highlights how good images look.  So it's pro images, but I think this is just a beautiful app  and I think they did a nice job on Android.  It especially looks good on a Galaxy Note  on that big format.  If you haven't updated your Google Plus app,  Android or iPhone might be worth doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like how when you swipe up, the bottom posts kind of fly in.  Isn't that elegant?  It's a really nice effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so elegant.  I think I'm watching a Hangout right here.  That's exciting.  Yeah, I think they've done a nice job of it.  Anyway, that is the...  Somehow I've gotten a YouTube.  Oh, that's because I joined a Hangout.  That's the new Google Plus app.  Very nice, very nice indeed.  All right, we're out of time, way out of time.  Thank you for being here.

She's on Google Plus, of course.  How could she not be?  Jeff Jarvis, the author of Public Parts,  available in your Better Bookstores right now.  You must read it.  I hope it is, God knows.  Not remained yet.  From Simon and Shusta.  And we really wanna thank Clay A. Johnson for joining us.  It was really nice to have you again, Clay.  Thank you for being here.  Thanks Clay, it was great to be here.  Informationdiet.com.

Transcript:  I love doing this.  Good, we'll have you back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't even have to...  Anybody who has props can come back.
