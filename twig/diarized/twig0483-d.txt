Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If Jarvis does not, she's got to, she's got to tell all the robots what to do. Yeah. Not a non

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  trivial task in a home like Stacey's. Jeff Jarvis, professor, professor of journalism. He's actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the Leonard Tao professor of journalism. I'm talking like that because I got a, I got a, a crown.  Oh, I love that. Do you have the temporary on right now? I have the temp on now. Oh, I hate that.  I'm running out of body parts, man. They're taking them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Buzz machine.com is where he blogs that other guy laughing. Why that's the famous Canadian,  Matthew Ingram. He writes for the Columbia review of journalism or Columbia journalism review. He's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  chief digital writer. You're, you're his suitably different, Matthew. Yeah. I'm a, it's a winter  thing or it's a play on. I have Matthew, I have the perfect thing for both of us. What's that?  Uh, I'll be, hold on. Oh shoot. I got to find a whole one second. One second. Oh no, where'd it go?  Where'd it go? Where'd it go? The punchline, the lights, the beard, the lights, the beard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Christmas lights in your beard. Yeah. I'm going to try growing like a big mountain man, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like, uh, I feel like I should grow. I got the gray beers on the show today. I should ask you tough

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  questions. Well, we're, we're, we're two old white guys in hoodies, black, black hoodies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There we go. Oh my, oh my. Oh no, please, please do not do that. I'm thinking about it.  Lights for your beard. But that means they flash. They flash. Yeah. Well, if you do that,  let me know. Cause I will send you the, I got those eyelashes. I never had the guts to wear them.  The light up. What are I like Kickstarter? Oh, that was one of one of Leo's best kickstarters.  Silly. Were they Christmas? I was still waiting for the unicorn that farts rainbows. That never  happened. They were, I don't remember. It was dumb. The sad thing. And I think I bet this  happens not is not unusual. They had it on Kickstarter. I put in some money and then of  course they were immediately copied by Chinese knockoffs, which you can get on Amazon for a  10th of price. I had to wait for mine. It was a bad, bad all around. Yeah, I got them. They're  just, they're called F dot lashes or flashes. Okay. Fine, fresh, fierce, interactive led lashes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They raised $113,000 some time ago. And they laughed at the bank. Have you ever worn them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. What would I do with these? Why did you buy them? I don't, I think we, I think we

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  embarrassed him to do it. I think it was one of those cases where, you know, because the game is  can we get Leo to buy something on the show? You still have not convinced me to buy a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I never bought a roadie. Maddie, I have some, I want you to get a roadie. Maddie.  The staff, you know, you know what I will not be getting? I know the staff does want the  roadie. Maddie, I will not be getting smart contact lenses that can tell my blood sugar.  No. Now my initial take on this was, and I actually mentioned this on the radio show,  once again, Silicon Valley over promises and under delivers. But somebody said to me, no,  this is, this is actually a good thing. Because unlike Theranos, Verily, which is Google's health  alphabet's health science division, once they figured out it can't be done, announced it and  said, yeah, we're not going to do this. Harder than we thought. Yep. That's totally unlike Silicon  Valley. Right. So I have to revise my initial disdain to say, well, at least they had the,  you know, the courtesy to say, nah, that we talked about this. Yeah. It turns out to be a lot harder  to measure blood glucose in your tears because it's not consistent, I guess. They thought diabetics  cried sugar, but apparently they don't. So this was something. Sounds like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sounds like a kind of dog ate my homework sort of excuse to me. Like why not just try harder?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, come on. It says in their posts, they're going to continue with other products. We remain  committed to improving the lives of people with diabetes, including through improved methods  for inexpensive and unobtrusive glucose sensing. This is the holy grail for health sciences,  is a way to measure glucose without a pinprick. And in fact, the apple has made a big deal about  how someday the apple watch will be able to do that. And no one has yet to be able to come up  with an noninvasive, the best they can come up with is constant monitoring with that little patch.  But it's, but it has little filaments that you inject. It's still, wait a minute. I think my  flashes are here. Where'd you get those? Put them on. You already own them and you didn't tell me.  That's father Robert Balliser in effigy. He's now at the Vatican. If the Pope saw this  father Robert, father Robert. So he already did this as a project. Is he, is he living in Rome?  Like at the Vatican? He overlooks really St. Mark's. What is it? Can we get, can we get like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  insider visits? Yes. What, what is he doing? Just being a priest. Last I heard. Okay. So father

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Robert Balliser is a Jesuit. He, we call it, we called him the digital Jesuit worked for us for  several years as a reporter and host of our shows. He's great guys, total geek. The whole time he  worked for us, the Vatican was pulling at him. At one point they offered him a bishop prick.  Wow. Right. But I think that's the right word. They offered him a bishop prick. And he turned it  down because he would have had to become a, not a Jesuit. It would have been a different,  whatever they call that brother or designation. Order is a good name.  And the, and the Jesuits are very, you know, they have some strict rules.  They sure do. Yeah. And the Pope is a Jesuit. So that's kind of the connection is that he's  one of us. Right. And so eventually, you know, at some point, if you're a priest, you can't really  keep saying no to Rome. If Rome wants you to go, right. They answer as, as the old, as the old  rye bread commercial say, or the old kosher hot dogs to a higher authority. Wasn't that the kosher  hot dogs? We answer to a higher authority. So the higher authority said, you're getting out here.  I think he's in charge of some sort of outreach kind of a thing. But honestly, I think what he  really does, and I hope I'm not talking out of school when I say this, but because he is relatively  young, I mean, they're all 80 and he runs the Twitter account or yeah, he's, he's actually  represents for them. And he's a geek. He understands. Yes. He literally runs social media and  he's, he's the guy they run stuff through to make sure that it's, you know, that's cool. Yeah. It's  a big job. Yeah. Very cool. And, but he was telling me he's such a geek that they had, they have,  is it called a conclave? They have an event. Yeah. The synod or something, when all the,  all the Cardinals and everybody get together and he's there, he's not a Cardinal, he's just a priest,  but he's there and they all speak Italian. So he said that languages of Rome are Latin somewhat  Italian and I can't, where is Francis from? He's Argentinian. So I think Spanish, right? Spanish.  Yeah. So those are the languages and his Spanish is very good. His Latin is Meza Meza and his  Italian is the weakest. So he took the Bing translator and put it on the table in front of  him on a smartphone and it would listen that he could kind of understand Italian. The Bing  translator would translate it and text. It was simultaneous translation. I mean, this is kind of  remarkable. It was good enough for him to follow what was going on. He could have avoided the 30  years war this way. Yeah. Although the last communication we have from him is I'm being

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sent off to study Italian. Well, it shouldn't be that hard. I mean, to speak Italian, you just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  speak Spanish badly. That's what I always thought. Or you add an O to an English word like airport,  though. Exactly. It's not that hard. Anyway, he's great. And he did say, if you go out,  at least he said this to me and listen, I'm sure it applies to you guys, that he will get you in  places that you know, awesome. They like the catacombs. Like the catacombs. Yeah. I wanted

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to go there last time I was there, but it was closed. Yeah. Plus I would just like to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Padre and have a nice pasta and wine with him and know that I'm talking to somebody who's in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vatican. That'd be just amazing. You won't have pasta with him. He said we eat spaghetti every meal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll go for sushi or something. Yeah, go for sushi. He'd be much happier. He said we live  within 500 feet of some of the best restaurants in the world and we eat bad spaghetti every day.  We'll get a hamburger. Oh, I could tell Padre's stories for a long time. Padre, if you're watching,  I'll take you out to dinner. We love Father Robert. We miss him and he'll be back in January. He  comes back for CES. He got permission to come back four times a year for Big Gut. I'll take him for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  steak Florentine. Have you ever had that? No, I've heard of it. So I made the mistake of ordering it  at a restaurant in Perugia and someone said it's a big steak. And I said, I like big steaks. You  know, I like, in fact, I'm a little upset that I haven't been able to get a nice big steak in Italy.  And they said, well, it's a really big steak. I thought, great. I like big steaks. It was probably  22 ounces. It had to be two inches. It's the whole porterhouse. Is it a porterhouse? It's the whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  porterhouse. So normally you'd get a two bone out of that. You'd get filet out of that. You'd get  ribeye out of that. The whole thing. And it serves with beans as if you needed something else.  And the cannellini beans and lemon wedges. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was there with Bobby Goche, who was I think the international editor at time for a while. Anyway,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  he also ordered one, which we should have just shared one.  Well, that's I've had these, but you have for two. Yeah. And they carve it up. Good idea. Yeah.  Good idea.  We have straight, far and wide. But that's okay. It's going to be that kind of show. And sometimes  it is. Squirrel. I got one. I got a good one. Let me take a break. And then when we come back,  I'll give you a good one for both of you, which is what's going on in Europe with the link thing.  You'll be talking about that for a couple hours. So let's get a commercial first.  It's time for a word from Slide Belts. This is a great holiday gift. I am like many people,  belts never served me very well because the problem with belts is that, you know, it's  basically caveman technology. Take a piece of leather, punch five holes in it and hope one of  them works. But the problem is, no, it's never, it's either too tight or too loose. Your pants  fall down or you can barely breathe. It's not a great solution. Slide Belts is a modern world  solution to an age old problem. How to keep your pants up. Slide Belts are a great gift for dad.  I'll slide down with you.  Yeah. See, because it's his twin. That's how you know, right? They don't have, they don't have,  by the way, this is the buckle and the belt come separately because they're in it. The belts are  interchangeable and they have all kinds of belts, everything from beautiful full grain and top grain  leather like this to canvas animal friendly vegan. So they call them straps because they're kind of  like watch bands. So what you do is you, you get your belt and you put it in the buckle and you  can get the buckles engraved. They come in a variety of looks. This is the chrome engraved buckle.  You see I put it in there and now it's, but these are easy to change. So, you know, you get, get a  buckle that says, you know, Twitter or whatever you want on it. And then I love this. When you  put the belt on, it's got these ratchets, 32 of them. This is a patented technology. Listen to the  sound. The belt now it's really good. It fits much better than a belt with just a few holes in it.  And notice that's when you're putting it on it goes, but when you're loosening it after a big  Thanksgiving day dinner, it's silent. So no one will know. They just hear this in the morning  and then they don't hear anything as, as the evening progresses. I love sly bells. 32  adjustments means it'll fit you better than any belt you've ever worn before. And because they  have so many different designs and styles, they're great for around the house at the office for  holiday parties. Let me show you another one. This is the, I love this one. This is the antique brass.  This is how they come to like in gift sets. So they're beautiful antique brass and this is a,  the Navy canvas. It's very pretty. There's one other buckle I want to show you. If you go to  thisslidebeltsplural.com slash twit, you can get 20% off your order when you use the offer code  twit. You might want to order. Yes. The survival belts 2.0. It looks like an innocuous belt buckle,  but should you be out camping and you need to light a fire or open a bottle or have a flashlight  utility belt looks like a normal belt, but look, there's a knife in it.  It's sharp too. There is a flashlight in it. It's very bright despite its tiny size.  And you can, this is a fire starter. So you can use a knife to set sparks on the fire starter.  This is literally, you could be lost in the wilderness with nothing but a belt.  You might look weird, but you'd be able to cook, eat,  hunt small animals. This is, this would be a great gift. A survival for, you know,  kids coming back from college, groomsmen if you've got a wedding coming up.  Slide belts by Brig Taylor are high quality, but they have a variety of prices. They have some  really nice gifts by the way in the gift set tab, but I have to tell you those are already discounted.  So the 20% off does not apply to those, but every other belt and they now offer watches  with similar swappable watch bands, which is really nice too. All slide belts come with a  one year warranty, free exchanges and no hassle returns. It is a great gift idea. Go to  slidebelts.com slash twit, use the offer code twit at checkout and you'll get 20% off your order.  It's not too late to shop for the holidays. I think Hanukkah is early this year, right? So  hustle over there. Slidebelts.com slash twit. So they tried it in Spain and it didn't work so hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In Germany kind of first. Did you know what that was called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shall we play the reggae? There is a song. Google news is now making noise that EU. So this,  I'm conflating this maybe with the copyright law. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's two parts of the same law. It's chapters 11 and 13.  I see. Okay. So article 13 would introduce the copyright. Article 11 is article 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When it's used to link tax. So the link tax, so news publishers in Spain complained that  Google was free writing on their content because in the search results they would include snippets  from the article, not the whole article, right? Yeah. And they said, well, we want, Google should  pay us for the use of those snippets. To which Google replied, fine, see ya and left Spain,  which meant all of those newspapers drastically lost traffic because you couldn't Google them.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff has read that also happened in Germany.  Yeah. So, so in Germany first, they tried to define a snippet. How much was,  was more than less than a snippet and they failed. They tried to do all kinds of things in the law.  At the end of the day, basically what happened was in the German law, they said that Google has to  have permission to do this. And Google said, we're, we're back. And so publishers tried to  withdraw the permission and not do it. They found after I think it was two to three weeks,  this was a disaster. They all gave Google permission. In Spain, Axel Springer said they lost

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  30%, 40% of their traffic. And by the way, no love lost between Axel Springer and Google. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  God, no, the access restart wars against Google. Yeah. They may be the number one enemy of Google.  They didn't allow any permission structure. They just said, you must pay. And that's what Google  said. No, we won't. We can't, we can't, we're sending new traffic. We're sending you people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we're not paying for content. It's not content. I want to, I'm trying to play the other side here.  It is their content in this snippet, but it's not like it's the whole article, right? It's just,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  in fact, Leo, one of the things I've seen research on is that, cause the argument is the snippet is  too long. It's too much content. The truth is what I've seen in research, what I've learned from my  own experiences, the longer the excerpt, the better the link performance. So what you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  as the publisher is that somebody clicks that link. Yeah. So the thesis is, well, if you put  the snippet, they're going to read the story and say, Oh, fine. I got it. And not click the link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which does happen. Yeah. Of course you see, if you see a headline that says,  Matthew Reagan grows beard. And I don't want to know anymore. I'm sorry, Matthew, than that,  yeah, I, I, I've learned everything I needed to learn. And the headline did that. That's been true  forever. It's like, well, it's walking back to the newsstand. You see a headline, you don't buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it what I'm seeing right here? I just searched for Khashoggi and in this search results for USA  today, there's the headline and then there's three lines with ellipsis. So they're doing some sort of  editorializing, right? This they're, they're snippeting. It's more than just taking the first  three lines of the article. I guess, I don't know. There's no, to go to, I don't know, check  it, click on the article. Right. So number one USA today, bright barred is number two, no ellipsis,  but three lines. Um, and then there's a hashtag news about Khashoggi. Go up to top Leo and click

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  on the news link. Yeah. For this story, the very top. I'm pointing to my screen as if you can see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it. Yeah, I get it. Right. So this is the snippets they're talking about. This is, this is more,  look how short those are. They're a sentence. Right. If that. Yeah. Cause they're all ending  with ellipsis cause they don't actually get to the period. So you get a little bit of the lead.  President Donald Trump acknowledged Tuesday, Saudi crime prince Mohammed bin Salman could have known  of the murder of ah, dot, dot, dot. Right. Just enough to tell you if this search result is what

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you're looking for. Yeah. And the truth is, the truth is the publishers are not as stupid as they  seem here. They're not trying to get paid for content. They're just trying to get any way they  can to get some of Google's money because they lost money by not offering advertisers a full deal.  So they're just trying, they're trying to blackmail Google or Facebook into paying the money because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  arms for the poor. And we should, we should point out, we should point out this has been going on  since 2006. Yes. So Belgium I think was the first one to complain. Um, but then it spread  basically throughout Europe. Spain was the first one to, to really put the paddle to the floor.  I think Google yanked the entire service, but this is a debate that's been going on for over a decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So by the way, I just went to duck, duck, go in the news section. They do the same exact thing.  Yeah. Yeah. Um, every search, every search engine does because the headline is probably not enough  to give you a night. And they do it by the way, if I search for a twit, they do the same thing  because the headline isn't enough to get, okay, this is why I don't like duck, duck, go.  I search for twit and what do I get? Man trapped in wild birds using glue and put them in cages,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  just like Mr. Twit. Come on. That's a relevant result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, these are ridiculous. Um, why did you do that? Why did I do what? Trap birds with glue?  Yeah. I didn't. No, I'm not Mr. Twit. I'm Chief Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Public urge to listen for twit to woo amid concern over tawny owl decline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ha! You did kind of take that word from the birds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the bird took it from me, but that's another story. So  twit hits the fan. Feckless twit. Adam Best-Skold's representative Scalise. Twit hits the fan.  Trump goes nuclear. Kansas City mom, an online hit after telling off prissy twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway. Anyway. So the eggs herbs, it's ridiculous to charge money for this. It's ridiculous on,  on its face. It's, it's what Jeremy Bentham called nonsense on stilts. I mean, it's just a ridiculous

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  argument. That's a good line. Nonsense on stilts. It doesn't, it's also, they have no leverage  because Google has all the leverage in this relationship, right? All Google has to do is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what they did to Spain. Well, and Google said you have a choice. If you're a publisher, you can  include something in your robots.txt file that prevents Google from indexing your site. And

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they're not doing that. Problem solved. So, yeah. So, so that is another answer.  Nevertheless, this is probably going to become the law, right? This new copyright law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's headed rapidly there. Yeah. It seems that way. Yeah. And, and, and, and that's our article  11, right? Matthew's article 13 is also dangerous because it's the one that's aimed at YouTube  and makes the publish. It takes away all the safe harbors and makes the publisher responsible  for anything that's put up that might have copyright. And so publishers, so this is going  to kill the meme. This literally is going to kill the modern day alphabet of the meme

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because like the DMCA didn't exist. There's no protection, anything that's even remotely  copyrightable. You have to prevent it from being uploaded if you can, not just take it down  when someone says it's copyrighted, but prevent it from being uploaded in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's YouTube's response, response, hashtag save your internet.  Article 13 is written by the European parliament. Oh, wait a minute. That's a snippet. I'll just  leave that out. By the way, we do snippets too. Yeah. And we don't have, we don't honor robots.  Text. So Google's in a better position than we are. Is this going to pass? Probably. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It seems that way. And so, so Google is, he started off the, the, the snippeting here.  Richard Gingras, the senior vice president for Google news was in a European tour this week where  to his friends, he was putting up photos of him eating oysters on the sand. But to the world,  he was saying, you do this. I pull Google news out of Europe. Google search results, Google news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He didn't say he would. He said that Google would consider it. If this happens, it would be a shame

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  if something happened to your nice news index. You got there. Yeah. Yeah. Now mind you,  because of GDPR, the general data protection regulations, if I, when I was in Europe last  week, I tried to read the LA times. I can't. So a lot of publishers shut off because they don't  want to go to the effort on GDPR. And it's not worth it. It's really not worth it because they  have no way to monetize European readers. So screw them. So the web is Balkanized not from China,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but from Europe. I think one of the risks with particularly with the copyright end of it is  there is in the US and in other countries like Canada, the term fair use or in Canada and  Britain, it's called fair dealing. A sort of clause that basically allows you to use copyrighted  works in certain ways for artistic purposes, for education, for criticism. Effectively, this  copyright regulation would make fair use or fair dealing not exist. So you would not be allowed  to use any type of copyrighted content, even a tiny, tiny bit for some alternate purpose,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  like artistic or education. Or comment or satire. Right. Or promotion. This throws fair use out of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Europe. Oh, yeah. Pretty much. So, you know, and I mentioned this a couple of weeks ago when we did  the Apple, the live stream of the Apple event, which we do every time Apple has a keynote,  we stream the keynote and comment on top of it. And our defense is that's fair use because it's  for commentary purposes. And as you may remember, YouTube got a takedown request from Apple,  not to take down the edited video, but to kill our live stream, which killed our live stream for two  weeks. We defended it. We said no, it's not. And Google said, okay, well, if we don't get a response  from Apple in 16 days, you'll be back up. So two weeks later, we're back up on YouTube live.  Oh, yay. Well, it's still scary. It's terrifying because it definitely has a chilling effect  because Apple could take us down for two weeks basically at any time. And that's a punishment  because it's not just the Apple event. It's in our entire live stream on YouTube live for two or  three weeks. And so that's a significant burden. You should be able to go for Apple for restraint  or train. Well, our defense is it's fair use. Yeah. So in Europe, Apple could do the same thing  and there'd be no defense. You're done. Right. You would have no appeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hmm. And I think the it's interesting. The last time I looked at fair use in the US,  there was a ruling that I'm trying to remember the name of it, but effectively said that companies  like Google or Apple or Time Warner have to consider fair use before they make a claim.  Not later have somebody say, hey, that's fair use. They actually have to actively consider it.  And if it's shown that they didn't, that can basically ruin a case for them.  That's kind of it. That's pretty strong protections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. That's unusual because really my understanding of fair use has always been it's a defense so that  they can stop you. They could shut you down. Your defense when you go to court, your honor,  this was fair use. And then the judge has three different criteria they're supposed to use to  Four. Four different criteria they're supposed to use to, you know, how much of the material was used,  if there was a loss of value to the company, things like that.  Transformative change.  And so then the judge rules. So the fair use is a defense. But this sounds like it's a little  bit more now, which is good. They're strengthening it in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why this decision was important because it specifically said you can't just take everything  down and then wait for somebody to claim fair use. You have to actively consider it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is part of the problem is this the internet's so global. As goes the EU to some degree,  so goes the rest of the world. Whatever the lowest standard is, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the risk. I mean, you've got, you know, the EU is a lot of countries. They are maybe not as  economically important individually as the US, but together, that's a pretty big market, especially  if you want to expand outside of the US. And so maybe, you know, some companies might decide,  well, we just won't have anything to do with the EU, but that's not a choice that a global company

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  can make. So what so YouTube, I mean, this is what Google has always done is they have different  rules. This is what GDPR did. Although you can see how GDPR leaks, in this case, in mostly good  ways into our lives in the US. Facebook, for instance, has to offer a feature at least to  people in the EU to delete their data from Facebook. And most companies like Facebook just say, well,  we'll make this available to everybody. That's, is that distracting having a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,  I'm hypnotized. I should probably take that. Only a little. Father Robert is blinking his  antenna on me here. So, well, and it's, of course, we have no say about this. According to the Guardian  article, the, the proposals were overwhelmingly backed by members of the European Parliament in  September, but Google is hoping to influence the European Commission and EU member states

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  before it's confirmed. And the problem here, of course, is that publishers and media companies  are using all their political capital to try to get this passed. This is protectionist legislation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, I will continue to follow it. It seems like it's, it seems like the news is worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and worse, however. And I think in a way, you know, that and the link tax and both the theme  that sort of runs through them is lots of big publishers, music companies, sort of content  owners feel like they've been getting ripped off since the internet was invented. And so  all of these things are ways of them trying to claw back some of the money that they feel Google  and Facebook and other companies are making at their expense. Which of course is not the case

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because it just Google and Facebook and company just competed in a new reality. When I was in,  I was in Munich a few weeks ago and spoke to the Munich media and Tiger media days.  And I just, the whole presentation was me. Unfortunately, there was nobody in the audience,  so nobody heard it. But it's me going through every one of these cases of legislation and  regulation and court cases lately and saying, here's the unintended consequences. The effort  was to take away power from Google and Facebook. In each case, it gave them more power and, you  know, take GDPR. American publishers can't afford to and don't bother with dealing with this, but  Google and Facebook are the only companies that are big enough where it doesn't affect them. It's  easy to do it. Fine. Okay, fine. We'll do it. Right to be forgotten. Google has more power.  Nets stay gay. The hate speech law. Facebook has more power. It's, they backfire in every way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I think the main, the main thing with a lot of those rules is that Google and Facebook  can afford to pay whatever is required to sort of get into, you know, to play with those rules,  play along with those rules, but lots of smaller companies can't. So they're just excluded from  the market, which gives even more power to the large incumbents. There's no chance that Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  will give a pittance to these news companies. No, no, no, zero. Because, because what's the precedent

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that then sets, then I can for Buzz Machine, I can say, I'm going to set a price and Google,  you've got to pay me. And of course Google's not going to. And then, so Google will say, well,  I guess we got to cut off Buzz Machine. And so you're not in the search. And so we have a  worse search and so it ruins the web. That's what the Europeans are doing here. They are ruining

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the web. You're killing the open internet. And, and, and I think it's, you know, fair use is a sort of  esoteric concept and it's a, it's a sort of slippery legal concept. There's four factors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's hard to explain. Larry, Larry, Larry Lester says fair use is the right to hire a lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. It's a defense. You can't just say this is fair use and that is, and it's up to a court,  et cetera. But the principle, like think of all the artistic creations, you know, entire genres of  music like hip hop and rap that have been created using samples from other media. That kind of thing  would effectively be outlawed. The ability to remix bits and pieces of media has been a huge part of  media, all kinds of media. Although there have been many, many lawsuits by artists who've been

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  sampled without permission. There have, there have. And I kind of understand how artists feel. What  you're saying though is, okay, if you're a creator, just keep in mind, this is good for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And to be, be a little less of a tight ass. And obviously it depends on how you do it. I mean,  if you're, if your song is, you know, 90% someone else's, a sample of someone else's song, then that,  that seems over the top. But if you're, if you're, you know, girl talk or something like that, and you,  you sample a hundred different things and you hear tiny snippets of each,  how is that not a new creation? Well, here's an interesting example of this was weird Al Yankovitch,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  who writes parody songs, but the rules for permission, but he, but well, what's interesting  is he doesn't have to cause they're parodies provided he's paradising the song or the artist  who performs or wrote the song. For instance, he couldn't take a Prince song and rewrite the lyrics  and then make it be critical of the president. Right. That wouldn't be fair use, but if he uses

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it to paradise Prince, that's fair use. He also weird out asks every artist before he, which is  a parody of also, which he doesn't have to do. That's all he doesn't have to do, but that's polite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So polite to ask, but also if you're an artist and you are asked, it would be polite to  give permission because this is all about creative, you know, flow and everybody, it's good for  everybody. If you allow creative flow, otherwise everything gets stopped up. Another thing to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  here is that Matthew, you and I, in our business is that if we were not copying from each other  and quoting each other in news, we'd all be doomed. You as a columnist and critic,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you spend your day, quote, snippeting others. Well, as I pointed out, that's the whole  Twitter network. Yeah. We don't do any research. We just, we just leech. We are leeching. We do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  no reportage. I do sometimes have my own ideas, but no, I see your point. No, and we have our own

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ideas too, but we base it all upon others. And not just you, but any newspaper out there,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  any news show out there. That's what commentary is. Right. Yeah. And I think there's the, to sort

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of take a, a completely, you know, copyright maximalist point of view, which is what this law  would do is, is really going to cut off a huge amount of creative work. I mean, will it stop  pirates? Yes, but it will also stop anyone from using those things in a creative way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and I, and I always say this when it comes down to stuff like this, it doesn't really stop  pirates because pirates are by definition criminals and they don't care what the laws are.  In fact, laws only stop honest people. True. Can I make a bumper sticker of that? Yeah. Piracy  almost always is not thwarted by any of this stuff, including copy protection, everything else.  Because pirates just circumvent blithely and go on with their go on and, and it's never slowed it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  down. If memes are criminalized, only criminals will produce memes. They'll all be on HN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pardon me for this Gutenbergian moment here, but part of the fundamental problem is that we still  think in a Gutenberg notion of content, of an idea that, that, that what we're making is something to  fill a container. Right. That's not what we're doing. And, and, and, and, and that's what a news,  that's not what a news organization is. We're causing much of those problems. They are in the  service business. They're using various tools to accomplish that service. But as long as they think  that they're just in the business of making a product called content and it's theirs and they  own it, it's not the true value of what's there is the information inside and you cannot copyright  information. Um, it's, it's the last dying gasp of the old content industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they're trying to use garbage. It's a pretty big gasp though. I mean, if you think of, you know,  the number of content companies that as, as far as they're concerned, that their product is what  matters, not, I was just ranting about, this is sort of unrelated or tangentially related, but I  was ranting about a piece I read at a respectable publication that I won't name because lots of  places do it. A 1200, probably 1500 word article, really smart article referred to all this stuff  and did not link a single time to this is on the internet, did not link single time to anywhere,  to the things they were describing to anyone who had written about that thing.  Because the idea is it's just like Facebook. They want to keep you on their site as much as possible  and any links should only go to their stuff so that you will be trapped there.  And then hopefully maybe you'll buy something. I mean, that's just such a fundamentally backwards idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, makes me mad. I don't know what we're going to do about it, but, uh,  it's kind of up to the EU at this point, right? Well, one thing it says too is that the only thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm trying to say to Europeans is who the hell is going to invest in anything related to the  internet in Europe. And they constantly complain in line that, well, we don't have our Google.  Well, the way you get a Google is by investing in risking their risk. I'm only getting started

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  on Twitter. Yeah. Yeah. There's no way you're going to invest there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I do think, you know, I have a lot of friends in Europe. I like Europe. This is not an anti-Europe  comment, but it feels like some of the motivation, particularly for actions against Google and  Facebook is the feeling that they are American entities that are kind of stomping all over

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Europe and ruining everything. Yeah. To be clear here, I'm not saying all of Europe, you know,  save your, don't at me, but I am saying powerful European publishers and politicians are ruining  the net. And we thought that China was the entity ruining the net or that Russia was. Europe's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  doing damage here. Oh, it's depressing. It is depressing. Here is- Cancel the turkey. I'm not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thankful. Here is a scary, here's something to be thankful for. Here is a scary robot  that you won't see in production. This is a shaft robot. Google, when Andy Rubin was still there,  bought a lot of robotics companies like Boston Dynamics and Shaft. They've been trying, they sold  off Boston Dynamics. They've been trying to sell shaft because Google quite rightly realizes they  got enough problems. They shouldn't get any creepier. They can't sell shafts. So they're  shutting it down. They tried. It's nice and pink though. It's pink. That means it's very friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. What if I can get another on, on, on, on, from eBay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the business side will be shuttered. Google says it's helping staff find new roles.  Alphabet owns shaft. Here's the DARPA grand challenge, eight tasks and walking. All of this  done by this robot. I guess though the research, I mean, I hope it's not, you know, dead. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hope that it, well, maybe I do. I don't know. See, this is, I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it.  This is- Technopanic. Yes, it is because every time I hear somebody say, oh, that's creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a machine. It's just a machine. And you, there is a reason you want bipedal robots because  as in this, you know, environment, they're designed for humans. They're designed for bipedal  navigation. And so if a robot's coming into rescue people, they need to be able to operate  in an environment designed for people like go upstairs and open doors and all of that stuff.  And so- Fire weapons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fire weapon. Hey, hey, knock it off. Or disarm, disarm a weapon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The good news. Hey, here's, I'll put a happy gloss on that. One would hope that if it's a robot  firing a weapon, it's firing a weapon at another robot. Look, it can draw better circles than I  can. Oh my God. It's punched a hole in the door. That's a terrible circle.  It's good enough. Look, it can turn wrenches. This is the DARPA Grand Challenge. So they  designed these challenges for robots. And this is the shaft robot here. It's getting a hose.  So that again, it's designed for a human, but it's able to get the hose and connect it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can it make a nice mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Inevitably, if you could do the one, you could do the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there was a robot. There was a story about a robot, a company that got a lot of investment  to have robots make pizza. It got millions of dollars. I forgot the name of it, but the  pizza was terrible. So yes, robots made pizza. It doesn't matter because the robot made it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? A human can make terrible pizza too. That's true.  It's not exclusively the realm of the robots.  Have you played with the pixels? Neither of you have a Pixel 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, first time. I keep saying I don't have a phone envy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The new night sight and the camera.  Yeah, the night sight looks pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't used it yet, but I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have the Huawei P20 Pro as I think you've discussed before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a very good, I bet you could do something like that.  Or cameras.  I don't know what to make of this leak. This is alleged photos of a Pixel 3 light.  This might be for you, Jeff. The Sargo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not white. I'm just satisfied.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again, from Russia. This has a Snapdragon 670 and, and this intrigues me, a headphone jack.  What?  What?  Yeah.  What? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you see the rumors about Samsung's giant phone?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With like 15 cameras or something?  The S10. I don't think it's quite that many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a lot. It was like six or something or seven. I don't know.  It's like blades on razors. Now they're just like, what the hell?  It is.  Let's just put 20 cameras on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's six cameras.  Okay.  It's their top secret Galaxy S phone. It's a 5G phone with six cameras.  The problem is, and you're going to just see weirder and weirder stuff,  phone sales are just flat.  Yeah.  And so Apple and Samsung and Google all are challenged to come up with something  that makes people want to run to the market. But look at this guy, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't need it.  I couldn't, I could not be more of a gadget freak and Google fanboy and all that.  And I have nothing to guess, but I'm, the problem is I'm satisfied.  I'm highly satisfied with my Pixel 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a good phone.  And I think if you look at Apple's results,  Same problem.  I think you're seeing, yeah.  The same problem.  People think their phones are fine.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what you need? You need to give away motorized shoes.  Okay.  That's in the rundown.  Oh, is it?  That's in the rundown.  Motorized shoes.  Google applied for a patent.  It's called financial reality footwear.  For VR, because it'll allow you to walk in place and believe you're walking through the woods,  even though you're not running into furniture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But don't they just use treadmills or fancy treadmills?  In the movies, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the movies, they actually made it because we-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, the guy needs to go on a diet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He looks exactly like somebody who plays a lot of VR looks.  It's funny that the guy in the, this is for a patent application, he's a little portly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yeah, so the idea here, I know I would fall and break my ass in these things in a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they roller skates or just shoes that met and noticed-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're shoes that are motorized so you walk in place, but the motor is there, I guess,  so that you, because you could run, think about versus treadmill, Matthew,  you can go this way and that way and turn around and then walk this way and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have omnidirectional treadmills though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah, they do. In fact, we sent Jason Howell down to try one out. It's the same kind of  omnidirectional treadmill that's used in the-  You can walk in any direction.  ... Player one, but it's a big honking thing and it's-  It is, yeah.  Something, by the way, you don't see in the movie, it's noisy as hell,  especially as you start moving.  Oh, is it?  Oh yeah, it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you'd have to have, I don't know, your plugs in-  They can fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can fix that. They can fix anything.  This is just, we should point out, just a patent.  A patent, just a patent.  Tech companies patent everything just in case.  Just in case.  More of a defensive move than anything else. That's an interesting idea.  We've been waiting for our Pixel Slate. Google says they're starting to come.  Oh no, that was a mistake.  Oh really?  They're not coming?  I don't know, because this is puzzling, because I asked Jason Howell, who ordered one yesterday,  he said, yeah, they say mine's coming today or tomorrow.  But now, according to Android police, it turns out those notices were a mistake.  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Candy from the mouth of geeks.  Damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This week, some pre-order customers incorrectly received a note  with delivery timing for their Pixel Slate.  Corrections will be sent in the following days.  Oh man.  Boy.  You know, that's worse than the other thing Apple does,  which is when you order a new Apple device, you get the accessories weeks earlier.  You get all excited, and it's just the case.  This is even worse. It's on its way.  So I don't know what's happening with the Slate.  We'll have to get Kevin Toffle on when they actually come out.  And I didn't realize this, and apparently no one else did, because  the ad age story reads, YouTube is now showing ad-supported Hollywood movies,  and they started doing it in October, but nobody noticed until November.  So you could get Terminator or Legally Blonde for free with ads inside,  just like network television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's pretty smart, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder how bad the ads are.  I bet lots of people will do that.  Yeah.  Has anybody watched any movies on YouTube with ads?  Anybody in the chat room?  I wonder, I mean, does this, because they chop movies on TV.  Once VCRs became available, widely available, and now DVRs and on demand and streaming,  it was like, why would you ever watch a movie with commercials in it?  It's just horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that created the pop-up ad that covers part of the lower bit of the screen,  or the bugs that sit there while the show is on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, don't you hate that?  Okay, so here's Legally Blonde free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A classic movie, let's recognize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not a bad choice.  I'm going to log out, though, because if I don't sign out, I'm already YouTube Red,  I wouldn't get any ads anyway, so I'm going to sign out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  You're going to get a copyright pull take down because of this?  Yeah, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See the chilling effect?  He says, I'm not showing it.  You better show it, buddy.  Here's Legally Blonde with commercials.  We're showing the commercials.  Oh, look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Take out notice once because of a commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, we've gotten take down notice.  But usually, the thing that's different about stuff that's downloadable on YouTube  is that you can turn it around right away.  The thing that, you know, YouTube Live is really sticklers.  You only get one strike, not three, and they take it down for weeks.  So I don't see any ads in here.  Maybe they don't have ads.  Maybe they're going to have ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because if you go to Hulu or something, you can't get past a certain point in the scrub.  Right.  So this is free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or you have to watch the commercial.  These are all free with ads on YouTube.  Rocky IV, Zookeeper, they're not the best movies.  I think Legally Blonde is Agent Cody Banks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Agent Cody Banks, are you saying that's not one of the best movies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One and two.  Rocky II, Rocky III, Rocky.  Rocky, that's a good movie.  The Terminator, the original.  Classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Classic.  This is sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What?  All done.  These are the movies that you could get for 99 cents in the videos in Blockbuster.  Yeah, that's right.  They're being a bin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is basically like the bin at the gas station with all the CHS movies.  Those are some quality movies.  Steve Martin's going to be a little sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Steve Martin's going to be a little sad.  He's probably got more titles in here than anybody else.  It's like an author seeing the things in the remainder bin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh-huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, some of these are more recent.  Some Wu Dang.  Oh, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Zero Dreams of Sushi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that in here?  Yeah.  Oh, that's a great movie.  Yeah, it's a good movie.  Highly recommend it.  This is quite a few.  Oh, Muay Thai Giant.  Muay Thai Giant.  Hello?  Seven-foot Gentle Giant Barney Emerald is drugged and robbed while on holiday in Pattaya.  He befriends two Thai sisters, one who can speak English, another who is a Muay Thai  kickboxing champion.  He stays with them until he can recover his passport after eating some spicy sum tum.  Yeah, classic movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've seen that multiple times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the snippet.  It's a good kid's movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's probably not.  I have to sign in to confirm my age.  The comments are funny.  You can comment even on YouTube paid movies apparently or unpaid.  So I have a little something I'm going to show you that just came.  All right.  We've got the privacy clip on it, but I'm going to take it off.  And we'll talk about that in a second.  You're watching This Week in Google, our pre-Thanksgiving Day festivities with Jeff  Jarvis from CUNY and BuzzMachine.com, Matthew Ingram from the Columbia Journalism Review.  And, oh, hey, what's going on with that city in Toronto?  We'll be talking about that soon.  Yeah, the sidewalk sidewalks.  We'll talk about that too.  The dystopia in Toronto, the smart city of surveillance.  This is according to the Intercept.  But first, a word from our sponsor.  If you have a business, you probably have corporate cards.  And you may have the corporate card from the bank and so forth.  Those have been nothing but problems for us.  That's why we've moved to Brex, the first corporate credit card for startups.  Very easy, five-minute online application.  The underwriting is based on your cash in your bank account.  So that means Brex can offer your company 10 to 20 times higher limits than other corporate  credit cards.  And there's no personal liability.  Plus great high-value rewards tailored to modern businesses.  You get seven times the reward on rideshare, three times the points on restaurant and travel,  double points on software.  There's no limit on how many points you can earn.  And points can be redeemed for statement credit on transactions.  So that's good as cash.  Exclusive offers with some of the best technology brands and services.  Amazon Web Services, Google, Salesforce, WeWork.  See, Brex is underwriting the company, not you.  So there's no minimum operating history or painful paper application.  No personal liability.  They merely use the cash raised by your business to extend credit.  That means no credit score, no social security number, not even a security deposit.  It's a Visa card.  So you can use it anywhere.  And cards are instantly issued to employees.  They get a virtual card where you can set limits and control spend.  And then physical credit cards set in the mail.  I got mine the next day.  Every employee can have a corporate card with real-time limits that can be adjusted by the  boss, the administrator.  That's really nice.  And one of the things I really like as the user of the card.  So we used it at a restaurant the other night and I got a text immediately from Brex saying,  Hey, we saw you just charged a meal.  Take a picture of the receipt.  What?  Okay.  And reply to this message.  So I did.  I took a picture of the receipt and reply to the message.  While I'm sitting there, I mean, we hadn't even left yet.  It's matched.  It says, is this transaction?  Yes.  And you're done.  You don't have to save receipts.  Just throw it out now because it's in the statement.  You know in the statement exactly what you spent money on.  It works with major accounting software programs.  So it's very easy to get data from Brex into them.  Look, you got to join the thousands of startups and tech companies who are using Brex BREX  right now to manage their growing business needs and earn valuable rewards while they do so.  Get the card free.  And because you're listening to this show as a Twitter listener, no fees ever forever.  Card fees are waived in perpetuity.  But to take advantage of that, you've got to go to brexbrex.com slash Twitter.  BREX.com slash Twitter.  We know you need a corporate credit card.  Why not use one that works better?  Brex.com slash Twitter.  We thank them for their support.  And it's nice.  I would show you, but I don't want you to.  It's a nice black card.  It's nice.  I like using it.  The smart city of surveillance.  I don't know.  This is the intercept.  Sometimes I have to bite my tongue.  It's Keysight in Toronto, which is a  big kind of a...  Are you familiar with it, Matthew?  Yeah.  It's a big warehouse district right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's being complimentary.  It's really a lot of nothing.  So it's what used to be the old sort of port or part of it.  When there was a big sugar terminal there, now there's condos.  But there's still a lot of land that is just nothing.  Empty buildings, parking lots, weed-infested things.  Yeah, it doesn't look great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's a joint effort from the Canadian government agency  Waterfront Toronto and Google's Sidewalk Labs.  They want to take 12 acres.  The intercept says, of the valuable waterfront,  just southeast of downtown Toronto.  I guess it's not that valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not as valuable as it used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And their pitching Keysight is a solution to everything from  traffic congestion and rising housing prices.  Again, I'm reading the intercept.  To environmental pollution.  The proposal for Keysight...  I'm saying it right.  Keysight, right?  Keysight, yeah.  It's spelled Quayside, but as I learned quickly...  Yeah, it's key like the British key.  The natives call it Keysight.  It includes a centralized identity management system  through which, quote,  each resident accesses public services, end quote,  such as library cards and healthcare.  Yeah, super helpful.  Yep.  The driverless cars, mixed use spaces,  the change according to market demand, heated streets.  Heated streets?  In Toronto, you need heated streets.  Yeah, I'm in favor of that.  Sensor enabled waste separation.  That's of garbage, not of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it depends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're a wasteoid, go there.  The algorithm determines who survives

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and who doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The idea is it's a laboratory for some of these concepts.  And people don't...  They volunteer to live there, right?  Yeah, theoretically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean...  You will go live there.  I don't think it's being required.  Nobody's...  But the big issue is sort of how much  control Google per se will have over, say, personal data.  There's...  And intellectual property that comes out of it.  It's supposed to be a partnership.  And I think...  So there's this sort of creepy Google aspect  and the centralized information databases aspect.  But there's also a sort of functional question  about how much the city is sort of turning over to Google  to say, do whatever you want, build whatever you want.  We don't care.  Take the data and do whatever you want.  That's...  So the issue is how much control there is on what Google does  and doesn't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is kind of in a microcosm what's going on in general,  which is that the tech bros think they've got a solution  for every problem.  And if government would just get it...  Larry Page practically said it at Google I.O.  Just give us an island.  Let us just get out of the way  and let us solve the world's problems.  And I think there is a libertarian streak in Silicon Valley  that government just slows things down.  Doesn't help the less government the better.  And that corporations...  It's kind of Adam Smith's hand of the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This isn't anti-government though.  This is pro-service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it is a little anti-government.  I agree that the sort of perspective is government is slow.  Government doesn't have enough information  to make the right decisions.  We have lots of information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Government always is talking about this privacy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you give us all your information,  we'll be able to make better decisions  about when to get your garbage,  how to separate it, how to offer you services.  I mean, there's obviously huge benefits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would buy an apartment there in a flash.  I mean, again, I have a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I have a Huawei P20 Pro.  So I know that all my data is backed up in Beijing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's fine with me.  So this is where the controversy gets a little hotter.  Anna Kavukyan, who is Ontario's former privacy commissioner,  was on the project and she resigned.  She was brought on, according to The Intercept, by Sidewalk Toronto  as a consultant to help institute a proactive privacy by design framework.  She was initially told that all data collected from residents  would be deleted and rendered unidentifiable.  But she resigned when she learned that third parties  would be able to access identifiable information gathered at Keyside.  I imagined us creating a smart city of privacy  as opposed to a smart city of surveillance.  And she resigned.  Google Sidewalk Labs says,  no, we are committed to the principles of privacy by design.  However, the question of whether other companies involved  in the Keyside project would be required to be private as well  is unlikely to be worked out soon and maybe out of our hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, let's be reasonable.  There's no way Google would do any of this stuff  if they had to delete all the data immediately and not use it in any way.  Like that just doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It wouldn't enable the services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some of the value to Google,  there's the philanthropic value of creating a better city using technology.  But there's also, for instance, imagine that Waymo would put cars there  and it would be a great testbed to see what urban environments would mean.  By the way, wouldn't you want to live here?  I want to live here.  This looks beautiful.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think they could do the things they're talking about  without a certain amount of personal data.  They're going to have to.  The big issue.  What they need is permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not about the data.  It's about the transparency and permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uber has our personal information.  My gas company has personal information.  My phone has more than anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the big issue, as with all of those things, is how much  and when and under what circumstances  and what are they allowed to do with it and who are they allowed to give it to  and how much transparency do you have over what they do with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if you're like me and Jeff and you don't really give a damn?  But in return for giving up our privacy,  we feel like we get something of real value.  We get to live in this beautiful place and this utopia  where the kids can run in the street because cars don't hit them  and I can bicycle and there's no distinction.  It looks like here between sidewalk and street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can fry an egg on the sidewalk in December because it's heated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a heated street so there's no snow removal.  I would live there even if somebody knew all about my toilet habits.  Who cares?  And I think that's a fair trade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is there a company you would not trust to run that?  Would you live in Uberville?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I wouldn't trust is the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, libertarian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, you Californians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't trust the government with it because they can do bad things to me.  They have guns in prisons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To be fair, they have all your information as well.  And they already have it.  And really that's the real concern.  And they often do bad things with it and give it to people and sell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the real concern is that Google will gather it all  and then the government will come and get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is one risk for sure.  I mean, to me it's everybody I think, well, with a few exceptions,  and they live in cabins in the woods somewhere.  With a few exceptions, I think everybody would be willing to make a trade  that involves them giving up some personal information.  People do already for Gmail or Facebook or lots of free services.  But the question is kind of where on the continuum of  we own all your information or get access to all your information is this going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just saying I should be allowed to make that choice.  I, of course, if somebody doesn't want to do that, they shouldn't live in Hooverville.  But everybody else, what was I talking about in the weekend about celebration,  the Disney-built city in Florida.  If you don't want it, don't live there.  Disney, I do not want to have my information.  There we go.  There's your limit.  Yeah.  Disney is, I draw the line at Disney.  But there seems like a fair trade to me and I would like the choice to do it,  I guess is what I'm saying.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think you should have.  And my only fear would be that if, and I think what some of the critics of this project are  saying is if controls aren't put in place before it's built, it'll just be a kind of slippery  slope down into the worst possible scenario.  And then you will have made a decision.  What Google should be doing, sorry, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, go ahead.  What Google sidewalk should be doing is proposing very publicly sets of rules for this so that  there can be open discussion.  And it's kind of like, I'm going to go two sides on this.  It's kind of like a condo board or co-op board, I should say.  But I will also say this, the worst example of democracy I have ever experienced is a co-op board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're terrible.  That's the worst.  Yeah.  Because there's always some petty tyrant who just wants some power.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I was going to say, it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel your committee was bad too.  Yeah, same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's nothing, the smaller the issue, the bigger the fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you could argue, I think, if you were defending Google, which I'm not, but I could be,  is that governments do make lots of really dumb and expensive and in fact dangerous decisions  because they don't have enough information.  And so theoretically, at least more information could produce better decisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's a company I don't fully trust, Facebook, 29 minutes ago, let's see,  5 p.m. Friday on the day before Thanksgiving, admitted that they, not only did they hire  the defenders, here's the tweet from John Pasatano.  Definer.  Definer.  Did I say defenders?  Well, they were defending Facebook.  Same thing.  Yeah, same thing.  Did we ask them to work on George Soros, Elliot Schrage writes?  Yes.  Yes.  So Elliot Schrage is, by the way, the fall guy for this.  He is the outgoing head of Google PR.  Right.  He's already left.  In fact.  He's already left.  So Google, I have Facebook, I'm sorry, not Google.  So it's clear that Sheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg have said, great,  Elliot's leaving anyway.  Elliot.  From under the bus.  You did it, right?  Did we, Elliot's writing, this came out at 5 p.m.  He did it.  They did it.  Did we ask them to work on George Soros?  Yes.  In January 2018, investor and philanthropist George Soros attacked Facebook, by the way,  nothing I haven't done, in a speech at Davos calling us a menace to society.  We had-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what most were saying about this?  These are Jewish executives.  I know.  Should have known better.  Should have known the symbolism of going after George Soros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because he's Jewish and it's an anti-Semitic, and many of the people-  It's an anti-Semitic meme.  It's an anti-Semitic meme.  We had not heard such criticism from him before and wanted to determine if he had any financial  motivation while he's Jewish.  Then you ask, you research.  The finers researched this using public information.  Later, when the Freedom From Facebook campaign emerged as a so-called grass, so-called  grassroots coalition, the team asked the finers to help us understand the group behind them.  They learned that George Soros was funding several of the coalition members.  They prepared documents and distributed those to the press to show this was not  simply a spontaneous grassroots movement, but part of the world Jewish conspiracy.  No, I added that part.  So is this what-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Others funding Freedom From Facebook include the CWA Union, Jewish Voice for Peace, Move On,  Public Citizen.  So the worst people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, horrible, horrible liberals.  It's liberals.  Now what do you say, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've been very upset about this.  Let's do my disclosure here.  I raised money from Facebook for the school.  I'm independent of Facebook.  I received the money personally from Facebook or any of the platforms.  End of disclosure.  They make it re-  I try to defend the internet and thus I defend the agents who are building what I think are very  good and important things that enable good things on the internet.  I end up trying to defend Facebook, but boy, they make it hard.  An example like this.  I mean, think for two effing seconds.  You don't go attacking George Soros.  If you want to ask publicly, if you want to criticize him publicly,  if you want to disagree with him publicly, fine, but you don't do it sub Rosa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in particular, you don't do it using a group definers  that is known for doing this kind of hit piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The worst and stupidest thing Facebook has done, and this goes back to the episode of trending  and the employed people there who were accused of anti-conservative bias, right?  They go overboard.  So whenever you have a Facebook event, whenever Zuckerberg has invited people to  headquarters, they go overboard trying to invite an equal number or greater number of conservatives.  And the problem is, as we've talked on the show often, as I say all the time,  there's one media outlet in this country that's conservative and that's Fox News.  And the rest is liberal.  We liberals don't admit that, but that's another discussion.  So what happens is you can't just invite Fox News.  So you invite the next one, the next one, the next one.  Before long, you have Breitbart in the room.  Before long, you've hired the definers.  Before long, you've not used your own standards to say,  I don't care if they're conservative or liberal.  Do I want to be associated with those people?  So the paradox here is that by trying to be more balanced,  they're making the exact same mistake we make in journalism, a false balance.  And they're putting themselves in the company of bad people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they also, to me, this is a sign of just how desperate things have become at Facebook,  because I think they've clearly said to someone, to Elliot or to whoever,  we have to do whatever we can.  We have to hire all the usual terrible lobbying firms.  We have to hire all the usual bad actors to do this stuff,  because I think they feel that they're behind the eight ball in Washington, which they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So a couple of things to note about this.  One, that it was released at 5 p.m. the day before Thanksgiving, which is a news hole.  And they knew that.  So they buried it.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, Elliot's, the fact that he was taking the fall came out earlier.  Yes, but this piece came out 45 minutes ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Point two, I find it almost impossible to believe that  Sheryl Sandberg did not know that this was going on.  I know Elliot Schrage is going to take the fall for it.  But are you telling me the chief operating officer had no idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So here's the question to me.  Here's the parlor game to me is who takes the next fall?  Because Facebook famously has fired nobody for anything.  Right.  So Elliot took the fall and I don't.  He was on the way out.  So it was easy.  He was on the way out.  So this was easy.  But he took the fall for this.  But the question is, does Sheryl Sandberg stay COO?  Does Mark Zuckerberg stay chairman?  He says he isn't leaving.  Margaret Sullivan.  Well, he's going to leave the company.  Margaret Sullivan wrote a column yesterday, which I haven't even read yet,  but I saw her last night in The Washington Post where she said  that Zuckerberg should step down as chairman so that there is true oversight.  I don't know that that's our business to say or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Mark Zuckerberg's told CNN today, I am not stepping down as Facebook chair.  This is a lot of the criticism around the biggest issues has been fair,  but I do think if we're going to be real, there's this bigger picture at well, Zuckerberg said,  which is that we, I don't know what this means, but you'll have to explain it to me,  which is that we have a different worldview than some of the folks who are covering us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I noticed that too.  And it's a very strange statement.  But I think what he means is we think connecting the world and giving everyone  the ability to say things and share things is good.  And the people who cover us do not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, here's another way to put it.  Matthew, I think you're right.  And I think that when Zuckerberg, the problem is they feel constrained to say what they really  think, which is the odd thing. When Zuckerberg said after the election, when he mocked the idea that  Facebook itself changed the results of the election and he had data to back that up in  terms of knowing how many people actually saw things, I think that he was probably  right in saying that. However, in a PR sense, it was stupid as hell because it was, it came off  as a form of arrogance and nonchalance. And so if he said what he really thought, if his worldview  is I have data and no, I think you all are overreacting. I think it's a small number of  people doing some bad stuff and we were, we were slow when we did it. Right. But if he said that,  he gets smashed. So instead he says things like that, like that, and that statement,  which nobody knows what the heck it means. They've got to get to a point of honesty and  bluntness and transparency and we're going to screw them sometimes at that. But then give us  data, show us the data that you have that backs up what the impact really is. But it's, this is,  it's all disturbing because it, what bothers me is it hurts the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He talked about Sheryl Sandberg. He said, Sheryl's a really important part of this company,  is leading a lot of the efforts for a lot of the biggest issues we have. She's been an important  partner to me for 10 years. I'm really proud of the work we've done together. I hope that we work  together for decades more to come. That sounds like I'm behind you a thousand percent. One thousand  percent. Somebody in the chat room, and I'm trying to find the bit of the clip where he says this,  says that he blames Jeff Bezos and the Washington Post. Maybe that's a confusion with somebody else.  But I don't know what to say at this point. Anyway, they tried to flush it down the news  hole and at least here, this is, we're talking about it. Did we work on this?  This is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think if you, you guys both read the big New York Times feature, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what this is all, of course, what stimulated this is last week. And I decided last week not to  spend a lot of time on it. Jeff and I, and Stacey talked about it before the show, but we had just  come out. And so I decided not to spend a lot of time on the show talking about it. But we could  talk about it now. One week later, the Times had, they say 50 inside sources delay, deny, and  deflect how Facebook's leaders fought through crisis. And that's where the George Soros relevant

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  regulations. To me, in that story, the shocking bad thing in that story was the Soros ankle.  The rest of it wasn't so much an expose to me as a TikTok, as we say in the field. It was stuff we  pretty much already knew, but took us through the details and fleshed it out. But I don't think there  was anything in that story that we besides the Soros thing that was terribly illuminating,  or even so much an expose as it was, it put it all in one place and you say, Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there was a lot of yelling and stuff. By the way, this has cost Mark personally,  and it's cost Facebook. Facebook stock down 40% since July. Zuckerberg lost $17.4 billion in wealth  this year. So it's not, there is a consequence. Mark is so wealthy, so virtually infinitely  wealthy that that's meaningless. It's paper money, but still. Here's the voice that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  trust in this discussion, which is Alex Stamos. And I saw him at an event last Wednesday, it was  Chattermouse Rule. We're off the record. So I'm not even supposed to say I saw him, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Alex Stamos, the former chief security officer at Facebook who left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who left in this, but the New York Times, you know, he's been pushing back. He's been critical of  Facebook. He's been saying what Facebook and he missed or did wrong, but he's also pushing back  on this coverage in a very intelligent and savvy way. And all I can say is this, I was very impressed  with Alex. I was very impressed with his candor and, and he is pushing back on some of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  coverage. Here's the opinion PC wrote in the Washington Post. Yes, Facebook made mistakes  in 2016, but we weren't the only ones. Yes. He said, Sheryl Sandberg yelled at me.  He had gone to public. Well, at least gone to the board and said he had no confidence that we'd  found everything the Russians were up to at Facebook. It didn't go public. No, well, public  to the board. Let's put it that way. And it was quite possible things could get worse before they  got better. Sandberg, as the Times investigation reported, felt blindsided by this and yelled at

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  him. So he confirmed that detail. So the, the narrative around his departure, which was  the narrative based in large part on New York Times reporting was that Stamos, when Facebook came out  with its own internal security report during the 2016, the run up to the election, that Sandberg  and others put pressure on him not to say that it was the Russians. And in fact,  the word Russian doesn't appear anywhere in the report. There's a kind of veiled reference to  the fact that Facebook has no reason to believe that US intelligence isn't correct in their view,  which of course was that the Russians were involved, but it doesn't specifically say.  So he's pushed back in particular on that narrative that he had a fight with Cheryl who  wanted him to downplay the Russian aspect. He, and presumably he's free to speak now that he's left.  He said, it's not that cut and dry. There were decisions made at the time about what they could  reliably say, what, how far should they go? Obviously hindsight being 2020, they probably  should have said Russians were involved, but it was a fluid situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's so many issues that happened. Russian media manipulation is one of them.  But here's his final paragraph. Finally, US citizens must adjust to a media environment  in which several dozen gatekeepers no longer control what's newsworthy. We've talked about  this a lot. While the platforms that bring hundreds of new media outlets to your phone  need to improve protections against abuse in a free society will always be vulnerable to the  injection of narratives from the enemies of democracy, both foreign and domestic.  The last line of defense will always be citizens who are willing to question what they see and hear,  even when it means questioning our own beliefs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is so, so important because it is the reality we have is that we have now an abundance of speech.  There are not gatekeepers. This all at all, I think is a good thing. And what it means is  responsibility now falls to everyone for what to decide that they want to believe or not and have  some basis to do that. And we have to feed that we in media, we, the former gatekeepers have to  feed that in new ways. But at the end of the day, everyone can speak and that's just where we are.  And by the way, Alex also says frequently that the other problem, and I have heard this from all of  the platforms vehemently, and this goes not just the Trump administration, this goes very much to  the Obama administration, is that government did not share information. Government was not  at the least bit helpful pre the 2016 election. Whatever they knew, they weren't sharing and they  weren't giving any tips to the platform as the platforms often didn't know to look for Russians  early enough. Government probably did, but government was shy about this. So there is  fault across many lines here. Let me ask both of you guys something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you really think that the we know what the Russians did, they, you know, created a bunch of  sock puppets made ads, they targeted different opinions, they cried, create strife. But honestly,  do you really think that effort was a decisive factor in the 2016 election?  Do you want to go first, Jeff? I don't. But I'm curious what you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it was so close that it's hard to say that it didn't for 70,000 votes. Could 70,000  people have somehow indirectly been influenced by this? Well, if it was that close,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that means that 49.9%. I'm going to agree with you. It was not, right. It shouldn't have been

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  close. And I will say again, and I'll get tweets for this and hey, people, it's my fault, not Leo's.  It's Fox News who did this. Fox News created the country we're in right now. And we immediately  created it by not serving half of America. We created that void and vacuum and liberal media.  Fox News filled it and they used it as well. I think you can blame CNN too, just as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I think so. CNN ran every single Trump rally. Yes. He got immense free air time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've talked to a number of people who specialize in this research in particular and asked them  that question. Do they think that Facebook and particularly Russian trolls swung the election  in any sense of that term? And I would say most of the ones I've spoken to don't believe that it did.  And the main reason is because research shows that content that you see online,  whether it's ads or just regular content, doesn't convince you to do anything.  So if you try and measure people's, I mean, look at the number of people who click on ads,  it's a fraction of 1%. But online content reinforces things that you already believe  and it pushes you in directions you are already going. But it doesn't change minds in that sense.  And so did it maybe give a boost to someone a little bit? Perhaps did it kind of encourage  people to think things even more strongly that they already thought? Yes. And the big debate  in this research is it was a very, very close election. And so you don't have to show  a huge amount of impact to sort of tip things over. And that's why I think there's still

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  disagreement about sort of who's to blame. Given that it's close, which had more influence,  Russians throwing out some junk or Comey? But the point is if it's close,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  then half the nation feels that way. So the fact is it was close. So the other thing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the researchers- So it was maybe influenceable, but it wasn't influenceable because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you took the vast majority of people and changed their minds.  Most people had already made up their minds by far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the other thing that may have played a role, which is incredibly, in fact, almost  impossible to measure, is who didn't vote. And did some of this information cause people not to vote?  You can measure people who voted. You can ask them why they voted the way they did.  You can look at how they voted before. It's very difficult to measure

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the impact on people who didn't vote. Here's what gets me about the PR thing here.  And Lord knows I'm no PR man, and I'm not exactly a politic in any way.  And you might hoot at this, but handled properly, I believe that Facebook could have presented  itself as a victim. And it's not unlike Tylenol, where it depends on your response. It depends on  how open you are. It depends on how much you really are the victim and how you're not a willing agent  or an unwilling agent of bad things going on. It depends on how diligent you are. It depends  on a lot of things. It's not just a PR slant. But that would not fly at all.  If there's no way Facebook was a victim.  I'm not trying to justify Facebook here. I'm trying to give a scenario that said,  if this had happened five years ago, before the rather than gone, I think there's a reasonable  view. I disagree.  I think there were. But Matthew, I think that, again, I'm not trying to justify them. I'm  being careful to say this. I don't want people going to be, hey, Jarvis says Facebook is a victim.  To some extent, they are, though, Matthew. They are. They were targeted  and they didn't look at things they didn't do, but they were targeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this company has hundreds of billions of dollars, has tens of thousands of smart people.  Its business is to run that network. And according to that New York Times story,  until midway through 2016, there was no one at Facebook whose business it was to think about  misinformation and how it that might be the platform might be used.  We agree to spread misinformation. No one, not a single person. This company is over a decade old.  We know you and I know since we're old people, we've been online for a long time. We've watched  IRC. We've watched web forums. We've seen the rise of 4chan. We know that when you connect people  online and there's that sort of disinhibition effect of being online, bad things can happen.  Facebook should have known and should have done something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think they could have seen Russian interference the way it happened.  I think they could. I think and I think they should.  I disagree. I disagree. And let's remember our government didn't see it either and didn't act on  it as well. So I agree with you is people acting badly. Yes. And they all, Google and Facebook,  both managed to deal with that when it came to financial motivation and spam.  Right. It's a different issue to deal with psychological motivation, political motivation.  It's harder for a whole bunch of reasons, but they didn't pay attention to resources to that.  So we, you and I agree there. But I don't think it's clear how much they could have.  I think it's so unprecedented. This information, like what the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Russians told it has been a function of international politics for 50 years. I mean,  this is not something that was invented by Ukraine. Yes, but not in the U.S.  I think it has been in the U.S. In some cases created by the U.S. This is a known phenomenon.  What I'm saying is if you've created a giant platform that you're making tens of hundreds of  billions of dollars from and you're connecting billions of people around the world, it's  incumbent on you to think about. And one of the things I criticize both Google and Facebook for  is not thinking about the, just thinking about all the good ways in which your technology can  help people. If you're going to build something that large, it's incumbent on you to think about  how it could be used against people or in bad ways. And it's incumbent on you to try and stop  that, not to continually apologize after it happens. Matthew, we're not agreeing. We're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  disagreeing as much as I think you're trying to say here. All I'm trying to say is, because I agree,  they should have done more. Maybe they couldn't have seen everything you think they could have  seen, but that's a matter of degree. They should have seen this as a responsibility. They should  have invested more resources. We're agreeing about all of that. What I'm trying to say is that if they  had done that, if they had devoted resources, if they had been transparent, if they had been  collaborative, if they had done all of that and then the Russians hit, they could have said,  we too were a victim here. They could have. Because they didn't do all those things.  No, you're absolutely right. It wouldn't fly. But they could have. That's all we're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If they had been a completely different company. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think the United States was sitting ducks anyway, because of our division,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it was easy to drive a wedge. Yeah. Well, there's a chicken egg there too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've been divided for a few years now. Yeah. Let's play some trumpets because it's time for  the Google change law. The Google change the subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. We need trumpets for that. Hey, Carson, when you get bored of anything we're talking about,  just play trumpet. Change the subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New from Google. This one's a little complicated. Google Assistant on iOS has been updated so that  you can now issue OK Google commands on your iPhone, but you have to do it by calling Siri  first. Who's going to do that? I don't know. Well, the only reason you might do it is if you have  smart home stuff that's only compatible with your Google Home. I like to speak. You're going to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, S OK, G Yo, Amazon. Yo.

Both my pixel, my pixel and my iPhone both woke up on that one.  And Siri said very funny boss. I mean not funny haha but funny.  And and my wow, my pixel said welcome to the waking world.  Oh, OK. So there you go. The new version of where I was.  A creepy message. I know. Welcome to the waking world.  It's like a matrix kind of. And then it says, did you sleep well?  Well, that's the blue pill. What happened? That's nice.  Where OS version H update improves battery saver and standby. I don't know anybody who's still  wearing watch OS, but if you are where OS I am good. Now you can update and get better app  switching and better battery life and a whole lot more version H.  H.

Transcript:  was going to Africa to work on food security with people. They had to fly to Rwanda and then walk  across the border. His mother and sister lost their homes in paradise. He lost things in paradise,  yet he's still going to Africa to help people. I met this incredibly talented new music cellist  named Ashley Bathgate. Please, everybody, look her up. She's really good. Did she play for you?  No, but I looked up the videos the next day and I said I was in the presence of this awe-inspiring  talent. I just said, oh, it's nice. You play the cello. So there was a silver lining to the snow  crop, but oh my Lord, it was just awful. So Leo, you could be here for two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, if I am, I'm coming to New Jersey to visit you.  Yes, you are. Yes, you are. We had a little premature change log, but now you can  complete the Google change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was taking a ship from Spain to America, which is when the dowry began.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. I didn't know there was spoken word involved.

Actually, I got a ham to put in the oven. Ham takes a lot  longer than turkey to cook, but it cooks more uniformly and it's all dark meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's the new white meat. Well, my ham, I don't know. It's a little like a dark white meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whoa, that's an entire pig. Yeah. Does it have the apple in its mouth? Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's just the... It's actually like one buttock.  Wow. It must have been a large pig, but it's...  Commercial hogs are the size of a VW Bug. Yeah. I'm gonna brine it in apple cider as soon as I get  home. Oh man, I'm getting hungry. Yeah. And then I got a lasagna I made on Monday. I made lasagnas.  I made a red one with red sauce and a green one with pesto. Can you FedEx me some ham?  Yeah. I will have enough to FedEx. Because I was planning for 16 because I don't know why I thought  there'd be 16. I think it's gonna be like five people. Perfect. Put some in a vac pack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought there'd be a lot more people coming. This happened last time I cooked for Thanksgiving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I overdid it a little bit.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage, home for the holidays, right? It's nice.  If you're looking for a new home, you know it's a really important purchase. This is where you and  your family will be enjoying the holidays, Thanksgiving and Christmas. And you'll be  gathering around the hearth for family meals. It's a big deal. You're buying your home.  It's also a big purchase, right? The biggest check you'll ever write. I'm not talking about  for the house, just the down payment alone. So it's kind of nervous making when you're  buying a house. You got to find the right place, right? And you're gonna need a loan.  So can I recommend the best lender in the country? The number one lender in the country,  Quicken Loans. Now nine years in a row since 2010, number one in customer satisfaction,  according to JD Power for mortgage origination. The last five years for mortgage approval. That's  a lot of number one awards there. Also number one in volume since December, beating out the big bank.  It's because the customer comes first at Quicken Loans. For instance, Rocket Mortgage. This is the  entirely online mortgage approval process they created for us geeks. So we could do everything  we need to do to get a home loan on our phone or our tablet or our desktop.  Phone's perfect. You go out to an open house, say, let's get this fire up rocketmortgage.com  slash twig. Please use that. That way we get credit. Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  And you'll begin the three-step power buying process. Step one, no 20 page  application notes trip to the bank. You just answer a few simple questions.  They'll run a credit check and give you pre-qualified approval. Boom, that's it.  You get to choose the term of your loan, the rate, the down payment. And by the way,  they have very good rates, very competitive rates, a variety of different loan products.  You pick the one you want. Then step two, without any intervention on your part in most cases, they  will verify your income assets and credit. And they do this in less than 24 hours to give you  verified approval. Now you've got a letter. You are basically a cash buyer. You go right to the  front of the line. You got a letter. You could show the seller or your realtor that says you've  got verified approval. That is a great, great thing to have. That's power. Step three kicks in. Once  you're verified, you qualify for their all new exclusive rate shield approval. They lock the  rate. Now this is a big deal. Rates are going up. I don't know why this is going on in Canada,  but in the United States rates are going on. And that means it's a little scary when you're  out there buying because there's pressure. Like we've got to buy this house before the rates go  up. It's going to cost us more. Not with rate shield approval. Quicken Loans will lock your rate  for up to 90 days while you shop, up to three months. The rates can go up, but yours won't.  Actually, if the rates drop, yours will drop, but either way you win. That's exactly what you'd  expect from America's best mortgage lender. Get started at rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  Rate shield approval is only valid on certain 30 year purchase transactions. Additional  conditions or exclusions may apply based on Quicken Loans data in comparison to public  data records. Equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org  number 3030 rocketmortgage.com slash twig. Get a nice new home for the holidays.  All right. I'm going to show you my pick of the week. I'll start. Oh no, that's impolite. Let me  let you, I'll do mine last. I'll let you start Matthew Ingram because you are a guest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you. Thank you. This is actually from the rundown, but we didn't get to it. I just  thought it was fascinating. Airbnb is going to let you stay with Mongolian tribes people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you want to bring their herders. But they don't have a street address. How are you going  to find them, Matthew? But well, you would use what three words, which we've talked about in

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the show. What three words? Yeah. So here's a real use of it. Yeah. Which is fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sort of the way that they use a unique combination of words to for places that don't  have a location. Obviously, if you're sleeping in a tent in the forest, in the, on the steps or  whatever in Mongolia, you're probably not going to have a street address. I just like it. Right.  Right. Matthew. Yeah. We actually have a nine one one address. We had to get one so they could find  you and give you CPR or whatever. But before that it was just, you know, third house on the left.  So I thought this would be fascinating to go and live with Mongolian reindeer herders. You get to  milk the reindeer. You get to, you know, sleep in a tent in the woods. Sounds fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And because they're nomadic, their three words get updated. Yeah. So service in a, in a major

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  city, I guess, that updates it whenever they move. Isn't that hysterical? So if you go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the what three words map here, I'll put it in right now for the Mongolian  herders. The three words are evaluate video nails. So let me enter.  By the way, we, what was that? I, we just, I just, hey, I asked, I sent away for my,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  my address. I never got that. What do you mean sent away for? I thought you just,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they were giving you free plaques with your address on it. And I sent away. Oh, wow.  You can't get there from here. There is no evaluate video nails. Maybe that was just a,  maybe the equivalent of five, five, five, one, two, three, four. It may have changed. Yeah. That's,  that's a fake one. Oh, that's cool. That's very cool. Yeah. What three words you can now,  but really do you want to live in a tent with nomadic Mongolian reindeer hoarders? That's  like, it'd be fascinating. Those are your size. And it looks like a teepee. Well,  what's the difference? What is a yurt? Oh, you're so much nicer than it's. I know. What's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  definition of a yurt? It's a thatch. Technically a yurt is circular. Circular. Okay. Here's a,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this is my yurt. That's nice. That's a yurt. That would be nice. That's the sort of yurt  palace. That's a, that's a yuppie yurt. Yeah. I will get you a more, this is a big thing.  Bougie. Yeah. This is a bougie yurt. Out your way it is. Yes. Yeah. But I actually wanted to-  Not in the normal world it's not. I'm not allowed because I'm in farm country to build any more on  my property because I'm within a hundred feet of a farm. Yeah. You can't build within a hundred  feet of a farm. It's some weird law, but this is a temporary building. Yeah. If it's movable,  I bet you could build. That's exactly right. It's like a tent, except it's not. It's a yurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So all you have to do is build it on stringers and then they can pick it up and put it on a truck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. See? Just a little wooden platform. Nice. Yeah. That is some yurt. What is your number of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the week, JJ? So I think I'll do the wire cutter Black Friday page, which is constantly being  updated even as prices go up and down. Okay. So it's a useful little tool here to find if you're  a cheap bastard, you can find Bergens for your loved ones on Black Friday. It's funny. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's changing and adding all the time. These companies like Wirecutter and Thrillist and  others basically treat this like, I mean, it's like an invasion. They've got, they've got, you know,  the desk and they've got people at tables and they've got, you know, a war room and it's crazy.  And, but what they, what's good about the wire cutter is they tell you if it's actually a deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because it's too bad. They tell you whether it's any good or not. And is it really a deal? Yeah. A  huge proportion. So the fossil Q Android smartwatch, normally 200 is 150. Nice. Which is  a good deal. So 3G, that is a good deal. But it's a good, but that'd be past Matthew's minus 1G.  You'd get no G's on yours, Matthew. So, so, so I was looking at this and I saw bike helmets on  there and it reminded me of what I saw in Stockholm. Have you heard, this is not a number, but screw it.  Have you heard of the Hovding? Of course. Everybody's heard of the Hovding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you spell Hovding? The Hovding is an airbag bike helmet. Oh, and it's a track. It inflates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so yeah, so it's not, it doesn't inflate normally. It only inflates if you fall  and it's got helium and it's charged. Isn't that phenomenal? But you have to wear,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's kind of a scarf thing. You wear the scarf thing. Right. So I met with the, with the media

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  executive and she, she bicycled because of course in Sweden to the, to the hotel for breakfast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And she, she was wearing the Hovding. Oh, so everybody in Sweden wears a Hovding.  They wear the Hovding. Pretty much. I can't, there's another video. There's another video

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  on there that shows it inflating from, from ground up. I could wear, great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a wonderful idea. I want one. I could just wear it like that. But is it,  I thought that's what I thought it was. I would actually wear that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here is, here is Will It Pop? Hovding 2.0. Isn't that amazing? Wow. I would just like to wear that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  periodically trigger it as I was walking down the street. Will It Pop? This is a new Hovding game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Curbs with Hovding. Is he going to just throw himself on the ground? I guess so. Let's watch.  Nope. He, oh, the fear is that you go over a curb and you trigger it. That might trigger the Hovding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, doesn't trigger it. It's fine. So that's, I think false triggers of a Hovding might be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. So he can do this. Oh, no, he can't. Doesn't pop. He's just going over big chunks of cement now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's quite the retro looking bike. I like it. They use stunt people to,  to simulate Hovding. Yes. Popping. Okay. I just thought I would share that. But you're right,  Leo. I wish it were constantly inflated all the time. I would love to ride around New York City  with an inflated Hovding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know how that word is? I think that's the woman who was in the first. Isn't it? What's her  name? She's great. She was also in California Cation. She's a sweet. I love this. I could just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  watch this all day. I know. If you were in New York, someone would try and punch you to trigger it.  Punch me in the Hovding. Will you? It's like 300 euros. What? Okay. It's like 300 euros. Once it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  inflates, you can't fix it. Right. So it's a one shot Hovding. I got it. Well, of course. It has a  black box on it. So they ask you to send in the black box. If it inflates, they know how well it  did. Yes. The Hovding invented by, I think she said two young Swedish women who had this idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for the Hovding. I kind of want one. I have a, I have a, I have a Bluetooth enabled helmet with  lights that lights up and it'll answer my phone. I can listen to books. It's got it blinks. It's  got all sorts of stuff. Cause I got a, for, for myself and Lisa, for the holidays, I got  electric bikes. Cause I, I'm now an e-bike fanatic. I love my e-bikes. So does it, is it just help you  or does it do it? Well, it's pedal assist, which means you have to pedal for it to do anything,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but you don't have to pedal hard. You just kind of go like this and you're going 20 miles an hour  uphill. It's like, Ooh, do you adjust the aid? Yeah, there's five steps. So step one is kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  most like bicycling with a little help. Kind of what you think a e-bike is. Step five,  you start to pedal and you go, it's so fun. But in America, I don't know what is the rules are in  Canada, but in America, you can only go 20 miles an hour on this thing where it's no longer a bicycle.  It's a, it's a what scooter or moped or something. So 20 miles an hour. No, no, it's just,  well, yeah, it gets more complicated. Yeah. So if so 20 miles, but people hack these all the time,  but you don't want to go 30 miles an hour on a bicycle. That's just dangerous. Sure. You do.  Well, you can downhill if you want, but it's fun. It's really fun. I love it. I'm a big fan. I went  to rad power for the first two and I'm still waiting for my super 73, but that's been held up  by these tariffs. So I ended up just getting a couple of rad powers and they came very fast.  But these are, these are really cool little bikes. They're really fun to ride. Highly recommended.  They're going to have a big $200 off Black Friday sale if you're  interested. They're not an average. How much does it cost? I think, well, I paid 1600. I think  there's the rad Rover. This is the one Lisa likes got 300 bucks off. So that's not bad looking.  Oh, they're so cool. There's places where you, I think they're going to start renting them in New

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  York. Uh, in addition to, um, city by city bikes, these electric bikes are the future. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought you'd need to have your hoof ding. I think I might need a hoof ding now. Cause I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  got upset with people in New York. You're in New York. You gotta get killed and people don't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  helmets on. Yeah. Well, I, I wear, um, a helmet, but a helmet is really just, you know, an eggshell  for the brain. Yeah. So I think I'm gonna have to get leather. You need a body hoof ding. I need

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a whole hoof ding. Yeah. Like a Michelin man kind of thing. Yeah, exactly. I'll wear my jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here it is, ladies and gentlemen. Wow. The portal is here. Oh my Lord. It's huge. It's huge.  That thing is huge. This is the Facebook, uh, device that's designed. Facebook isn't just in  your home. It took over your home. That's a big, uh, screen. Well, and the other thing is of course,  you have to have a Facebook account. Although as I found out, uh, cause I, I, as you know,  deactivated my account as I found out, if you deactivate your account, oh, you know what?  It's when did you deactivate it? Uh, right after I logged in. So actually I can't demo it. I guess  by unplugging it, it doesn't have any memory. It now needs me to log back in and everything.  Oops. Um, so I'm sorry to say, I won't be able to give you a full demo. What's that? Like a 12,  13 inch screen? Yeah, it's, yeah, it's kind of, yeah, it's a wide screen and it rotates.  And actually most of the time you're going to use it like this because in the, in the portrait mode,  because then you can see the whole person's body and face. It's a, hold it up like it's a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a giant, it's the world's biggest phone. Hello. I'm here. Hello. It kind of looks like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  uh, the 17 inch, uh, Tesla screen. It's pretty big. Yeah. So the idea of it is I guess, okay,  so this is going to be a process cause I have to reactivate my Facebook account,  log in, then you can deactivate because it's using messenger. Well, what Facebook doesn't really kind  of emphasize. They don't, they never delete your account. Facebook messenger doesn't stop working  when you deactivate your face. Oh really? Interesting. So, uh, if you, and I'm going to  do a full review on the new screensavers, I'll have it all set up again. But, uh, if you deactivate  your account, you don't get your pictures. Otherwise it's a very nice slideshow. If your  Facebook pictures, you choose the, the topics or the people, uh, or the, or the folders, uh, from  Facebook. And so you get us, it's got time of day. It's got a, and then you, it's got a Amazon's  echo built in. So you can use, do some echo things. And if you want to call, you say, uh, hey portal,  call Jeff and it will call you and it'll do a video call. This is a very high def camera. It's  a 4k camera. And at first, it follows you too, right? Well, and at first everybody thought,  oh, ha ha, that's creepy. A Facebook camera that follows you around. And it does it very slowly  follows you around. But what I realized is that's not the real threat here. The real threat is  Facebook has a wide angle 4k picture of your room at all times. Handy. So following you is just a  side effect of how high resolution this is. So it could just take a portion of that. And, and,  and, you know, as you move, it does a good job, it follows you around slowly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, um, I think it was the wall street journal. Their review was this would be a great device

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if it came from literally any other. Russell Holly and Android, uh, at Android central said  it's his favorite way to video chat. It's a heck of a lot of fun. Uh, yeah, it would be so much cooler  if it didn't come from Facebook, but I mean, it's also expensive. Uh, the little one that  Russell's using, uh, is 200 bucks, but this giant one's $300. Uh, the sound quality is pretty good.  It does have Amazon's echo in it. So that's kind of cool. Although you can't do things like watch  YouTube videos. All the only thing the video is good for is, uh, is video conferencing.  So full review, I got two of them because I foolishly thought you had to have two,  but in fact you can call anybody with messenger and do a video phone call.  So you don't really need two of them, but, uh, I, anybody, I got them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anybody want to be on a permanent line? I think I'm sending one to my mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Otherwise, you know, there'd be only three people in the world. You could call who chose to buy that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but everybody has Facebook messenger. I called, uh, Lisa and she didn't even know I had it. And  she just picked up on Facebook messenger on her phone. And so I was able to see her and everything.  It does come with a handy dandy privacy cap for the camera, which I've already lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You put it on the desk. I thought it's just a piece. You did. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just a piece of pla- Oh, here it is. Yeah. Yeah. It's just literally a piece of pla-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's otherwise known as an afterthought. Better than duct tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And privacy is always an option. You just put it right over that there and then no one can see you  from Facebook. It's the video chastity belt. Yeah. I suppose the microphone still works, but maybe not.  Um, I think it's kind of cool. In the, in the, uh, Russell Holley's review,  he talks about the good things and he says, among the bad things,  Facebook has partial access to a camera and microphone in my house.  But I don't think, I mean, honestly, I don't think Amazon's listening to you.  I don't think Google's listening to you and I don't think Facebook's listening and looking at you.  But nevertheless, the optics, if you will, or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember when, um, to remember when the first reports came out that, um, AT&T had allowed  the NSA to, to basically tap into one of its main, uh, lines and they were basically,  you know, recording phone calls all across the US.  Yeah. They had a room in the San Francisco switching office.  Yeah. So the, I remember talking to someone at the time and like when the news first started  coming out and like, if you actually did that, there would be so much data.  You can't.  There would be no way you could A, store it, B, search it, C, do anything with it.  It would just be impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. I'm going to log in just so you can see it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That looks really heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You're not, it's not portable. It has a handle, but it's not,  it's not that heavy, but you're not going to carry it around.  It's a big box.  It's ungainly. Yeah, that's what it is. So you're not going to carry it around.  You're going to put it somewhere where you want to make, uh, you know, make video calls.  You got to go to facebook.com slash device and then enter in this code, W F Y Q M Y.  And then don't ask me to confirm my login again. Okay. Uh, confirm.  And I am, uh, I think I'm logged in success. Now I can show you  there's, there you are.  It has a Pandora and Spotify on it. Uh, I'm going to call this one kitchen.  Cause that's where it's going to end up.  That's where to call me.  I can call you. Should I call you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure. Hold on. Let me just see. What if I call you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, I don't know what will happen. That's it.  That's let's give it a shot.  You want to see how the smart camera works?  Here's how the smart camera works. Turn on the camera and microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Says it's calling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it is. Yeah. Well, I hear something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do you answer it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm, uh, wait a second.  Don't do anything. Was it calling you?  Don't do anything yet.  No, I was calling. I was using text. Okay. Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't do anything yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I wasn't. It wasn't me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tap the center button on the top of the portal to turn them on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now I'm calling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, hi, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at that. I got double Jeff.  Wow.  See, I thought I could really use this as the, um, as the, uh, for the show.  Now watch, I know.  Okay. So watch now you see me now watch. I can dodge out of the way  and the camera will follow me slowly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Only you can see that though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know we're, we're setting a camera up so that you can see it. Um, here we go.  So as I move around the camera, because it's just a slice of the 4k camera,  I can't get away from it, but it doesn't move real fast because otherwise,  but this is the best part. Ready? Jeff, get ready for this.  You're going to like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, oh no, not that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. This.  Come on. Do it. Do it, man. Do it. Do I have to drag it? What is the story?  Is it filters? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it going to, ah, hello Jeff. What do you think? I, uh, I am, uh,  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hello. It's actually very good. It's actually very, it does a very good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I think Apple does similar things, but what it's doing is I'm, I'm putting faces on.  Yeah. It's kind of a Snapchat filter effect and, uh,  I wonder where they got that idea. Yeah. Yeah. Where do they,  where do they think of this? There was some scary Halloween filters. I can't,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't find them. I can't filter. I can't put filters on though. Yeah, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where are they? They're in there. I don't see them. They're in there somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey Jeff, come on over. We're having a party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Where are they? They're out there. I can add people. No, you don't want to do that.  Um,  oops, I lost you. Oh no, I lost you. Can you see the tears coming out of my eyes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no, I can't find you anymore. Don't show Jeff. Just show me. There you go.  So you get the idea. Here's a strawberry hat.  It's your hoof ding. It's my hoof ding. I got my hoof dings on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. Hi Jeff. It's amazing what technology can do. How useful it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What life would be without this. So I mean, this is kind of cool. This is pretty well done.  The face recognition is very good. Yeah. Yeah. The blues brothers. What do you want?  Uh, I don't know what this one will do or why. Okay. Uh, apparently I have a, uh,  it looks like a panda bear on my head. Uh, flying an airplane, it's my airplane hat.  Here's a, for relaxation, there's a cat. It is very realistic. Wow. You know,  it is. What do you think, Jeff? I like it. I like it. I could turn it, uh, I could turn it this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although I think you're mostly going to want to use it that way. I'll do the same thing. Yeah.  Oh, funny. I, I, I, I wrote it. You should leave yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In a horizontal, leave yours in landscape mode. Um, anyway, I don't know. What, what do you think?  That's actually pretty cool. I don't mind. I don't, I honestly don't fear Facebook in my,  you know, spying on me. Why would they, what would they gain that? You know, um, I think though that  you know, clearly this is a product they had for a while and they, and they just kind of finally  said there's no good time to put this out. Let's just put it out now. Let's say it was not popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We'll blame it on Elliott Shrink. Right. It's Elliot's Elliot, the outgoing portal guy.  This is my favorite one. It's the first use of AI of, of, of, uh, uh, what are we trying to say?  Augmented AR. Yeah. That kind of just, it's pretty good. Fluidly fits. Yeah. Obviously. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  one thing Facebook does have is really good engineers. And I wonder if Colleen Kelly,  our former video engineer who works at Facebook now doing a lot of video stuff for them. I wonder  what her hand was in this. Cause she works at Facebook. Yeah. She works at Facebook. One of  the things that I, um, we really wanted to do with our avatars, you know, when for those of you who've  seen our video, we have Jeff and Matthew in television screens, but they're in landscape  mode. I really prefer to have them in portrait mode. And I asked Colleen, I said, can we do that?  And she said, she looked into it and she said, not really. It needs some pretty expensive gear.  And I find it interesting that this is really designed to be in portrait mode. So Leo, you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  going to, you're going to send those to all of us then for Christmas. Is that the deal? You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what? The only reason I actually, my initial thought was this would be awesome for the show.  I just put these on the table with me and, uh, and I guess we just do it like that.  But, um, I realized that there's no way to get a feed back to you except from this camera.  Yeah. Right. So I'm watching the wrong thing. We don't have really a way to get a feed out of it,  except to shoot it. So I don't want to put that in my suitcase. Yeah. Well, there's a smaller one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't do this with mine. It doesn't, it doesn't let me do these things. You don't have those

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  things. Oh, no, I don't. You can't have a cat on your head. They may be denying. They may be  delaying. They may be deflecting, but they're pretty damn good. Put it a cat on my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And at the end of the day, at the end of the day, isn't that what matters? Matthew Ingram,
