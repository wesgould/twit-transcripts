This Week in Google, the show that talks about, and somebody emailed me and said, boy, with  what's going on right now with Amazon, you really should say This Week in Amazon and  Google or we'll just say This Week in Google and the cloud.  How about that?  Our guests as always today, Gina Tripani from SmarterWear.org.  Hi Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hello, great to be here.  Great to see you as always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, who's at a conference right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For continuing care, assisted living facilities.  I mean, communities.  Are they interested in the Google?  Yeah, they are actually.  It's a business like every other and they have all kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not speaking to the old folks, you're talking to the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, to the people who own the places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, Jeff is the author of this great book, What Would Google Do?  And his new book, Public Parts, went to the printers, right?  Went to the copy editor, yep.  Oh man, there's another layer.  There's another layer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Congratulations.  I know it's a series of steps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes it is.  Yes it is.  Bit by bit, inch by inch, death by a thousand cuts.  Paper cuts, yes.  Paper cuts.  And good news, we've got Chris DeBona with us.  Very kind to allow us to defer and defer and defer and we're glad to get you on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just not that important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are super important.  You never have had skull surgery and has the things still attached to him.  Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I'm wearing...  So I couldn't find my regular sort of like discreet, lovely Jeff D'Arvids-esque headset  and so I decided to go with really big.  He's wearing his gamer headsets.  It was actually they had it at the tech stop here so I was like, yeah, I just need one  with like a mic and a USB interface.  I'm telling you they're gamer headsets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just resist the urge to say, I'd T-bag you.  Okay?  I wouldn't say that.  I'm not political.  You're not that kind.  Yes, you're not political.  Chris, first of all, is an old friend of course.  He came on regularly on the screensavers to talk about open source software.  He was at SourceForge where he was involved in that...  Actually, it wasn't SourceForge.  You were responsible for SourceForge.  It was VA Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, responsible is a strong word.  I named it and I'll defend that to my death but the other guys wrote the code and I just  made...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He just gave it the name, that's all.  And he's now at Google.  He's a program manager for their open source projects, quite a few of them as you might  imagine at Google.  Code.google.com is a place to go to find out about that.  In fact, it is the summer of code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we just launched student applications.  So we've already gotten a couple of thousand student applications in.  Would you tell us what that is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Last year, Google bought advertising on our open source show.  Oh, we should have done that again.  Which Chris hosted, by the way, in the early days, Floss Weekly.  Randall Schwartz has ably taken over.  Is that still going on?  Oh, yeah, we just did it this morning.  It's been fast.  The thing about Randall, you were so busy, it was hard to get a weekly show out of you.  And I kept erasing the shows, which didn't help.  That did not.  Brian Aker will never forgive me for that.  But three times we had to talk to him.  After I erased it accidentally the second time, I sent him a basket of coffee goods.  And just really felt terrible.  But we finally did get that Brian Aker interview on the air.  Randall Schwartz took over a couple of years ago.  He's done a great job.  He's been alive.  Well, he's kept it alive.  He really and I really appreciate it.  But both of you, of course, are great, great friends of open source.  And I brought that up for some.  Oh, yes, because Google sponsored Floss Weekly last summer.  Didn't do it this year.  But nevertheless, Chris, here's your chance to put in a big plug because I think this  is a great program that Google does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if people are in university or attached to a university in some strange way, you can  try out for the Summer of Code.  You basically apply to take part in the program.  Various open source organizations work with us to mentor students through the summer.  And we pay you if you're successful.  If you meet the goals of the program, you get paid $5,000 the course of the summer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yeah, so it's pretty good.  It actually starts with companies who have open source projects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some companies, but mostly just pure sort of open source projects and organizations  like Python, Apache, and all the names you'd expect to see.  So they apply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you pick the 107 projects?  170 different projects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had about 600 apply this year.  And it's always heartbreaking because they're all so great.  Well, most of them are.  And we have to pick really a smaller number than we wish we could because we're spending  about $7 million on the program this year.  We want to make sure that the organizations that are taking part get a good flow of students.  And so that restricts the numbers we can take on because we're accepting 1,200 students  this year.  So yeah, it's really something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you go to code.google.com slash soc, you can find out more.  This is, and let me encourage students, computer science students to follow up on this.  This is a great way to get an experience of working for an open source project, to get  paid while you're doing it, which is great.  Often, many of these students go on to very successful careers as coders, sometimes for  open source, sometimes not.  It's a really great thing for your resume.  Gina, how's your coder of less than we're doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hear people from other companies, even folks like the Facebooks and Microsoft the world,  they said, if I see a successful Summer of Code student, I can almost guarantee that  they'll get hired.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That says it right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's great.  Jeff, what did you say?  I was going to ask Gina how her Summer of Code person worked last summer if she knows  where he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because we fail people if they're bad.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we had a great experience.  I was a mentor in last summer, Summer of Code, and myself and my other lead developer were  mentors and we had two great students and it was really, really successful.  My student built the installer for ThinkUp, so you don't have to edit any config files.  It's kind of a wizard that steps you through a three-step installer.  Our other student built a Google Map of geo-visualization of tweets and replies and retweets.  It was amazing.  It was such a good experience that we continue to do mentoring programs in-house at ThinkUp  because it was such a great way to develop.  Our students were so smart and they were so eager and they wanted to do such a good job.  In fact, one of the two students that we mentored during last summer is still very active in  the project and still contributing, which is awesome.  It's a great program for students and mentors.  I highly, highly recommend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why does Google do this, Chris?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We started because Larry felt that there were a lot of computer science students that weren't  doing computer science over the summer and wanted to figure out a way of productively  pay them to work on coding and to retain their edge instead of having that summer drop-off  in knowledge and sort of like the momentum of their computer science career and study.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's purely pro-bono?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, pretty much.  I mean, if you look at the rules, we don't even require that the organizations accept  the code even if they pass the student.  Because we didn't want there to be a situation where the student wrote good things, but it  really wasn't quite right for the organization.  But probably about a third of the students go on to keep working on their projects and  making sure they're integrated with their mentors project and remain members of that  community, which is pretty exciting.  Especially when you consider these guys, they're going back to school, these guys are going  back to school.  So it's pretty nice.  And then we do feel that open source has done an awful lot for Google and for the internet,  and it seems this is a pretty good way of giving back.  It creates more open source developers, it creates more open source code, and those are  things that are actually really, really hard to make happen.  So it's sort of like a really nice sweet spot.  And there's a lot of love for the program internally.  If you talk to like Alan Eustis, who's one of our senior VPs of engineering, and he just  he loved the program.  So even if I go away, I know the Summer of Code would just be great here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, thank you for doing that, Chris.  Really appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I've got a great team that does all the work, Carol and Cat, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are going to put Chris on the spot in a little bit because there's a little talk about  Android, whether it's open or not.  This was Larry Page's first week as CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, Monday was a big day.  Everything's different.  And everything's changed.  Everything's blue now.  We've got paper in this room over here.  And there was a big exit.  From Eric to Larry, you know, in our shrines.  We're going to talk about that in just a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And also, I'm going to challenge myself.  You see these, these are two tablets.  This is the iPad 2.  The iPad 2 running iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is...  Did you call Steve and see if it was okay to turn it on before doing anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I had to get permission.  She likes to have control.  This is a Zoom.  Now, I know how to turn on the iPad 2.  In fact, if I lift the magical revolutionary cover, it just turns itself on.  But I'm a little puzzled.  There's no on-off switch.  So I, in a moment, when we return, I will attempt to turn on the Zoom.  Yes, it's an exciting new feature.  How do you turn on the Zoom?  Coming up with this week in Google First, though, I'd like to mention one of our great  sponsors, the great folks at carbonite.com, backup Kings extraordinaire.  My kid was in here a few minutes ago, and he's a great example of how the Cobbler's  kids have no shoes.  So he's been making a lot of music.  He uses Logic Express, and he's really into it, like morning, noon, and night.  And I was very supportive of it.  But his hard drive died on his iMac.  He came downstairs and said, Dad, I can't, the computer won't boot.  And I said, oh.  And I said, you've been backing up, right?  And he said, what?  And I thought, that's really not his fault.  It's my fault.  And he lost everything he'd worked on for about six months.  Now, fortunately, I was able to recover that drive thanks to some wizardry that I've learned  in the past.  But man, next time, from now on, carbonite.com, because it's automatic cloud backup.  So even if you're backing up locally, which he's also doing, I brought up an external  hard drive, and it's automatically using ChronoSync to back up to that.  I have a network attached.  Storage is backing up to that.  And I have carbonite.  He's never going to lose any data again.  While you're online, carbonite trickles your data back up to the internet, where it's always  safe.  The nice thing about this, $55 a year is unlimited storage, all the personal stuff in your internal  drive.  So I don't have to worry about how much music he's making.  I don't get teared up.  The price doesn't suddenly go up.  I buy a year's subscription.  I know that's good for the next 12 months.  And I have to say, it's really cloud storage.  If $55 sounds like a lot, look at how much it costs just to do 50 gigs on Dropbox.  This is half that, less than half that.  And it's just like Dropbox in the sense that I can log on to my carbonite account on any  computer on my iPhone, my Android phone, my BlackBerry.  There's my data.  I can access it and use it even before disaster strikes.  Carbonite is so great.  You get your data back with a couple of clicks of the mouse.  It's PC or Mac.  Cloud storage, encryption, of course, 128-bit SSL to the cloud.  You can also add, I think it has Blowfish and Triple Desk encryption available so you  can have completely secure private data.  Look, try it for two weeks free.  Carbonite.com offer code TWIG.  Please do use that offer code so we get credit for that.  T-W-I-G.  And that's two weeks free, no credit card or anything, just the word TWIG.  And if you decide to buy, continue to use that offer code.  When you buy, check out for the year subscription because that 12 months turns into 14 months  automatically.  You get three with your subscription if you use the offer code TWIG.  Carbonite.  You got to back it up to get it back so do it right.  Carbonite.  Okay, now don't laugh at me.  I'm sure there's an easy way.  There's no buttons on the front.  I was a good five minutes, Leo.  So you and Gina both have one.  All three of you have one.  I'm sure Chris has one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was in the store.  Okay, nothing there.  Nothing on the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did the same exact thing.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, don't tell them the secret word.  Is this it?  This must be it.  Yay.  So there's a button on the back.  That wasn't that hard.  Once you know it.  And it even has like a little icon.  13 seconds.  That wasn't bad.  It has an icon with on, off and lock.  So now what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Slide.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's cool.  App Store.  Oh, you installed the new Amazon App Store.  Yeah, that's nice.  Now there was an interesting story that said that Steve Jobs actually vastly overestimated  the number of native honeycomb applications.  He said hundreds.  There's about 17 or something like that.  Top right apps.  Okay.  There we go.  So let's say Beluga.  Now that's written for Android phones, but that scales perfectly nicely.  I mean, it's got a lot of stuff on the right there, but that's okay.  If I go in there, the message is, that's fine.  That's all they mean is it doesn't, it's like not taking advantage of the real estate.  So what do you think, Gina?  You've had it for a couple of weeks now.  Are you happy with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like it.  I like it a lot.  The only app that I've found that doesn't run full screen is Mint, which I guess, you  know, when they built the app, they just said it should be this size, but everything else  kind of fills the screen.  I like it very much.  I like the Gmail client a lot.  I mean, the Gmail client is kind of like, is what a real honeycomb app looks like, you  know, taking advantage of all those screen real estate.  It's one of the 17.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you know, honestly, Gmail, the Gmail app is the reason why I'm on Android to begin  with is I live my life in Gmail and it's just the best client anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, this is pretty nice.  This is very, very usable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's slid over like that.  I like that.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Angry Birds is obviously awesome.  Love the Kindle app and InstaFetch.  I'd like to read my kind of, you know, read it later things from InstaPaper.  So I like it very much.  It crashes once in a while.  It still feels a little half baked here and there.  And it's heavy.  Like you said, it feels a little heavy.  It is when you compare it to the iPad too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels a little heavy.  But you're saying, Chris, that it's how many, how many apps are there now, Chris?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know the exact number, but it's well over 17.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's 20, 25, 100.  It doesn't matter.  The truth is if most apps look fine, I don't think that makes a big difference.  Yeah, most of them scale just like no problem.  The issue though is how well this and the Atrix are doing, the two Motorola products.  This one is the first honeycomb tablet.  The Atrix is that dual core phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Atrix has that thing where you can dock it in a laptop.  I've never tried that before.  Yeah, for 500 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've tried it.  It's kind of nutty because it's so expensive.  Is it nutty as meat though?  I mean, you know.  Well, here's the deal.  You get a little docking station that's about the same size and weight as a netbook for  $500 over and above the phone.  And it's running kind of Linux.  It's not a kind of familiar operating system.  I don't think it's selling that well.  In fact, that's the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you think the Asus one will do?  You know, the one with the built-in, you could slide it off the keyboard dock thing.  You know?  I haven't seen that one.  Have you seen that one?  No.  Yeah, it's coming out in America-ish.  Android?  Yeah, no.  So it's running Honeycomb and then you can just use it as a 10-inch tablet and then you  can also dock it in this keyboard battery-based thing that makes it look like a netbook, but  it still runs Honeycomb.  Oh, that's interesting.  So then it turns it into a tablet.  It can do like an extra eight hours of battery and everything.  It's pretty, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about Andy Rubin saying Honeycomb, we kind of rushed it.  It wasn't ready.  It's, and then actually let's put you on the spot, open source program manager.  What about the people who say, ha ha, see, we told you, Android's not open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what I want you to do is whenever you read an article like that, see if they conclude  with and therefore I'm going to use an iPhone.  Yes, almost always.  Because it's like, you know, that's not ever open source at all.  Not even close.  So, you know, we've delayed the release of Honeycomb's stuff.  It's still compliant with the open source licenses for the GPL and LGPL components.  That's all fine.  But the Apache stuff, which is what most people think of as Android, we're just delaying it  until later.  When we brought out Honeycomb, it wasn't that we rushed it out so much as we, if we put  that on the phone, it would be terrible.  And it wouldn't look right.  And we haven't harmonized that for the phone.  The UI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how, so Android is open source in the sense that it is the open handset alliance.  There is a source code base.  Google adds stuff on top of it, but each new version Google holds onto the source code  for a while, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Only recently did we ever delay.  So before Honeycomb, we actually commonly always released by first customership, but  commonly released up to a month ahead of time.  So this was the first time we actually delayed.  But why hold it at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not have it in, you know, on code.google.com?  Why not just keep the source up there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, Andy really feels that to reduce the chance of people installing this on phones  and reducing fragmentation that we should delay it this time.  Does that make it not open source?  It makes Honeycomb not open source.  Okay.  Yes.  It doesn't make Android not open source though.  And I know that seems like splitting hairs, but basically up through gingerbread, it's  all there.  All the code is there.  You can't take it back.  We wouldn't take it back.  And we're committed to open sourcing the code.  So it's just a matter of time.  What is the license?  So it's Linux on the bottom.  So Linux is GPL.  And then we have various system utilities, some of which are GPL, but most of them are  BSD.  And then you have the Android frameworks and UI and the rest.  And those are Apache.  And then there's some proprietary software like Gmail client is proprietary, the Maps  client is proprietary, and that's just proprietary software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I mean, I don't see how you can say something that's licensed to BSD or GPL or Apache is  not open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, people are a little upset because they want honeycomb out now in total.  They don't just want the kernel and the rest.  They want everything.  And I understand that desire, but they'll be satisfied when we do it.  Unfortunately, they won't be satisfied until we do it.  And so some people don't go from love to respect.  They come from love to hate.  Right.  There's no middle ground.  And so all I'll say is that we know and it'll come out.  But sorry, it's not out yet.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, you got anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's reasonable.  To me, Android is open enough.  I mean, the thing that people are upset about, it's like open source.  It's not open unless the source is released.  Right.  Honeycomb source isn't released.  That's why Chris just said honeycomb is an open source, but Android is.  Leo's question is, do you define open source as I get to see the day's commits that night  versus kind of dropping it kind of later on?  To some people, to the purists, that doesn't necessarily jive.  And the thing I keep hearing is Google is using the open word as a marketing gimmick  versus they're not walking the talk.  I don't necessarily think that.  When you're kind of going to base Android's whole cells, developers and end users to some  extent and handset makers as it's open, not releasing the source, it feels uncomfortable.  I wish that we had a date.  We had an idea.  Like Chris, can you say that honeycomb will drop sometime this year or this quarter?  I mean, honestly, I don't want to put you on the spot.  But I feel like that would-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's okay to put me on the spot.  I can't actually answer the question, though.  I can't answer it for Andy.  I can't answer it for the Android.  So it wouldn't be right for me to do so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there a chance that honeycomb will never drop but it'll incorporate the honeycomb changes  into the next version that will be phone ready and tablet ready?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean, that code's moving forward.  It's not like we're going to pretend that honeycomb didn't exist.  That's likely at all.  I think the best-  What I would say, the funny thing about Google is we've done a lot of open source projects.  We've done Chromium.  We've done Android.  We released 400 different projects last year.  So if you look at Google, we have every kind of project that will either make you happy  as an open source advocate or make you unhappy.  We have ones that are just pure API releases that won't work if Google goes away, and we  release them once.  We have Chromium, which is this huge project, and they do all their development pretty much  in the open, almost universally.  It's like, so we have our prod kernels, which do a ton of patches out to the mainline kernel.  We have the Android kernel, which does some funny things with wake locks, and so we're  only now finally getting more mainlining.  So basically, you can pick and choose.  If you want to be upset at Google, you can find something that'll make you upset.  If you want to be really happy about Google, I can point out a million things that'll make  you happy.  So it comes down to how can we do what's best for the product and what's best for the open  source community and do those converge.  A lot of times they do.  Sometimes it gets kind of weird.  That's just the nature of being in a very large organization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also the nature of, and it's a slippery slope of providing a handset operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and remember, we have people who are making phone calls with this stuff.  It's not just a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not Chrome OS.  It's something very different.  Network operators and handset manufacturers both weigh in with their requirements here.  I'm not defending it, but I just ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, you don't need to.  Mobile though is substantively different than shipping a computer.  There are regulatory requirements that are incredibly difficult to navigate.  There are all kinds of things.  We set out to change the world of mobile with Android, and part of that strategy was open  sourcing.  If you look at what Android has done and how many people have taken it and run with it,  can you picture an Amazon app store or an iPhone?  No way.  It's in the nature of Android to help that kind of thing happen.  Yeah, I think that it's important.  It's still very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You feel confident ... I'm not asking you for a commitment, although I'd like to, but  I don't think it's yours to make, but you feel confident that the source will be released  at some point.  Yeah, I do.  I do.  Obviously, only Andy Rubin can make that commitment.  He might not even be able to make that commitment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The way that Andy works and the way that Android works is instead of making commitments, instead  of going on programs and talking, I'm more echoing, I guess, but they'll just do it.  That level of communication is probably what frustrates some people, but in some ways the  Android team is just more introverted when it comes to the rest of the world of open  source.  I think that comes out of coming out of the mobile world.  Mobile companies are used to talking in a certain way with each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't want openness at all.  It's amazing you could even get close to open on a handset, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're sensitive.  Some of those sensitivities might be overwrought, but they are sensitive.  We want them to like Android.  We want them to use Android.  That means we have to work with them, and we want to work with them.  If you look at what Android's been able to pull off over the last three years, it's pretty  amazing.  The number of carriers and handset manufacturers that have adopted Android, it's pretty great.  The nature of the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking at, I think the most cogent of the arguments came from Ryan Paul and Ars  Technica.  What he says, and I think this is legitimate, is that it creates uncertainty.  He says, unfortunately, the utter lack of transparency surrounding Android development  and the absence of a public roadmap make it impossible to guess if or when Honeycomb will  be released.  The lack of code availability is especially bad for enthusiasts who are hoping to be  able to install custom firmware on their Android tablets.  But ultimately, he says, even after the matter was resolved, the fact is that Google is willing  to withhold source code at its whim for competitive reasons.  Might argue about what the reasons are, but is going to cast a dark shadow over the company's  increasingly hollow claim that Android is an open platform.  That's an angry thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was quite a rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's an angry man.  The one thing that I do say is absolutely true is it creates an uncertainty, a cloud  of uncertainty.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure.  I mean, think about it.  When we announced Android, I think it was in 2007 or something crazy like that, there  was no code for a year.  When we brought out the first rev of Android, there wasn't even a phone that was running  it for another, I think, three weeks.  There's always going to be uncertainty.  The world of software is not certain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is certain?  The problem with purists is that life is not pure.  I mean, I'm going to come off like Google Family Boy again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would say to the purists, if they want purity, I have gingerbread.  Gingerbread is purity.  Gingerbread is enthusiasm.  Fully open sourced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all out there except for the top layer that's Google juice only, Gmail and stuff  like that.  All the rest of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And those people don't care about that.  I think that's an interesting point too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's not really been an immediate...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that a roadmap that will satisfy enthusiasts would be very, very difficult  to come up with.  I think they have roadmaps that they share with handset manufacturers and carrier partners  who are committed to shipping hundreds of thousands of units a day.  And so they prioritize.  Yeah, I agree.  This is the difficult part of being...  They ship the hardware because they're the ones making the multi-billion dollar commitments  to the platform.  That's the problem of being...  And that's really hard for people to hear because open source doesn't work that way.  It doesn't work on commitments of shipping tens of thousands of units a day or hundreds  of thousands of units a day.  They work on the idea that developers can have control over their individual piece of  hardware.  But when we have to pay attention to the 350,000 plus devices that are shipping every day,  it means that you end up walking a little bit away from the people who can't ship that  many.  And that kind of stinks, right?  Am I not popular enough?  Well, you are.  But right now, we have to concentrate on the future of the platform.  And that means the people who will make that future, which frankly kind of isn't the enthusiast  community.  That said, if you look at the application developers, we try to cater to them like crazy.  And they are being well-served by the SDKs and all the rest.  So it's really tough because these are my friends.  I hate seeing them unhappy.  And these are people who I'm also paid to care about, but I also care about them.  So I want to satisfy them.  But right now, satisfaction with Android means let me introduce you to Gingerbread and Honeycomb  will come later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The opposite of this would be OpenMoku, which was a fully open cell phone platform that  didn't go anywhere because you couldn't get a handset manufacturer to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, OpenMoku tried, right?  And then they did some really remarkable things for what they had.  So good on them.  Same thing with MeeGo and Symbian.  They've all tried open source.  Open source is really hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard to do in that space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Android's kicking ass.  Android's kicking butt, right?  So the question becomes, so open source is really hard.  Sailor is really hard.  Mobile is really hard.  UIs are really hard.  All this stuff is really hard.  And the punishment for failure is you lose a lot of money.  You lose a lot of time.  You lose 400 engineers working night and day, weekends for four years.  It's a tough commitment to make.  And then many people simply fail when they try it.  Think of all the mobile OSes that simply aren't around anymore.  Can you picture the Sony Ericsson mobile in your mind anymore?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I really don't want to picture the Android robot with his son on thumbs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they really like Android.  That's great.  But they also see it as a way of, wow, we don't have to develop our own operating system  anymore.  That's really good for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that was, I'm sure, why Nokia took a billion dollar payout from Microsoft and said,  okay, forget Symbian.  We didn't really like that anyway.  And I'm not going near that.  So Larry's first week as CEO.  Where is Eric?  He's writing a book, I heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he was working with a co-writer by the name of Jared Cohen on a book.  But I have no idea what the status is.  Eric and I, we don't hang out.  I don't know if you know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know of editors who've seen the book proposal.  Is it tell-all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it'll say all of the nasty things.  No, I don't.  I have to be honest with you.  So Eric is going to write, I'm sure, a very interesting book.  And I'm going to read it.  I have no idea what it's about.  We will too, of course.  No matter what.  I understand it's a historical romance based in the 1800s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Larry Page takes power and Jonathan Rosenberg exits senior vice president of product management.  Yes.  Hard not to draw a connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to let someone else draw that connection because I honestly have no idea.  What do you think, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was Jonathan Eric's man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I've heard and seen, but it's not much more than anyone else has, is just that it's  number one, one word was that Larry wanted a long-term commitment from people, which  I understand that to be built.  He's building his team now.  That's interesting.  And he's going to depend upon his team.  And then secondly, that you're bound to have changes in how things operate.  And I don't know that it was Larry versus Eric because the, tell me if I'm wrong, Chris,  but I doubt you really could have much of the way of camps because you had to please  all three all the time, pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, you know, the times when I've had to go for them for approval for things, you  know, I know it's all three of them in the room.  It always seemed extremely collegial.  They all seem to work really well and productively together.  So it's hard to, it's hard to criticize, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He wrote the, the meaning of open memo.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a great memo.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right at the end of December, right?  Right before the holidays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So have you seen, I mean, have they changed the paint scheme?  Anything going on around there that's a little different now with Larry?  Yeah.  We installed more electric car parking.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's funny is, you know, Eric, you know, transitioning to the, I guess the chairman  role or whatever was, I guess, almost a month and a half ago now.  Right.  And I guess, you know, I sort of like, oh, okay, it's changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, you kind of expect at a company that size business as usual, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, I mean, you know, Eric had been here almost a decade, right?  So it's a long time, right?  So yeah, you know, it was okay.  And, you know, I have nothing but respect for Larry.  So, you know, I don't just say that because he's the boss.  He's always kind of a good guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I may go a little valley wag on you though here.  Okay.  According to search engine land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Search engine land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Chris Sherman writing, Eric Schmidt apparently tried to get the search results.  This is an excerpt from Stephen Levy's book, In the Plex.  Asked Google to remove search results about a political donation that he had made according  to Stephen Levy writing.  One day Denise Griffin got a call from Eric Schmidt's assistant, quote, there's this  information about Eric and the indexes, she told Griffin, and we want it out to her credit,  by the way, or to Google's credit.  They did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which I think is important.  They did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was the best part of that.  If this is true, it's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is from the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of Stephen's book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Stephen's going to be on the show at the end of the month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, excellent.  I love Stephen.  He's great.  Guy that wrote Hackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm really excited.  He's performing, performing, doing a reading at the Computer History Museum, I think tonight.  Oh, neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, very cool.  Griffin explained that it wasn't Google's policy to take things like that out of the  index just because people didn't want it there.  After she hung up the phone, she freaked out.  Doesn't Eric know we don't do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's my favorite line.  Doesn't Eric know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't know when this happened.  I mean, it might have been maybe it was his first day.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it was so long ago that a certain Facebook executive was the one who supposedly said no.  Oh, that's Cheryl Sandberg.  Cheryl Sandberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.  Yeah.  It was awesome.  She did a really good TED Talk recently.  I don't know, a few.  But she's at Facebook now.  But she did a great TED Talk about sort of women in the workplace.  But I love that she supposedly was the one who said, no, we're not taking it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Denise Griffin calls her boss Cheryl Sandberg.  And they had several conversations before they finally trudged up to Eric's office and told him it wasn't Google's job, nor should it be, to filter his personal information.  Sir.  And by the way, you can still get those search results for Schmitt's political donations.  I guess he didn't take a job as Secretary of Commerce.  Is that off the table?  Did Obama hire somebody?  We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know that he said the Secretary of Commerce was now the ambassador to China, which is  in a shing, sort of like you graduated to that.  So I guess the spot's open if you want it, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think Rosenberg will go to Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, gosh.  I have no idea.  I got all they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're building that nice new campus in the old Sun Campus in Menlo Park.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so I actually got to ask you, when I heard about them moving to the, well, we used to  call it Sun Quentin.  Sun Quentin?  Yeah, because it's basically at the end of Willow Road, right on the water, and to get  to it during traffic in the morning, it literally takes like 20 minutes to do the mile from  101 to that location.  I'm sure they're building a tunnel just for Facebook employees.  Unless they build like their own subway and their own monorail or something, I'm like,  wow, you just destroyed an hour's worth of productivity for every employee who works  on that site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem is, and probably much of the point of this is, don't leave.  Do not leave.  They give them three free meals a day.  They're having special cafes built by a very famous restaurant designer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, I'm sure they'll be lovely, but I mean, getting to work is going to be a huge hassle.  I'll never leave.  I'm telling you.  My sister actually used to work basically in one of the sublet buildings there, and  she's like, it's miserable.  It took her less time to get to Foster City every day.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, and I'm not trying to tease Facebook.  I mean, I have a lot of friends there.  I just, man, find somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've got Roman and Williams.  They did Breslin and the John Dory restaurants at the Ace Hotel in New York City.  It's going to be very trendoid.  Very beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, John Dory, that person did something else too that I really liked.  Anyways, it's not important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Roman and Williams.  Well, we can go to their website and find out more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Let's do that instead of doing the podcast.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The New York Times also knew that it was called Sunquentin.  That's good reporting.  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, that's kind of cultural out here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sunquentin.  Google is bidding $900 million for Nortel's patent portfolio.  Yep.  And they say they will use it as a defensive shield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is that how this works now?  They don't actually need any of the patents.  They just need to be able to have something to throw at others who would throw things  at them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, since we have articulated defensive patent policy at Google, it is worth saying  that the Nortel patents, you know, they cover a lot of areas around networking, which we  are very heavily invested in.  So it kind of applies, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say both Android and Chrome will benefit from this acquisition.  Yeah, we've talked about this before, Jeff, right?  It's like mutually assured patent destruction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  It's just the damnedest business we've gotten ourselves into is all I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you sue me over my patents, then I'll sue you over your, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The worst thing about it is it's so deleterious on people's time.  You end up spending time in depositions.  You end up spending time in court.  You end up spending a lot of money on lawyers.  It's just, it's a tax, really, on successful organizations.  And I don't think it really helps the quote, inventor, unquote, anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like Larry Lessig says about fair use.  That's a right only to hire lawyers.  And in this case, too, this is the legal full employment act.  And it's not doing what it's supposed to do, which is to improve innovation.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I have a lot of opinions, most of which I can't share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can read your mind, Chris.  It's okay.  You don't have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, when you said you couldn't share your opinions in the May 6 episode of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was that opinion?  What was that opinion?  Share it with us now.  I'm going to show you why I'm moving to Italy.  And it's not for the pasta.  Isn't this the most amazing story?  When I type Leo Laporte is into Google...  Oh, a legendary broadcaster.  Leo Laporte is an idiot, is a douche, is a Mac fanboy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Libel, the robots committed libel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get to sue.  Well, that's what Italy says.  And if I'm in Italy, I could win.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  Chris DeBona is here, program manager for Open Source at Google.  Great to have you, Chris.  Gina and Jeff also, we're talking about the Google and the cloud.  I'm going to talk a little bit more about the cloud Amazon style in just a little bit.  And of course, why I'm moving to Italy.  But it actually might be for the pasta, actually.  Pasta.  Pasta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  You might pass on, Leo.  Come on.  Pasta is always involved when you talk about Italy.  Trapani is a town, right?  Yes, it is in Sicily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's do it, baby.  Yeah, Trapani, here I come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meanwhile, in order to go to Trapani and live there for the rest of my life, I have to invoice  some clients.  And fortunately, I have a cheap and easy way to do it.  In fact, if you have fewer than three clients, it's free.  Three or less is free at freshbooks.com.  Actually, I discovered this about seven years ago now when I was still sending out invoices.  I started using FreshBooks.  Amber MacArthur told me about it.  And I tell you, it made me money because I hate invoicing so much.  If you're a freelancer, you know what I'm talking about.  I would forget.  I would put it off.  I sent a company invoices nine months old once and they said, no, no, we don't have  to pay you.  There's a statute of limitations.  I got the money, but it wasn't easy.  This changed my life.  Freshbooks.com.  You send them your logo and create on the website, you create these invoices that look  great, look professional, but they have a special feature that I really love, a pay  it now button so that your clients can just pay you.  In fact, they can even set up automatic payment through their credit card.  They also use 11 payment services, including authorized.net, PayPal, First Data.  Makes it very easy to get paid.  That means you're going to get paid more quickly.  In fact, according to FreshBooks users, they get paid on average 14 days faster than before  they started using FreshBooks.  Got old fashioned clients who still want paper invoices.  FreshBooks will stamp them.  Stamp them and mail them for you for an additional fee.  Not much.  Just a little bit over the postage.  I just love FreshBooks.  They even have an iPhone app that will automatically track hours and input it into the invoice  or you can do it on the web.  You can actually invoice from your iPhone.  I wish they'd had that in 2004.  I want you to give it a try for free.  FreshBooks.com.  Sign up today and you'll be in the drawing for a birthday cake.  It doesn't have to be your birthday.  A free birthday cake every day this month.  FreshBooks.com.  Try it for free right now.  Click that green button in the upper right hand corner.  We love them and I know you're going to love them too.  FreshBooks.com.  The easy way to invoice.  So what's the story?  Somebody sued because they didn't like the instant search results on Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Google Suggest in the drop down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I'm getting right here.  I go Leo Laporte is an idiot, a douche, a Mac fanboy.  That one?  I think Mac fanboy is the one you should sue about.  I want to sue him over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So don't you like the Mac?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this guy puts his name in and the suggestion autocompletes con and fraud or con man afterwards  and then he sues Google for libel and he wins.  This is in Italy.  And he wins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is really scary because it then makes Google responsible for the content of the  entire internet.  Exactly.  It's just.  Oh, you really want to eat that pasta knowing who makes it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not anymore.  This is what the court, let's see.  What did the court, I'm trying to find the court, what the court said.  I don't understand how this could even happen except that the judge in the court was a nitwit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, the judge is a nitwit and don't forget that there's a Google antipathy in  already in Italy where three executives in Italy have been found guilty of, I forget exactly  what the crimes were, but David and two others, I think.  Right, Chris?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a video on YouTube that they felt we didn't pull down fast enough.  That betrayed some Italian boys beating up on another Italian boy who's a special needs  kid.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to think somehow how this could be justified.  The only thing the judge might have thought is, well, clearly this is gaming, Google,  and that Google should be more insensitive to gaming or should it?  Who knows it's gaming?  Maybe it's like somebody's name, same name, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it could be a couple of things.  It could be lots of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It could be lots of things, but the precedent it sets is that it's the same worldview as  my dear friends in Germany, that they expect the internet to be controlled and packaged  like a medium and that they just don't understand what it is.  And they don't understand the freedom of speech issues, that that's like saying that you can  sue every library in Italy if it has a book you don't like in it.  Or it's like the libel tourism that we see in the UK, that if you say something, if I  bad about some scuzz bucket and one person in the UK reads it, then he can sue me in  the UK because the laws are better there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But why do I get Leo Laporte as a douchebag when Gina gets Gina Trapani as married?  Which is not right.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the problem here is that what we get down to is a lowest common denominator or highest  watermark, I guess, of idiocy that we become liable to.  So the EU, Vivian Redding, just put together a set of four principles for the internet,  one of which is that it makes sense on its face, but it doesn't in practice is that if  you have data in a service in Europe and the data is stored in the US, that it's now, she  would propose European law that it has to be stored under the same exact rules as Europe.  Well, if we grant that kind of reciprocity to the UK, the EU rather, I'm saying to the  What happens when China says, ah, we claim the same rule, right?  Then we're all ruled by the highest watermark of censorship, the highest watermark of controlled  and the internet cannot work that way.  By the way, Jeff, it's a funny story, but it's a dangerous mindset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, Google has a response to you.  Jeff Jarvis is an idiot.  Jeff Jarvis is a twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a compliment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It seems like it's just a fundamental misunderstanding that like this is content that Google is saying  that this person is.  And I mean, Google was doing some editing.  I mean, at the press event when Google announced the auto suggested in Irina Slutsky, didn't  she say?  I'm not sure how to say her last name, but her name, there were no suggestions for her

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because she was blocked because of the slut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right.  Slutsky, which she's not now.  I see.  But Google is doing some of that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know.  They're doing generic word cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Diana is doing safe search editing on suggestions.  Yeah, safe search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if the guy is a con though?  There's an issue here is that I'm going to go and use some company to fix my septic tank.  Do you not want to go to Italy again, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that what you're telling us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To Italy?  You're going to boycott?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, if you call him a con, he might, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He could sue you too.  It's sued, right?  Well, let's say that I go on and I use Google the way it's used, which is to find, you know,  a rotor or a septic tank cleaner.  And I'm comparing between three of them.  Well, one of them may be bad.  And there's reviews up all over saying the person's bad.  And Google ends up summarizing that as to say con, or in my case, perhaps the idea that  Dell sucked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to take a little break coming up Chipotle's hidden menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is my gift to you.  Oh, that was you, Jeff?  I thought that was Eileen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Awesome.  That was me.  I'm going to give you a full field report and you're welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is why people listen to this show.  You thought it was Google, the cloud, Amazon.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to admit, I'm actually really curious.  My daughter, we go to Chipotle probably once every two weeks, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why do they not advertise on this show?  I just baffled.  Because we got to give Leo...  Have you contacted them?  Yes.  They wanted to give us free tacos.  Free tacos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you give the code twig at the counter or something?  No, that would be good.  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The guy said, give us a proposal.  Oh, well, have we proposed?  I don't know.  Ask your staff.  I don't think so.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lisa.  Lisa!  All right.  We shall work on that.  We also have other news about Facebook, Google, Amazon.  Actually, kind of an interesting leak of the next Google Android marketplace with an interesting  application.  We'll talk about that in a second.  But before we do, I would love to mention our friends at Squarespace.com, the secret  behind exceptional websites.  Squarespace is just doing a great job.  I don't know if...

It's yours.  I think this is really a cool idea.  Squarespace.com slash twig.  We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  Chris Tabona is with us.  He's program manager for open source at the Google.  I guess I teased it so I better give it even though this really is like what you would  traditionally put it as the last story, the kicker, the silly season story of the show.  Is this the burrito?  Yes, Chipotle's secret menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I forget what's the blog there, Leo, on the list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is Sirius New York Eats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sirius Eats, yeah, New York.  Sirius Eats.com.  God bless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see, this is the beauty of network world.  Someone on Twitter, a twig fan, said, Jarvis, you got to go to this Chipotle.  And like me to that.  And this is a special Chipotle where there is a well-known chef.  No, this is in Manhattan, 18th and 8th.  I wasn't going to tell the world until I went first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  So you gave us some just random link.  Aha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the real link.  And so at 18th and 8th, they have a chef who's been working behind the counter there and  creating special stuff.  So the best part of this is that he has a chicken and pork chorizo meat selection in  addition to the usual chicken and beef and such and such.  And it is killer.  It is charred and spicy and wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they have margaritas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have margaritas, which is the other great part, which they make with Patron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patron!  Whoa!  Patron margaritas, I'm there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is true.  And they also do the pork and the beef differently.  Some of those things come in that, what's that way you cook it in the bag?  It's da-da-da-da.  Yeah.  They do it specially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do they call it?  El Pastor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that what they call it?  The sauces are all done differently in this store.  The beans are done differently in the store.  They use a different rice that's more kind of brownie stuff with stuff in it.  The tortilla is whole wheat.  It's like, you remember the bizarro episode of Seinfeld?  This is the bizarro chipotle.  But it's a test kitchen for them.  Yeah, it is, but it's public.  You wouldn't know a thing is different.  You wouldn't know anything at all, which is kind of brave of them because it's the old  Holiday Inn, no surprises, McDonald's all the same.  You go into this one and the flavors are just different and it's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chelsea's a pretty crazy neighborhood.  I like Chelsea.  I've always liked Chelsea.  I like Chelsea a lot.  I am so going to this store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm coming out to New York for Blog World in May.  Ah!  Field trip.  Why don't you come too, Gina?  We'll have a field trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm thinking about New York in May.  We'll talk offline.  What are the Blog World dates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to speak at Blog World too, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you?  Well, maybe we could all do the show from Blog World.  Blog World Expo.  Leo, we do it from Chipotle.  Well, that's what I'm thinking.  Maybe we could go from this Chipotle.  It is May 24th through 26th.  Oh, come on, Gina.  Just stay a little longer.  I'll see what I can do.  Stay a little longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I'll be in New York then.  I'll come by and have a talk with you.  Great, Chris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So anyway, that's my little gift for you.  Thank you.  I'm a Chipotle for lunch only guy.  But the other night I was teaching late and my wife said, the heck with you, I'm eating  first.  So, I went by there and I had a nice margarita, which I normally do.  I had the bowl with the chorizo and it was lovely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're making me so hungry.  Let's run through the last few stories so I can get the hell out of here.  Twitter's getting a tax break from San Francisco.  San Francisco has a fairly onerous...  Did that pass?  Yes.  San Francisco has a fairly onerous payroll tax, one and a half percent payroll tax, not  just on payroll but on stock options.  So when a company goes public in San Francisco, it costs millions.  They passed an exemption for, not just for Twitter, but from any company that's in kind  of the tenderloin, kind of the nasty areas of San Francisco.  Twitter's going to take over the old landmark on 10th and Market Street, which is just on  the edge of that area.  They say they'll save $21 million in payroll taxes over the next couple of years thanks  to this tax break in San Francisco.  I got no opinion on it.  I think it makes sense for the city to keep companies like Zynga and Twitter happy.  The commercial real estate prices, the employment in San Francisco is in great shape.  The economy's in great shape and it's because of the tech companies that are there.  So you want to keep them there.  There are a lot of people say, why should Twitter get a break?  Mad Men will be streaming on Netflix joining Glee.  Netflix is interesting.  I think that they're getting into the distribution business.  That's exactly what they're doing.  Mad Men is made by a company called Lionsgate and licensed to the movie, whatever, A&E,  whatever channel it was.  AMC.  AMC.  Right.  For millions of dollars.  They've made a secondary deal now for what's estimated to be a million dollars an episode  for all the seasons of Mad Men for streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rather than selling it to TBS or some other worse outlet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How long before they go right to Netflix and eliminate AMC entirely?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's already happened.  It's already happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we had it on the list last week.  That's right.  They're making some Netflix only products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First one series.  This is a beautiful, beautiful moment because it breaks open potentially the hegemony of  the old networks.  We'll once again ask, why do we need a network?  Why do we need a network?  At the editorial level that we don't really need.  Why do we need a cable company?  Why do we need all that stuff?  MSOs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The cable companies have really resisted a la carte pricing, which has been very frustrating.  To get the Sopranos back when I had cable, you would end up having to pay $150 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  HBO really didn't ever want to put that on iTunes or anywhere.  They realized that was where their money was.  Although you have to wonder if Netflix, at $7.99 a month for a streaming subscription,  are they going to make their million dollars an episode back?  Or is this just their way of saying, we want to be in this business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're right.  It's their way of saying that.  They can account for this in many ways.  It's not just on the money on the Netflix.  How many people now...  I'm going to confess something here, worse even than I go to Chipotle for dinner, which  is I don't use Netflix.  Netflix.com slash twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've been looking for people who don't use Netflix.  I don't think there are many, many of them.  Please sign up today.  I will.  I will.  And although that's the thing, this knocks me over the edge.  $7.99 and you can watch Mad Men, you can watch Glee.  I'm doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's great.  It's really great.  Totally worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Completely worth it.  I have to say, the other side of this equation is that now people with PlayStation 3s and  Xboxes and Wii's and Roku boxes, many new TVs, almost all the new Blu-ray players, they  all have Netflix streaming capability on a big screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But not Honeycomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not Honeycomb.  Not yet.  Not any Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not any Android yet.  Anyway, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was my line.  No, I don't blame you.  You can get it on iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can get it on Google TV, which is an Android build, but not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is on Google TV?  It is.  It is.  It's kind of the old interface, but yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's something related in a very different way that happened today.  God help me.  When I mentioned this name on the show, there are certain people who get all mad at me because  they don't love him.  But Glenn Beck is leaving Fox basically.  Is he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where's he going?  Is he going to join Dr. Laura and an unholy alliance to take over the world?  He's going to still provide some programming.  Gina, wait a minute.  I'm sorry.  Stop smiling.  You were really, you had a face.  That was a face.  Go ahead.  Where's he going?  Where's Glenn going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he's going to Fox or do some programming for him.  But the thing is that where's he going to go?  A reporter called me today about it and I said, he's going to go to the internet.  He's going to go direct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you've talked to Howard, I'm sure, about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'll reveal a secret now.  I've never said this out loud before, so I'll reveal it here.  Is that when the negotiations were going on with Sirius for Stern, I was asked to make  context for Stern and I made them with Google.  I made an introduction to Schmidt and it didn't happen.  Stern stayed, you know, he stayed a bit, you know, chicken or, you know, wise.  Maybe the world isn't ready.  So he's staying on Sirius for now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sirius offered Howard half a billion dollars.  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't blame the guy.  I wanted him to make the internet, but it's going to take one big star to make the internet  ready for stars.  I was hoping it was going to be Howard Stern.  I fear now it could be Glenn Beck, but you're going to see entire series start through these  new distributional ways and you're going to see stars who operate with great control in  this new way.  And so unfortunately, it could be Glenn Beck could become the hero of the internet.  How's that for turn your story, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could be Oprah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll take Leo over Glenn any day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to start crying in the middle of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm trying to get a raise here now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, we did give you a raise, by the way.  Just so you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina has Sultrapani there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yes, Mr. LaPorte, you're the best.  Obama's going to go to face speaking of Glenn Beck going to go to Facebook headquarters  to go to a town hall with Mark Zuckerberg.  And immediately the questions from many on the right.  Where's the Republican candidates?  When does Sarah Palin get her town hall at Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you just wouldn't you pay to watch Sarah Palin and Mark Zuckerberg and the lack of  ability to understand each other?  That would be a beautiful thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd pay to watch that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fortunately, these are not pay per view events.  Thank goodness.  I'd pay for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The New York Times, I'm not so sure that I'd pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's interesting.  Arthur Oaks Salzberger talking about the paywall at the New York Times.  First of all, said it didn't cost us 40 million dollars.  He didn't give a number, but he said it wasn't that much.  It's not accurate.  It's vastly wrong.  OK, fine.  Twenty million, whatever.  But what he did say is in response to the complaints that it's pretty darn confusing  because in fact, we were talking with Cory Doctorow this morning on triangulation.  If you didn't see it, tune in to Regulation 10.  He's great.  But Cory said, you know, the problem with his paywall, among other things, is it's too  darn confusing.  How do you know how many times you visited New York Times this month?  And to make it even more confusing, some visits don't count against the quota.  Salzberger said, we don't agree it's too complex.  It's new.  Let it breathe for a little bit before you make judgment.  It's like red wine.  We don't have any numbers.  I wish he'd said, you know, but he's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish he'd give numbers.  You know, and they complain at the Times how the Wall Street Journal gives no numbers for  anything.  And the assumptions about the Wall Street Journal's paywalls are all off, say, the people  at the New York Times.  But the New York Times should be transparent about this.  And it's good for the industry.  If they believe that pay works and is necessary for journalism, well, then they should do  it.  The other reason they should do it is that if it would only work for the Times and not  work for the Cleveland Plain dealer, then the Times should be aware of that because  the numbers I've gone through with some executives, you know, maybe it'll work at the Times and  I'll pay for it at the Times and I want the Times to succeed.  And, you know, that's all wonderful.  But just because it works for the Times does not mean it will work for anyone else.  The numbers are not going to stack up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little leak of the Android Marketplace 3.0, number of Android fan sites had it.  And among other things, look, here's an app, a music app.  It's the Android player with streaming.  Streaming capabilities.  Can it be true?  How do I find out if it's streaming?  Go into settings.  This is Eileen's phone.  Okay, we're going to go to settings.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Google account.  Stream music via Wi-Fi.  So there's streaming in here.  But what's missing in here is what are you connecting to?  So the presumption is this is going to connect to a Google streaming music service.  Yes.  Looks that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't have any success setting it up, though.  I mean, if you tap Google account, nothing was listed.  There's nothing hooked up.  Right.  That's just not hooked up yet.  But interesting, for sure.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder who would know anything about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder who we could ask.  If there was anybody...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could go out in the hallway and ask if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What outgoing open source guy do we know at Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, former open source program manager, Chris DePone.  Awkward.  Awkward.  I won't ask.  I won't ask.  But that's interesting, of course.  Amazon really with a preemptive strike.  Although I have a theory on this.  A couple of weeks ago said Amazon Cloud, actually a week ago Tuesday.  Still waiting for iTunes.  Apple obviously has been working on this.  They bought Lala.  They built this big network center.  Google Music.  We've heard rumors about this.  Everybody wants to get into this business.  I have a theory, though.  I think everybody was standing right on the edge saying of the cliff,  looking at the other guy, you're going to go?  And they tricked Jeff Bezos into jumping because now all the lawsuits from Sony  and everybody else hit Amazon first.  Let Amazon establish the legal precedent for doing this.  Record companies aren't happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Canary in the coal mine.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see if Amazon can get away with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just picturing the cliff actually.  One, two, three, psych.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Maybe that was that meeting with Steven and Eric at that cafe last year.  Maybe that's what they were talking about.  That was like a year ago.  I know.  Well, it takes a while.  Let's make Jeff jump.  Okay.  You can say one, two, three, and I'll go, and then we'll stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I hear this mad psychotic laugh fading off in the distance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, the crazy Jeff Bezos laugh.  But Jeff might have been right.  Bezos might have been right.  Maybe by first mover advantage, by getting this in there.  And a lot of legal experts say, no, he'll be able to survive a legal challenge to this.  Certainly Amazon thinks it's going to be.  However, there we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you wonder too whether Amazon is in a better position to survive it also because everyone is going to depend upon Amazon as the primary retail channel of the world.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'd say Sony and everybody else would far prefer Amazon to Apple.  Right.  And I'm sure they don't have any faith that Google could create a successful marketplace.  They've really not shown that they can do this.  In fact, I think Google's smart.  I think Google encouraging Amazon to do an app store and to do vetting and all of that.  That's good for Google.  We've talked about that before.  All right.  We've got to wrap this up because it's time for TNT.  Gina Trapani, your tool of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tip of the week.  Actually, yeah, this was kind of a big product launch this week.  I have to confess, I have not turned it on because I'm kind of funny about this location thing.  But Google Latitude added a feature.  If you if you enable it in the new Google Maps on Android, it basically tracks you where you go and where you've been.  And it gives you this private dashboard that shows you statistics about where you spend your time at work or at home.  And I haven't turned it on.  And actually, Leo, I wanted to ask you if you had turned it on because I invited you and you and Jeff and you both ignored my invite.  I did.  Because I'm a little funny about the location stuff.  I use Foursquare, but I only check in where I want to.  With Latitude, this is sort of like in the background tracking wherever you go.  I use this software called Rescue Time, which basically does the same kind of on my computer.  It watches all the different apps that I use.  But there's something about tracking my location.  Oh, yeah, that was my.  So Leo's got up on the screen right now.  Wrong tip.  This is my backup.  This is my backup tip.  Let's talk about the Latitude.  This is brand new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See your location history dashboard if you've enabled location history for a latitude.  So I do use Latitude.  It can see where I am and where my friends are.  I did.  When I did when I when I turned this on, I went through and pruned everybody out who wasn't actually a friend because I'm letting people see my actual location.  But but I actually kind of like this because it checks in automatically.  It shows where my friends are on the map.  I don't I don't really mind.  I kind of I kind of like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I guess if you have it enabled for a couple of weeks, you get that dashboard with these charts about like, you know, you spend this many hours a week at work and this many hours a week at home, which is this kind of nice like personal data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been available on the web for some time and it's very it's very creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it creepy?  See, this is why I didn't enable it.  So like, I'm not sure.  Even though that's it's totally private, all the stats are aggregated in private, not for anyone else.  It kind of gives you an interesting look at, you know, where you've been and what you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me show you because I have been using it.  I've had it enabled for several years.  Wow.  And so it says it gives you like pie charts of how much time you spend at work, how much time you spend a different place shows you the places you've been to the most.  It's actually wait till this is used in divorces.  Well, because it's you know, you have to log into my account.  Right.  So it's kind of my my material.  Let me see if I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did it give you any insights about your whereabouts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I spent too much time at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Mostly, mostly that's what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is the Google dashboard.  Everybody should know about this anyway.  Google.com privacy dashboard.  Yeah, this is great.  So here's latitude.  So if I click location history, I have traveled.  What is that?  How many meters is that?  I've traveled 19 million kilometers, 19 million kilometers.  No, no, I'm sorry.  Nineteen million meters.  That's what is that?  One hundred ninety thousand kilometers.  I don't know what it is.  So I've got it enabled and I can view my check ins.  Where do I see my history?  It's really kind of cool because you.  Yeah, see, I spend my time at work is green.  My time spent out is blue.  My time at home.  So 50 percent of my time at home.  There you see, this is the gym.  I spent a lot of time at the gym.  Yeah, good.  Yeah.  Twenty nine hours last week at work.  You hacked that.  I know, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know that's that's.  This is kind of embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's edit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I say how much you know, I work so hard.  I only spent 29 hours at work last last week.  Fifteen hours at work on average.  I suck.  So so there's a lot of insight in here.  Fifteen hours a week I spent out.  Twenty three hours a week on average.  I spent a lot of time at home.  Here's the graph.  Countries visited airplane trips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is pretty cool.  It's super cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Except when you're getting divorced and your wife logs into your account.  But otherwise it's really cool.  Just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just like I spent a lot of time at Jeannie's house.  I don't know.  It's all there and it's automatic and it's on your phone and everywhere you go.  And I you know, so it's nice that you can see that on your phone.  But that but actually that dashboard has been around a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you're really fly too much, that's when I look at this, that's what you see.  Yeah.  What was I doing in Doha?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm traveling so much.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you were going to Tiffany's to buy your wife a present, you didn't want her to see that.  How hard is it to turn off temporarily?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no one sees it unless they log into your account.  Right.  It's not public at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to turn off location services on your phone, I guess.  You know, they're not really clear about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I see.  This is actually where I disagree with you.  Where I think would be creepy if we didn't show this information to you personally, not anybody else.  But it's like, you know, when you have these services, you know, they are keeping that information and people don't.  That's true.  Everybody knows.  You know what?  That's a very good point.  Everybody knows this, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just that they're showing Google saying, look, we do know this.  I've traveled 12,218 miles and I will reach the moon in 213,403 more miles.  So this is like a graph of my way.  I like that.  That's how close to the moon I've gotten.  Yeah, that's really neat.  You don't go anywhere, dude.  No, this must be.  I mean, I must not have.  Maybe you just turn it on.  I must have just turned it on because you're right.  I've traveled more than that.  Yeah, I've traveled a lot more than that.  So it mustn't have been on.  History range.  Oh, wait a minute.  That's only.  Yeah, see, I think so.  You can enable the range.  Look at this.  This is this is my map of travels in the last two days.  So that's how often this is how often it checks in.  Yeah, look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, Leo, I just put on the on the page at the very bottom under also a German politician,  of course, of course, suing sued a phone company there to get all of their green to get all  of their data on everything they had for him in their phone system.  Right.  Yeah.  And so then the site came along, my friend, book going blow and they visualized all the  data.  And it's it's actually that when this gets creepier because the phone company has much  more data on you, right, in terms of where you go in their system.  And it's all subpoena bowl and all that.  Right.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not even you know what?  This is the sad thing.  And I think I've mentioned this a couple of times.  It's not even a subpoena that they need.  It's what's called a pen register, which doesn't even need a court order.  All the cell phone companies have portals that any law enforcement official can go to  and just say, where was Jeff last night?  And you can even set a standing pen register that they send tracking information all the  time.  And the reason this is is because the courts at this point say that search and seizure  without content doesn't need is, you know, has a lower level of standard of proof.  And that means to and from on email messages, not subjects, not contents and GPS locations  are considered to be non content.  So you're absolutely right, Chris.  This is information that every cell phone carrier knows about you and will gladly for  a small fee share with any law enforcement agency, any government agency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Chris may have just convinced me to turn it on.  I might as well see what they can see.  Right.  Yeah, I like it.  I mean, just don't show your wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all.  Google for things that they should be legitimately concerned about with their governments.  You know, it's like, you know, we just try to be upfront about it.  We say here's our privacy.  Here's our privacy policy.  Pretty amazing.  Here's the dashboard.  Here's data liberation.  You know, if you're not comfortable with this, don't use that tool.  Don't go to that site.  You know, it's it can be really, you know, people get put onto Google that which is really  the province of their government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do.  I do think that this would be incredibly useful 20 years from now.  Yeah.  You know, if I've kept this for a long period of time, I do wish there were more data in  here, actually.  I think it's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this reminds me that I can't I'm looking for it now.  But if you go to Chrome and put on incognito, it warns you that it says, OK, this is what  you can do.  But it warns you in there.  I can't find it right now that well, you'd be also be aware, though, even if you turn  on incognito, that someone could be looking over your shoulder or secret.  I swear it says the secret agents could be watching surveillance by secret agents, malicious

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  software that tracks your keystrokes in exchange for free smileys.  Internet service providers or employers that track the pages you visit, websites that collect  and share information about you, people standing behind you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People standing behind you actually is relevant.  It says that right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, because the thing is, sometimes we get people who are like,  I am afraid that this government is following me and they they probably have compromised  Google.  And I'm like, you know, if if a secret agency is really following you, you should look outside  your front door.  You shouldn't leave your house and have them walk in and install something on your machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, these people would stop using Foursquare.  And I even mentioned the fact that if you're worried about Google, don't worry about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Worry about your Internet service provider.  They actually even know more about you, your cell phone company, your Internet service  provider together.  I think it's OK to worry about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're a big company.  We do a lot and people do search through us.  That's really important.  But, you know, it don't just stop there if you're actually worried about these problems.  You know, good.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week, a minor interview, but after last week, I did Lady  Gaga's followers on Facebook this week.  I was struck that Argentine footballer Leo Messi in seven hours got seven million likes  in Facebook.  Holy moly.  And what struck me about that week, you know, I keep forgetting how much smaller Twitter  is than Facebook still.  You know, Facebook has ten times the photos that Flickr has and Flickr has five billion  of them.  You know, the size of Facebook just, I kind of forget once in a while, but seven hours  for seven million likes is one hell of a commentary on the power of Facebook, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually gave you a number.  Oh, you did?  I didn't see it.  Well, that's OK, because I'm going to steal it.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a number for you guys if you want one.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.  I'll do a number, then you do a number, Chris, and then I'll do my tool of the week.  But the numbers, I got an email from StumbleUpon.  They hit one billion, one billion with a B monthly stumbles in the month of January,  the first time they've ever reached a billion.  If you thought StumbleUpon was no longer relevant to Germaine, they've gone up since this is  July 2010 here.  They've got this steep jump.  Wow.  Yeah.  Good for them.  Somebody, the reason I noted that is I was talking to some social media expert or somebody,  maybe somebody would email me and said, you know, really ought to get your pages on StumbleUpon.  It's an amazing traffic tool.  Your number, Chris DeBona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I'm going to let you down.  I was going to find the Lady Gaga questions on the question and answer service we have  for once you visited.  And I just remember being like a hundred times with Elmo got when we did the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got more than Elmo.  That's all I need to know.

Transcript:  Chris, I find it for you.  Shut down.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was on Google Moderator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm going to show you the I really this.  This is kind of a long standing tool tip.  We've mentioned it before.  But if you haven't yet installed the Amazon App Store on your Android phone, do because  as we've mentioned before, every day a free app and today the free app is one that I particularly  like called Pixay Pro.  There have been a kind of a dearth of great camera apps on the on the Android platform.  But this is one of them lets you put captions, modify photos.  It's a really a lot of fun.  And it's normally I think it's normally a couple of bucks.  Yeah, four bucks.  It's a free today on the Amazon App Store.  And every day there's a new free app and some of them are pretty good.  So if you don't if you don't yet have Pixay Pro, here's your chance to get it free.  This is one I've actually paid for some moons ago.  Here I can launch it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a little pick please.  I think I seem to remember you.  I like pick please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a posting service which would go great with Pixay Pro because what you do is you  take a picture and you do something on it.  You capture it.  I'll pull up a picture here.  This is my dog.  And and I can take it.  I'll do the maximum size and then I can put a caption on it.  I can do all sorts of you know special effects and so forth.  This is actually an amazingly deep program that's not you think Pixay Pro.  It's all about captioning.  But all of these these are filters.  I mean this is actually one of the most sophisticated apps I've seen for cameras.  Stickers.  I could put masks and glasses on my doggy.  And word balloons.  And word balloons.
