Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, the pasta, the reason it was out  this week, my wife found out, is the pasta actually comes from Italy.  Oh.  They import it from Italy.  And so we're waiting for my Cacio e Pepe to arrive.  When you go to the store, even when you buy dry pasta,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you don't buy American dry pasta.  You buy the Italian dry pasta.  Well, no, I mean the whole thing is made in Italy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Cacio e Pepe is made in Italy.  It's authentic.  Yeah.  Hence the Italian.  And you make fun of me.  Former TV critic knows his Cacio e Pepe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now TV dinner critic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  TV dinner critic Jeff Jarvis is the Leonard Tau Professor  for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School  of Journalism at the City University.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wasn't trying to get the first intro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got it.  It's OK.  Stacey.  Intro Steeler, you.  That's Stacey Higginbotham.  She is, of course, the host of Stacey on IoT.com and the IoT podcast  with Kevin Toffle.  Subscribe to her fine newsletter.  It's free.  There's no reason not to Stacey on IoT.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's no reason not to.  There's every reason every reason to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there is no there is no cost.  So that's the reason you might not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what, y'all, if you like IoT, please sign up  for the newsletter.  If it's not your jam, that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you don't have to.  And you know, that's my philosophy always, right?  I don't want to make anybody do anything.  And you know who stayed quiet during this whole time?  Because he's smart.  Smart, Aunt Pruitt.  Aunt Pruitt's here.  Hands on photography and hands on wellness.  I don't know about smart, but I am quiet.  You have borrowed John Oliver's glowing white chamber  for your shot today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's good.  I like it.  Just a slight change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He always refers to that on his show last week tonight.  So Stacey, I just wanted to say my tone of voice  has been pretty good.  What is it today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah?  Are you friendly?  Are you positive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you turn it on.  Well, you've been locked into a studio all by yourself, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no.  Who are you talking to, man?  I'm talking to people.  For instance, for Windows Weekly, it said,  you sounded mostly focused, but so also calm and skeptical.  That's exactly right.  That's exactly right.  Here's my data.  This is the Amazon Halo band.  And even though it kills the battery, I turn it on.  This is pretty good.  Do you have an over-the-shoulder shot, John?  We still do, right?  So that's the little gray.  You can't see that very well.  Only 1% negative, 2% extra happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because you're a radio guy,  so you make even insults sound happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it probably doesn't work.  Around 8.50 this morning.  It doesn't work for you, because you're always sounding happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even when you're telling somebody to blow off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was sad at 8.50 this morning.  I had two phrases that sounded sad and restrained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was that after your Pilates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was.  You know what?  It was.  It was during my Pilates.  How did you know?  That's very good.  Sad and restrained.  Mostly going, ugh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  God, that's over.  Ugh!  Yeah, no.  I found myself surprised, because I think of myself  as a genuinely pretty positive person.  And I was either neutral to negative most of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember you were saying that.  But I'm mostly neutral, too.  This weekend is cool, because we can do it live, too,  as I'm talking.  Right now, I sound interested, knowledgeable, and focused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, when I was showing off mine,  that's exactly how I felt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then if I go like this, Aunt Pruitt,  I sound amused, happy, and friendly.  So I can't lose.  I can't lose.  You can't sound angry.  It's not any, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm really so terrible right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This just says you're a bad actor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.  You suck at acting.  Isn't it funny that it can do it?  Oh, now I'm curious, interested, and skeptical again.  Isn't it funny?  Isn't it interesting?  I think this is actually surprisingly accurate,  at least for me, because it's very positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ha ha ha!  I had an invite out for that thing and requested it.  But they haven't emailed me like they emailed you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  Well, they didn't email me.  It was when Stacey was talking about last week,  I went to the site and I said, oh, yeah, you have four days.  Buy it.  $69, you get six weeks, six months of free service.  I doubt I'll pay for it after that.  But it's interesting.  And then, of course, it's a fitness band.  I know you wanted to do it for Hands On Wellness.  I guess you could borrow mine.  You want to borrow mine?  Sure.  All right.  All right.  I think it's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, are you going to use Aunt's photo?  Have you taken the photo yet?  And are you going to use Aunt's photo for your body fat  percentage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I forgot about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's on to me.  You figured out my plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would use Aunt's photo for my body fat percentage too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd be like, Aunt, come over.  My body fat percentage is pretty high, believe it or not.  Even though it's not?  It is.  It's like, I want to say I'm right at 30% or so,  something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm at 30%.  You can't be at 30%.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  I don't know what mine is, Leo, and I don't want to know.  I don't want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like you, Stacey, I'm reluctant because you have to pose  in front of the camera.  But I'm going to do it.  I just started wearing it this morning  because I had a charge over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I was like, do you have to have a couple stiff drinks  before you do it?  Nah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know how ugly I am.  It's not going to disappoint me in any way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He has spent his career with his life as an open book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I spent my career on camera, not naked, but I, you know.  Thank God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're no Jeffrey Tubman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have an open book, but I was still very concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  No, I understand.  I really do.  It's funny because I thought, oh, how hard can that be?  And then I started looking and I was like,  because you're taking a picture and it's going to Amazon.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Or not.  Well, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They said they offer you the choice.  Do you want to back up this in the cloud?  And you can say, no, keep it on the device.  And then they're like, if something happens to your device,  you'll lose this information.  You're like, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.  Precisely the point.  Exactly what we want.  Anyway, I think it's interesting.  I think a lot of people look at it and say, oh, it's just Amazon  wants a microphone on you all the time.  I don't think that's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, Amazon.  So the microphone data for Tone, that actually  deletes itself after 24 hours.  And then none of that data actually goes to Amazon.  So none of your utterances that it's picking up on,  and none of that analysis goes to Amazon, according to Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's really, I think that's the only reason I got it.  Because I have, look, I have three fitness devices on.  I have my Apple Watch.  And look how fit you are.  Yeah, look how much, look what kind of,  and then I have the Aura ring.  So I'm going to have plenty of stuff.  But, and I have a sleep tracker in my bed,  so I know my sleep, so I don't really need it.  But except that that one unique thing it does  is that tone of voice analysis,  which I actually find kind of fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amusing for a few hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so I have a friend, my best friend is a therapist.  And she, we went on a hike the other day  and she was really intrigued by it.  She's, because she actually uses little pulse oximeters  to measure people's heart rates  for part of joint couples therapy.  Oh, interesting.  To like track when people get into kind of, it's not,  I'm going to just call it flight or fight response.  Right.  Like when they get to a point where she knows  they can't hear each other,  then she like has to measure that  and calms them down a little bit.  And I don't know, she thought this was really interesting.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm fascinated by it.  Because I'm fascinated by me.  And anything that's more me, I'm all about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm fascinated by data about me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And me.  You're fascinated about me too.  No, it's, it is, it's a little bit,  here I'll use a big word, solipsistic.  But, but that's me.  The former CEO of Google.  Remember a guy named Eric Schmidt?  He's applied to become a citizen of Cyprus.  And they're delighted to have him.  Of course they are.  Recode says in effect, he's buying a passport  he can use to enter the rest of the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you find any reference to how much it costs?  I couldn't find a reference to that in the stories.  If you have to ask, it's too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  You can't afford it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's, let's look into it.  Maybe I should just apply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't mind having you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are about a half dozen programs all around the world  where foreigners can effectively purchase citizen rights  by skirting residency requirements,  by giving them some money or we call it an investment.  Oh, I got it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the host country.  You invest 2.0 million Euro in property.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you bought a house for a 2 million year old house.  On a nice house in Cyprus, on the water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's not gonna live at anything less than $2 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, it's nothing to him.  It might be cheaper to go to St. Kitts or Nevis  in the Caribbean.  St. Kitts and Nevis, not Orneavis.  It's an ant, not an ant, not an or.  The Cyprus program has brought in $8 billion  since its 2013 bankruptcy.  It's been very, and there are 4,000 recipients,  mostly Russian, Russian oligarchs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you know, they drive up property values quite a bit,  those oligarchs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The idea though really is that it's a,  you're now, you have an EU passport.  So I was actually thinking about doing the same thing  maybe in Portugal.  Because it would be nice, you don't have to stay  wherever you bought that citizenship,  you can move around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's just say, I actually, I rounded down.  You need to make a 2 million Euro investment  in real estate plus 100,000 Euro donation  to the government research and development fund  plus $100,000 to the land development organization.  After five years, you can reduce your investment.  You can downsize to 500,000 Euro.  But you know, so you.  Well, but you still have to have something, yeah.  Buy a smaller condo.  They've actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't quite understand what the end game is though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The end game is to have a passport  that allows you access to Europe.  So by the way, it wasn't just him,  he got it for his wife and his daughter.  That's pricey.  So well, come on, he's a billionaire.  It's nothing.  It's cigarette money.  That's not that pricey.  And so, yeah, I mean, I think there's a couple of reasons  you might get it.  It's interesting that this article appears  right after the election.  Yeah, right.  But I wouldn't be surprised if some people weren't saying,  well, let's see what happens in the election  and I might be moving out of town,  which I think is reprehensible, but you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I've heard more so is,  at least from the tech side of things,  is after the election or even before the election,  is most of tech is just trying to get out  of freaking Silicon Valley  because of the way California is with all the taxation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this doesn't affect him because he's no longer,  he doesn't own a business in California.  He's just a rich guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, that's why I was like,  well, what's the big deal with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember Larry Page wanted his, remember that?  Oh, the island.  He wanted his own island.  At the end of a keynote, he just said,  you know what would be great if we just had an island  with no regulation, that's what we want, the Google island.  And that's honestly,  I don't know a lot of very, very rich people,  but I would guess that's kind of like  in the back of their heads.  They may not say it out loud or even think it,  but the back of their heads,  I just wanna go somewhere where I could be me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, but who's gonna work on that island?  How are you gonna treat those people?  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean. Right.  No, it's a non-starter.  I mean, it's crazy.  But the rich, as F. Scott Fuerstgerald once said,  they're not like you and me.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Clearly not. Clearly not.  So La Vida Golden Visas,  I just put the link in the rundown right underneath the story.  Basically that packages the deal.  Here's the apartment you can buy.  Oh.  With your visa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're gonna skim a little off of that too.  GoldenVisas.com slash Cypress.  So, oh God, I have to accept so many things.  So look, Cypress is pretty.  Is it on the Mediterranean?  I think it is, yeah.  It's at EU, English is widely spoken.  South of Turkey, I believe is what it said.  Yeah.  It's Cypress offers the quickest,  most assured route to citizenship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Aren't they at war oftentimes with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but they're not there very much.  Stacy. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Montenegro's nice.  Look, Montenegro is so much less expensive.  From 350,000 euros.  That's pretty good.  Germany's 360, Portugal's 350.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a fancy residency, that doesn't get you past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, you gotta get a lot more to get into Portugal.  Ireland's a million, full family residency,  no requirement to reside.  Minimum stay one day.  So this is really, you know, it's interesting.  Wait a minute, you could do it in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just have to.  Wait a second, Ireland, one million?  That's, now that's a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's more than the US.  The US is only 900,000,  plus an EB-5 approved investment.  And you get your green card.  See, why are all these people sitting on the border  trying to get in?  Just get $900,000 in your EB-5 and your set.  Squared away.  Oh, Grenada's cheap.  Let's go to Grenada.  See, look at that, isn't that pretty?  It's in the Caribbean.  Is that on the coast of Spain?  No, I think it's in...  Oh look. That was in the Caribbean.  You get VisaV.  Yeah, I think it's in the Caribbean.  Visa-free travel to the UK, the Schengen countries,  and China.  And it's cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Ireland's the best deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't believe this business.  GoldenVisas.com.  Isn't this amazing?  Why do you think Ireland's such a good deal?  It's the most expensive, a million euros.  No, but I just like Ireland.  Oh.  He would like to live in Ireland.  He thinks everybody in Ireland talks like this, that's why.  Oh, hello, Jeff Jarvis.  Welcome to our country.  Top of the morning to you.  They're not all leprechauns, Jeff.  I just gotta tell you.  This is an ideal program for high-knit worth families  seeking residency in Europe.  It'll be particularly attractive to businessmen,  entrepreneurs, and journalism professors.  Oh, what they're selling is the universities  that you get your kids in a good class.  That's true too.  They should, see?  Laurie, what's her name?  You should have just done this  instead of spending all that money at USC.  Just get an Irish visa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  An Irish visa?  That feels like slang for something.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an Irish visa.  Do not look that up.  Don't go there.  An urban dictionary.  Oh, he got an Irish visa.  Not to mention the Dutch turnaround.  Nope.  Nope.  Not good.  Not good.  Google is, these are the three Google stories  from a Dumal.  Google is moving to bring high-speed network to Africa  via experimental light beams.  Here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it just fiber?  I mean, fiber optics is experimental light beams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's invisible light beams through the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The high-speed data transmission  through invisible light beams between Tara,  it's Project Tara,  Tara terminals mounted on high  up on existing towers or rooftops.  Whoa, wait a minute, Stacey.  Each link between terminals can transmit  20 gigabits per second over a distance of 20 kilometers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, without a new repeater, sorry about my dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's excited.  Never, there's no apologies for Zoom or dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've tried, already trialed this in India and Mexico.  Now they're looking at beginning in Kenya  and then a Pan-African rollout.  So my eighth grade science project

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  was to try to figure out how to transmit data with light  through the air.  And I couldn't of course figure it out  because I was in eighth grade, little Jack.  How did you get into this with light  when there's light all around?  What's the science of this?  Lasers.  But is it laser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's invisible light, they say.  Well, you could have lasers in an invisible spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All light is a wave, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We all accept that.  Wait, wait, wait, that's a great start.  That's a great Stacey class start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, all light is a wave and a particle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, yes.  But you can use it.  Just, I mean, you can transmit data over that  just like you transfer it over.  And there's invisible light, there's UV light.  Explain it to eighth grade, Jeff, would you, Stacey?  Well, I don't know what spectrum.  Explain it to eighth grade aunt.  Are they in?  That's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I be a fifth grader in this conversation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I won two science fairs in the.  Did you really?  Wow.  Fifth and sixth grade, then we went to a new school  and they said, you won science fairs.  This is a perfect class for you.  It was the whole term, just science, one project.  I picked a project that I couldn't do anything with.  It was stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's because.  Oh, was it this project?  Dude, you could have just like flashed Morse code  and seen light.  They have the Mutt Navy ships in the 40s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I knew they had to go through,  it had to be like working a room with light on.  It was dark, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really want to understand what they're doing here  and this article is not helping me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The point is because they don't have to dig cables.  So in effect, you're using these beams instead of cables  to connect.  Yeah, but is it line of sight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is the bandwidth?  It's absolutely line of sight.  Why is it better than microwave?  It may be just microwave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because as you know, Jeff, light is a wave in a particle.  It's a wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, see, I'm thinking like, okay, if it's light.  All of it, like the lower wavelength lights

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  are lights we can see, they're different colors, right?  You know that like red is on one wavelength  and blue is on another, right?  So that's how we see.  That's all light as waves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What'd you say, Jeff?  That's why they call it a wave length.  It's all light as waves.  That's why they call it a wave length.  Is that true Professor Higginbotham?  Oh, sorry. That's true.  Will this be on the final?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, I give up.  But you can send data over those and you can,  what's it called, modulate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, just like a fiber optic cable would do.  But you don't need the cable around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I don't know anything about like the ups and downs  of, cause I don't know where they are  in terms of invisible light.  So where they are in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like fiber, here's from the X Project X page.  Like fiber, but without the cables,  Tara uses light to transmit information  at super high speeds through the air  as a very narrow invisible beam.  Invisible beam.  Okay.  So yeah, we don't have numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's a big huge remote.  It's a big huge clicker, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just outside the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you did it for eighth grade, Jeff.  Thank you.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't give a lot of details about the spectrum  or the frequency or any of that,  but yeah, it's going to be outside of the visible spectrum  and it's going to modulate it just like.  Well, how much does it cost?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because when you're shooting something like that,  that could be pretty energy intensive.  Oh, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.  Well, but that's the beauty of lasers  because they're so coherent.  It doesn't have to be a huge amount of,  you're not trying to burn holes in the other guy.  You're just setting light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How bad do you want this data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anybody want to join the conversation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and if it's lasers, I mean,  so when you have microwave, the frequency,  like things will attenuate it,  but like a bird flying through  is not going to totally disrupt your signal.  Right.  But like if you're using something like a laser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But rain, no, it wouldn't kill anything, but rain,  it's not going to be high energy,  but rain and fog and stuff might impact it.  I mean, anything that could break the beam of light might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I was thinking not even that.  In anything as simple as like a leaf falling in front of it  could break the beam.  As opposed to there's a slightly wider dispersion rate  with like microwave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With packet switching, it'll know the packet's lost  and it'll figure it out, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If it's using TCP, it will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you arrive?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nope, said it again.  I bet you they're doing something like that.  Sure.  Well, that was a fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was our Google.  That was an entire team of Google.  And now Stacey's thinking, good, the show is over.  We finished all of our Google stories.  I can go have another brownie.  I've got a story that's half Facebook, half Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go on.  Google?  Okay.  Facebook and Google have extended their bans  on political ads indefinitely.  Jeff has something to say about this.  Google plans to review the situation weekly.  Facebook doesn't say what kind of end date it would be.  I suspect this has something to do with the fact  that the result of the election is disputed  by the Republicans.  But, and there's a lot of, you know, obviously,  misinformation spreading on social media about this.  I don't know if they're blocking that though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there is a huge problem, which is the next story,  which is that we have a gigantically important  runoff race in Georgia.  That's right.  That's in January.  I asked someone at Twitter, they said, nope,  we're not gonna be race specific.  It's a global ban on them.  And so I think this is a real problem.  This is this file is under be careful what you wish for.  Twitter has all these, Facebook has all these awful  political accusations, you should get rid of them.  Now you have campaigns that can't afford to advertise  this clearly to groups and we're dependent upon TV again.  Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But no one watches TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the problem.  Yeah.  That's the problem.  So a huge amount of money is gonna go to TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but dude, maybe ads aren't the best way to try  to win an election.  Is that possible?  It's the one way you can control though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you've got very little time to do it.  Well, you should do, I mean, look how successful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the president's rallies were.  That was a very good way to.  Of killing people, yes.  Well, they're not dead yet.  They live long enough to vote.  But no, but I mean, I think we can, okay, COVID aside,  that certainly galvanized his base and got a lot of votes  and got out the vote.  So there's rallies.  There's other ways to do it.  Maybe debates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't do door to door.  That's how you'd normally do it.  So this was the new door to door and now they're.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good point.  Without door to door canvassing, which by the way,  the Trump organization did do, Biden did not do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can still have, I mean, people have shown up at my door.  They're wearing a mask.  They're far apart.  They stand out there and they shout at you  about how they did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you're trying to get to the whole state  in a very short amount of time.  This is how long election should last,  but it's gonna be a six week election from now  and or six or seven, whatever it is, but it's short.  And you've got to reach a lot of people  and you want to reach them with a targeted message,  which is not awful.  You can reach young people with a different message  than old people.  That's okay.  And social media let you do that.  And now it's cut off.  And so there'll be more need for big money  going into big old media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Kelly Loeffler has self-funding.  She's got plenty of money.  And Reverend Warnock, her opponent,  is really a grassroots campaign.  So it probably would disadvantage him  more than it would Loeffler, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what's interesting about this.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's really, yeah, that's a very good point.  So what is their rationale  for continuing the ban on political ads?  Not worth the trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Life's been better without it.  I mean, if I were, I get it.  If I were them, I'd say, good, let's keep this going.  Yeah.  Well, we got crap if we didn't fact check  every damn political ad.  We don't make any money on it, really.  It's hardly a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually my fault because you asked me  if I were at a dinner party with Mark Zuckerberg,  what would I ask him to do?  And I said ban political ads.  And obviously he must've enjoyed the meal  because he listened.  So it's my fault.  Did you take brownies, Joe?  That's where the brownies went.  So an interesting statistic from Facebook,  maybe a little self-serving,  but according to Facebook's own posts,  what do people actually see on Facebook in the US?  Only about 6% of it is political content.  Most of it is just the other stuff.  Really?  Cats.  Cats.  Does that ring true?  I mean, it is Facebook's own.  Yeah, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because people don't really care about politics  as much as we think they do.  This is about what they share.  This is what they choose to do.  The problem here is Facebook owns a company  called Crowd Tangle, which the New York Times uses  to say what's the most popular thing on Facebook?  Well, the most popular thing on Facebook,  as we've discussed before, is still small.  Because nobody sees the same Facebook.  It's not mass media.  So mass media looks at it and says,  Crowd Tangle says this is the most important story  on Facebook.  And that most important story is nothing.  So what this says is, look at it in the context of the whole.  News as a whole is 4% of content on Facebook.  Politics as a whole is 6%.  I'm sure there's a lot of overlap  in those two Venn diagram circles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's interesting, because with Facebook's own numbers,  the top US pages by engagement,  they're all political.  That's the Crowd Tangle numbers.  Except for Jesus Daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Crowd Tangle.  But then if you actually look at pages  by all posts on my page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then it's the Dodo, Rick Lacks, Steve Harvey, really?  AARP, why is Steve Harvey?  30% of US weekly active people  were reached by the Steve Harvey page.  Isn't he the host of Family Feud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's a former comedian, but he has  syndicated radio show.  Oh, he has radio show, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's Rick Lacks?  I don't know who Rick Lacks is.  He's equally big.  The Dodo's number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, as it should be, cute animals.  Not the Dodo bird.  No, no, no, that's the Dodo site,  which is nothing but cute animals.  Oh, okay.  Don't you watch the Dodo, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rick Lacks is a magician.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a magician, okay.  See, this isn't so bad, folks.  So the Dodo, Rick Lacks, and Steve Harvey,  and AARP are roughly tied.  Then Justin Flom, the president, Tasty,  which is Recipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, he's not a magician.  He calls himself a deception expert.  Oh, he debunks magicians.  No, no, he's a magician.  Just deceiving you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who just died a week ago?  Who debunked magicians?  Randy, the Amazing Randy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love Randy.  Oh, I love him.  Leo, seriously, do you not watch the Dodo?  No, at least it does.  Every once in a while,  Lisa will lean over saying,  I know you hate these, but look.  And then I have to watch some cute video.  Oh, they're really cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Never heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You haven't?  We gotta show you.  We gotta show him.  We gotta show him.  We're gonna change his life here.  We're gonna make his life happier.  You can follow him on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can follow him on Instagram.  It's thedodo.com.  Yeah, here's the daily Dodo.  Dog fakes a limp every time he sees the stairs.  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure I've seen some stuff  like this pop up in my stream somewhere,  but I don't actively follow this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you wanna see Pino the pup, who is a maze master?  Yeah.  Sure you do.  He knows the maze.  Corgi.  He's a Corgi.  He's gonna go, look at him go through the Gatorade bottles  without knocking a single one over.  If he could play for Clemson, you'd be all over him, man.  All in.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Hey, there's nothing here.  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is great to do with your dog  if you have Gatorade bottles in spare time.  They love this stuff.  Why, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They love it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a mental, it's challenging for them.  It's fun.  And you're, to teach them to do this,  you're engaging with them  and then they're not laying around bored.  Well, that's true.  My dog likes to rattle.  My dog likes to find and rattle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have to do the funny voices?  Oh, look, there's a big donut at the middle of that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We do not narrate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I'll start.  Oh, you kill him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, he doesn't know what to do.  Because corgis can't back up.  It's not a well-known fact,  but they don't know how to back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've just got a wide turning radius.  Yes.  That's what's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, isn't life better?  That's what's amazing is that the corgi

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  doesn't just walk through the bottle.  Like he takes it so seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's, that's because he gets a reward  when he does it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dogs love following your rules.  How much training did this involve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It depends on the dog.  Corgis are really smart.  I mean, I wouldn't think a whole lot  because this is not...  This is not something they wouldn't do.  Like when I did agility training with my dog,  who was not a corgi, but a similar herding dog,  they love it.  Yeah.  They really like to please.  I mean, you're not hurting them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're just like...  You can have the baby elephant  that can't figure out his own trunk,  the dog that smashes snowmen,  the tortoise that can't stop eating shoes.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or...  I'm thinking the baby elephant.  You got to get baby elephants.  You got to go baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Da da da da da da da da.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll turn off the silly music.  He just doesn't understand that that's his nose  hanging in front of him.  I'm starting to feel sorry for him.  I think this is elephant abuse.  This poor elephant.  What?  Elephant abuse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's a sweet elephant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It seems like he's doing perfectly well  figuring out his nose.  Yeah, he does.  I don't know what's wrong with this one.  Uh-oh, watch out.  Stand back.  Here comes mom's leg.  Oh boy.  That was clickbait.  Yeah, that was clickbait.  They deceived us.  That did not work.  No, they didn't.  Screw you, the dodo.  Screw you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Screw the dog with the snowman.  Yeah, sorry.  Our show today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dogs are always the safe bet.  Mr. Jarvis.  Now, you just went through and showed  that all of these other top pages  are what's showing up inside of Facebook  and pretty much said that no one really cares  about the political ads and political posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A smaller number than we fear, that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so with that said,  why does it matter if the political ads  are taken away because nobody's watching them anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the difference here, since you asked,  is that that's content versus advertising.  Advertising gets shown to you because you paid for it.  So it gives the speaker, in this case the advertiser,  much more control.  And this is the problem with Facebook  because the publisher will say,  people don't look at my stuff.  And Facebook has two answers for that.  One is, we'll make it more engaging  and people will share it or pay it.  Make better content or make it an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's the difference is that you can then reach  the people you know you want to reach by paying.  And the thing is, it's so much cheaper  than any other medium.  And more efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you have a limited amount of money.  And more efficient.  It's very effective because you can really target.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that an answer?  That is an answer.  I was curious because I personally don't see anything wrong  if political ads went away.  But then again, I'm a different breed of person.  There's a lot of crap I don't care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's exactly why Facebook and Google are in no rush.  They know people don't want to see them.  And they know it's a hassle because people complain  and then you're blocking some.  And then it becomes, just like Jeff said,  it's like, so they're, and they don't make that much money  from political ads.  And it's funny because radio and TV do.  They really.  Oh, this is their season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  You said your mother ran, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, my mom said that there was some paying like 80 grand  for 30 second spots, political.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But on radio or TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On television.  Because they have to buy it by the rack rate.  They can't get discounts because that would be biased.  So, but I don't think it's that much money for Facebook.  They'll fill those veils, no problem.  So it's not a loss of revenue.  It's a loss of a pain in the butt.  And you have happier customers.  The only people who suffer here is the American democracy.  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well said.  Wow.  Check your wise man.  Check your wise man now.  Oh yeah, I think that halo is gonna go, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were deep, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Erudite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Erudite.  Let's take a break.  This has become like almost a comedy show.  We've completely changed the tenor of this show  over the last six months.  Hasn't it?  It's more like, you know, let's watch some elephants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at them falling apart.  Yeah, maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We needed it.  We needed it.  If we had a Taco Bell ad, I would do one,  but I don't have a Taco Bell ad,  but you know, if you're welcome to think about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff will provide one for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have a Chipotle story coming up.  Oh, see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never could get them to advertise.  No, jokes.  Yeah, I don't know why.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by NetSuite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you. Thank you.  You want to see my new toy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you hear about the remarkable two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you got yours?  I'm waiting for mine.  I ordered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is the remarkable.  It's incredibly thin.  It's light. It's E-ink.  And so when you write on it with the thing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to use their thing?  You have to use their stylus?  You have to use their thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it feels very paperish.  It's very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the good news.  What's the bad news?  Because it's expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's expensive as heck.  This is $399.  I got it because my intention was to read and mark up PDFs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what they talk about.  Like lawyers would use this to mark up.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have academic papers that I need to read as research.  And this was a pre-purchase thing.  Not quite, it wasn't Kickstarter, but it was like that.  So I ordered it like nine months ago before the pandemic.  So I was traveling then.  I wonder where mine is.  Taking a whole pile of papers.  I thought, good, I'll just sink them in here.  You don't need that.  And I'll do it.  The app is really awkward.  Basically, it can only go one way.  If I want to send a document back to myself,  I have to do it via email.  It doesn't sync with Google Docs or Dropbox  or any of that stuff.  It just is difficult.  On Chromebook, it doesn't work with the app.  So I had to put it in the Android app.  And that's, of course, not designed for it.  And I've got to go through three steps  to get anything into this to then take it out.  And then I would mark things up.  And then I would send the PDF back by email  so I could print it out.  And the marks would come up half an inch away  from where I made them,  which is a little difficult when you're trying  to circle words.  So I love this.  It's beautiful.  They have a wonderful return policy.  So sadly, it's going back.  So the thing I would say to you is,  if what you want to do is take notes and draw  and all that, it's gorgeous.  If you want to deal with PDFs and stuff,  it's going to take another couple generations  of software before it's ready.  And it's expensive.  So sadly, I'm going to wave goodbye to the remarkable.  I'll be curious to hear what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will.  And I could cancel it if I could figure out how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, see, they make it easy.  That's one thing about them.  They're good.  You can cancel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't even have a receipt or anything.  I know I got charged for it.  Oh, you got email.  You got email.  I got to find the email somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they were good at that.  They were very good at that.  Okay.  So I just thought I'd show it off.  For some people, it'd be perfect, though expensive.  For some people, like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to use it as a replacement for the Kindle.  And then I could use it and mark up stuff  as I'm reading it and stuff.  Yeah, it's a be EPUBs.  I have a lot of EPUBs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the other thing I wanted it for,  was to be able to mark up books.  EPUBs are hard to find and get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you, a lot of programming books  come in EPUB format.  Or they're in Moby that you can convert to EPUB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty much that or Cory Doctorow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I was hoping that,  because one use would be,  I've got a programming book here  and I've got my computer here  and I'm reading it and I can mark it.  And that would be kind of,  so maybe I won't give up.  You'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe you'll love it.  I don't know, but it's sad.  You get 30 days to return it.  The guys at Stave have good policy.  It's beautifully done.  They kept me informed the whole time  and when I was gonna get it,  I got it when they said with a little COVID delay,  but they were honest about that.  So it's beautifully designed.  Great hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's interesting is this E Ink.  Remember when E Ink came out,  everybody was saying,  oh, there's gonna be so many good uses for this  and so forth and so on.  And I don't know if the E Ink technology  hasn't advanced as fast as some thought or what.  I mean, for instance,  Kindle still isn't quite black text on white paper quality.  It's a little soft contrast, even the latest ones.  And they've gotten faster and the resolution's gotten higher.  But it feels like E Ink.  Remember there were E Ink phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember a couple of years ago in China, CES Asia,  I think there was iFlytech or something like that.  I've been trying to look it up,  but they talked about similar tech  like what you're working with right now.  And I remember the feel of it felt great  from a tactile standpoint.  But at the same time, you're looking at it  and it's a little fuzzy here and there.  It just didn't seem like it would pan out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's possible that it's not,  it's just not a technology that people want, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That happens.  Either I got a beautiful screen with all these colors  or I get paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like beautiful screen with colors.  I don't even use my Kindle that often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really?  I love my Kindle compared to reading on an iPad or my phone.  I give books back to the library  if I can't read it on the Kindle.  And they're like, oh, you must open it  in the Overdrive app.  I'm like, nope, don't want to read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's not that I don't use Kindle stuff,  but I do it most often on computer or a phone or a tablet.  Very little on the actual Kindle device.  I like listening to audiobooks  while they're being read on the Kindle  or going back and forth.  That's very good.  There are books that are done at the same time or two.  That is a smart feature.  Yeah.  Well, I guess I'll wait because I can't find my email.  So I guess I'll wait.  It may work for you though with your use case.  It's exactly right.  I think it's very dependent on your use case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  That's what I was also saying.  Beautiful hardware.  If I were a note taker, I could read my handwriting.  And I was organized and did those.  It'd be gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's this aspirational thing I have.  I find myself doing this all the time.  Either I will write a journal  and three weeks later I stop,  or I will take more notes as I read.  I have this aspirational thing.  Cause everybody's, oh, it's so great.  If you do your Zettelkasten as you're reading,  and then your ideas will,  and it's always too much trouble.  I just wanna just listen to a book and go to bed.  I guess maybe ambition has died in this old frame.  Is that possible, Jeff?  Do you just lose your ambition as you get older?  I'm not gonna ask Anne or Stacey  cause they're very young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, that's very common.  I'm even less ambitious than I used to be when I was,  I mean, you just don't, you're done with your life.  You're not fighting for your offspring.  You're not fighting for the chance to have offspring.  You're just like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are some things  that just don't deserve your energy anymore.  Yeah, I've reproduced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I'm just gonna eat a lot of Pachioe Pepe  and go to bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really, what are you even still doing here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what's the point?  I don't see doing nothing.  That would drive me.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My father, you know what?  That's what's great about podcasting.  It's as close to doing nothing as you can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I try to tell people.  Just be for yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He can make a living.  He's getting a sweat doing this.  Doing nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, the Amazon is in trouble now with the EU.  So, see, did you see TikTok?  There was a story about TikTok in the news today saying,  hello, hello.  And he is, what's going on?  That was the-  Tomorrow, you're supposed to put us out of business.  Hello.  TikTok- Are we still doing that?  Are we still doing that?  TikTok says the Trump administration has forgotten  about trying to ban it,  and they wanna know what's going on.  What's the latest?  And they haven't heard in more than a month from CFIUS,  the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States,  which is the enforcement arm.  They set a deadline of tomorrow, November 12th,  for TikTok to divest itself of any tangible  or intangible assets or property wherever located  used to enable and support ByteDance's operation  of the TikTok application in the United States.  They did get a preliminary injunction,  Judge Beadlestone, and then nothing.  In the nearly two months, TikTok says in a statement,  this is to the verge,  since the president gave his preliminary approval  to our proposal to sell to Walmart and Oracle,  we've offered detailed solutions to finalize that agreement,  but have received no substantive feedback  on our extensive data privacy and security framework.  Nothing.  The imminent deadline tomorrow, without an extension in hand,  we have no choice but to file a petition in court.  We have 1,500 employees in the US.  What's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  The election's over.  Done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  We're done.  You were a toy.  Get the jack around the

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got to feed a little more tiny  Shake Shards.  Food 22,000.  I don't think it's going to be a big deal anymore.  So maybe we'll get owned by W znaczy.  I wonder, you know, is Oracle going to be owned anything for  not getting it's it's hunk of tick tock?  Was there even not good Lord?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was there even an agreement with Oracle?  We do we ever see an agreement or was it just like, Oh, yeah,  we'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's true, other than a promise.  Yeah, we'll host on your cloud.  Sure.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like it's like one of those just it's like hanging out with  a crazy person.  They're like, you better do this by then.  And you're like, OK, should I?  And then, you know, you get close to the date.  They're just wandered around, still doing something else.  And you're like, so about that thing that you told me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, if I were to talk, I just shut up, right?  And just go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  But what if then in like a week comes down and finds them?  Right.  Or, you know, something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  There's two ways to go about it.  They could just shut up and be quiet or they can just continue  to attack them and say, hey, look, we put our necks out there.  You put all of this ridiculous information out there about us.  We got business to run.  So what's it going to be?  And just keep attacking the administration publicly.  And maybe you'll get that hit dog to bark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or I can see the phone call.  Miss Cooper, could you lay off Trump for about six weeks?  Go ahead and put it on Twitter.  We don't care.  But just just just on TikTok, you know, to the Trump jokes, please.  You go back to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you go back, has comedian Sarah Cooper famous now for lip syncing  the president, has has she done anything lately or is she just quiet?  That's a good question.  She has nothing to work with.  He's not been out there.  That's right.  He's that's a good point.  It's just tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plus, she's trying to break away from this.  She's trying to get.  Yeah, yeah.  She made her fame.  She doesn't want to be on a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, isn't she doing something with Netflix?  Am I imagining?  Yeah, she's got a special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that's her.  That's her larger comedy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And she also had a book that she wrote like a while back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How to impress people in meetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it was out of her Google experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, cool.  Cool.  So the EU, however, is not resting.  In fact, now they're going after Amazon and any trust suit  against Amazon.  And there are two different issues that the EU is looking into.  Oh, sorry.  Let me stop the audio on that.  They open an investigation in to partly because of this dual role  Amazon has as a marketplace and a seller.  They wonder if data from the sellers is being unfairly used by Amazon  to create and sell its own products.  Actually, that investigation began last July.  And and this is the culmination of that.  The investigation found that Amazon does feed nonpublic seller data,  the number of products ordered in the seller's revenue into its own retail  algorithms to help it decide which new products to launch and the price  of each new offer. That's according to Martha Vestai.  I guess that's illegal in the EU.  Is it illegal here because certainly grocery stores and other grocery stores

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and department stores and everybody else do exactly that.  Yeah. And then and then and then the evidence is always good on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we wouldn't have generic products on grocery store shelves if they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Right. And the reason they decide to make it is they know what sells.  They have inside knowledge about what sells.  And so they decide, well, let's make our own.  And the other thing is still there, just like on Amazon is no different  from what Macy's does with this house brand or Kroger's does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's interesting with grocery stores is they actually go to.  There are plenty of companies that make the store brands and also  the packaged like the CPG.  They do both. Right. Right.  So that's a little different in that it's just a marketplace.  So if it's promoting its own stuff over somebody else's stuff,  there's no benefit to the people who have the somebody else's stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the results of this investigation begun last July  are that Amazon has breached EU antitrust rules.  But before penalties are imposed, the EU says the investigation must be completed.  The probe could, according to CNN Business, drag on for years and expose Amazon  to potential fines of up to 10 percent of its annual global sales.  Whoa. That would be a penalty of about 37 billion dollars.  Now, the second investigation,  whether Amazon artificially favorites its own retail offers.  When you see the Amazon recommendation boxes,  the buy box, do it does Amazon  favor its own stuff or not?  Our concern, says Marta Vextair, our concern is that Amazon  may artificially push retailers to use its own related services,  which locks them deeper into Amazon's ecosystem.  These are all, I guess, classic antitrust issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would like to see the actual data on this, because  that's just like someone whining, one person whining about their product  not being pushed up. But I'm pretty sure it's more than one person.  I'm pretty sure it's more than 100 vendors or something.  You know, it's got to be a big. That's why you investigate.  And I guess, you know, I'd like you could investigate it.  Right. You could have been up with that, because if you look at your own  Amazon page and all of the recommendations that pop up,  it may be 50 50 split on Amazon basic stuff versus some other OEM.  At least it is for me. But I'd like to see the other issue in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Ben Evans had a good piece that he wrote.  That's right below the rundown, where he also depends on if you're going to try  to argue this kind of market manipulation, you've got to define what a market is.  And does Amazon really have a have a monopoly?  And so the argument here is that if you looked at retail,  Amazon has somewhere between five percent of retail.  And which Amazon is.  It's a little bit of a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. What Amazon is quick to tell you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. If you look at them in books,  they have half of both or half of U.S.  book sales and three quarters of three quarters of e-book sales.  Right. One percent of grocery sales, even Wal-Mart has 20 percent.  So you can't complain about the buying Whole Foods.  So in this case, you're right.  And the question is, well, within within their marketplace,  you know, what other opportunities do sellers have?  And the thing I think that Amazon will argue is we could take off  all those third party sellers and they'd be far worse off.  True. And so would our so would the consumer be far worse off  because we compete with each other on price and we give consumers choices.  And that's there.  And we give these these these sellers a marketplace they wouldn't otherwise have.  So fine. You know, we'll take it down.  Actually, won't say that's a huge part of the business.  But but at some point it becomes it's a whole different world now.  So because it's it's competition.  It's complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you all been hearing the sentiment of especially nowadays with the pandemic,  we should stop ordering from Amazon and support the local businesses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to. Oh, my child is her gift list is at a local bookstore.  And it is.  My parents love to give her books and they do not have a lot of money.  And like a lot of the books are like  twenty six dollars, but they're like eighteen dollars at Amazon.  And this is I can't dictate to someone like I am not going to tell my parents  don't buy them on Amazon because my daughter thinks it's unethical because she is.  I love your daughter. Wow.  That's yeah, but she's also very privileged.  Right. Right. Right.  I mean, I'm fine saying, all right, I see what you're doing here.  I will support this and I will tell you that we can buy fewer books.  And I say that I'm like, hey, if we have this budget, you know,  are you willing to give up a full book because that's what this will cost you?  And she's like, yes.  But I still am like, I'm going to tell my parents this and they're going to be like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah, they're not going to be cool.  So why is a local bookstore more expensive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they don't have the economies of scale.  They don't have the ability to bludgeon the publishers.  They also don't have rent.  I mean, Amazon does have rent, but.  Yeah, I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that would argue that Amazon really does have in some respect  a lock on the market that's not necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. OK, so let's take books out of the let's take books.  I'll give you I'll give you a concrete example from a friend of mine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  who made a product, you know, he probably got it, you know,  he got somebody design it, got it made in China and started selling it on Amazon.  You know, because it's really a great way to sell stuff is a third party market.  Yes, that's what I was thinking.  They do the film and everything.  But all of a sudden, his product is being sold by Amazon directly.  His product is being sold by Amazon directly.  Apparently, they're buying it and selling it at a higher cost.  And then the prices go all over the place because it's algorithmic.  Oh, and yeah, he's.  I don't know if you I didn't hear the.  Final result of this, but it damaged his business for sure.  Amazon, in effect, just muscled him.  They bought a product from him. Right.  And charge more.  But then his sales disappeared somehow because maybe the recommendation,  I don't know, they bought his product from him, though.  I'm trying to get. Well, yeah, I guess.  But they're buying it at a lower price than I don't know exactly.  Maybe this is where price fixing comes in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the Zabara's case with Cuisinart.  Zabara's tried to have set prices and went to court.  Zabara's the magnificent deli in New York.  In this case, was doing discounting and Cuisinart  tried to pull the product from Zabara's and lost the case.  Interesting.  Court said you can't.  Because Apple does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple has very tight control of the channel.  They do not let people undercut the retail price.  So maybe that court decision.  I don't know how they get away with it.  Yeah, sure.  Well, it's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know how they get away with it.  Yeah, I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't.  Apple.  In any event, I can't remember the exact details and I may be telling this wrong,  but it was clear that Amazon was manipulating the price  and doing something that ultimately hurt him.  You're right. They're buying it from him.  Maybe it ended up being they made a clone of it.  Well, that would be different.  Yeah, that's not.  I'll ask him about the details on this.  I just remember he was very bitter about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bushy, cuddly company, right?  The way they what they pay their employees, the way they treat folks.  You know, there's issues there.  On the other hand, you know, it gives everybody, especially in the pandemic,  it gives everybody this incredible range of choice and at good prices.  Yeah.  And it does provide a marketplace for retailers.  You know, they could do a nicer job of it.  And that's probably what's going to get them in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess that's the real question.  Is this just a temporary period while we reorganize all around online?  Or is this really a predatory situation?  You know, from the point of view of consumers being able to buy that  that your daughter's book list at a significant discount on Amazon,  it's a lot easier for them.  There's a lot to be said.  I mean, that's a huge customer convenience that Amazon's giving her your parents.  So that's not a bad thing.  And the publishers are getting as much, I presume, getting a cut that they  can live with.  That's the thing.  The only people who lose on this is the is the local bookstore

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  who's charging significantly more rent and stuff like that.  Yeah. Those people are losing out.  But I well, and they'll be gone.  A lot of people don't understand that Amazon is a spot for small businesses  to sell their goods as well.  Yes, Amazon will have some sort of cut out of it or whatever.  But people just seem to poo poo the fact that you shouldn't buy from Amazon  because they're just destroying the local businesses when they never even  think about the fact that that same local business may have an Amazon store  that you can buy from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in a way, that's what I'm saying is, is this just the market rearranging itself?  Because, you know, somebody like Ant could sell books out of his house  and not have to have a bookstore and do well, you know,  and maybe that's not a bad thing.  I, you know, then there's the societal thing.  I mean, I understand your daughter's concern, Stacey, because she wants to have a place  she can go in town. That's a bookstore.  Maybe not so much.  No, she's been a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jeff, you can say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But as a teenager, as a teenager, being being virtuous,  which is really hard to live with because you can't say, don't be virtuous kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'd be proud of her.  I think that's great.  I think that's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, yes, the alternative is way worse.  Like if she's like dumping crude in the backyard and like, screw the dolphins  or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you just be glad.  Yeah. On the other hand, what do you think?  Do you think Jeff Bezos is like that when he was 16?  Oh, Lord, no. Oh, my goodness.  Take over the world.  His father was a circus act.  Like a performer.  Yeah, I think he was famous for his unicycle act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, I was like calling someone a circus act feels kind of insulting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, he literally was.  It was not an insult.  I read this in that book, that wonderful.  Sorry. That wonderful book  about Amazon and I forget the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His parents divorced his mother married.  So he was born Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen. Right.  His parents divorced.  His father was a bike shop owner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, maybe I misremembered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then they married Miguel Mike Bezos.  That was way off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I swear to God, it was in the Everything Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  An engineer for Exxon.  Yeah, you know, Leo, this you can't believe what you hear on podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I swear to God, it was the unicycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't believe what you read before he had a bicycle store.  Maybe, you know, we're going to have to get Brad Stone on  and he's going to have to explain it.  I'll find the book.  It's in the Everything Store, which, by the way, a great book,  even though now it's a few years old.  And at the time, it really annoyed Jeff Bezos, even more so  Mackenzie Bezos, who wrote a horrific,  scathing review on the Amazon site of the book, The Everything Store.  But it was a really good inside look at Amazon and how it worked.  And despite all the criticism from the Bezos family, as far as I know, it was accurate.  So I think his birth father,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the breakfast as a line cook in the breakfast shift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who did Jeff? Jeff.  So did I. Well, no, I had the closing shift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I had Ponderosa Steakhouse myself.  If you like your steak, give you a patented break.  Get steak at the Ponderosa Steakhouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the so his birth father, Ted Jorgensen, had a bike shop.  I quit my day job.  And I swear to God, I swear to God,  I read in that book that he was a circus performer originally.  Maybe he went from you can't be a unicyclist forever.  Maybe he went from being a unicyclist to owning a bike shop.  That would make sense.  Sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, yes, right now, I can see this little motion  graphic above your head trying to connect the dots.  I'm trying and they're just going in circles, just  not connect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see.  He was OK.  His father as a child was just long to a unicycle troop.  Yes, Jorgensen did. OK.  OK. And worked in a retail store making a dollar 25 an hour  and didn't have much money.  Jeff Bezos, biological father with a star in the book, a star unicyclist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he didn't even know that his son was Jeff Bezos.  So what?  Bezos's birth father was a big name on the unicycling circuit. OK.  It says it right here in the Daily Mail.  So, you know, it's true.  This is from Brad Stone's book, too. Yeah. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His grandparents belonged to the Caravan Club, airstream trailer owners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's a picture of him on his unicycle.  I rest my case. OK. Oh,  there are pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. That looks like a photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you know Bookfinder dot com?  That's an awesome site.  It is the best because I need to buy a lot of old books about books and stuff.  The things are out of print.  I wouldn't do this to a current author, but but it's it's every it's a books.  It's everything.  And Bookfinder is spectacular at looking for old books.  I'm going to get dizzy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have actually used it because, yeah, if you want out of print books or, yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but the other point is, Stacey, it also has new books on there from local stores  here and there. Right. Right. So you can buy local still buy at a local store  somewhere and support them. Right.  But the other book trick I've gotten lately, which I didn't know,  there are books that came out in the UK that weren't coming out here for six  months and I needed them.  You can order directly from Blackwells Blackwells dot co dot UK,  which is a good chain in the UK.  And they ship without at good prices in the US without shipping.  So they're a competitor in Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. We got more, including the change log coming up.  But first, a word from our sponsor, our show today brought to you by bandwidth,  not the megabits per second you get from your service provider.  Bandwidth is a C-Lac. What's a C-Lac, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Competitive local exchange.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when you're in a when you're in a see, she's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tested it. Is bandwidth a wave?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a particle, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's capacity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so you have your I-Lac, you have your I-Lac, which is your incumbent carrier,  which is like whoever your phone company is.  But you can also have competitive local carriers, C-Lacs.  That's what bandwidth is. They're an actual carrier and a name  you may not have heard of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He used to be like, yeah, David.  Is it David Morgan?  I can't remember his name.  I'm sorry from like the very early days of covering.  Tech telcos, he and I used to talk about it.  It's very smart. It is David Morgan.  David Morgan. Still. OK.  Yeah, he's a good dude. OK, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all. He was at Republic Wireless for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And yeah, Republic Wireless was actually spun out of bandwidth.  Like, I remember covering that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Oh, OK. Really? Oh, wow.  Yeah, it's funny because, you know, I started talking to these guys  and said, well, I never heard of you. What do you do?  And they started telling me this like, oh, I guess I've been using you  for years because they were.  So when Grand Central started, they used bandwidth to make Grand Central work.  And then when Google bought Grand Central,  bandwidth just went along for the ride and then Google slowly  expanded into meat and everything else.  And yeah, it was kind of I was like an eye opener.  This is one of the things I love about this industry is there are these people,  these companies.  They're they're selling the shovels and the picks.  You don't know, you know, you know about the gold miners.  You don't know about the guys who showed sold the picks,  but it's the guys who's selling the shovels and the picks that keep the whole thing going.  Yep. You know, and that's a perfect example.  Jeff, you ready to sing a song with me?  Surely. Oh, they were singing.  Me, me, me, me. Bye bye, Mr.  Agit Pai. He's going away and I won't say goodbye.  Agit Pai will soon lose his job.  He'll take his giant oversized Reese's Pieces coffee mug  and be going probably back to industry where he came from. Right.  Lawyer for Verizon.  Yeah, never really left.  Did he? Nice piece of advice about this.  Now, this won't happen until January 20th, but almost certainly the party in control  of the presidency. We talked about this last week,  gets a 3-2 majority over the FCC and the chairman's spot.  So with a Biden win, the FCC majority will become Democratic in January  and Pai will no longer be the chairman and experts say is likely to leave entirely.  Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye.  Has not been great for net neutrality,  not been great for Section 230.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm dreading, well, neither is Biden good with 230.  I'm dreading some of Biden's views on technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're just going to have to.  Who is Biden surrounding himself with to help him out?  Bingo. Yep. Bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He hasn't called Jeff yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think his legitimate concern, for instance,  that Elizabeth Warren might get a seat at the table in commerce or something.  I doubt he'd take her out of the Senate.  Massachusetts has a Republican governor.  Yeah. So that probably.  But still, she's certainly advising.  And we know she was very aggressively advocating for the breakup of big tech.  I wonder, though, if the FCC will bring back net neutrality, for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could. I think I think your retirement should be as chair of the FCC.  I think I would do it. No, I would do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would hire you to tell me what to do.  More qualified, but you're too young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am competing with Leo.  I have actually advised.  All right, you can have it.  I talk to FCC commissioners all the time, all the time, not all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I spent I spent one day with Michael Powell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that was original net neutrality, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was funny.  And his BlackBerry, he spent a lot of time in his BlackBerry  while we're walking around.  But that was fun. But that was 2004.  That was ages ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, after the FCC released their original net neutrality documents,  it was Christmas, like Christmas Eve,  or maybe it was the day after Christmas or.  Oh, it's the 23rd.  I'm at my family's house in Houston and I get a phone call and I'm like, Oh, God.  You know, and I had seen that they were out and I was like, I hate you.  I hate you, FCC.  And they were like, please hold for Tom Wheeler.  And I was like, what is happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tom Wheeler called you. Wow.  Yes. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To talk about the new FCC rules, because when I was at Giga,  oh, my was like the most psychotic, most psychotic  broadband reporter in the face of the planet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't doubt you were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I asked you what I like meant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But sadly, I hadn't read the whole thing.  So I was like, I was just pissed that I was like sitting here going, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Tom Wheeler and good.  Tom Wheeler is a really interesting example.  Yeah, he ended up being very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We were always we were always kind of surprised by that, but he did a good job.  I was really we did proud is not the right word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Part of the problem with the FCC chairman is they often come from industry,  as both Wheeler and Pi did.  Yeah. And so you go, well, how can I trust this guy?  You worked for Verizon or Comcast.  They also have the knowledge.  Well, they do have the knowledge.  But Stacey has never worked for any telecom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She has the knowledge and my father-in-law have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's perfect. That's fine.  You can arms lengthen.  Yeah, that's a good.  Honey, stay away.  Stiff arm your husband.  Stay away from me.  And then somebody in the chat room said, and they're absolutely right.  Stacey is less emotional than Leo.  So she gets the job.  Yeah. So there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm good friends with Susan Ness.  I was an FCC commissioner,  and I'm delighted that my FCC fight occurred after she left the commission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She'd have had to recuse herself.  There are some good people.  Jessica Rosenworcel is a very good commissioner.  I have talked to her on several occasions.  Yeah.  So there are good people on the commission.  But it seems like the chairman has a lot of, carries a lot of weight,  really sets the agenda to a large degree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to get it fast.  No, that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They do have to.  They politic amongst themselves.  So that is, I mean, in up until the Trump administration.  And I know, you know, we had Pi and I can't remember, not Carr.  Carr. God, who was the other guy?  Maybe I shouldn't be the FCC chair.  I no longer remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that is one of the rules.  You have to name all 52 FCC chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. All five current commissioners.  Yeah. Well, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You probably do have to open that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Anyway.  But they actually do.  Understand the rules for the most part and try.  I do actually believe that they took their jobs very seriously.  Pi was a little bit of a wild card.  He used to leak stories very negatively to the really conservative press.  He was a little bit more.  Partisan, which is weird for an agency that had been very  it prided itself on being technically and data driven.  They love those words. But anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't think the new president will announce his chairman of his FCC.  But apparently he's expected to announce shortly after Thanksgiving  in just a couple of weeks, many of his cabinet nominations.  And there's some thinking, according to CNN, that  he will announce his chief of staff as early as tomorrow.  Yep. With his claim is the former chief of staff  as vice president, I think. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey, I put the other FCC chair into the Twitter chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, where's the Twitter chat?  Stacey's like, where is the truth?  You could just say the name Google talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know which one she's asking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, you put the whole list in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tom Wheeler, Minion Clyburn, Minion Clyburn,  Jenikowski, cops.  Jenikowski was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, it was Jenikowski, not Wheeler that called me.  Sorry, Jenikowski.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was cool. I talked. We had him on.  Yeah, I talked to Davos. Yeah, he was cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I did talk to Wheeler, just not at that.  That's the wrong commissioner with that story.  Starks is who I was thinking of, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Starks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no. I have told the story of my FCC for.  No, no, it was cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, what was your FCC?  The medical history?  What was that all about? I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So at the time, it was the FCC's largest fine for indecency  to a Fox show, Married to America, for suggestive use of whipped cream.  Oh, my God.  And there were the FCC that said there were 159 complaints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It comes so far, so far from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whipped cream, I know.  That was the worst. That was blasphemy in America.  Suggestive use of whipped cream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I filed the FOIA and I called and I asked.  They said they had 159 complaints from all America,  which I thought was ridiculously small.  Then they admitted that there were CC's in there.  So it was actually like 89.  And then they admitted that there were 23 unique letters.  And then I looked at all the letters and all but two of them  were the exact same letter sent by the parents television council.  So only three people in all of America had bothered to complain  about this show that was the worst thing that had ever been on television  at the FCC. Wow.  And since then, tracks and believe, yeah, because of that,  they now put all complaints up online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, you're the reason they do that.  Thanks, Jess. I love reading those complaints. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also my other proud moment in life in Washington, D.C.  I'm just bragging here.  Well, I love to do that was when I got to testify before the FCC  and say, Baba, we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You said Baba, I did see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you just did that.  So Howard would like you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they used and had they used it as a bumper on our.  Oh, I bet they did. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What did what was the reaction of the FCC when you said that?  Oh, nothing. They didn't know.  Did they know what you did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were warned this jerk was going to do something as a Howard Stern fan.  Fine. Oh, they knew it. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Don't you dare say Baba Bui on this show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't understand what this is or why it matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't. What is this? Bobby Bui of what you speak?  That's the nickname for Gary Delabonte,  the executive producer of the Howard Stern show and people.  It's it's a joke because he did something stupid and they gave him the nickname.  I'll spare you the story.  So now when people want to disturb shows,  they say they know Bobby Bui.  And now on golf tournaments, when somebody shot a good shot,  somebody in the crowd will certainly be sure to yell Baba Bui.  And then they play it on the show and it dissolves the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, somebody once called my radio show and did that.  But the most famous one,  which really I think is the one that will go down in history,  was during the O.J. Simpson slow speed chase.  He's in the white Bronco and everybody's watching on TV in the helicopters and stuff.  I have a recording of it. I won't play it, though.  But and somebody calls, I think it was Tom Brokaw.  It was it calls NBC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, one of the it was  it was one of the standard fake fake phone callers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. His name's Larry and calls in and says, I see O.J.  And oh, I know it was Peter Jennings.  He's going to end. You're on the Euro City.  I'm sitting in my car and I see O.J.  and he is unhappy and goes on for one.  And Peter Jennings is this on ABC on live TV going.  Oh, and very seriously.  And then and the guy at the end says, and Baba Bui to you all.  And then Peter Jennings is baffled as one would be and goes, OK.  And he goes and then Al Michaels breaks in  and Michael says, Peter, Peter,  that is the catchword of well-known radio personality Howard Stern.  It was a prank call.  I have the recording. I'll play it for you someday.  It is hilarious. It's hysterical.  So that's really the most famous use of Baba Bui to us.  It is. Yeah, it is.  And when somebody once did call the radio show  and I don't know what they thought, like I would be all upset. Yeah.  I was like, oh, that's nice. Good for you. Bye bye.  I was like, so what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  We hit the back button five times to figure where we were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where were we? FTC, not FCC.  FTC has now settled with Zoom.  Actually, it's vice versa. Zoom settled with the FTC.  The FTC was mad, as many of us had been, because for years,  Zoom had claimed end to end encryption of all calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't know Zoom was years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. Yeah.  Even as early as when the pandemic started,  Zoom said video calls, particularly end to end encryption.  It was not. Zoom had the keys.  That is not the definition of end to end encryption.  It's the definition the government would want to be like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm talking about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the government wants the keys.  But in this case, the FTC said  Zoom maintained the cryptographic keys that could allow Zoom  to access the content of customer meetings  and secured its Zoom meetings apart with a lower level of encryption  than promised.  Zoom said, yep, you got us.  That was when they started, apparently, started their 90 day  turnaround to encrypt everything.  And they paid some fee.  I can't remember.  Was it 15 million, something like that as a penalty?  But as a settlement.  But the funny part is now that COVID is over  because the election is over and we Democrats can pull back on our hoax.  We were kidding all along.  OK, you dead people, come on.  I shouldn't. That's bad taste.  But apparently, the news that Pfizer might have a vaccine,  and by the way, this was a Pfizer press release  that Pfizer might have a vaccine that's 90 percent effective.  Send Zoom shares down 14 percent.  Netflix shares down three and a half to five point four percent.  All of the, you know, stay at home stocks  tumbled so stupid because of the good news  that there might be a vaccine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's just silly.  And, you know, that's the market just being like, oh, OK.  Oh, world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, basically, the market is they came back up as the day went down.  Did they come back? Oh, OK. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Well, they went down a little bit. Amazon, too.  But but a it's folks, we've got at least a year and a half,  if not two years ahead of us.  B, that's a habits have changed. Oh, thank goodness. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's the vaccine won't save us for a while. Right.  So Netflix stock, Zoom stock, we're fine.  Tell a dog, you want to buy something by

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  minus 80 degrees centigrade freezer stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah.  It requires storage change at 80 below.  Which is going to be challenging, but so do all of those  recombinant computers, DNA, their their RNA, the RNA vaccines.  So they require a refridgerator, at least dry ice refrigeration.  It's going to make it a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I just realized maybe they're going to use the same containers  that bring my catch a pepe from Italy. They will frozen.  Frozen. Oh, no.  There'll be vaccines.  There's a catch a pepe shortage coming to save lives.  It's worth it. So your trader shows stock quick, quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tim Berners-Lee's Inrupt Startups has released its first product,  a privacy platform for enterprises called Solid.  You know, we had Bruce Schneier, who's working on this on  a show last month, and it's really intriguing.  The whole idea. Remember, we were talking about that blob,  you know, Stacey's blob, the idea that your information should be  stored in a blob that you control.  It's kind of what this is all about.  The solid privacy platform allows large organizations and governments  to build applications that put users in control of their data.  Tim Berners-Lee, of course, invented the World Wide Web.  And ever since he's been paying penance,  he said, hey, hey, hey, hey, he's no we he's a great guy.  Wonderful, amazing fellow.  But he has always believed the web should be free and open.  But he's been a little disturbed lately that these companies  are making money using our data.  So he created Inrupt, I-N-R-U-P-T three years ago.  And now with Solid, they have an open source project that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will see what does it do.  Can you explain this, boss? No, it's a server that you it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's like a server that an enterprise can set up and you put people's data  onto it and you can access it and they can, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, very much like the blobs, although they call them pods.  They call them personal online data stores or pods.  The enterprise version consists of the solid server, which manages the pods.  Developers can build applications using an SDK that let you access these  these blobs, these these data blobs.  And then you can but you could you maintain control of it.  It's an interesting mechanism. We'll see.  There are certainly some organizations, for instance,  the National Health Service in the UK is building an application for patients  who can use solid to control their health data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the patient gives permission to the doctor.  Yes, that's good. That's good.  And you build the app to talk to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, to request that information and wait for permission.  So this is the quote from Inrupt.  Patients will be able to permit doctors, family or at home caregivers  to read certain data from their solid pods  and add caretaking notes or observations that doctors can then read.  So it's a central store with your personal stuff.  But you control it. You you keep keep control over it,  which is, I think, a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So basically, I speak to Germans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have a big database that you manually take care of.  No, different tables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you don't have to take care of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, because that does not sound fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I was like, who who who is going to control this data?  You know, he keeps saying that people have control over this information.  Like, who exactly is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Joe Schmo? So I'm going to guess here, but the this is an open source project.  So I'm the National Health Service.  I'm building a health app.  It's in my interest. I want to protect patients' privacies.  So I use the solid database within it and this pods concept within it.  Patients when patient information is stored, it's not stored  in a SQL server database or an Amazon bucket or anything.  It's stored inside a pod, which is designed to be tightly controlled and secure.  And the pod has interactive has an API or some permissions framework  so that the physician puts stuff in there, the caretaker puts stuff in there.  Everybody puts stuff in there.  And then as the as the user, as the owner of the patient data,  I will be they will request of me permission to access that data.  So I don't control it in my pocket.  That was that was actually Stacey's original blob idea.  But then this is probably I would guess one of the issues is  you've got to tell providers you need to use this solid  interface in your code.  It's when developers writing is people will

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the enterprises will use it and will run it and keep the date  because they don't want to deal with storing your data.  They want to outsource that to this company.  Basically, I don't think it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. That's I'm unclear.  So I don't know.  It may be like I have SQL Lite built into my app or my SQL built in my app.  Instead of that, I have solid built into my app.  And that's the data store with all of these controls.  I know it's not clear to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not pass privacy as a service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not clear to me that there's a third party storing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, I thought the inrupt people were going to store it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think so. It's an open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, OK. So no one's no one's doing that, because I don't think a lot of like  the NHS would totally build and maintain the server  for customers using like their stuff.  But then what you have is useless because it's your data in lots of  your data may be stored, but it's all sorts of places everywhere.  Yeah, you want that centralized thing.  Yeah, it's blobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One blob. I'm not clear, actually.  That's a really in the article I'm reading on TechCrunch does not make that clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So because it's open source, I would imagine I could come along.  I'm Pfizer and I can come along and say, I want to buy your health data.  And here's the price. And I can say, yeah, good, Pfizer here.  Take it. Here's right. Pay me. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So I don't know. So that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then the other issue is so all right.  So then I say to somebody, you can have the data.  Do they have the data in perpetuity?  They have the data for a use.  But how do you enforce whether they, you know, Cambridge Analytica, whether they  use that once or now have other uses of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so you're sort of right, Stacey.  I'm looking at on the solid project dot org site, get a pod and a Web ID.  You will pick a pod provider  that will be hosting your pod.  As of now, there's only two places interrupt in the solid community.  So but I guess the theory would be you would there would be a variety of providers  or you can self host.  They say the way to get the most control of your data is to self host your pod.  So you're right on this one, and self hosting means your data is physically  stored in a hard drive. You hold it home and managed by software.  You run in your own machine.  I doubt that will be the predominant way of doing it.  But somebody who's sophisticated enough to do that.  I have a Synology NAS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was going to say it's like Synology or like what is the it's the.  Media server that everyone.  Plex Plex. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Plex runs on my Synology.  There might also be a solid object that runs on my Synology where all my data is.  And then maybe I have a key that when I sign up with a health plan,  I say, here's the solid key.  Please store all my data there.  I think that's an interesting thing.  So you'd either go to a provider that does this third party trusted third party,  or you could do it yourself.  So it's in a way, you know, it's like it's like LastPass.  It's like a password manager.  Many password managers allow you to either use them to store your password.  All right. Or you store it yourself.  I think that's a very I you know what?  It's Tim Berners-Lee.  I'm not going to I'm not going to bet against it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's great. Full disclosure is that I'm an advisor and a shareholder in a company  that he's also an advisor and shareholder.  So, you know, minor.  I haven't seen it in ages, but yeah.  The company. Yeah, they're good.  They're still going. They're great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I thought you said you hadn't seen it in ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like the company. I do with them.  Is the name Tic Toc?  So it's Google. Google.  So there are and there are also there's a on the solid project website.  There is a showcase of solid apps, for instance,  notepad, a simple note taking at the storage notes in your solid pod.  I like this idea.  It's essentially that blob you're talking about, Stacey.  It's a secure enclave that you control, that you put the things you want to keep private.  You either host it yourself or use a third party.  And you have there are ways you can give people access to different parts of it.  This is a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the company that I'm involved in,  I just remember the name for a second, Infinite Analytics.  This company provides marketers with data  to help them understand how to make more effective commerce recommendations.  But Tim Sir, Tim came in and he asked me to be involved  because they thought we thought there was a media opportunity here  and the media company where people were too stupid to understand the opportunity.  So I became pretty useless to them.  But but he talked early on years ago about how you could have a trusted third  party in media that would have data about the consumers use of this media  and that media and the consumer could have some say, OK, yes,  you can tell them all that I like playing horseshoes.  So give me lots of horseshoes sports data.  And and the consumer would then be a control of that.  And the same with marketers.  So he's been trying to build this personal data vault  where you have a market control over it for a long time.  Interesting. You start with health because there really isn't a market there.  But there's a huge control issue there.  So if you can solve it for health, you can probably solve it for a lot of areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here they've solved it with chess.  This is called solid chess.  Do you know it's a decentralized  game? No central server is required to run or set up a game.  So you invite somebody, you play somebody in the data stored in your pod.  So crypto private chess.  Well, you don't. It's a it's a proof of concept.  But you're storing it, you're hosting.  It's very I think it's interesting in crypto.  You could use crypto to protect it.  You would use your public private key crypto to to keep others out of it.  I think this is very interesting now that I kind of understand a little bit better.  I think it seems workable.  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have I have what may be a controversial view about crypto.  What's that? It's adherence tend to be jerks.  I'm an adherent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, OK. I'm an adherent, but not for currencies.  I'm really excited about it for a large scale authentication of automated devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm excited, too.  But it's like it's like admiring the BMW  then realizing you don't like all the drivers because the way they drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a BMW. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do. And she's a two strikes and you're out, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have I have my husband.  We bought we buy all of our cars used in the BMW.  I think it's a five series five, three.  It's blue. It's cute.  You don't have to justify it. It's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's OK. Let me take a break.  And then we got to regally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, I mean, I could do the change.  I should do the change.  Like I should do the change.  You ready to do the change like play the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, closer to the end.  Yeah, yeah. Now's the time to change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's change like.  You probably saw some buzz and noise on the net about Google Photos  storage policy changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I only have two years left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no. Starting in June, 2021.  Any new photos and videos you upload will count towards your storage,  the storage that you either the free 15 gigs that comes with your Google account  or any additional storage you purchased as a Google one member.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I have. Tell me, tell me my my G Suite.  I can use my. Yeah. Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't know.  Different. You get a terabyte with G Suite.  Your Google account storage is shared across a Gmail, Google Drive and photos.  If you have on.  Line existing high quality photos and videos,  people who bought Pixel phones, for instance, until recently,  because they convinced you it was one of the benefits of buying the phone.  Yeah. Store your phone. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You I have a lot of original quality photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any photos you've uploaded before June will not count toward your 15 gigs  of free storage, so those are free and exempt from the storage limit.  So those are free and exempt from the storage limit, apparently forever.  You can verify your backup quality anytime in the photos  app by going to the backup and sync in settings.  After you back up your photos of it as an original quality,  these changes do not or if you have these changes do not affect you  because you've always this has always been the status for original photos.  Right. Pixel one through five won't affect you.  Nothing you need to do today is just that Google Photos,  which used to have unlimited free storage, right?  No longer has unlimited free storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is sensible. People knew that was coming eventually. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's Google actually promised for I mean, way back.  I mean, I remember when Gmail launched, they were like free forever.  La la la. We're like, wow, great. We'll use it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, that was the come on.  And a lot of us have I have sixty thousand photos on Google Photos.  So it's not free anymore.  Amazon still offers free unlimited original storage if you're a prime member.  There are a lot of photo printing sites like a Shutterfly  that I think you could have unlimited storage there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And because they want you to print and also Flickr has an unlimited pro plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Play for that. And you're paying. Right. But that's not expensive.  It's not. It's I can't remember.  I buy it three years at a time because I like Flickr Pro.  Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, this is, I guess, upsetting to people  who have been putting everything on Google Photos.  I think, you know, you said something interesting.  I guess you really could have seen this coming because remember,  Google had Google 411 where, you know, you would call and you would.  It was their information number.  And I thought there's a great free service is good.  It was they killed it because we got enough data. Thank you.  And I think that's probably what's happening with photos.  You've got enough data away. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yet, Leo, yet there's another story somewhere in there  that says Google now wants you to label your photos to help their learning sets.  So they would tell me they don't have enough data.  They realize their data is not good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's bad because I'm you know, it's free.  I guess it's not unreasonable.  Huh? Google, a new optional fetal  fetal, she

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  had new talk at log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder what the halo thinks of that.  A new optional feature in Google Photos and Android  says, hey, tag this.  What is that image?  Oh, gosh, that seems like a lot of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't it.  And and that was the whole point again of Google Photos was that it knows  it's a pug. Wow. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tap on the search button in the apps menu, scroll down.  You'll see an option to help improve Google Photos.  When you click on it, you'll be presented with four tasks  to describe your printing preferences, your preferred collages,  to identify which photos belong to which holiday events  and to identify the contents of photos.  Do you get your work for you? Google Pay.  Yeah. Do you get rewarded?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the thing.  They're doing the work, but they're not going to turn down any additional help.  So, right. That's all they're doing.  I'm sure they're still working hard at all of the tagging and being able  to figure out the facial recognition stuff and animal recognition.  Pretty well without without help. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's done very well. Right. I think the identification is good.  Although, you know, the Google Captures bother bother you, you know, where they say,  where are the traffic lights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So annoyed. I'm so where's the crosswalks?  I'm filling those out for everything that I do nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And don't you know, when you're doing that, you're just training Google  for its self-driving vehicle efforts. Right.  We're just giving them that because we have to.  Bucks a hell out of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Annoying. I feel like it's it's OK because what you get is worth it.  I mean, like the knowledge you get is pretty cool, but that's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  But every single time I click on I guess I don't get a lot of captures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe that's what I get a ton of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just you don't go to new places, I guess, or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I hate change. No change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's been working on adding pay features in its Google photos,  again, for Google One members.  They're just trying to make Google one more and more valuable.  XTA developers spotted this in an APK tear down in version four point four five.  In version five point one eight.  There's more evidence.  New prompts that will alert the user of the premium editing features  and urge them to get a Google one membership.  Not sure what features maybe color pop is one that's locked behind the paywall.  One one commenter suggested pre processing.  Suggestions like.  Saying this is dog food.  No, that can't be what it is.  They're dog fooding it. That's probably.  Oh, here it is. Dynamic.  I want all my pictures to look like dog food.  Can you do that for me?  Dynamic HDR or vivid.  These are all filters, I guess.  Maybe new filters like afterglow, airy, ember, luminous, radiant and stormy  will be behind the paywall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I smell a CFO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you think it's all Ruth Porat's fault?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think so. Like there's photos things.  What's what's this making for us?  I don't there's no ads on it. What the hell? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, you probably smell the shareholders, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Ruth's just doing the bidding of the shareholders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I am one. I'm not happy.  She's chief financial officer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're a shareholder in Google.  Oh, I think we've said this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, he has a small stake in Google that is worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like every show you should introduce him like that personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Google's shareholder TV guide critic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Google shareholders sounds so grand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, OK, Stacey, let me ask the journalism professor and the journalism  practitioner practitioner.  So I my retirement funds are invested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's different if it's an ETF because you don't control those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's mutual funds.  So, for instance, one of the issues, the technology fund,  which is hundreds of technology stocks, Google and Microsoft and Apple  are in there, but I don't control what percentage of it or anything.  I buy the fund. Right.  Yep. Right. So that's OK.  I don't disclose because I couldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Funds are fine. So, I mean, every publication and I've worked for many  and they have been all above board.  You can do ETFs, you could do mutual funds  as long as you're not picking and benefiting from individual stock.  Yes, I'm not. Decisions.  The other option is to create a blind kind of trust situation.  So like for a while, my husband did it all.  And I just had no idea what was in our stock portfolio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. For instance, I think Lisa, I don't want to know what they are,  but Lisa has individual stocks and my wife.  And but that's not I'm not trying to influence her portfolio.  And I don't know what their portfolio contains, particularly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I would say if you own individual stocks,  you need to disclose that or is it on the website as part of your disclosure,  Jeff? But I would have it on my own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said it every once in a while. He said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I say it. I feel like you should say it because well, it's this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I know, I know.  But it's it's what's more relevant is when we talk about Facebook issues  and I raise money for the school from pretty good about disclosing that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've disclosed Google before.  It's not like millions of dollars, right?  Is it? Oh, well, never mind.  I think you should disclose it every time from now on.  And you should buy me a boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little tiny boat for your bathtub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't. For that reason, I've never bought individual stocks.  But that also because I feel like I don't know what the hell I'm doing.  And if I buy an individual stock, I'm going to be burned anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I had I had before I joined the show. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, you did.  And, you know, it's there are some sad stories associated with this.  We had a guy, a wonderful guy, Scott Bourne, who is a regular on Mac  Break Weekly, and I said he had a fairly hefty holding an apple.  And he says I told him he had to sell it.  He did. And he never let me forget it because it's gone up like 800 times.  Oh, yeah. Oh, no, I've had to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, the bird photographer, the bird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Scott's great.  And Scott is an unabashed Apple fan.  So regardless, I don't I don't you know, nobody expects him to say  bad things about Apple anyway. So.  Anyway, I guess I feel like I'm not happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if Ruth did this, so there's photo thing is this penny pinching.  Google should not be a penny pinching company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you know Scott Bourne  recently tweeted within the last half hour for those asking?  Yes, I'm tempted by the new Apple Macs.  But for once in my life, I'm going to be smart.  I'm not going to be.  That's a surprise. New and proven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember waiting on a street corner outside the Apple store in San  Francisco with Scott because he had a tower taller than him  of new Macintosh computers.  And I was kind of like saying, all right, I'll protect you.  I'll protect you. That was the day they were released.  So this is definitely showing some unusual  restraint restraint on the part of Mr.  Bourne. I have, on the other hand, before the announcement was over,  had purchased a MacBook Pro 13.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know this is an Apple.  I know we're in the change log.  But what's your quick review?  Because I don't have a chance to have it yet.  I don't have it yet. But I know what they did.  Are you happy about the oh, yeah, about the huge, huge, huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Potentially, this could be a revolution in desktop computing.  It's the first time in a long time we've had one company  make the entire stack, the software, the hardware, the chips, everything.  And it was a lot of pricing.  Well, yeah, they actually dropped the price of some of the products.  The other products stayed at the same price, but potentially with increased  significantly increased battery life and performance.  So but it remains to be seen.  That's Apple saying it. We'll see.  And the first reviews will come out probably next week, round about this time.  And the first hardware will arrive a week from Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How is it a desktop revolution?  What is it? What is it?  Well, partly because of that, Apple's making their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're saying goodbye to Intel and making their own processors.  And there is an absolute synergy, I think, to one company  making the entire hardware stack, hardware and software stack,  because everything can be tuned.  You know what Big Sur needs.  You know what the applications running on your system need.  You know what they do not need.  Instead of buying off the shelf processors from another company  that's making a generalized chip, you're buying your designing, building  and making chips that are specifically for your particular use case.  That, I think, has a lot of potential.  They're also this is this hardware platform is very forward looking.  They're doing things Intel does not  apparently cannot do, including a five nanometer process,  unified memory architecture.  They're they have one system on a chip that has everything,  including the DRAM is on that one chip,  which means that the DRAM is faster than any outboard commercial RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even their integrated video can't be looked at the same. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, we talked about that because people are saying, well, what about  I want an Nvidia card?  Well, we have to see, but it's potentially faster than what Nvidia can do,  even though it's shared memory.  Well, it's just you can't compare the two because it's such a different architecture.  There's a lot of potential.  I it's going to be very interesting.  I would not if if you don't have a dog in this, I wouldn't.  I like even Scott Bourne.  I wouldn't run out and get the first one.  I would wait and see what because they're going to be issues.  They're going to be compatibility issues because it's not Intel.  And all the software up to now has been written for Intel.  So there may be issues there, although Apple's very good at that.  They have a lot of experience with that kind of transition.  This is their third time changing chip platforms.  But also there'll be issues that, you know, we don't know  what the performance will look like or if there'll be showstoppers or,  you know, if it'll get hot or we don't know any of that stuff  and we won't until we get in our hands.  So there are unknowns.  However, on the face of it, it looks very, very positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, Stacey, I just like from the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Stacey's interested.  She's all into chips.  Yeah, that's right. It's chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's chips. I'm here for that.  Yeah, you're happy for chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would if you're if you're interested, because the problem is, and it's  this is Apple, they don't give you they never even mentioned clock speeds at all.  No, zero.  So, you know, they did a lot of graphs with literally no numbers on the axes.  So you don't know what am I looking at here?  But there was a very good piece in a non tech  kind of an unusual piece in a non tech, because based on very little information,  they were able to do a lot of sleuthing, including they took a silkscreen  of the chip and were able to figure out what all the pieces were.  Wow. One of the things that's going to be very interesting, Stacey,  I'd be curious what you think about this.  We're talking about this on Windows Weekly.  There's a 16 core neural engine on this chip.  So you've got eight.  You've got eight GPU cores.  You've got four high performance CPUs,  four high efficiency CPUs for a total of eight.  But in addition to all of that, notice the RAM is right here on the on the chip.  But in addition to that, you have a 16 core neural engine,  a machine learning engine built in.  This is the kind of thing you get on phones.  But Apple's putting in desktops.  I wonder who that's for.  So the. Yeah, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You probably would. Graphics.  Yeah, I was like, there's tons of stuff that you're going to want to do locally  on your AI stuff that you want to do locally on your computer.  And it could be, yeah, I don't like I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The fact that Apple would devote such a significant portion of I mean,  they had a lot of transistors.  I think it's what was it, 16 billion or 18 billion transistors on this thing,  which is mind boggling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is this is different from the bionic processor on the phones.  Maybe they just stuck it in there just to see what people would do with it.  Oh, oh, what about these things running  VR or right like a headset?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what's also interesting.  So this is an interesting point, too.  These chips, they're dubbed M1 are distinct from the iPhone chips.  We thought maybe they'll take the iPhone A14 or the new A14 iPad chip  and do something similar.  It's clearly based on that platform, but it's different.  And so it's not that they said, well, we got these chips.  We're just going to put it in the desktop.  They've definitely done other things that are specific to desktop.  So they have the capability of saying, and we're going to do one for VR  and we're going to do.  But they wouldn't.  They're not designing a general chip.  That's the whole point is these chips are tuned to the use case.  It very precisely.  So I don't think they put in a 16 core neural engine  unless they see a use case in desktop computing.  And it's not I mean, if you're not a researcher,  if you're using Microsoft Office and Chrome, do you need neural engine?  I don't know. Well, maybe you do. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not yet. Not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So maybe they're thinking of something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because how long do you keep a Mac or a laptop?  Probably average of four years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Three or four years. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, yeah, I would I would say three to four years.  We could be looking at needing some sort of.  I I'm so now sucked into like the IOT world.  I'm like, of course, you need edge processing or edge, you know.  But yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So does this wet your whistle in terms of graphics and photos  and stuff like that, does it does it does it?  Do you see possibilities for all of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In a word, yes. Yeah.  Oh, really? Because you're a Windows guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is. That's why I'm asking. Yeah.  It was exciting for me first off because of the pricing. Right.  I've always been interested in the Mac operating system,  but I could never justify the cost.  You know, if I want to if I had three grand to spend,  I can get X amount of hardware specs with that three grand on the Windows side  versus something a lot less on the Mac side.  So I've always sort of stuck around on the Windows side of things.  But they obviously changed that.  And then they've already gotten Adobe linked in with this  and got support for Lightroom and Photoshop right already out the box.  So, yeah, sign me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the author of this in on tech article, Andre from Asana,  who spends a lot of time with processors, he's kind of a processor nerd,  has this to say at the end.  Apple is absolutely leading the pack in terms of performance and power efficiency  based on testing the chips in the phone and the tablet.  The design was more than able to compete and beat integrated graphics designs.  Apple claims the M1 to be the fastest CPU in the world,  given our data on the A14 in the iPhone, beating all of Intel's designs  and just falling short of AMD's newest Zen 3 chips.  A higher clocked firestorm, that's the performance chip  above three gigahertz, the 50 percent larger L2 cache  and an unleashed TDP total power consumption.  We can certainly believe Apple and the M1 to be able to achieve that claim,  the fastest CPU in the world.  This moment is brewing for years now, and the new Apple silicon  is both shocking, but also very much expected.  In the coming weeks, we'll be trying to get our hands  in the new hardware and verify Apple's claim.  Intel has stagnated itself out of the market  and has lost a major customer today.  AMD has shown lots of progress lately.  However, it'll be incredibly hard to catch up to Apple's power efficiency.  That's because the x86 is inherently much less efficient.  If Apple's performance trajectory continues at this pace,  the x86 performance crown might never be regained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I've been calling for the end of, well, not the end of, but the  what is it when you stop being the supremacy?  So the relegation of x86 to where it belongs, because now...  It's terrible.  Well, it's just it's not efficient.  And where everything needs to be battery powered forever.  Why would you...  And we have so much availability,  like so much capability to design custom processors  and chip designers.  I mean, yeah, everybody's doing it.  I think it makes sense that they're doing it.  And I don't know what else to say about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's some other interesting things.  For instance, it's a highly parallel chip.  A huge increase over what Intel and AMD are doing in parallelism.  So that's also very interesting.  And that, you know, the size of the pipelines  here is remarkable.  So that's the point is that they're doing things  that make it very difficult to do.  Oh, well, that's a three gigahertz chip.  That's a three gigahertz.  It has nothing to do with clock speed.  And I think that there'll be the same complaint about RAM  because they're all maxed out right now.  It's 16 gigs of RAM.  Yeah. But I don't know if you can judge it because...  It doesn't even matter, right?  Yeah. How they're using RAM is different.  iPhones have never had much RAM.  So I think we just have to wait until they come out and say,  well, let's let's open, you know, some programs.  Let's do some head to heads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll also say that  regarding the Adobe part of it,  what they were showing was Adobe Lightroom, not Lightroom Classic.  And people that used Adobe Sweet know that Lightroom Classic is a beast.  It's a pig. That's the beast.  As far as trying to have resources to run it.  You know, so I'm still waiting to see what's going to happen with that.  And then from the AMD side of things, I'm an AMD fan.  I've never really bought into the Intel side of things.  And AMD has been rather exciting for content creators  and how they work with the likes of Lightroom and Premiere Pro,  where you don't necessarily have to offload into GPU acceleration.  The chips are handling quite a bit of the task already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think Stacey's point is really well taken,  which is that x86 should have ended of life, end of life a decade ago.  Intel thought it was going to and then it failed.  It hasn't, right?  And so I think that it's high time to see if we can replace x86 or something better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and they tried. I mean, remember, do you remember Larabee?  Yeah. I mean, they and I was 2008.  Yeah. No, I Taneum was actually that was AMD, wasn't that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, that was Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was Intel. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem was it was so damn hot that it couldn't work.  Yeah. So what machine did you buy?  I bought the fast theoretically, I think the fastest one, the MacBook Pro 16,  13, rather. So we'll see.  I will do like that theoretically.  Yeah, it's unknown.  And, you know, this is the M1, you know, there'll be there'll be many,  many, many generations after this.  So it's going to be I think it's I think it's high time we got rid of x86.  Only Apple could do this at Microsoft.  I can't leave x86 behind.  So it's going to be Intel or AMD on Windows for a long time.  They there are attempts have just been horribly slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't call it a windmill monopoly for nothing.  Yeah, right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, YouTube is down for everybody right now.  I just oh, yeah, I don't know what's going on, but I've just been in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what will you watch tonight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it back? Is it back? No, it's back.  Is it? I can watch. Let me see.  I'm watching Olive and Mabel.  Are you able to watch something? Let me see. I don't know.  Nope.  I can't see Olive and Mabel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, how about YouTube.com slash twit?  I think, yeah. So so the YouTube site is up.  The video streaming is down.  So that means that's a different part of the overall Sierra live stream.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same problem with YouTube music.  No, hold on. It's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what's what's the is there there must be a Google status page.  Let me see.  Is that part of the change log if YouTube is down?  That's that's part of the change log.  Yeah, look, I see a bunch of red exclamation marks next to Google  Compute Engine. Even music.  And music is down to music rests on the YouTube.  So service disruption coming from the Compute Engine.  So that would mean much more than YouTube.  That would mean anybody running on Google  Compute might be having problems. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Snapchat. See if Snapchat's a small notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not it. This isn't this is not a GCP customer.  It's not related to that.  That's just that. And that looks like it's fixed to, by the way.  So, yeah, Google's not reporting a status problem right now.  It's available that there was a problem with compute.  All right. Keep an eye on it.  Is it an overall disruption?  It's still the change. Well, that was a change.  Google's going to factor page speed and experience  into search results starting in May.  So you better get your page loading fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the experience part is interesting, too.  How do they measure criteria?  They're there. It's in the story. Yeah. Criteria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So a core web vitals loading interactivity, visual stability.  Will it be mobile friendly, safe browsing friendly, HTTPS?  That's something Google's been no intrusive interstitials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can finally get that thing off my dropping stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that an intrusive interstitial when you drop that?  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I tell my husband, I'm like, he's like, it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm like, oh, everybody does it, Stacey.  It's not your fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate it. It's less intrusive than others.  It's intrusive, but less and less so than others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't have any annoying ads, though.  I just have tiny banners on the side.  So if you can sit through that interstitial,  nothing else is going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, the problem with it is you think you're fine.  You think you're home free. Then suddenly.  Boing.  Oops.  I know. Sorry.  So Joanie just started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, good. So it's back.  No, it's not.  I'm still spinning on their live stream.  I started listening to that. It's good.  Isn't it good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. It's pretty old stuff.  It's very old stuff.  Yeah. It's your play. Stop, Joanie.  I love you, but stop.  Sorry.  Yeah. It's very folky at the beginning.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see what else is going on in the world of Google.  Google hides free movies.  There's over 40 classic movies hidden in maps,  but sorry, you have to be in the UK.  It's a virtual scavenger hunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're guessing nobody's using maps these days?  Is nobody's going anywhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's part of their Google Pixel Presents  mobile cinema campaign,  along in collaboration with the British Film Institute.  Skyfall, Shaun of the Dead,  The Phantom Thread, good movie,  Wallace and Gromit, Curse of the Were Rabbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is a good movie too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wednesday Day of Gromit.  Fans will be able to search a map of the UK  to find key locations after following clues  with the films then being made available  to watch from anywhere.  That's pretty cool.  You have to, oh, wait a minute.  Hold Your Horses.  Participants will have to ensure their mobile device  connects to a 5G network in order to join it.  I put this in here, I didn't see that.  God, Verizon's everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bollocks, Bollocks, Bollocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well played, Mr. Rand, well played.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouTube premium members are being offered.  I'm excited.  I haven't seen that.  The premiere edition of the Stadia package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've not seen that yet, and I'm a YouTube premium member,  but I've not seen any notification about Stadia,  not that I'll play.  Well, here's a link to see if you're eligible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Simply click this link.  And yes, I am free Stadia controller free.  This is funny, because I signed up for this  and then I canceled before I got it,  because I thought I'm not gonna use that.  It's a $99 value, yours for free  if you are a YouTube premium member.  I can get my Stadia gift right now.  Let me click this.  There's a link in the article.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm clicking that now.  Yeah.  Yes, get your gift.  But I thought I was supposed to get  some sort of email notification.  I hadn't seen a thing, but I'll take my free gift now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, apparently now I have to choose a Stadia avatar.  These are hideous.  Which one should I choose, kids?  Cupcake?  Cupcake?  Or what?  I kind of like the dinosaur, because I am.  A dinosaur.  All right, now I next, your Stadia name is public.  I'm gonna say Chief Twit.  Don't use your real name.  Oh, okay.  That's how I will appear to other players.  Chief Twit the dinosaur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you also have to buy a Stadia Pro?  No, no.  Oh, you do?  This is one, claim your free Stadia premiere edition.  Two, sign up for Stadia Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, son of a gun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Three, get your redemption email.  Four, redeem in Google Store for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, who the hell with you, Studio Google?  How much is it?  10 bucks a month?  I don't know.  I'm not paying for games.  Nope, me neither.  I've got Animal Crossing New Horizons, that's all I need.  Google has added status updates  to the Pixel's personal safety app.  10 bucks.  Yeah, 10 bucks a month.  So it was nice, they were gonna give me a free joystick,  a free coconut sultra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just to get me to play.  Hold that lollipop out of your mouth, huh kid?  Yeah, you brat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google.  So this personal safety app, which, do you use it?  Does anybody use it?  It's nice.  You can now send out a status page  in which you would say, I'm doing okay.  That would be, I guess, for if there's a disaster  in your neighborhood or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.  I thought they killed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just.  Oh no, that was Facebook.  No, they killed the thing where you.  Facebook did it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that, frankly.  Google also had a thing where you could find  your long lost friends in the storm,  but they took that down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They did stop that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so, I can't remember.  Isn't it funny though, all that stuff used to be.  That room?  That all that stuff used to be.  Everybody used to do that, and we were all in it together,  and now it's the hell with them.  Google Maps is getting a trips tab that shows your,  oh, this is sad.  This is cruel.  Your last vacations before COVID-19.  Isn't that cruel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  I think it's kind of nice that they,  whenever I get my little thing that's like,  hey, here's where you've been this month.  It lets you know, it's like, by the way,  you probably haven't been a lot of places  because you're in a lockdown area.  And I'm like, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember when you used to go places?  Is there anywhere in the US  that is not locked down right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Google serves the rest of the world, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But most places, I would imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are plenty of places that do not have,  we are special in a way that we're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Carolina, Texas, Florida.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  We're very purple right now.  Yep.  Unfortunately.  Unfortunately, here in Sonoma County.  I think unless somebody has something else,  that's the Google change law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did want to mention to Mr. Jarvis though,  about maps, how he says, is anybody even using maps?  I still use maps for a couple things,  for just keeping track of the hard heads,  if they say, hey, we need to go so and so.  So I tell them, all right, turn the maps on so I can see you.  And then also, depending on what I'm watching on television,  I'll open up maps just to look at it as a reference  for what I'm watching on television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your voice thing is making you sound curious now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am curious ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a reference, but they're too young.  They're way too young.  Yeah.  But it occurs to me, so I used to always just automatically  turn on ways in the car, and now in the rare moments  when I go somewhere, I don't bother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know where I'm going.  I only go three places.  Exactly.  We had an advertiser about a decade ago.  I was a big fan of it.  Everybody was really into the sling box.  You remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember listening to TI, one of their chip engineers,  explain the new chip inside the sling box.  Low, God, it was like, what, 12 or 13 years ago now?  Yeah, I was really sad.  Actually, I wasn't sad.  This makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Monday, they stopped selling it a long time ago, I think.  But Monday, Dish announced they're going to turn off  the sling box servers.  So they'll continue to operate for a couple more years,  but after that, the hardware won't work.  It needs, I didn't really realize this,  because it feels like you're just connecting  to your home entertainment system from the road.  That's what people used it for.  But I guess for Nat Traversal,  you have to go through their servers,  and they didn't want to keep running those servers.  The sling player is 32 bits,  so it doesn't work on modern Mac OS.  Dish said, we had to make room for new, innovative products,  so we continue to serve our customers  in the best possible way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not mad about this.  No, it happens.  I mean, I'll be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it had a long run,  and they stopped selling the hardware years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, people have had, I think, had a good run with it.  And by now, there's other ways to do it, I would think.  There's a lot more options for it.  Yeah, so let me think about that.  Plex would be the best replacement, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Run a Plex server in your house.  Yeah, this is not related to Sling TV, by the way,  which is probably another very good option,  is subscribe to YouTube TV or Sling TV,  and you get your locals, you get a DVR.  Yeah, what do you need this for anymore?  The idea is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this isn't, yeah, this is for someone who bought it  and is still running it because it worked.  There are plenty of people out there in the world  who are not like us, who are like,  I don't want to think about this gadget ever again.  It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you're going to be thinking about it again  in two years when it stops working.  Yeah.  So this, I think, is a trend  we're going to see a lot more of.  The estimate is about 60%, thanks to quarantine,  about 60% of small businesses will fold in the year 2020,  a huge number, a lot of them restaurants.  And because the only way most people are eating out  these days is takeout or delivery,  Chipotle's opening its digital-only restaurant,  doesn't have a dining room,  doesn't have that line for ordering,  it's just for takeout and delivery.  Why do they call it a ghost kitchen, isn't it?  It's a ghost kitchen.  It is.  Okay.  Yeah, like others have.  And there are a lot of ghost kitchens popping up now,  a lot of restaurants turning into ghost kitchens,  and a lot of new people starting ghost kitchens  for DoorDash and Grubhub and all the other delivery services.  But in my imagination,  this is finally not DoorDash where I live.  You finally got DoorDash.  Have you been using it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not yet, because we literally just got it last week,  and I haven't ordered takeout yet since then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your daughter's going to tell you  that it's mean to the restaurant you shouldn't use it.  It's actually-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My brother actually does DoorDash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In COVID, it is not mean to the restaurant.  Oh, right.  This is the only revenue they have.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if you can order and take out and go pick it up, yes.  But there's like places that-  That's better for the restaurant.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they get more money if you don't use DoorDash?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, they pay for DoorDash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they pay for DoorDash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  So my vision of the Chipotle  was that you would drive along and say,  I'll take a burrito,  and then you drive to the next stop and you say,  chicken, then you drive to the next stop and you say,  put on the veggies,  then you drive to the next stop and say,  yes, squat please.  Then you drive on.  That's what I thought I was gonna do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Someday we're gonna have that vaccine.  We're gonna be able to go to Chipotle's again.  Life will be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sad with the Chipotle app.  I tried to order from it and my favorite burrito,  I can't eat the veggies  because I'm allergic to bell peppers.  But now they're veggie with guacamole.  You have to get the veggies to get the guacamole  and not pay 225 extra.  So I'm sad.  I know this is just-  Boy, you said a terrible thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a problem.  It is a first world problem.  Not even a first world problem.  It's like, it's a first word Karen problem.  It is like, it is like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ooh, white words.  We called you a Karen.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you hate it when you have to pay extra  for the avocado because it comes with the peppers  and you can't eat peppers?  Don't you hate it when that happens?  I hate it when that happens.  I'm sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't.  I'm sad.  No, I'm teasing you.  I haven't yelled at anybody.  I'm teasing you.  I haven't said mean to the people who make my burritos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, of course.  It's wrong and we should all petition.  Let's boycott Chipotle.  Every podcast they advertise on,  I want you to stop listening to them now.  Do they advertise on any?  Oh, I don't know.  They don't advertise on ours.  That's all I care about.  You can roll up on this one.  I'm sorry, Stacey.  You're not a first world Karen.  You're a wonderful person.  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was just noting that that bothered me.  You could say something like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  okay, Joe Rogan.  You could say that.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I would never invoke Joe Rogan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Spoilers, according to the American Medical Association.  No, it's not the AMA.  It's not the American Medical Association.  It's the American Marketing Association,  not affiliated with the AMA.  Spoilers do not harm box office revenue.  This is actually research published  in the Journal of Marketing,  that esteemed academic journal,  researchers from Western University  and the University of Houston,  examined whether spoiler movie reviews  harm the box office.  Do spoilers really spoil using topic modeling  to measure the effect of spoiler reviews  on box office revenue?  They collected daily box office revenues  for movies between 2013 and 2017.  Then they were then matched with their respective reviews  connected from the IMDB.  They measured the spoiler intensity,  the degree of plot uncertainty,  the amount it was resolved by reading spoilers  in movie reviews.  The study results indicate spoiler intensity  has a positive and significant relationship  with box office revenue.  It enhances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't believe that was a study.  Yeah, I mean, people,  we're in a society of people don't wanna miss out  on anything.  So if a movie has been talked about so much  where even spoilers get leaked,  seems like society is like, I gotta see it anyway.  I still gotta see it  because so-and-so was talking about it.  So why would the revenues change?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and here's another theory too.  Do you wanna know how it turns out  so you can talk about it even before you've seen it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I don't even wanna talk about it to other people.  Is it a cheater not a spoiler?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do that with horror movies.  So like when I was watching, especially like TV shows,  when things get a little too intense,  I'm like, I gotta understand what's about to happen.  I do it as like a stress valve or a pressure valve  kind of release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's a question from Emory in our chat room  that I think is good.  Why do they call it a box office?  Do they sell boxes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, you're a TV critic.  That's a really good, I never thought about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is box?  Because the office, you bought it from a thing  that looks like a box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The term box office originated in the Elizabethan area  when affluent people would sit in private boxes  to watch theater.  Oh, really?  To get spare boxes for sold in an office

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  called a box office.  Just like Leo made up about the unicycle.  I made that up, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you didn't mention Elizabethan boxes.  Globe Theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, that was a Google snippet  and I did not click through to in shorts

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  where this information comes from.  It's a really good piece of information though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because it's all you needed, it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The uncertainty reduction mechanism suggests  a spoiler friendly review platform  can help consumers make appropriate purchase decisions.  We recommend that review platforms  keep the warning labels on spoiler reviews  because of the benefit of allowing consumers  to self-select into the exposure to spoilers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get to choose. Yeah, that makes sense.  Don't surprise people with a spoiler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the same issue as snippets.  A short snippet isn't as, which of course,  publishers wanna say you've sold their soul for using,  is actually not as good a promotional item  as a longer snippet.  And even a whole story can be a better promotion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our final story of the day, I'm gonna make it a good one.  The Pope, Pope Francis, papa, urges followers to pray  that AI and robots always serve mankind.  Let's just pray for that, shall we all together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see a movie coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To serve mankind.  The Pope said. It's a cookbook.  I'm sorry.  Do you think Padre was involved in this one?  I think he might have been.  Oh, maybe he was the advisor, maybe.  It's one of the Pope's monthly prayer intentions,  regular missives shared on YouTube.  Well, now we know Father Robert's involved.  To help Catholics deepen their daily prayer  by focusing on particular topics or events.  In August, the Pope urged a prayer for the maritime world.  In April, freedom for addiction.  Probably from addiction.  I would guess.  And in November, it's AI and robots.  The Pope said AI was at the heart of the epochal,  is it epochal, epochal, epochal, epochal, epochal?  Epochal.  Epochal.  Of the epochal change we are experiencing  and that robots had the power to change the world  for the better, but this would only be the case  if these forces were harnessed correctly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Indeed, if a technological progress increases inequalities,  it is not a true progress.  Future advances should be oriented  toward respecting the dignity.  What accent is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm like, what is happening here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't even get to the content.  Of the person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, just remember Pope Francis is not Italian.  No, he's Argentine.  He's from Argentina, but he has to speak Italian.  So that is the accent of an Argent,  native Argentinian speaking Italian in Rome.  Oh, prove it to me.  In English.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm like, um, please not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want to say it's exactly what he sounds like.  Okay, maybe not.  Let us pause and then I'm going to get your picks  and number and all that stuff.  If I might.  Our show today.  Yay.  Yes, it's time.  It's soon.  It's going to be Chipotle time.  Our show today brought to you by zip recruiter hiring  so hard, but you know what?  If you are one of the companies hiring right now,  bless you.  There are people out there dying to get a job with you.  In fact, the perfect person is waiting to hear from you.  So how do you get to them?  You use zip recruiter.  That's the best way to reach out and find exactly  the right person for your job opening.  I'll tell you all the good reasons  you'll want to use zip recruiter.  First of all, when you post on zip recruiter,  you're posting to more than a hundred job sites.  So you're casting a broad net.  You're getting it out there to everybody.  Furthermore, zip recruiters technology  actually helps you find people with the right experience  for your job.  They'll go through those and then find people  that are qualified and actively invite them to apply,  which makes a big difference.  Four out of five employers who post on zip recruiter  get a quality candidate within the first day.  We would get them within the first hour.  In fact, it was always a thrill and a wonder  because we'd post and when you post it for a job,  you really want, you hope I'm going to find the right person.  I really want to fill this position.  And I hope it's not going to be a long time  because you've done a lot of work.  And then that first good applicant flows in  in the first hour or two, you go, wow, this is great.  It really is a great feeling.  And the nice, the other thing I love about zip recruiter,  it doesn't go into your phone.  They don't call you, you don't go to your inbox  and your email.  Zip recruiter, all the applicants go  into the zip recruiter interface.  Their resumes are automatically reformatted  so you can easily scan them.  You can create screening questions,  true, false, multiple choice essays.  So you eliminate people without any work.  You eliminate people who aren't right  for the job right away.  And then the interface makes it very easy to scan over  everybody left, rank them, rate them  and hire the right person fast.  Makes such a difference.  It makes such a difference.  As your business changes, as the world changes,  if you're hiring, I want you to do it right.  I want you to find that right person  because they can't wait to hear from you.  They're just waiting for that call.  See for yourself right now,  you can try Zip Recruiter free at ziprecruiter.com slash twig.  Ziprecruiter.com slash twig.

I got this halo band, now what?  Stacey's thing is next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know how Stacey pops in every now and then  with a cocktail recommendation?  Yes.  This is a non-alcoholic cocktail type thing.  So this is a non-alcoholic aperitivo.  I've been trying to drink less  and this is like super fancy.  I'm doing an unboxing here for you.  But it is called Gia.  Gia.  And this is super bitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's super bitter.  Why would you want to drink that Stacey?  You can bought them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love bitter flavors in my cocktails.  So I'm going to tell you,  this is a mix of lots and lots of herbs.  I'm going to tell you what some of them are  in case you know how they taste.  Gension root, that is the super bitter ankle.  There's white grape.  There's fig in here.  Ginger, orange pill, peel.  I can't say that word.  Yuzu, so fresh.  Lemon balm, elderflower and rosemary.  Sounds good.  So this is a really complex.  This is not it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is the one I'm going to share after you do that.  So go ahead.  G-H-I-A, like Carmen Gia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like, like Aunt Gia,  my daughter's stepfather.  Or not stepfather, godfather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Carmen Gia was the Volkswagen everybody  in my generation wanted.  Oh yeah.  Oh, I wanted it so bad.  Oh yes, beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is really delicious.  And it is, I mix it with tonic.  They have a bunch of little cocktaily mocktails you can make,  but it actually is one of the few,  like I have tried like fake gins.  I've tried a couple fake whiskeys.  I've even tried to fake tequila.  This is actually one of the few that really give me  the sense that I've had a really complex cocktail.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what, really,  if you just put a little vodka in it, it really is good.  Mm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, if you mix this,  I mean, it's kind of like an Amaro or something like that,  or actually more like a, what is it, a Negroni?  Yeah, Negroni, yeah.  So if you don't like Negronis, you're not going to like this.  But if you kind of groove on that super complicated,  I mean, there's sweetness here,  but the bitters are real strong,  the bitter taste is strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  $33 for the bottle,  but you probably, it's probably highly concentrated, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, well, I mix mine like two ounces of this  and two and a half or three ounces of tonic.  So you don't need much, yeah.  It only keeps though, for like three weeks in the fridge,  there's about 12 servings in here.  But then it's kombucha.  And then it's kombucha.  But yeah, for the holidays, especially if, I don't know,  I can't drink every night anymore.  This whoop band yells at me when I drink.  I know, I know.  So anyway, throwing that out there for y'all,  it is definitely one of the better non-alcoholics,  and I've tried Seedlip and all these others,  but this is probably my favorite I've tried so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gia, and you can find it on,  I think they're local to our area.  DrinkGia, D-R-I-N-K-G-H-I-A.com.  Doesn't say where they're from,  but I noticed that the phone number  to text them is our area code, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I actually think they're from Brooklyn, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brooklyn?  It does feel like a Brooklyn thing, doesn't it?  Doesn't it feel like a Brooklyn thing?  Maybe they have local phone, maybe they know where I am,  and they just have local area codes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They also have this whole thing where they are,  they have, they talk about the herbs promoting relaxation.  I don't know about that, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does, it just, it's a good.  It's funny that you should bring this up,  because during the election and post-election,  I've been drinking heavily, but like you,  I don't really want to get drunk,  so I've been doing the same thing,  which is making adult drinks with herbal concoctions,  and the ones I, I would love to try both of these  to see which one you like better.  This is Curious Elixirs, and this was something  Mary Jo Foley told me about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I have tried the Curious Elixirs, which one did I try?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have four different kinds, so,  and it's not, just like yours, it's herbal, not sweet.  They have, and you could put booze in it,  but you don't have to, I just put a little seltzer in,  little perrier or something, and it's really good.  So I like this idea, I'll have to try the Gias.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's not in, I think they actually serve it  in bars in California, but I'm not sure  if you're gonna go to a bar anytime soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I joined the Curious Cocktail Club,  which gives you a monthly variety pack  of all the different four flavors.  So, yeah, it's quite, so I, you know, I have,  it's funny, because at the end of the day,  don't you wanna, I mean, I feel like,  maybe because my parents used to do this,  they'd go home, my dad would get home,  and they'd have a drink, but I don't wanna have a drink,  so I'll have one of these, and it's very nice.  It feels adult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and it just feels, it's, yeah, yes, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got a little something, a little bit more,  a little less herbal, a little bit more.  Yeah, yeah.  Improvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I don't drink sodas.  I feel like I'm being judged,  because this is right here on my desk.  I'm not judging you, I'm not judging you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not judging you.  I'm gonna go have a nice cabernet in a minute then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have so few brain cells to spare  that I just try to stay sober these days.  I didn't used to.  I'm kinda with you, Stacey,  because you don't sleep as well,  and you wake up, you don't feel as good.  I just, I don't, I need the comfort  without the confusion.  That should be their slogan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's shake and not slurred is their tagline.  That's even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shake and not slurred.  So, Gia, drink Gia, D-R-I-N-K-G-H-I-A.com.  We have dueling elixirs.  I have curiouselixirs.com.  Jeff, do you have a number for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.  It's a digital story,  because the New York Times has just passed a milestone  where it makes more money from its digital subscribers  than its print subscribers.  And a lot more money.  All right.  But the numbers are, well,  actually it just kinda passed over a little bit.  So, online, so there's seven million online subscribers  of whom 4.7 million pay for news.  The rest pay for crossword and cookie names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's hysterical.  Yeah, I do, I do all three.  I pay for both.  Yeah, me too.  I don't pay for the crossword.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't care for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  831,000 pay for print.  So, 831,000 readers provide $145 million.  The seven million digital subscribers  provide $155 million, 10 million more.  So, 800,000 versus seven million.  That's the problem.  That's why giving up print is hard.  Meanwhile, advertising sales has dropped 30% to 79 million,  which used to be the primary revenue source.  The subscription surpassed advertising a couple years ago.  But even online advertising has fallen.  So, online advertising is now 47.8 of that 79 million.  So, basically the only thing that's growing here  is digital subs.  They're now at seven million.  They have a goal of 10 million digital subs by 2025,  and they could make it.  But it's a very different business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And bottom line, they're making money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bottom line, they're making money, yes.  33 million in the quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, that's good.  Yeah. That's good.  That's good.  Yeah, because that's an expensive operation,  but digital makes it, I think, maybe a little more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're interested in this stuff,  and I know this is probably speaking  to maybe one person in the audience,  but Mark Thompson, who just left as CEO,  did a great video presentation  for the Bodleian Libraries at Oxford's 700th anniversary.  They did a celebration.  And if you look that up,  you can find a really good talk about change  and change management from Mark Thompson.  Interesting, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The podcasts have contributed to that bottom line,  by the way.  Yeah, oh yeah.  And the wire cutter, and you know, they-  Yeah, they could buy you.  They could buy you.  Yeah, but they bought cereal.  Just cereal, just the podcast alone, by itself.  They spent $30 million buying several startups,  including cereal productions.  Yeah, I think their strategy's been quite good.  They've also benefited from Donald Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, which they say, and they admit.  And so I talked to somebody at another paper  where they're worried about what's gonna happen to subs.
