Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, thanks for having me. I every week my my ears buzz

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But not actually be here yeah, actually last week we were talking about your very clever idea to create a kind of permanent post  Explaining section 230 and it's divided up into like responses to common errors people make  About section 230 everybody from the new york times to this show  It's it's it's pretty common people misunderstood. I must understand what uh section

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, can you do me a big favor can you can you violate quarantine and go to new york and walk into joe  Scarborough's studio and sit him the f down and explain what the f section 230 is  He's gone on a full moral panic tirade every morning. Uh, oh here it oh here it comes here it comes. Oh, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's not the only one oh god no god no, that's true. This is the post we mentioned last week  Hello, you've been referred here because you're wrong  About section 230 of the communications decency act  uh  And which is great because we all need this link  Uh so that we can send people  and then it has uh, if you want if you said and then various things you might have said  Like well once a company that starts like that starts moderating content. It's it's not a platform. It's a publisher  And then mike says I regret to inform you you are wrong. You are full of crap wrong  So honestly, it is complicated. It's hard to understand. There's really two parts to 230  And so it's it's confusing to people none  Less confused none more confused than the congress of the united states of america  Which consistently seems to not only misunderstand 230 even though they enacted it as part of the communications decency act the only part that's still around  but uh  But they constantly trying to undermine it lately most lately with the earn it act  um, yeah  And i'm glad you've taken this on because honestly  I can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sometimes I feel like I am the last man fighting this fire but uh, you and jeff kossoff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's only 26 words, but uh, it seems to be hard to understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well the thing is if you actually read it  It shouldn't be that hard to understand  I think part of the problem is that a lot of the people criticizing it have never even bothered to read it even though it is  It's pretty pretty short and sweet. Yeah  um  But uh, you know, and if they haven't read it then you know, or if they read it and they still don't understand it  They can read jeff's book which is quite readable and really enjoyable  Uh, even even if you're not deep in the weeds on these things, you know  I I actually the funny thing i've said about jeff's book is that when I got it  I figured you know, i'll flip through it and skim it  But I know the story of 230 and I know the law and I know the history and the cases and all that kind of stuff  and it just sucked me in because it's so well written and so interesting and it has all sorts of information and  Uh, you know details that I didn't even know even though I kind of live in this world  So it's it's a great book. I'm sure you guys have recommended it before but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think everybody's of the 26 words that created the internet. Please do pick it up. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have it. I'm ready

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should once you start it really does it sucks you in okay  I know because I mean you think here's here's a book about a law like an entire book about a single  Law about the internet  How interesting can it be and it is the type of book that normally I would get and put on my shelf and never  Actually read but I am telling you it is worth actually trying to read it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I put it there so people will think i've read it. That's the whole right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be me just sort of a poser with it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh as jeff says, yeah, right  Why is 230 important?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, I mean it's what jeff's book the subtitle says it created the internet it created the modern internet  You know, it's it's kind of incredible to to think about it  but you look at kind of the history of how the internet came about and  and  Even if you go back like 100 years and you go to the history of like television and radio and and especially radio and how  That came about where in the early days radio had a chance to be sort of the the proto internet  Where it could be anybody communicating with anybody and it switched and there are powers that be that sort of  Forced it into being just a broadcast medium. So, you know a sort of one to many situation and you lost the ability for it to be  You know one to one one to many kind of kind of communications

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think mark coney actually said that he said why would you want to do one to many?  That seems like yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was not his intention certainly and and and and then you have something like section 230 which somewhat accidentally  really  He sent the internet to be this platform that could do  You know many to many communication and and allow people to to have their voice online  and you know, some people like to claim that it's like the the biggest gift to  to  Big tech or whatever  But I think it's actually the biggest gift to free speech because it really set it up so that  So that internet sites could host speech  without being afraid of it of of being sued out of existence because somebody posted something that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was defamatory or otherwise violated the law. It's why we can have a chat room  It's why your blog people's blogs can have comments  You know google has the resources to protect itself, but do you to protect yourself because your blog comments?  So it's important that we have that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And and I I would go even further than that  But the things that some people don't understand is that you know 230 technically protects users as well  So like the comment space, you know  If you post something on facebook and then the comment space beneath your post if somebody says something there you want to be protected  And 230 does that 230 protects you it protects there are cases involving  People forwarding an email  And and getting sued because they forwarded an email and 230 protected them also  So it does a whole bunch of things that actually protects the free speech of everybody using the internet and without it  It would you know, it would stifle speech and create a real chilling effect on on the internet  And the way it functions and we'd have something very different probably something a lot more  Akin to to broadcast television and radio rather than you know something where anybody can communicate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly why the broadcasters and the radio people want it that way  Yes, yeah why right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're advocating so easy to to misconstrue this this  Section 230 because so many people are getting it wrong and don't quite understand it  Is it the language or what what is it because nobody seems to get this right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I I wish I knew right there like I kind of wish I could go into some of these the the brains of the people  Who are misconstruing it because some are doing it deliberately?  you know some I think are  You know, I think a lot of people just think  That this is the way it should be  And and they don't bother to read the law and they assume that the law was put in place for a certain reason  Or somebody, you know said that the law should be this way for a certain reason and then people have just run with it  And it's really strange because certainly among politicians  They know what the law says and they're just deliberately misrepresenting it and so you have a bunch of senators mainly who have  You know gone out of the way to to misrepresent what the law says  And then what's funny, of course is now they're introducing all these bills to try and turn the law into what they said it already said  Which  Should sort of indicate that they know that they were being misleading before

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mike what drives me crazy?  Is that there are media lawyers media executives and editors who still get it wrong?  who think that if they  Because they go to the what section do that he fixed  They think that it's prior to that and they think that if they moderate any  Public comment and miss something they are more liable than if they didn't which is exactly what 230 was there to fix  I was to give people both the sword and the shield and to this day to this day  I see people in the media industry who are so ignorant of their own business and the law around it that they still say  Oh, no, no, no, I can't moderate anything because that'll make me more liable. Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree and I make fun of those people all the time. I'm going to do a very very narrow bit of defense  For some of those people because I you know  I think the first time I really saw it pointed out, you know as directly incorrectly  Uh as this was actually in a wired piece about facebook about four years ago or something  It was like the cover story about mark zuckerberg  And twice in that article they say that facebook decided that they would not do any moderation because if they did they would lose 230  Which is again is the exact opposite of what the law says law says you can moderate and you're not liable for it  And I like called out the wired reporters for for for saying it  and  And sort of the one what I heard back  secondhand not directly from the wired reporters, but also from some people at facebook was  Effectively like yes, we know that the law actually says the opposite of that  But that law is only for the u.s  and because as facebook  We wanted to put in place some sort of concept or a set of rules that applied beyond just the u.s  The easiest thing to do was to say don't moderate because then you could be liable  And and somehow that got morphed into the idea that that is what the law said  Which is the point, you know  And and I can understand like if you're trying to come up with some sort of set of global rules  You can't rely on the language of 230, but that's that's not a good defense of it, but that's kind of where I think  some of that came

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This morning on morning joe as as my blood pressure goes sky high when I see the moral panic coming  He honest to god said  The washington post doesn't put in nazis  Why should you you should be liable for putting in nazis?  Thinking and this is by the way  Joe scarborough is the guy who can't edit himself because he goes on for 20 minutes asking one question  Imagine two billion joe scarborough's and you got to edit all of them  It's it's absurd and there's no respect for or understanding of the value of the public conversation. That's what brother. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I mean the sort of related issue to that is that what he's really mad at is the first amendment and not section 230  Right because yeah, the washington post doesn't have you know nazis, but then again  You know sometimes the new york times up opinion sections  But it's it's the first amendment that allows that I mean like you can say  You know nazi supportive things that is that is legal. It's it's you know hideous and  Disgusting but it is allowed under the first amendment is the first amendment that protects that and I think a lot of people  Confuse that and then if you know we get back to the the media getting it wrong, right?  The new york times seems to get the 230 issue wrong all the time and they had that you know  That one giant headline once that said, you know the law that allows for a hate speech online  And and blame 230 and then they had to write a tiny little correction that said oh actually it's the first amendment  Which is you know kind of kind of a big mistake because you know  You can change 230 and there are all these bills around to try and change 230  But changing the first amendment is a slightly bigger process and I don't think anyone's really trying to do that right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of changes the earn it act  Uh was marked up today and changed or this I guess it was today and it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they released the new bill today. They'll mark it up tomorrow. Okay, and propose a change that eliminates the teeth

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which I guess is a victory in some degrees if people haven't been following the story the earn it  act is a  Creation of lindsey graham and richard blumenthal, which is kind of a right there a marriage made in hell  and they wanted to  Some see it as a kind of a covert way to undermine encryption  They may not need it anymore now that there's a absolutely overt  Proposal to undermine encryption, but the idea was if you if you don't follow quote best practices  You could lose your section 230  protection they've  Mike if i'm reading this right they seem to have eliminated that you might lose your section 230 protection

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the the earn it act is no longer about earning your anything  Right, they pulled it out, but they kept the name  And and they kept they kept this commission right the idea behind the original bill was that you'd have this commission  Which you know was designed so that they could pretend it was a balanced commission  But it really wasn't  And the attorney general was able to put his hand on the scale entirely and say like this is what platforms have to do  And if that includes getting rid of encryption, then that would that would be one of the items  And so now they they still have the commission and the weird sort of you know, pretend balance of the commission  But then there's nothing like they'll come out with a set of best practices that nobody has to follow and there's no legal penalty  If you don't follow it  So they they pulled that part of the bill  It's possible that if the if the bill became law and this commission comes out and they do set up a bunch of best  Practices I could see congress coming back and then later trying to put those best practices into the law in some way  but but  It's not and so the only thing that's really in the bill now that changes  The law is that they add a new section to 230 that says that  What is now referred to as c.s.a.m child sexual abuse material?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is no longer covered by section 230. I like which I like your line the artist formerly known as child porn  yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well one of the fun things that the bill actually if you go through the end of the the the  The amendment that was put out today is that it goes through everywhere in the federal register that says child pornography  And says replace that with c.s.a.m  So it's just over and over there's like four pages of like oh we have child pornography in the law here and here and here  And now just like cross it out put in c.s.a.m instead. So yes, that's the new the new term because child pornography is no longer  Allowed, I mean that sounds bad the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, you also make an excellent case which is that big tech seems to be taking the rap  For child sexual abuse. Yeah material as opposed to the creators thereof like it's all your fault  And fix it big tech  In fact ron wyden, I didn't I didn't realize this but again, this is what we learned reading tech dirt  Has a little uh known  proposal to uh to encourage enforcement of child protection laws  In lieu of going after big tech here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and and yeah for some reason his bill didn't get very much attention  I saw he just put out a statement about the new earn it act saying that it's it's a problem and again  You know pointing to his alternative which is basically saying like, you know  laws  Right, like the real problem is that the law enforcement the doj and others are not enforcing it  And if you look through the details like the doj actually was required by congress to to  And has been allocated a whole bunch of money  to go after  You know people who are engaged in in in c.s.a.m, which is the you know, uh the the correct term now  And they haven't done it and they're supposed to put out a report like every couple of years or something  I forget the exact details and they haven't done it like they literally have just ignored what congress told them to do and what?  Congress allocated for them and then they blame  uh, you know the the different tech companies and you know,  The sort of related issue to all of this is that you know, the tech companies effectively all got together  And put together this voluntary system where they are reporting all of the different, you know  When they come across any kind of  Of this content they're reporting it to nick mech, which you know  The national center for missing and exploited children and they put together this amazing system that allows them to to share  The content with the other platforms and in a hashed form, you know  They're not sending around this material but in a hash form so they can identify it and block it and stop it  And it's you know, it's an incredible  You know voluntary initiative that they've put together and that's actually being leveraged against them  You know the the reason this bill came about in the first place was because there were these reports about how much  Content how much of these, you know  Sending to the database these platforms have done  So yes, like facebook has identified a whole bunch of really really awful content  And they are reporting it and helping to make sure that that gets blocked across the internet and not just on facebook  And they're being blamed for it. And so, you know this bill again, it's it's targeting the wrong thing  It's not targeting the actual problem. It's kind of like blaming the testing for the corona virus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't sound fair at all if if the big tech companies are actually trying to say hey  These are bad actors or what have you exactly right? They're not necessarily  Harboring it on their platforms. They're just saying hey we found some people trying to use us

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They revealed how much there is right and that's right everybody, but I think that points to an underlying there's an underlying  Thing going on here that a lot of this is just theater that it is. It's a convenient political  Weapon that can be wielded against big tech  By the right primarily  Um, you know, it's their fault. It's their fault. It's their fault. No, but no, it's not just the right too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's it's not the right joe biden is joe biden's against appeal of 230  Yeah, it just drives me nuts. I know people who tried to get into the campaign and say stop  stop

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's yeah, this one this issue is not just the right it's and it's you know, monsal's a democrat  Absolutely, right and there there are other democrats who are supporting it as well  And you know the more you look  The the the deeper you look behind it you realize like the lobbyists who are actually working for it are basically like the who's who?  Of of the big internet company enemies. So like there are hollywood lobbyists who are pushing this bill very heavily  Uh, and so like the joke that somebody made and i'm I forget who told it to me  so I I should give credit for it and I I won't but like  We're saying that like, you know hollywood might want to think twice, you know, especially as like more and more people from hollywood are being accused of  various  not such good behavior  And of promoting certain things like, you know, so someone said, you know if if a hollywood production has somebody who is  You know credibly accused of  you know  Being a predator of some kind like maybe they should lose the copyright on those films because that's basically what the the structure of the  earned it act was  um, and so or  or you have like  some telco companies have been  Lobbying for this just as a way to kind of you know  Take a stick to the internet companies that they feel are taking their money and then the other the other batch of lobbyists  Which I find funny are sort of the old school tech companies  The ones who miss the boat being, you know oracle and ibm  Who have also been lobbying for for getting rid of 230 because they don't  Rely on 230 because their business because they picked the wrong business model

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is genuine anti-encryption sentiment and that's kind of come forth now graham blackburn and cotton have both  Have are sponsoring this so-called law so-called it's very clear  Lawful access to encrypted data act which essentially  Insists that law law enforcement should have plain text of any encrypted data  Without saying exactly how it's to be done  Uh is I wonder if that's one of the reasons the earn it act lost his teeth. They don't need it anymore now that they've got the  lawful access

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  act  There's been this weird discussion where some people are sort of making that claim  I think it is related to that like I think they put together this bill in part because they knew they had to do something  to sort of  um  Claim that there was no encryption issue with the with the earn it act  There is still a little bit of of worry about how encryption could sneak back into the urn it  This the the laed  Bill probably has no chance of passing  but the the funniest the funniest thing I saw was  I got  A press release when when that bill came out. I got a press release from this group  and i'm blanking on their name, but the it's  uh, it's  An advocacy group that's been around forever that advocates against porn just in general like they think porn is evil  And they think it should all be completely blocked on on the internet  And they sent out a thing praising this new bill because they said it proves  That the urn it act is not about encryption because this bill is about encryption and therefore we should pass both of them which  doesn't make any sense  It's not consistent in any way shape or form but um, it's it's I mean, there's just so much so much nonsense  And I just feel like you know every two days or something somebody produces a bill that  You know doesn't understand how technology or the internet works at all or why any of this stuff is important  And it just seems somewhat performative to say like we're standing up to these big internet companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's not purely performative. It's you know, we're four months away from an election  Yes, it's really if it's performance it's performance with the goal of impressing the voters if nothing else sure so mike  I want to pass i'm a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Yes, sir  Um, I mentioned this show last week so more folks again mike but I want to send you i'm i'm part I was part of a  This will take two minutes transatlantic high-level working group for content moderation and freedom of expression. That's the end of it  which which  proposes a different  uh more flexible framework for accountability and transparency instead of the kind of regulation we have and the hate speech laws and stuff  So i'll send it to you because I think you'll find it interesting. Yeah, I want to I'd actually we're going to take a break

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I would love to talk a little bit  uh, because really all of these laws would impact  American  You know our american european part, right? But what but there is a global issue, uh, you know  You've got on tecto brazil has proposed a fake news law that says  You know internet users are guilty until proven innocent demands constant logging from isps  So there's a global issue, uh for sure going in europe just there was just a report out in europe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think last week like you probably know better than I do. Uh that said that basically was envious of china  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  China's doing it right. They know how to do it man. We uh, not only they they clobber covid  But they know how to keep a lid on these big

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tech companies. Yeah, I mean it was it was a report prepared for the european parliament by an outside group  So there were there are questions, but it wasn't necessarily the european parliament endorsing it  But it was a like hey that great firewall. What an idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well that really works it didn't get hooted off the continent is just frightening  Yeah, let's take a little break. It's so good to have you mike masnick from tech dirt.com ant pruett

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  from hands-on photography jeff jarvis from the craig newmark, etc and uh  Our show today, uh brought to you by wasabi not the hot stuff you get with your sushi, but it is hot stuff. It's hot cloud  storage the perfect  Solution for anyone who is generating  Terabytes of data weekly and is and going out and buying more storage all the time wasabi  Is the is your is your savior?  It's it's better than on-prem storage. It's more secure than on-prem storage  And they have quite a bit of capacity  They're they're ready and willing to help you with your capacity issues wasabi is 80% cheaper than amazon's s  3 is significantly cheaper  It's also significantly cheaper than on-prem storage  Typically you could store data in the cloud at wasabi for less than just the maintenance fees  Just the maintenance fees on the same amount of on-prem  storage and  You know people I think maybe the argument is yeah, but if we don't control it  It's you know, it's out there in the cloud somewhere. Let me tell you it's safer in the cloud than it would be  in your server closet  11 nines of durability that's one file every  649,000 years you're not even gonna lose that because they do integrity checking every 90 days on every file on wasabi  They're hosted in redundant premier tier 4 data center facilities highly secure  And the and the other thing is your data is secure by default encrypted always at rest even if you don't specify encryption  They have access control mechanisms things like bucket policies and acls  So you can grant permissions  To people who have need access and prevent people who don't from getting something you can even I love this part  Designate data as immutable. It cannot be changed. It cannot be erased or altered  Protecting you not only from the ransomware guy waiting to jump but also from yourself from  fumble-fingered employees  HIPAA compliant FINRA compliant CJIS compliant  This is the way you want to store the data and did I mention 80% cheaper than amazon?  S3 and up to six times faster plus, you know things like they don't charge for egress  You know, I you know that hits me every time, you know, I got transfer something else of s3 and say well that'll cost you  There's no they don't have those complex storage tiers. No api requests just a no charge for api requests  Oh, yes, by the way, they support the s3 api. So you already have tools that work with it  It is really a great solution  If you're a managed service provider and you're selling storage, you can actually you'll love this you can earn more and charge less  Everybody is happy now. There's two ways to pay there's pay as you go flat rate 5.99 a month for a terabyte  or  If you know  You're going to be using a certain amount of data. You can get the reserve capacity storage it you buy cloud storage  Kind of like you buy on-prem storage you say all right  I'm going to purchase this amount of cloud storage in a one three or five year increment  You get bigger discounts for both longer terms and greater capacity  And you it's locked in you know how much it's going to cost  That's another thing i'm trying to knock down all the pins all the reasons people say no  No, we have to have we have to buy another sand. No, we have to do you don't you need wasabi  It's just great. You just pour your data up to the cloud boom. You're done  Calculate the savings for yourself start a free trial of storage for a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This has been a big story from the past. Please. Mr. J  So a micro-money of it  The the protectionism that occurs  Uh in the industries that are threatened by this i'm just trying to find it right now  So in my in my research on gutenberg, I have just reread the book media at war  1995 by gwyneth jacobay  It's an academic book. It's about radio at war or newspapers at war with radio actually put it properly  And and and I remembered a couple things they did have you ever did you ever hear of the built war agreement?  Mr radio no  So in 1933 when newspapers were fearing that that this radio thing was going to come in and they were going to have news  On it and f that we don't want that that's they can't do it  Well, they're they're all idiots and we are the only ones who have any hold on truth think about this was the first  Real competitor to the medium of print radio  So they they went after them and they they had a meeting at the built war which they agreed  That cbs and mbc would abandon news gathering  They would be forced to pay for news coming from three wire services  Uh, they they would not be allowed to put any advertisements on anything related to news  They'd be limited to news bulletins of five minutes  And their commentators were prohibited from discussing news less than 12 hours old  So  This is what the newspaper industry attempted to do  It lasted until 1938 but petered out because some newspapers owned radio stations and didn't like it and the wire services wanted to sell the  Radio stations and so they didn't like it. So it went away the newspapers tried other tactics, right?  They threatened to stop printing radio schedules, you know like tv listings in their papers, but the readers hated that  So they said fu we want the radio schedules. They had to do that  They lobbied to have radio regulated, but this is really cool  They lobbied to have radio regulated by the federal government as indeed occurred  And then they said that any companies that are regulated by the federal government should not be allowed to cover congress and shouldn't be allowed  Into the press gallery  Oh, wow wonderful little yeah, isn't that great?  They uh, they blamed radio for taking advertising revenue from them  But the depression is probably what killed more or newspapers  And as jack away said it was all cloaked in a self-important  Sacred rhetoric and we're the ones to give you the news. We understand what's what  Um, they also feared that the unfamiliar it's amazing. It's all it's all exactly, right?  They said that the radio through the magic inherent in the human voice  I'm quoting here for a book called propaganda the news has means of appealing to the lower nerve centers of creating emotions  Which they hear  mistakes for thoughts  Radio is just showbiz they said we're the voice in your head  The sense of hearing does not satisfy the same intellectual craving as the sense of reading  Most folks are eye-minded  So they they uh, yeah, but but it's exactly  Exactly parallel today, right people  Radio is crap people are it's filled with crap people are too stupid to realize it. They're going to be affected by it  We have to clean it up. We have to stop it from happening  When was what year was that?  1933 is when it started and it ran for quite some time because I mean if you think about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In a way, that's exactly what joseph gebels did with radio in nazi germany

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean so so the argument the argument was that radio was going to be used but also I would think that that um,  But fdr  Also used it right after fire site wanted the new deal  And most newspapers at the time were republican and opposed the new deal  So he said f them i'm gonna go around them and do fireside chats

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, and so and it proved to be very doomed. Are we doomed to repeat this cycle forever?  Yes on and on and on it happened again  with uh television it happened again with uh telcos go the r-box going into  News same exact thing happened and there's this i'm gonna read a quote if I may jack away the author from  um  An actual academic on light b  Where the hell did I put it now?  I'm sorry  I messed this up having been presented with a new technology  Contemporary actors voice their concerns about how the new medium will change their lives and in doing so reveal their vulnerabilities  In their hopes of technological deliverance is reflected the ways in which the current lives fall short  In their fears of technological danger can be heard what they hold sacred and are most afraid of losing  Listening to fears about the impact of new media is much like interpreting dreams. Isn't that lovely?  These are the collective nightmares of people or an institution about the potential dangers of changing the familiar media ecology  Beautifully said and she wrote this book in 95. Uh, she wrote this  But she had to have finished it before  The web yeah for the internet which is any of that coming and what the parallels are just magnificent  Yeah, yeah history has a way of echoing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yes. Yeah always does it's kind of depressing actually. I feel like yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We never just gonna stay in my four walls. Yeah safer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think it leads to the people who know the history to uh, that's right into uh, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A habit of of screaming at people. Thank god. Jeff Jarvis reads the old books. I'm not reading it. I don't know  So this was the week for cancel culture, uh, I could just go through all the people who have been banned or  blocked or kicked from youtube and  Facebook and  It's funny because this is the this is the the back and forth the reaction and then the reaction and even parlor  to start  Parlor had to start banning people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Parlor is the last passion of freedom of expression. Yeah, no, how could this happen? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, I actually created a parlor account. I was mortified because when you first create an account it immediately  Tweets on your behalf, whatever you call it. It immediately says oh leo's i'm parlor everybody. It's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So just a word of warning when you first sign up sign up with a  Uh deleted dead post a second name

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man, how embarrassing and then apparently they're offering parlor which has been around for a couple of years  It's a twitter. You know clone basically a competitor  And was discovered just recently  By members of the republican party and the trump campaign  And has been you know touted as the a bastion of free speech safe from the cancel culture  And and of course you're immediately offered when you join, uh  Array of right-wing news organizations like bright part bright part. Yeah, that was the first thing so you kind of know  Maybe they don't mind that so much  Although they're at great pains to say look look. No, no, no, we have no political point of view  We just we're just you know, we're just here doing our job  They they did offer I think they first offered 20 000 and up to 30 000 to a to any  Liberal pundit who was willing to come on?  And be a target boy  On the site. I don't know if they've awarded that money or not, but now they're off actually starting to  starting to ban accounts already, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they they uh  What's funny though is  They they sort of keep changing the reasons why they're banning accounts  And then everybody's trying all the the fans and supporters of parlor are trying to justify it  And and I keep trying to point out that like the reasons that they say it's okay for parlor to do it are the same reasons  why  All these other companies twitter and reddit and youtube and twitch are banning people they have rules people violate the rules  And so then you get you get in trouble for it  And that's the same exact reason that parlor is giving and you know, I just I find it hilarious that parlor  Claim that that you know, oh, yeah, we're only  The only content moderation we do is based on the fcc which doesn't apply to the internet  uh, and  uh, and the supreme court of the united states  And and their their community guidelines when I see it  Right, right  But the funniest thing is like if you read through their their entire community guidelines, and I said this  In my post like it feels like you know some 20 something tech guy  Went to like the wikipedia page for exceptions to the first one  Copied the headings and then just put in what they think it all means which has nothing to do with like the actual, you know  You know very clearly laid out limits to to the first amendment  Which you know involve lengthy trials and careful analysis and yet parlors just like, you know, no no  We're going we're going to follow those rules  except if you  Have a username that we find offensive then then we'll kick you off  It's like that's not that's not against the first amendment

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, you know, these are hard. These are really hard thorny issues  Although parlor did something right that maybe these other guys should do neil ipatel called it the reverse 230 clause  Where you're you're you're on the hook for parlors legal expenses if they get sued  And as you point out mike, I bet ted cruz will start supporting section 230 once he realizes  He's going to be paying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If parlor gets sued that's yeah  I mean one of the points I made like a lot of people called out the the uh, that indemnity clause  You know the thing is like that indemnity clause is actually in a lot of different  Social media sites and or used to be I saw a few of them have pulled it  I think twitter used to have it and pulled it. I think twitch did the same  But um, youtube still has a very similar  Indemnity clause, but the thing is it never matters because of section 230, right?  The only reason that would come into play is if you didn't have section 230 and the legal fees might actually  You know be substantial and might actually matter and a platform might want to shift those over  But it's funny because you know ted cruz has been one of the the most vocal opponents of section 230 and one of the most vocal  Misrepresenters of 230 and yet here he is now being like the most vocal supporter of parlor  And I and I honestly think that you know if 230 went away and he realized what legal liability he had just put on himself  He might rethink that stance if if that is he were intellectually honest

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what I I that what makes me wonder if all of this is not just grandstanding and you know  That's not it has no nobody's going to do anything. So is the season. Yeah white supremacist david duke and richard spencer  banned from youtube  Let's see facebook, i'm sorry reddit killed a number I think several thousand as I remember  um about 2000 2000 subreddits including the donald  And all was in them choppo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  now  The the whole david duke thing on youtube that that made me scratch my head a little bit now  I'll be the first to tell you I never went to look up his youtube channel

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I don't know what was on you're no fan of the grand dragon. Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Clearly, but it made me wonder, you know after seeing that, uh, like what content was being displayed?  And knowing that it's david duke how much content was it was it just two videos was it a hundred videos?  How long have they been there and if it's been more than a week?  What the hell took youtube so long?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I yeah, i'm i i don't think there's any defense of keeping that necessarily up  I think you know youtube stands for the longest time was that they  You know, they didn't want to be accused of bias, right?  and this was this is the whole thing why so many different different sites have sort of tiptoed around this is because as soon as they  enforce the rules in a way that that happens to impact a  republican or  Supporter of trump suddenly they're accused of bias even if they actually are treating other others equally  And so  You know a lot of these platforms have really really tiptoed around these things and youtube was definitely one of them  And they basically said well if it's not directly violating our policies  then we're going to leave it even if even if it is, you know horrible and awful and  Eventually, they said, you know, okay, we have to we have to adjust our policies even further. So there's a big there's a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  balance beam  Which is going to cause me greater pain  And is it going to cause me greater pain to piss off donald trump or is it going to cause me greater pains to piss off?  Black lives matter and the scale has shifted  so now youtube acts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cool, go ahead a hypothetical would be  David duke was was clever about the content that that he and his team produced where it didn't necessarily come off his hate speech  Is that the argument?  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think they feel any need to justify it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think so that goes back to my first question. What took so long, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I I think well, I do think it is part of it  They they actually were somewhat careful and if you not that I spent much time  Paying attention to to his youtube feed or the related youtube feeds either but they actually do tiptoe themselves a little bit  To try and present it in, you know, sort of a buttoned up light. They're they're they're horrible viewpoints  But I I think you know it goes beyond that scale  You know the scale suggests there's sort of like two sides to this  And I think it's it is a lot more complicated than that and that  You know one of the things that I keep trying to point out to people is that every content moderation  Decision involves trade-offs and it's not just one or the other  It it involves a whole long list of of trade-offs and you go through the list of options that you have and every one  Of them is bad and and that's a problem that I think people don't quite get they assume that there's  Like there's obvious answer that if we just do this and we just get rid of this then then we've solved everything  And yet the the real thing that happens is, you know, every one of these has some issue that  You know will come back to bite you no matter what choice you make  And it it it's this, you know  The people who are doing this job it puts them in this impossible position where they're trying to balance  So many different interests and no matter what choice they make  Is is not going to work in some ways going to cause some other problem  And and I don't know  You know frankly how how people can do that job when they know that every decision they make is is a bad one  And they only have bad choices including doing nothing, but that is one of the choices and so often like  When you just have bad choices in front of you doing nothing is seems like the the best choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so I just got to tell it around mike you're hired tomorrow  By zuckerberg at a huge money. Oh don't fall for it mike. He does this to us every week. Don't fall for it  Go ahead. What what do you what do you what do you what should facebook do? What?  Having just laid out  The gordian knot that is facebook  What do you what do you what would you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well  I I wrote a paper last year  That lays out what I think these sites should do  That they probably will not do but what I think they should do  Is effectively take themselves out of this business but enable everybody else to be in that business  And what I mean by that is that they should restructure things so that they are not  A silo that controls everything where they have to make all the decisions  But they effectively open up their platform so that anyone can build an implementation can build their own facebook or could build their own  facebook filters  and allow anyone to come in and make those decisions and then allow anyone to adjust those or to make their own decisions and sort of  Go back to what was the sort of promise of the early internet of you know pushing the power out to the ends of the network  Let us let a million parlors bloom  Exactly, but allow allow them allow them to communicate with each other federate and  And it could be federated it could be there's all different ways that you could do it  But you can put in place some ways of doing that where there are incentives for for better overall behavior  And the the the analogy that I use and it's not a perfect analogy and you can criticize it  But the analogy that I use is email or email, you know for the most part is based on these open protocols smtp or  imap and whatnot and  Anyone can build their own implementation of it  Anyone can put together an email server or you have companies that come in and offer it and obviously you have gmail being  You know probably the biggest provider of email out there  But google has actually incented not to be awful with with gmail  Because if you don't like what they're doing or you don't feel safe using their product  It's very easy to switch to some other email provider and when you switch you don't lose access to everybody  You can still communicate with your entire  Book you can export your your all of your email  People can always reach you or you can set up things in different ways  You can have a gmail address but use a different client or you can have a different email address  That is not gmail and use gmail as your client like you can mix and match and and you can  You know add in different filters and different tools and different people can build different things to go on top of it  And you have this structure that allows for a lot more experimentation a lot more competition and a lot more incentive for good behavior  While pushing the power out to the ends and not just relying on one central source to control everything  And if you don't like it, you're you're stuck. What's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you just what's the business incentive to do that though?  Basically, you're getting you're saying give up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I I think google's pretty happy with gmail and what they've gotten out of it  It might not have the same margins as other parts, but this that protocol existed before google invented gmail

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's not like google invented email and then said hey, why don't you all do it too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so I think well, I I think you're right like there is some something that has to give in that  But part of my argument is that the cost of continuing to control everything gets higher and higher

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gotta make the pain so high that they finally say well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's getting there and I also think that there are some potential interesting other business models  And you know the one that gets the most attention and i'm not endorsing this because everybody gets mad at me if I if I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well either way, uh, no one is gonna get mad at you here mike. Well, maybe jeff watch it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I will pre-roll my eyes and say there is the potential of of very  Uh with some of the like cryptocurrency  Possibilities to create business models around protocols that are different where the incentive is to have more people just using the protocol overall  And not just sucking up everybody's data and making use of it  And so I think there's some potential there  I think there are a couple other business model ideas that could work as well  And like the only way we find out is if we allow for that experimentation to happen isn't isn't at jack

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um before covet wasn't he toying with that with the with the notion of an open platform and building on top again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so he and and he he credited my paper, which was a little bit scary  In in in helping him make that decision he read some other stuff too  It's not it's not all my fault. Uh, and I know that that I you know  I know that that twitter folks are still exploring that and they've they've reached out to a bunch of people and I know that  People are kind of working on like how would that look?  And you know the one thing that i've  The deeper you go into this and the more discussions you have is that again like everything else you start to go down different paths  For like how how would this work and how how could this look and and no matter what path you go down  You do run into challenges and you run into hurdles and it's not clear what will work and and if you  Go through the thought process of saying like well, what if we we set this up sooner or later  You're going to to come across a situation where you say well what happens when?  You know, whatever the nazis take over this part of the world, you know, and and and  It will create challenges and I know that like on the content moderation question, you know  There are some people out there who say like oh, you know  They embrace my paper more than I do and they're like well this will solve all the content moderation problems  And i'm saying no like no matter what you're still going to have content moderation questions  But I think that this approach allows for more experimentation and somebody who's probably a lot smarter than I am will actually figure it out  By not just limiting it to to you know  A few giant companies within a 50 mile radius of where i'm sitting right now when this all started

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When this all started becoming a problem a couple of years ago, corey doctorow  told us  uh  This is where geeks have to step up and invent 20 new facebook's  I don't see any publicly held companies saying hey, you know what?  We got a new idea. We're just going to give away our intellectual property and let everybody do it  But I could see  Many people coming along and saying well, we we need to make a better one  I mean in a way isn't parlor a response to twitter and if there were and so is mastodon. Um, yeah  Is that is that viable doing it that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't I just don't see publicly held companies all they're doing is trying to copy  What was rather than trying to invent something new i've been arguing that the that the internet so far is made for speaking  No one's making it for listening that well this would be giving away

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This would do that giving away the facebook platform or the twitter platform would not create something new  We just create more facebook's. Yeah. Well, we don't know it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. You don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, if you if you allow for the experimentation you might begin to see some some really interesting things  The other thing that that you know, corey's argument is a little bit more  Nuanced than that even and I and I agree with corey on this one  I think it is important his argument is not just that you want people to create 20 facebook's but you want them to  to  Without needing facebook to say, okay  You want them to be able to go in and suck out facebook's data, right?  And so he he's trying to force the same kind of thing that i'm doing  But doing it without the permission of of those large companies because it could be a legal framework to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could see yes, you could see that be kind of almost an eminent domain a government saying. All right, that's our data  You got to let it free

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, but right now the law is actually the opposite and this is partly like facebook's doing right? I mean they  Have have  Cases, yeah  I mean they they filed these the big case that they did was  Against this this company called power.com that tried to build like a unified interface for all the different social media  Companies is about a decade ago. And so you could give  Power your login  So it was authorized but facebook said that that was unauthorized access and it violated the computer fraud and abuse act  Which is you know  Supposed to be about hacking and yet the courts bought that argument and the court said yeah, that's right  So because of that facebook is able to block access  To to their service and so that makes it much harder to build that what what corey refers to is adversarial  Interoperability, which I love I I also think is really important. It's a great phrase. Yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry and I interrupted you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you have no no, he said I muted myself. Sorry, but no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just saying that's pretty much what we were saying last week about these extra  Spin-offs if you will of different options for these social media platforms. That's pretty much the same thing. Yeah. Well, i'd love to see it  I don't see it happening, but it'd be nice  Where's your paper published mike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, it was through the knight institute at columbia  So and the the it's called protocols not platforms if you do a search on protocols not platforms  Uh, it should be the top result and it's it's uh at the knight institute  At columbia and so very sensible

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sweet, what's your background? Like how did you start? Uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How did you get to be so smart? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the first guy i've ever met who's as smart as corey doctor oak and explain corey to me. So I i'm very grateful. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, my background is not that interesting. I I I I have a degree  Of all things in industrial and labor relations nice, uh, and so  If you want to know about labor disputes in the early history of unions, i'm your man

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It shows you have a high threshold for boring topics. So that's that's very useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think unsolvable ones. Yeah insoluble problems. That's exactly right. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but yeah, but I just you know, I have always had a real fascination with sort of technology and innovation and  You know subscribe to wired from day one  Uh and and was sort of deep in in that world and um, and I went to to business school  To get a you know, one of those horrific mba things  with the intention of you know going to work in silicon valley and and working for an you know, innovative company a  startup and I I  Left business school and I went to one large company for a little while which was intel  And saw how that worked or didn't work  And then went to a startup  Uh in the 90s and saw how that didn't work  and decided I was having a lot more fun commenting and uh,  thinking through the issues rather than actually having to  To implement them at scale or dealing with venture capitalists and and all of that kind of fun stuff  and then you know now who spent 20 some odd years just uh  Talking about this stuff. It's really amazing people are texture is textured  Uh also depends on how you count as with so many of these things  Uh, but we're we're four full-time people and then we have some freelancers and contractors  So we're between four and eight depending on how you count

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And tech dirt is ad supported, but there's a patreon page as well. You sell  gear and so forth tech dirt  Dot com there's all sorts of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ways it's not called gear. It's called merch merch. Come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I'm not good at this as you know, i'm not good at this  um  Nice and he's even got a game a card game. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, go get the card game collected all that was that was uh, we we've been doing this is a bizarre thing that we've sort of  come across recently which is  We've been making games. We're actually working on this has not been released yet  But since it's relevant to the topic we've been working on a game  That will uh turn the players into a trust and safety team for a fictional  uh  social media network and and and force people to make these decisions and  And as I said, uh, then later regret whatever decision they make  So we had hoped to have that out a few months ago and then you know, the world kind of blew up  So there was a twitter string with mike and jeff kosseth and me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there was we should make 230 the broadway musical or something and I said uh the board game and mike said working on it  on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And maznik's on it. Yep. So we should have that but the the game that is on there is uh, it's actually the cia  Internally used board games for training and they perhaps stupidly admitted that at south by southwest  uh, and so uh, someone filed a foyer freedom of information act request

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so you're not joking when you say this this has been declassified. You're not joking a legitimate honest to goodness

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Declassified cia training game and they released it and and I know copyright law well enough to say if it's a product created  By the federal government. Yeah, it's it's in the public domain. We can take it. It was heavily redacted  The design was not great  So we had to update the design and fill in a lot of the blanks of of the secret stuff  The cia doesn't want us to know  uh, and and we turned into a game and we put it on kickstarter and it's it's actually  You know, I would say I will I will admit it is not the greatest game in the world  I think there are better games out there. The cia is perhaps not the best game development  But it is a fun game. It's the most accurate game in the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're looking for simulations of global  Global this is great. And here's your choice. Here's your chance to get it for 25 off. Oh god

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we that code may not we should have taken that down. I think that could end  Whoops July 1st now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're trying to get a discount who knew we would still be saying it's staying inside. Here we are. July 1st  Who'd have thunk it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What a great idea. I think that's hysterical. I love that. It's a fun game. I mean, I actually do still play it  I play with my kids. Is it like risk a little bit or I mean strategic? No, it's uh,  It's less strategic than it should be i'll tell you like when we started putting it together  We you know, we put up on kickstarter and we got all these backers and we said, you know  Hey, look we want to and we were working with like an actual game developer who's developed a whole bunch of board games  We said look we can make this game better and a little bit more like a a board game  You would really like and people like no we want the original  CIA version, you know, that's the one they had we wanted as true to that as possible  And so it's it's a training game  Like it's it's really designed to teach you about like all the different ways that the cia can spy on you  And and so it is it is educational but it is it is fun you're sort of it's a it's a there's there is strategy to it  You're basically trying to solve different world crises with different techniques to get information and at the same time you're trying to put  uh  You know hurdles in front of all of the other players  So there's there's legitimately a card called red tape like you can put red tape onto another player and slow them down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want red tape

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now is is red tape classified as political military economic or a weapon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I honestly don't remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's hysterical

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really fun yet depressing all at the same time at the same time precisely

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh mike maznik's here. So is aunt pruett jeff jarvis  Uh mike, you you know, you noticed we haven't mentioned google really yet  The show is called this week in google so we do we pay lip service to the title by doing something we call  The google changelog that's coming up  Next what's new at google but first a word from our sponsor. You may have noticed we're here in the last pass  Studios that's because we're big fans been using last pass. I have personally for more than a decade  Joe segress joined us  Actually went and talked to steve gibson of our security now show steve got to see all the source code helped joe helped him understand  Everything last pass was doing and steve gave it his absolute seal of approval  He started using it. Uh, and then we started using it in our business too because after all  You can have you know the best  Operational security in the world, but if your employees don't  They're the weakest link. So especially now as employees are going home and they've got the keys to the kingdom  They've got passwords to your bank accounts your databases your customer records everything  You need to keep that stuff safe and secure using last pass and business has really made a difference  Your it department has a big  job, I mean not only are  People going home, but you've got more appliances more devices more applications  New threats and new regulations strong security is not easy  Fortunately last pass is here to help your it department with strong security. That's easy to use  And easy to manage  Last pass lets you secure every entry point from shadow it to apps to mobile and cloud services their access solutions  Give you visibility and control over every access point to your organization and really that is what you're going for here  Of course, it starts with you with authentication  And that's really where last pass sings and it's more than just password management employees can access a variety of applications and devices  They can use single sign on  Of course passwords with auto fill they also do authentication better than anybody else  Not only they take advantage of the biometric authentication and modern smartphones, but they also do contextual authentication things like geolocation  And ip address and and last pass identity will give you a simple and integrated view across  All access and authentication tests so you know  Who's accessing what when and where and the best part about last pass the thing that's really kind of impressive to me  usually we think of the trade-off between security and  Convenience  Last pass can increase your security but will not impact productivity in fact employees our employees love last pass  They they use it because it makes it easier for them and auto fills passwords  The single sign on is so great. It's better than passwords and more convenient  They don't need to understand, you know, what's going on  From our it point of view all they know is it's easier to do what they need to get done  Even sharing passwords, which is tough now that we're all working at home last pass makes  Securely security effortless. Remember your passwords are entryways into your business  spreadsheets  Sticky notes or as one of our engineers did public websites with your passwords. Those are not secure  Last pass's password management secures it all so you don't have to of course strong encryption  Last pass works on every device you have  Vault is never decrypted anywhere, but on device your password is never transmitted to last pass  These are all the things you care about and last pass does it all right secure your business  Give your it department the tools to keep your business safe visit lastpass.com  twit to find out how they can help you and your business stay productive and secure no matter where  your employees are  And many of them are home as as as as ant is last pass.com slash twit. We thank them so much  For keeping the lights on here at the studios. We appreciate it. Thank you last pass last pass  Dot com slash twit somebody in the chat room rocky horror is saying we should rename twig to this week in leo's gang  This week in gang's  No  This and whatever but you know google kind of says it all right because it's you know, it's about the google verse  It's about the world that we're all living in. What do you think about the the facebook boycotts?  Certainly, it's something to pay attention to but i've seen many people say, you know  What facebook makes most of its money on the long tail of small advertisers? They don't care  You know the top 100 brands are only six percent of total facebook advertising  Mark's taking it seriously. He's meeting with the groups behind the boycott. They are you seem to be even changing  Um some of the things they do on facebook, but this ad boycott jeff this this isn't really something mark's worried about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it? Um, I think there's a larger brand damage  And you know the problem I have  And full disclosure as I raise money for my school from facebook  I receive nothing personally from any of the platforms end of disclosure  Um is that facebook is constantly trying to catch up with with moral questions and that's just not good  He's got to get it. I keep on saying, you know, they've got to have a north star  They've got to have a strong view of what they do and do not  Want on facebook and what it stands for why it exists  But instead it's just always somebody's after them and then they'll okay if I do this will you stop yelling at me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's more reaction. It's more reaction more than than anything else move fast to break things. It always has

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, that's their motto. Yeah. Yep. What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean  I think it's interesting. I think it will have some impact and I think that  That they at least realize that like it's it's it's really bad pr right now to have all these giant companies  Basically saying that we're pulling out  You know the the the point that I that struck me as interesting is that you know going back to the argument about section 230  one of the points that a lot of people a lot of critics raise about 230 is that because  The law, you know gives you know blanket immunity to the to the platforms for not moderating  That they have no incentive to moderate and I think that this is a really good example that that's not true that there are  Other ways to have incentive. Yeah, it's not just the law, you know, if users are getting upset, that's incentive  If your advertisers are getting upset that's incentive if the the media is turning against you as it very much has in facebook's case  That's incentive and so I think this is another example of like the nature of 230 which allows for  These changes to be made without having to go to a giant commission at the government and say like is this an okay best practice  uh is that it it allows for the platforms to change and  Experiment and so I think that this is a good example of ways that different parties can you know  Apply pressure to facebook whether or not this one works  The fact that these kinds of things are out there is is I think a good sign and so  It'll be interesting to see what happens. It'll be interesting to see how much facebook actually does change

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Follow-up question mike. What do you think of the specific demands of the group?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, you know, i'm i'm less impressed by them. I I feel that they're a little bit  That they don't necessarily take into account the reality of of the the difficult to impossible choices that facebook is trying to  Make in all these situations. So, you know, I think they're a little bit unrealistic  And I also think you know as a side note a bunch of the companies I think that have pulled ads were probably  uh struggling in general because of the the  Pandemic that we're living through and we're probably looking to decrease advertising and realize that this is a way to decrease advertising  But get good media attention. Well, and not only that but but you deliver

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh said they're pulling ads on both twitter and facebook to the end of the year  What they're really doing is they don't want to be near any controversy. They don't they hate being near news  They don't want to be near politics. This they just basically said until the election is over  We're not going to be near any human beings

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right and and we get good press coverage for it in the meantime, which sort of makes up for the loss of advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Perfect timing. Yeah. Yes, you can see that marketing guy coming in and say hey, it's win-win  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, um, but you know, it's it's interesting  I mean it's interesting to see how these changes go take take place and sort of you know  The the different campaigns and public pressure is actually a pretty effective tool  Uh, you know, even when I don't agree with the the overall aims  You know, it's fascinating to see it in practice  the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  NAACP the anti-defamation league  Color of change have all  Arranged to meet with sarah shale sandberg and chris cox the returned by the way. Wow the returned product officer  At facebook chris cox. Yeah, he left like in a huff a year ago now  You know, I like it here after all never mind  And they want zuckerberg to be there  Facebook says  Yep, mark's gonna join. So he's gonna meet with them  I think that's the least he can do is is at least listen to their concerns  What are their concerns in person or or?  I'm virtual. I'm sure it's virtual  What I hope it's virtual. Yeah, I mean  They're not gonna all get together in a room. No  No, uh, so  What do they want what what what would well, I mean, I know what they're saying but but what would they really like facebook to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To I don't think they know  Well, I think you know  This is this is the this is the issue with like all of these questions around trust and safety and content moderation  they want  Uh less of the bad stuff and more of the good stuff  Whatever. Yeah, if you ask them to define those things it's a well, you should know it when you see it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bad stuff and good stuff. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so the adl is probably the clearest the adl says get rid of hate  Okay, the adl has a definition of hate  Utilizer doesn't have an addition a definition of hate, right?  And when when that which is defined as hate turns out to be the president of the united states and his party  Well, that's getting as mike was saying that's gets to be pretty uncomfortable

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who would have thought I would have a headline here that says?  twitch bans the president of the united states temporarily  That's like  The world turned upside down  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know and and I think the president was probably celebrating that moment too just just for a few minutes proves his point  You know what? I made another headline. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, yeah, and that was the first thing everybody's asked me is what's what's president trump doing on twitch?  What is he playing a game? What is it? Maybe he's playing that cia game. I don't know, but no, I think  I think that uh, yeah, pewdiepie. I think honestly, uh  And this is hard to say I think it's it's kind of shameful. I mean the president of the united states  needs a  Has I think has the right to reach out to the american people  It's just like I think it's shameful when the networks refuse  Any president uh time to speak but it's these days that was in my day  That's the old days when the president said i'm gonna get nbc cbs and abc on the phone. I have something to say tonight  Uh, it's the same thing only it's now a much broader  Doesn't doesn't the president have a right to that bully pulpit. That's that's part of the job. That's why we elect him

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes sense if it's someone that we the people  Elected, you know, they know it is  You know, it should have this platform. Yeah, whether we agree to move on right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, it's their right to I understand. It's their right to yeah, certainly right the president has a right to speak

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that doesn't mean that a private company has to understand to carry their speech, right? I mean  You know there  There are appropriate things for for different platforms or different vehicles to carry in the same way that you wouldn't expect like  you know  espn to to to carry the president's speech because it's not the right audience or nickelodeon or whatever  You know if they decide that it's not right or not appropriate for their vehicle  Then they they should you know, that's freedom of association as well  And it's it's not like you know  If the president wants to say something it's not like he doesn't have ways to get that message out  Even if the various internet platforms say not through us

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I I do and I understand that i'm not saying there should be is there ought to be a law there clearly is a law  It's called the first amendment. You don't have to yeah, but uh devils advocate, but well, i'm not even playing devil's advocate  I do feel like um  If this is part of the pain, you know  All of this there's all these different levers that different groups are pulling to create pain for these  social uh platforms  to push them in a direction that  people want  but I think ultimately  It bothers me if the elected leader of our country  Is not allowed to use these platforms to speak

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What if the elected leader of your country what if the elected leader of your country is bolsonaro?  Right. I'm sorry. Mr. Goodwin, please godwin, please but bolsonaro was elected, right? I mean  Yeah, but well or or or i'm sorry i'm gonna go there if it's hitler, right?  Hitler was not hitler was not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, he was not fully elected. So that's all right. Well, he was the he was the legal head

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he was the legal head made himself more. Sorry. Sorry godwin. Please give me a break

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think mike is mike has suspended godwin's law for the last I think so. I think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So no there is there has to be a limit leo. There has to be a limit where you say we're not going to  um, but yeah, I argued that facebook should leave it up but should say  Should model the behavior of disapproving of the essence of it and say this is here. Here's why it's here  But by it being here, we are not endorsing this I you know, and by the way as

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think everybody knows i'm no friend of the president but  And I understand that twitch should not let  Richard spencer or david duke have a stream but uh by the virtue of his office he is in a different category

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure, and and I think that's true and I think that's it's actually why what twitter did, you know  A month ago was so interesting after going back and forth where a lot of people were asking them to take down that that account  They decided to to just add more content to it and and put more context to it and saying things like  This this does violate our policy  And and facebook last week announced that they're going to start doing the same thing after originally saying that they wouldn't do that  That's right. They're they're now saying that they'll do it and to me that is that is a pro free speech  It's adding more speech right and not removing it and recognizing that the president by the nature of being the president  You know is in a unique position and therefore has unique rules and some people get upset about that and saying well, you know  Everybody should be treated exactly the same but but the president is not the same as everybody else

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  What else  Jeff what what what's next? What are we talking? Oh, oh, we haven't even talked about anything in  You know, i'll tell you one thing. I really loving so apple changed how ios 14 works with privacy in a very aggressive way  Um, you know, they're they're they're surfacing all sorts of stuff like the apple id for advertising  Which you can now like when you first install an app say yeah, don't do that, which advertisers are terrified about  They also are showing all sorts of privacy violations tick tock the first a bit  But now that there's 56 different apps that spy on your clipboard  Even when you're not running the app and apple's new notifications are letting people know about that  Um  Apple's turning out to be I think it's kind of interesting just by a slight change to ios, which is widely used of course in the us  They turn out to be narking on a lot of these  Uh things and I have to say at this point  I would not be using tick tock anymore. The country of india has banned. Yeah  Tick tock and 59 other apps. Well, that's for another reason. Well, they're quote chinese apps  Uh, and that's because of border tensions  Share it the uc browser and tick tock. Yeah, it's not because of privacy violations, although they claim  It's because they're worried that those apps  Uh were engaged in activities that were prejudicial to the sovereignty integrity and defense of india  Uh, they can apparently do this  This is you know, we forget that the first amendment is a unique and wonderful piece of uh,  The american constitution but not widespread  Um anything to say about that either one of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would not use tick tock pretty bad tick tock looked pretty damn bad. What did what what did you guys think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean  it's it is  These things get more and more complicated. I'm i'm not going to defend tick tock because I think yeah  I agree that that it seems that they  rushed into a lot of this  Without much thought and then there's a new excuse though. This is the zoom excuse

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, we're just trying to make a nice product here. We didn't really expect anybody to  bother to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is the same theory of move fast and break stuff. Yeah, it's the same theory. Maybe it is that I mean it's you can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Impute intention. Sure, but it's also I mean  it's also the nature of innovation right and like sort of how how it works and this idea of like  You know the minimum viable product and and you know getting stuff out there quick and iterating  And that is how a lot of innovation happens  And so like I can see both sides of it and I can completely understand the argument that like this looks really bad  And they should do better and I agree with that  But I also the one sort of hesitation the one point where I step back a little bit as I say  Do we even get these innovations in the first place if you say you have to have it perfect the first time out?  And I think we would probably end up losing a lot of the innovations that eventually do come out of this process  And it's a very messy process and there are obvious problems with it  And that's that is what we're talking about  And I don't mean to diminish that and I don't mean to excuse like all the horrible things that that is  Within the tik tok app or even the mistakes that I think zoom has made and and is now rushing to try and fix  But you know, I think watching how these companies respond to this information as it comes out is the most important thing and like  You know zoom has actually been a really interesting case study in that they seem to be one of the rare cases where they're  They appear to be taking all of these issues very seriously, you know  I've brought on really good people and have been very transparent about all the changes that they're making we'll see about tik tok

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um, but hasn't zoom been talking out of both sides of his mouth with  Well, we're going to encrypt everything is going to be encrypted and we can't see it  But yet we still have the keys already still talking that story

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They they've been changing that you know as as they've gotten more and more pushback on on the setup of how they were doing it  um, they they've been changing but again like  The the theme of all of all this is that every one of the choices that they make has trade-offs, right?  And understanding which of which of the bad decisions you have to make  Yeah, it is really difficult and it's really you know  It's it's fun to criticize them because I do that all the time  But recognizing like being in their shoes like I don't know exactly which decision I would make either right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can see you smiling right now as you talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I say that all the time as jeff knows and ant knows about facebook and google and twitter as well  You know, these are tough decisions  It's interesting that apple for whatever reasons of its own has decided to come step forward and become the defender  They just turned down a bunch of uh web uis proposed by the w3c  Because they would enable fingerprinting on safari and they said, you know, we're not going to implement  There's no reason an app need, you know a web app needs  Uh access to the accelerometer or the gps coordinates except that there is if you want to make  Your web browser be, you know support application like behavior on the internet which many people do  There's a good reason for those uis and so I don't think the w3c is proposing them out of some sort of  secret cabal with advertisers  But I think it's also interesting that apple said yeah, we don't think so  Because they could be used to fingerprint you. I mean things like exactly how much ram you have  Why does a browser need to be able to report that? I just I and so you you nailed it mike  There are reasons people do this not necessarily nefarious  But I would also submit there's really reasons to say no. Yeah, I don't run facebook. I don't run instagram  I don't put tiktok on my phone anymore because  Basically, I think most apps these days are really a wrapper around data collection tools. Yes  Yeah, most what can we do to make it sexy so that you'll install it so that we can find out everything you're doing and sell it  That's yes, that's the business we're in right now. So yeah, you know, I I there's also the the level where you'll see those little reports to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, send this crash report or something like that for like adobe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's some privacy implications there too generally my friends on macbreak weekly yell at me because when you install  apps  on apple's  Devices, there's often there's always a checkbox. Do you want to send data back to the app developer?  And I always say yeah, because I want to help them be have make a better app, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they say because that's you have that that that mindset of a developer. I mean you are the linux guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would like to know that you know, I want to know when you're opening it and why and how long you spent  But they say no leo. That's you're just enabling tiktok to collect all that information

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're giving them all the jewels that they're trying to mine. Yeah. Yeah, so I I choose to say yes and then not install

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apps and then I guess the in apps I install i'm tacitly saying go ahead collect what you need

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Relax it's okay leo. Okay, it's gonna be all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Face recognition software finally as mike masnick puts it actually tim cushing puts it on tector gets around to arresting an innocent person  This is a pretty horrific story  Uh that comes out of detroit detroit police department  Got a grainy grainy picture  Uh from a cctv camera  Uh the worst the yeah, uh the worst and it was a low res screen grab to boot  Uh of a robbery occurring and they fed it through who knows might have been clear view ai whatever they were using for face recognition  And uh came up with this guy. I'm not gonna say his name support guys had enough trouble  Uh, he got a call from police police department saying come on in you're gonna be arrested  He says at first I thought I was a prank and ignored it an hour later  When he pulled into his driveway in farmington hills a police car pulled up behind him blocked him two officers got out  Handcuffed him in front of his wife and two young daughters  They wouldn't say why is being arrested just showed him a piece of paper with his photo and the words felony warrant and larceny  This is the worst part when his wife said where are you taking my husband? The officer says google it  Like I don't I don't even know what that's supposed to mean  Google it what the hell you're talking about. Where are you taking him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, so the show is finally about google. Yeah, finally. See I got the word google in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had to work on it, but I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So an hour and 40 minutes in we got it. We got the word in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so unfortunately, um  Oh by the way, the police said well, wait a minute  We didn't just use the face recognition  We showed uh him his driver's license photo to the lost prevention person at the store  And she supposedly identified him  in any event they eventually had to  Let him go  And apologize, but the poor guy went through hell  Um including being held in jail for several hours before being released in a thousand dollar bond  Well, what 18 hours and 18 hours?  Yeah, eight 18 hours. Yeah, it's good thing. He had a thousand bucks. He was in there for 18 18 hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In a holding cell. He's now he's now suing good. So the aclu took up his case  And they're they're suing over that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way had they bothered to ask or investigate  He he had an alibi. He couldn't have done it. He had posted a video to his instagram account  At that time on his way home from work. See you see

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Social media is good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I got google in and you got that in so well done jeff we've

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fulfilled our missions we can go home happy. I do not mean to make light of this terrible story

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's terrible and this is why everybody uh, and I think eventually this is going to happen including congress now is talking for  Putting a face recognition on hold. Of course, he's black. I should have mentioned  That the poor guy is black and that's why he was recognized  Uh, you know, I don't give a damn if it was a white guy  It was still terrible, but but but the false positives in face recognition are so high  Yeah  Probably put any black guy in front of that face recognition and say oh, yeah, he did it. He looks guilty  Oh lord, it's flat out wrong. Yeah one. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead. Sorry. Go ahead. No, no, you I don't know the law or anything like far as all of the extensive of  warrants and whatnot, but  It seemed a little bizarre that they walked up and just immediately slap the handcuffs on and I thought they at least had to tell them  You know what's going on and start going through the miranda right stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is the other problem right in policing in general, but with his face recognition  They can the police consider that  Ample evidence this guy did it  Okay, so they treated him as a perp right? They didn't treat him as a suspect or let's investigate no  No, the the computer said he did it  Okay, that was sufficient to them. In fact the contractors that supplied the ai system  Even said  Maybe this is you know  Retroactively a match using facial recognition alone is not a means for positive identification. Well, what do you make the stuff for?  All right. So anyway, let's hope this is this was going to happen. Fortunately nobody was  injured  But it's you know, shameful and it just proves why this has got to stop and I think give me facial recognition to make  Autofocus even better. There you go. That's all I need put it in the camera. That's what I want. Yeah, that's all I need. Yeah  We could actually go on there's more  According to business insider leaked documents show how police use social media and private slack channels to track protesters  george floyd floyd protesters  But I you know, it's too depressing. There's a large rise

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this is this is an example. This is an example of of kind of what mike was saying earlier  I'm stretching it mike, but what the hell?  is  that  When possible you blame the technology whereas what the last few weeks have shown us is there's a systemic issue in police  In the institution of policing in the united states and the fact that they misuse technology is only one of a myriad of problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go. Yeah, and i'll connect it to another story just for fun  Which is the the the discussion on encryption?  And you have all these police who are keep keep saying we have to have backdoors to encryption  We have to break encryption because we can't find out any information anymore. And yet in both of these stories  What did we see? We saw police who if they use technology properly could have actually gotten useful information from from social media  All these sources social media or or whatever, you know  But you know, I had a story not too long ago that that sort of touched on this with these examples of like  The fbi tracked down somebody who had had lit a fire and lit a police car on fire by  You know, I forget the exact details  It was this crazy string of of things where they there was a woman who was wearing a shirt that had a saying on it  And they tracked that shirt to etsy and they found a review that matched her name and they found her linkedin profile  Police work. Yeah, and it was like actual detective work. Manics, baby  But but in that same story, there was also examples of the fbi, you know arresting people based on social media posts where they were  Sarcastic, right, you know satirical posts rather than any actual criminal behavior  And so you have all of these things where you know law enforcement really they have all these new tools  but they haven't figured out how to use them and you know, they sort of  Jump into the sort of lazy explanations where if we think this is a crime, it's a crime  And that creates all sorts of problems and so, you know  There's there's a real issue here where if we're going to have law enforcement doing this before we say let's break encryption  You know, let's figure out if there's a way that they can actually use the technology that they have in front of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have the best high def picture ever of everything that's going on. Come on. Give me a break  They just don't like these little one or two blank pixels. They want to see the whole thing. They want to be perfect  No blank pixels  Somebody the chat room says they're barnaby jonesing it they're doing it man. They're  Today's the day the  California consumer privacy protection act goes into effect

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're in charge of the world now, California. It's us baby. Forget gdpr. We got the ccpa

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what's going to happen. Although I do see a lot of companies now putting just ccpa disclaimers and trying to  Trying to y a yeah at least cya  It gives internet users in California. Hence the world the right to request businesses not to sell  Or even and even delete their personal information kind of like GDPR  But there's still questions according to ad week  Of course ad week would be all over this about what counts as selling information in which party manages opt out  The ccpa defines a sale is selling renting releasing disclosing disseminating making available transferring or otherwise  Communicating orally and writing or by electronic or other means a consumer's personal information  By the business to another business or a third party for monetary or other  valuable  consideration  It's a very interesting definition of selling. Yeah, well you could put away the source and just yeah, right by the way  For money doesn't have to be for money valuable consideration could be mutual benefit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was ad week assuming that there's a third party managing all of this and this isn't just a government managing all of these these  Checks and balances coming in for people to want to opt out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an interesting question now, I think that  At least with GDPR. It's up to it's up to us for instance to enforce. Yeah, it's the companies that have to enforce it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The  The the California Attorney General can go after companies that don't do it  And then there's you know, there are other aspects to to it  It's it's it's going to be a mess just as GDPR was a mess  And if you look at kind of the results of GDPR in a lot of cases  It's really just given more power to the big companies that can that can deal with it and created all sorts of problems for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For the smaller guys really true. That's that's unfortunately really true. Although I welcome these protections

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we need them. I think having protections is good. I mean the CCPA  What bothers me is that it was it was a very rushed job and it's why like, you know  Part of it went into force six months ago without the actual regulations  It's the new regulations that went into force today  But because it just wasn't ready because they just kind of rushed the whole thing and and privacy  You know  if the stuff we were talking about before is complex and crazy and has all different trade-offs privacy is a is  You know at an entirely different level of trade-offs and complexity  and and  You know, that's not the kind of thing that you should rush a law through and so well  I am supportive of the idea of better protecting privacy in so many different ways  And I think the companies are terrible at it, but I do not think that this is the proper vehicle for doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there will be an extension to it because  As Mike knows here in California, we have we've decided that assembly doesn't want to do any work  So they've decided to let the voters vote. There will be a ballot initiative in November called the California  Privacy Rights Act which would expand  the definitions of the CCPA  Make it even more dramatic  For instance a business of the any entity that buys sells or shares the personal information of  100,000 or more consumers or households  So the previous threshold fifty thousand  By increasing that number the idea is protect small businesses, so that's good  And under CCPA cut consumers have the right to know what pieces of information a company has  Collected over a 12 month period the ballot initiative would extend that period to any time so long as it takes proportionate effort  Whatever the hell that means

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They would also you know the problem here is the same as before is that there this this this  This this this  Saying selling your data is not defined right data is a transactional among parties and who owns it what it is  It's the same as saying get rid of hate. It's tough. What's hate? Yes  And they're leaving it just drives me nuts

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well and to answer your question and the the ballot initiative does in fact propose creating a  an agency to enforce the California Privacy Protection Agency and  Yeah, it's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some of the stuff with the ballot initiative is a little bit sketchy too because the whole reason we had the CCPA in the  First place is because the same guy got a ballot initiative in California on the ballot that was even worse initially and the CCPA  Right, that's right  Yeah, right  We will we will pass this you know hastily written law that is not as crazy as your ballot initiative if you drop the ballot initiative  And so he dropped the ballot initiative that passed the CPA  CCPA put it into effect and six months later. He's back with another ballot initiative and you're like wait  I thought we had a deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Realizes from that same guy. Oh, that's it same guy  So aunt who has just moved to California you're gonna get used to this  We tend to have very big ballots with lots of initiatives because it's fairly easy to put an initiative on the ballot  Yeah, and a lot of them are kooky as hell the most famous one prop 65  Which was the one that mandated that anybody any place that has cancerous chemicals and it has to notify  Which has had the kind of unintended end result that there's a sign on everything  With a prop 65 warning that if you notice that right everywhere you go. Oh, yeah, this you can get cancer here  Oh, you sure you can't see that box of cause you cancer, but they but they and intended consequences  So we get we get a lot of those in our initiative

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've seen some of that type of stuff on the ballots back in Carolina too. So I'm not surprised

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure it's you know, it's legislators who don't want to get be on the hook for making any any real laws

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's the same thing why we now have to click through on every web page saying like, okay privacy this cookies that cookie  Right because nobody's paying attention to anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same thing meaningless same thing most of those by the way don't have a I don't want you to do that  It just say I agree would you leave me alone? I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, my favorite are the ones that say I agree or they just have an X to close it  I'm like so if I could I disagree what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happens if I just close it? Is that an acknowledgement? Is that a decline or ask? Yeah, ask Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've done that in some of their pop-ups before  Hey scoop from Kara Swisher. She's just tweeted you can officially call it tech a palooza  Representive David Cicilline has told me in an interview today the four CEOs of the most powerful tech companies in the world Apple  Facebook Google and Amazon  Cook Zuckerberg  Pachai and Bezos have agreed to appear at a late July hearing on antitrust. That's a big big

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  by popcorn futures that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stream will stream that live we ought to stream that one  It's I can where can I I mean that should be  C-SPAN yeah, it's like NASA, right? It's we paid. Yeah, cuz the Washington Post, you know, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Runs that stuff too. Although you probably know this Mike

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we we like to stream the space launches of a stream NASA TV and so that's time  We stream the the Dragon Crew launched National Geographic took down everything. Yes, I wrote about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody got we own space. That's ours

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just a switch again happens every time again and and this is I really like your point of view you cannot impute  Malice when just simple stupidity or or even just mistakes apply and in this case  There's just a checkbox National Geographic either did or didn't check that said, you know  We own this and and the the real error is YouTube's content ID system  Which is so automated and so fast that there's and really the appeal process takes forever. It's crazy. Hey good news  the Supreme Court agrees an  Eight to one decision ladies and gentlemen, I gotta see sue they see who the dissenter was  On this one booking.com had tried to register its name with the PTO  The Patent Office rejected the filing saying that's generic you can't you can't trademark booking  You can't trademark that booking said well, no, wait a minute  So Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the majority said the public perception of a name is the core issue if booking.com were generic  We might expect consumers to understand Travelocity to be a booking.com, but they don't they know better  Who was the dissent I doesn't say gosh darn it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this this actually involves my old career when I worked for advance  We had for example, New Jersey online, which we called NJ. Oh, but the URL was nj.com  Everybody was confused as hell. So we finally went with  Nj.com as the brand and the URL but knowing that we would not get a trademark or we'd have problems with the trademark  Claims because it was generic now and J.com al.com for Alabama  Nola dot com no longer theirs. That's right. Yeah, they they they're the well  It's not AJC is a is not a generic, right? It stands for something. Whereas NJ is very Jersey  Yeah, it's the Jersey. Yeah, so you could we couldn't claim ownership of New Jersey  But we met they now can claim ownership of NJ dot-com

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds kind of retroactive though like you have to establish that everybody knows what booking.com is and then you can say oh, yeah  That's our trademark. It's like you can't I mean, how would you defend it if it didn't exist and you say I know I want it  It's a Stephen Breyer was the dissenting justice, but I don't think he wrote it. He just said I don't like it  So anyway that you know  Among meaningless Supreme Court rulings that that probably is right up there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But so I know you discussed it on your 83 other shows boss non-stop. I'm sure what but I'm curious  Apple micro no  Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft closing its doors. Well, it's tied into the Apple thing. Yeah, they were losing money there  They just there was a big red blot on there. I always felt sorry for the staff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm almost as cool as an apple guy. Yeah, I mean they were always empty

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you ever go buy one first of all that made my daughter's computer?  They made a big mistake because they look like Apple stores and they're near Apple stores  So the comparison is vivid as you walk by one. It looks like a party, you know people are laughing  Correctly doing marimba conga line is and then the next door it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hear the crickets  this  Paul Thurman said the the squeaky sign on the hinge

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, they weren't very successful  They're closing him. I made it more than it is which was kind of the writing on your wall  Yeah, that's my job is to blow things out of proportion is the writing on the wall for the post PC era  That at Microsoft just you know, Microsoft knows its business is not computers or selling computers or even windows  Its business is the cloud and in fact, it's a great business. They've they were smart  They they they moved their whole business to something that everybody's gonna be coming to  And they were smart and so the stores have no real that's all in the Della. That's all in the Della. That's such an adult. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So were they as smart? Okay, it's a question then  Who did a better pivot?  Microsoft or Netflix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And  I would like to say Netflix had already had that in the cards anyway from the get-go. Well, do you remember though how much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Approbrium that Reed Hastings got when he said we're gonna split into two businesses the DVD business  Yeah, and the and the quickster business quickster. Yeah  And people thought  Nuts you're what are you doing you insane person you and of course he was exactly right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think you know, I think the Netflix  Disruption and change was a more linear one like you can see the easy. Yes  The train was the Microsoft change that's you know, that's a completely different business  and it involved like a very different set of skills and outlook and  Structure to the business in fact and it very much is, you know  Nadella's ability to come in and completely move that company in a very very different direction is really really impressive when you think about it  Whereas, you know the Netflix I think everybody kind of understood like that's where Netflix has to go  But that was not nearly as obvious with Microsoft. So I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Netflix actually made two pivots at both of them  You know the economic exigencies required but the pivot from streaming other people's content to making their own was sure arguably much more  significant and and properly executed they became the dominant content creator and  Very well, that's true. Yeah, so I would say I'm not sure which one you were talking about and I  I would say the pivot the second pivot might have been more important not more prescient because they knew they were losing movies  All of movie companies were saying you can't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just saying that it seems like Netflix had already had that in the cards before we even conceived it as consumers, right?  The hand was saying you know what?  We're getting our butts kicked on this particular side of things at the market and we're getting our butts kicked over here  But on the enterprise side of things, hmm, we seem to keep doing our thing and doing okay  So let's just go ahead and move  Cloudwires with the Azure and all that good stuff and I think that's most impressive there. Well, here's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  interesting thing that I brought up after drinking the apple Kool-Aid and  Basking in the reality distortion field and enjoying the excitement of Apple silicon. It kind of came to me  Apple's making this change also in a post PC world and  Apple's doubling down on computers  Fortunately, they have mobile and they're doing very well in mobile which Microsoft does not so Microsoft didn't have that and I don't know  If that's an advantage to Apple or a disadvantage  It's keeping them in the hardware game when it may in fact be that the future of computing is cloud-based  And all you need is some sort of thin  Client to access it and won't really matter. Well, what does Apple have to offer in that world?  You know what? I realized there is a platform for Apple as a fashion  Accessory because Paul Throt said this when you okay, so you're gonna need something you're thin client  Apple can make the best looking  clients with the best battery life and the coolest and the thinnest and in a way  They already are doing that. So there is a path forward to them. They'll be this yeah, but then client company  It's not as much money. Yeah, Microsoft's gonna make who's I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do I do think they have they have a challenge in the services side of things and I think Apple Apple's realized that  And you know the most interesting thing that I've heard people say it's like why doesn't Apple buy box or  Drop box or something like that and build a services business on top of that, you know, they have iCloud  But that is you know, not quite the same thing right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, as you know, that's historically really hard to do you have this big? Yes your clash  You don't take a scourge that is terrible at services and is terrible at cloud and just buy a cloud company and say see we fixed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because that's you know  Yeah, and that was a synergy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not I mean they bought I've certainly bought companies, but they don't have not done done the really big massive  Purchases and and and figuring out ways to move those in-house and that is yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A an arena that is very very difficult to get right and Apple knows that actually Apple has said that specifically  We don't want to have to do all of that culture adjustment so that we can acquire a big company  I mean and you could look at all the wreckage of you know, what was it compact?  You know, I mean you listen on a guy, you know, yeah HP compact or  Warner Brothers AOL and or you know time warning. Oh, well, there's been a lot of those bad  Acquisitions. So anyway, it's interesting to think of the Microsoft Store somehow tying into the Apple  Silicon story two different takes on what the future of computing will look like perhaps that's my  If I were Mike Masnick or somebody with his brain side right? I'd write a think piece on that but I'm not I know  The other day I started writing a blog just because I thought you know  I really probably should organize whatever this mush is up here and  Because I realized that my job really is just to have a thought speak it and it goes and it's gone  And I don't have to be held accountable or anything for the age. It's great. I love it  And so I thought I should start writing a little bit because that forces a discipline  But then I look at people like you Mike or Ben Thompson and I go I don't I don't even know how to start thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thinking that hard deep stuff. That's why I don't write. Yeah, it's hard. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Need a thesis what I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have no thesis. I am thesis free. Let's do play the drums the Google changelog  This is where we pay lip service to being called this week in Google  Google Sheets will soon be able to auto complete data for you. Google's can become the auto complete company

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So one thing they really do. Yeah, it really really really amused me. Yeah, like oh, you actually should be making profit this quarter

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're gonna just put that in. Yeah, so the risk of this is it becomes Microsoft Clippy. I see you're trying  I see you're trying to make profit. Can I help?  That

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would be an interesting lawsuit on the 230 front

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, really who's liable for that if you  My balance sheet they call it. It's kind of it's kind of smart fill. It's kind of like smart compose  Gmail finish your sentences for you. I don't know  Google explains say you have a column full of names, but you want to split it into two columns  By the way, I do this all the time as you start typing the first names into a column like in other words  You start doing this manually  Sheets will say oh I get it. You're trying to idiot you moron  It'll just fill it in for you. Look at that formula suggestion. I guess that'll be useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's perfect for someone like me that that hates spreadsheets and yeah  I've never been a spreadsheet person only if I'm doing like a  Massive data load into the database. That's that was it and that's only because it's a flat file

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right for years. I've spent hours like trying to figure out stupid things like this  I get the city and state in separate fields in the zip  How do I and it's just a pain in the butt but you know now Google do it for you  By the way smart complete is also coming to Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Messages or smart compose I guess so as you just said it is the I'll complete that for you  You don't even have to think now. You don't even have to say it. Maybe it'll write my blog posts for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I want I need a Leo complete  Holy cow. Did you hear that? Yeah

Yeah and restrict who can present  Do you use meet in for your classrooms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, we're using zoom we started with with me but  Google got hit by such surprise the quality the video quality was terrible. It really was terrible. Yeah  They they just got zapped

I can actually aim it at that one  Google is now rolling out their version of airdrop. It's called nearby sharing  They bet they've been way behind on this one. Of course  It's fitting because Apple's stolen everything from Android for this new version  I feel like this is a Vincent Vincent price

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's you know, it's it's a regular normal sort of podcast  You know, it's basically I'm usually just trying to interview somebody who is doing interesting work  you know in and around the kind of stuff that we talk about and  It's usually sort of you know, 35 to 45 minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't show off now. That's

We all are we all are  they're gonna  It was a experiment in the shopping tag, they're gonna tab they're gonna expand it as ever  advertisers step away from the ad by  Moving on I don't have anything to say about that  Finally, I should have mentioned this last week. I knew about it and I forgot  Google is finally letting you use a fine number and a voice number on the same account  This was I've been a Google you had big complaints about that. Yeah  I had to give up my Google voice account when I got Google PHY if I wanted to use the same number  Now you'll be able to forward voice calls to PHY. You're gonna get some of that functionality back, which is weird  Because for the longest time we thought they were killing Google voice  But you know Google, you know that you know how that is Google is a funny thing you spend so much time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trying to ride things out with Google thinking you're gonna fix this or improve that but yet  There's the other side of the corn where you know, oh, they're gonna kill this thing any day now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there's no no rhyme no reason as an original Google voice user from the very very beginning  I have been dreading dreading the the possibility that they might kill it. It's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Me too. Yep, but see that's the sad thing cuz I when I got PHY I kept the number cuz well  That's the number I use but then I lost all functionality and voice and it was kind of frustrating  So I give future generations will not have to suffer my pain and isn't that all about all your complaint  Google is not gonna reopen its offices next week. They're pushing it back till September  Smart I  Think I've been counting the seconds Jeff for you since you don't know how it's moving away. I just want to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually know they were having a bad core coming right over. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you looking at dark sky you're looking at the I'm now looking at AccuWeather nice  It's so we reviewed some time ago. Did you ever try the Focals and I know Anthony loved them  These were heads up smart glasses  They had a little as you see you can see on these they had a little projector  And you would put your notifications heads up unlike Google Glass you actually could continue to look at things and do things  They were preparing Focals to we knew all about it. We were very excited. Anthony's very excited  No, not gonna happen cuz Google just bought them  They started his Thalmic labs in 22 and they're now at 2012 they're now called North and  We don't know how much Google paid  Rick Osterloh says he cites North's strong technology foundation  So Google may not have given up on glass. This is actually a better glass the Focals  I'm not doing it again

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right after I started at twit that's  About the time when mr. Nielsen's review. Yeah on hands-on tech  I saw those things for like five seconds. If that didn't really get to spend time with them though. Yeah, I didn't either
