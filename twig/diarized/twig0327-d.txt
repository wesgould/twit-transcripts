When you have smart panelists like Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York talking about this stuff,  you just let it go. You pull the string and let it go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have no control. You have no hope. You have no sense. There is no order in the universe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I celebrate it. I want it to go off the rails. That's what I look forward to every week.  That's what we specialize in.  Also joining us, an excellent engineer when it's coming to driving off the track, Mr. Kevin Marks.  KevinMarks.com.  I'll just be the conductor in the back going, what the hell? Where are we going?  Welcome. Good to see you both.  We had a great pre-show conversation about books and health and all sorts of stuff.  But let's talk right away about Google.  We got Google News.  Google Plus. They changed the plus on us.  Actually, I don't think any of us have the new one.  I have it at my desktop. I got it on my desktop.  I don't know how you get it.  They said in the blog post, when you sign into Google Plus, you will get an opt-in announcement.  I think I ought to sign out then. Let me try that.  Should I sign out and sign in?  Try it.  Let me show you the workaround that Lisa found, which is the strangest thing in the world.  She needs to be a little busier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the old Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll know because if you have the old plus, you'll still have the button, the drop-down button that says home with a little house on it.  That's going to be replaced in the new Google Plus with a hamburger menu.  Go to settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just logged in on it and it showed me the new Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Log out, log in.  I didn't get that.  Manage Google Plus activity.  Click in the search menu and all of a sudden, boom, you get the new Google Plus.  But it's a temporary change.  I clicked it and said, let's go.  All right.  So let me log out and log in again.  That would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you just sign out?  Is that all you did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just looked at the page and then the dialogue popped up.  I've been trying that over and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I've got to wait as long for this as I've had, I'm still waiting for Marsh friggin Mellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Marsh friggin Mellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does it all have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was like end of October.  Marsh friggin Mellow.  You're talking about your Nexus 6, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, I've got my old Nexus 6 or my Nexus 7 too.  I have the new 6P, so I've got it on that.  I don't have Marsh Mellow on my other devices.  It's killing me anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, as you now know, it's not worth worrying about.  It's not that big of a difference.  Now on tap is a cool idea.  Now see that whatever that is did not work for me.  I still have the old.  I logged out and logged back in again.  I'm still old Google Plusing.  But boy, you'd think that...  Here, I've got mine.  It was the second coming of Adolf Hitler or something.  Like they have ruined...  What have they done to my Google, Ma?  All right, so here it is.  That's what it looks like.  All right, go back and forth between mine and yours just real quickly so you can see.  Old Google.  New Google.  New Google has a big red bar across the top.  Material design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's material.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  New Google.  And also they've done a huge amount of work on making the website fast and responsive.  That was the other big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in fact, huge amounts of...  I mean, the size of the pages has gone down dramatically.  So good.  So rewritten from scratch, right?  Lots of animations.  What do people not like about the new Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't see that much of a change.  There's more emphasis on collections and communities.  Okay.  The posts look the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I just put the link to the image I got in the chat.  Okay.  The IRC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  So this is... you got the sign in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so basically when I went to Plus...  Yeah, that's what I want.  I got that little thing that says...  Meet the new Google Plus.  And now I've got the shiny version.  Yeah.  But yeah, there was a post about how they redeveloped it, which I should be able to find  on Google Plus, shouldn't I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a Plus post, as a matter of fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But basically they said they've rethought the way they did it and built it from scratch.  And this version's actually been on the mobile web for a while.  They said if you go on your mobile device, you'll get this new updated version.  But they've just rolled it out to the desktop as well.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought they said that it will be out soon on iOS and Android.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's on the web.  They haven't changed the apps yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're saying if I go to plus.google.com in Chrome on my mobile, I will get a mobile...  Actually, I'm going to try in Firefox.  Let me just see.  That's interesting.  Okay.  So plus.google.com.  There's your shot.  Yeah.  I've been using Firefox on Android because the mobile Firefox supports all the plugins  and desktop Firefox supports.  Yes.  Okay.  I think that's true.  That is the new Google+.  The app or just the web on?  Not the app.  The web on.  I don't have to log in though, which is kind of a pain in the behind.  So it's architected to be more lightweight.  And that would make sense.  That's why the mobile version of it has been using this for a while.  What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you hand this to Leo?  That's the new app.  No, I'm doing it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, did you get the new app too?  I got the new app.  Yes, I have the new app.  Oh.  Well, maybe I'll have that too.  I'm also...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I had to, you know...  Are you satelliteed?  Yes, I'm satelliteed.  Android Police has their APK.  Whatever.  They've pissed the APK on their posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lauren Weinstein is complaining about grade type for older eyes.  But other than that, I don't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I got the oldest eyes there are and it doesn't bother me.  Yeah, you want to keep the...  You do want to keep the contrast type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The screen's about to go.  I'll need to do my fingerprint.  There you go.  Okay, so that's the new app.  The main difference is, at least in the Android app, is that bottom row, which I do not like at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Home, elections, communities, notifications.  I just don't like that.  Otherwise, though, the presentation is very similar.  I heard some people complaining about the way the comments, but the comments have always rolled through.  Oh, yeah, they've always done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I just checked on my Android and there is a new Google Plus update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, if you update that and it doesn't refresh it automatically, you can go into your app settings and delete the data.  And then the next time you load it, it'll give you the refresh.  But it says, what's new pin posts in your collections?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So collections are basic.  Collections is basically Pinterest collections, isn't it?  That's what it's like to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they've had those for a while, haven't they?  They've had it for a while, yeah.  It was fast growing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now they're just putting it in front of...  They just made it more like upfront.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I won't join any collections.  Don't worry, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, the thing is that they've had this in the mobile web for a while.  They just made the desktop web be the same as the mobile web.  But that post about how they did it, so they've basically really stripped it down.  So it's gone from 22 megs to 327 kilobytes, the homepage weight, which is pretty impressive.  Yeah, massive difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is Google AMP too.  It's the religion they're going to enforce all over.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You go.  Sorry, I was gapping there.  Yes, so it's very much the religion of how to do it.  But one of the things they say in this one is that AMP has a very high JavaScript component.  This one, they said one of the design principles was that they want to be able to render stuff either on the server or the client  so they can give you a solid server-side version and serve that to you and then update it with new stuff on the client.  So that is a big architectural rewrite.  And it's a smart idea.  So there is this trend towards doing web pages that are basically all JavaScript and the HTML that isn't really there at all.  And that is problematic.  That's not AMP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  AMP restricts JavaScript to a minimum, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, AMP requires you to use only their JavaScript.  Google only.  So if JavaScript, unless they fix it since since, if JavaScript fails to load on AMP, you get a white screen.  Because for some reason, for some reason, there's so much JavaScript.  They try to white and only change it when it loads.  That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And my point was really, you make the more sophisticated technical point.  I was just making the dumb point that Google's religion of fast pages we're really seeing come out here in a lot of different ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely. That point is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The people who are the most avid Google Plus users, like Lauren Weinstein, who you quote,  Who's great. He's wonderful.  Yeah, hate it.  Do you think this change to Google Plus is going to be a positive for Google Plus?  Will it bring people back to it or is it going to further chase people away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't see.  Listen, I think Bradley and company are brilliant.  We love them.  But if I were going to say to somebody, you know, as somebody who's defended Google Plus, even though I've kind of abandoned it to be all to be honest.  Right.  But I've defended it since the beginning.  If I went to somebody nowadays, hey, Jarvis, this is your Google Plus thing.  What's new about it? Should I try it again?  I wouldn't know what to say.  Yeah.  Well, they got a hamburger now.  I don't think it's that different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not.  I don't think so either.  It's not that different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, the same principle is there.  They've got a flow of things that shows in the page and they decide which ones to show you and you can search for them and so on.  And the actual contents of them hasn't changed much at all, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've only seen two Lauren posts complaining.  I wouldn't say hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but those two posts, he's pretty adamant about hating it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's mainly the contrast.  What about Elgin? What's the God of Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Mike likes it a lot.  Yeah, he's big on it.  He says it's a huge improvement.  It loads so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think everybody's observing that, right?  Yeah.  I don't think collections are that interesting, to be honest with you.  No, I don't either.  And so I'm a little disappointed that Google's put those front and center.  And I'm not making any collections, as you can see.  Flipboard does this.  Pinterest does this.  A lot of sites think, but it's too much work, frankly, to make collections.  Well, it depends.  I mean, I've joined a lot of communities.  I participate in communities.  I mean, we make collections for this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We just put them in a spreadsheet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  True, true.  Okay.  I don't do that if it was too much work.  But I should be clear that Jason does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also have collections on my Google Plus post.  Do you?  I'm a collections kind of guy.  We hired the right guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when you do collections, you're going through the homepage,  and then you're adding it to your collection by clicking that share button?  No, I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you collect something?  I mean, actually, to be honest, I don't follow collections necessarily.  I follow people.  It's confusing, right?  Because collections is basically a way of saying,  you like me, but you don't like the things I say about this.  So instead, follow the things I say about this.  So in other words, I've got an Android collection.  Most of the stuff I post on Google Plus is Android,  so it goes in the Android collection.  How do you make it go in the Android collection?  It kind of does that by default because it remembers the last place I posted,  which is in my Android collection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you post to a collection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. And so anybody following me in the Android collection sees those posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you're also posting to your stream and your profile?  Yeah, it's all going to my profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you see it?  If you're following me, yes, you see everything that I do,  including my collections that have nothing to do with Android  or that are in a different collection.  If you're just following my Android collection,  that's all you're going to see from my postings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Requiring users to add taxonomy to what they do on social.  That's a lot.  I completely agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When it's tags, there is this distinction between tagging and categorization.  And categorization is hard because it requires you to think about the world  and divide it into categories.  And then every time you've got something like, which box do I put this in?  Tagging is easy because you have a thing and you say,  what words does this remind me of?  And you put hashes in front of them, slap them in, and there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to create...  I'll just put some terrible picture in there.  I don't know why.  It's meat. It's meat.  I'm trying to create a tech news thing.  So people that have used Circles automatically follow this collection.  Okay, you can turn that on.  So now, how do I make stuff?  Oh, it's only posts that I make?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're creating a collection so that people that follow you  could just follow your things that fall into that category.  So let's make a post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So when you make a post, it says, where do you want to post this?  Do you want to post this in a collection or do you want to post it?  I see. It says tech news.  And you could choose another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then somebody has to follow your collection separate from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, because by default, they can be in both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what it said.  It said, would you like everybody who follows you to see this?  And I said, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you can make them fully public or you can make them restricted to Circles.  So it's got the same permission model as everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was like a couple of months ago, I posted just public,  just a couple of songs, John Lennon songs that I love.  And then somebody in the comments was like,  I really don't care to know what music you listen to.  Could you make a music collections and then I don't follow that?  So that sounds like, that's like this is mostly like negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like, I don't want that stuff. Could you put that somewhere?  I know. I wasn't at Mark Zuckerberg said people don't want to make lists.  And frankly, that's what Google Plus kind of went wrong with this whole.  I liked it initially, this idea of circles, but it was too much work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I never used to. I just I just did it to everybody. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think it's a tempest in a teapot as somebody saying,  why are you spending so much time talking about this?  No one's going to care next week. It's Google. It's our show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the interesting thing for me is the is the change in the web development model.  That's the best part. That's the part that I thought up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this officially an AMP page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's it. I think that's what Kevin's saying.  It's not an AMP page. No.  But what it is, I think what it is, is it's following the pattern that they talked about at Chrome,  their fest, whatever it's called this week. Yeah.  Where they did. I'm trying to remember what they what they what they have jogged.  Basically, they've got this model of building apps using the browser.  They've got a name for it. Progressive Web Apps or something.  But so the idea is that you by using new browser feature called service workers,  you can have it a thing that is able to run code in the background on your machine,  even if that web page isn't open and receive notifications, then wake your web page up.  And it also means that it can work offline.  There's a way of setting up caches so that you're if you go to your URL once and cash stuff.  And then if you go to that URL again, even if you're not connected,  you can get some some some of the content there or previous content that's been cashed and potentially create stuff as well.  So there's there's a there's a big that Google is doing a big push on this.  The Chrome team is doing a big push on this.  Firefox has it partly implemented.  It's in the developer version. It's not in the full release version, whereas in Chrome is in the release version.  And Apple has it has it on their five year plan.  Five years for this. Yes, exactly.  Well, you know, IOS is IOS is like that anyways.  Like, well, you got a new browser when we when you get a new phone or when we have you get a new phone.  Well, there'll be a new version of the of the US.  But so so, you know, Safari updates tend to come in in big lumps with lots of things when they're when they're releasing new OS's,  whereas the Chrome and Firefox update every six weeks and so new stuff flows in continually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say the new Google Plus does load very, very quickly. Right.  Yes. That's nice. I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think there's bigger news that just happened after this came out. OK.  Which is the app streaming. What's that?  Oh, OK. Look, this is a very big deal.  Look at Danny. Danny's article is very long, but very clear.  What it amounts to is this.  When you go to search and you have information that you want from an app for apps that have agreed to do this with Google,  even without having that app on your phone, Google will stream that app into a web page out of the search results so you can get the content.  So this opens up the content of an app to Google search, number one.  And number two, it opens up that content to you without having to download the app.  So it's the web fighting back against the app world.  So the example they give is a hotels tonight app where you go, you search for.  Unfortunately, it's not out there yet. You search for hotels tonight in Phoenix.  And right now it says, hey, would you like to download the app?  Instead, in this world, it'll say click here.  And in that image, you will just go to the same content as if you had the hotels tonight app and it will be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, OK, does the app developer have to go along for the ride on this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, yes. Well, so far, yes, there's a limited number of tests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could see people saying, well, that's we made the app so that you would have to get the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, maybe you still have the option to get the app.  This is a sampling way to get the app.  The problem or eliminate the marketing apps.  How are they getting the interface?  How does one do that?  There's hooks. I don't know.  I'm sure there's an API that gives Google the hook in so that they can search the content that is behind that app.  Now, we're starting in a dark web, you know, in the light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love this idea, because that's of course, apps are a walled garden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And exactly. So this is really interesting to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's the list.  Hotel Tonight, Weather Channel, Chamani, Gourmet, My Horoscope, Visual Anatomy Free, Useful Knots.  What an eclectic list. Daily Horoscope.  So you got two horoscope apps and the New York subway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go to Danny's Twitter feed, he has a little tiny vine showing what he did on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that this?  No, it's a different one.  Something else? OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So just another indication of it in practice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I wonder if Google's got like the apps running in some lab somewhere.  Yeah.  How would they do this? This is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure it's launched the Google Play Store and runs the app through that app.  So it is effectively downloading the APK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it also, yeah, Kevin, but it also has to be able to search.  But it's also searching. It's scraping and returning results.  Search results.  Right. App indexing.  Yeah, there's two different things happening here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's part of the, what do you call it?  The thing they've got in M that's like making sense of the app, right?  Yeah, app indexing. It's looking into the apps.  So it's part of the Now On Tap.  Now On Tap model. I don't remember what Google calls it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also, man, it was, I think it was last year a company called Agawi was snapped up by Google  that was developing technology to do just this, basically virtual versions of mobile apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to TechCrunch, Google's been indexing the contents of mobile apps for two years.  But they're just now making that information available.  Thousands of apps have already been indexed.  So this is kind of making the app contents part of the knowledge graph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and it's also part of, it's also to me, again, I'm going to speak at a high level,  not the knowledgeable level Kevin speaks at.  But I see a similarity between this and Instant Articles and AMP in the sense that it just makes,  you're not going to a website, you're not loading a browser to go to a website,  you're not loading an app to go to that. The content feels like it comes to you.  Yeah. Well, isn't, I think this is what we want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just wonder about app developers, how they feel about it.  To my mind, app developers, you know, the difficulty, they should because the difficulty of getting people to download

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and remember to use your app, A. B, the impossibility of getting anyone to discover what's in your app through search.  Right. Now, of course, we're going to hear, oh, we're going to hear antitrust stuff about,  oh, well, Google's taking it over and they're streaming it and they're in control of it.  You know, and there's maybe a chance that they're going to be able to do that.  They're in control of it, you know, and there's maybe issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, if Google did this with Twit podcast, you did a search and all of a sudden it said, yeah,  and they also talked about this on this week in Google and they put up a little player that jumped to that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Boy, I would love that. Yeah, because it's a sampling. Yeah, it's a discovery. Yeah.  And you may well choose to download the I mean, there should be an app opportunity.  There are reasons. You know, I have the New York Times app because it caches the whole day's New York Times  before I get on the train in the morning. So that's reason for me to have that app.  Right. Right there. And Guardian, same thing.  So there are apps that I do indeed want, but frankly, very few of them.  This opens up a huge amount of of that world.  Now, the question is, what is what do you do with something like Facebook?  You search Google for Facebook and, you know, if Facebook doesn't play along, I guess they don't do it.  Or I don't know. Do you remember yesterday's Wall Street Journal article?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google gets surprise ally in mobile app search push Facebook.  That's right. So I think nobody really knew what was going on here.  Facebook on Friday began allowing Google to crawl and index its mobile app.  Oh, I didn't see this agreement means results from Google searches on smartphones  will display the some content from Facebook's app, including public profile information.  The listings will appear as deep links. It'll take users to the relevant part of the Facebook app.  So, of course, this is good for Facebook.  May not be so good for your privacy, but if you're published, well, just, you know, if you're posting publicly on Facebook,  you really might want to think about, you know, what do I want to post publicly on Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's I mean, that's been the true Facebook for a while. Of course, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Facebook index is it. So right. Yeah.  And Facebook added their search a couple of weeks ago. Yeah. So this is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they changed that search because they used to have they had that sort of graph based search that let you say,  find me friends of mine who work for this company, which nobody ever used that and gone for public stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, to me, to me, what happens here in this combination of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I've got a next to be here just in the eye. Yeah, I saw it. Let me pull it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Installing things has gotten so fast and painless.  Why not skip it entirely and make a phone that already has every app quote installed already and just downloads and runs them on the fly?  I felt pretty clever until I realized I'd invented web pages. Oops.  Actually, there is what is that mint phone that was a Kickstarter is coming out next month or in January.  Are you talking about next bit? Next bit that it takes stuff off of your phone if you don't use it and then it streams it back when you need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I mean, the notion of a web page and a website and the notion of an app really starts to get mushy here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it should because that's what I really didn't like the move.  And you're a you know, like let's Kevin Marx. I mean, you're the open web advocate. Is this a good thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think the thing this is interesting is this combines with the progressive web app stuff.  I was saying with which they were approaching from the other end and they're saying, OK,  here's where developing apps that run in the browser but on Android will feel much more like apps.  They will you can they will give you an install this on your desktop prompt.  They will work in the background. They will get notifications.  They will appear in that new web view that has less webcraft around it and browser craft around it.  So they're coming in from that direction. And this is interesting because they're coming from the opposite direction.  They're saying, OK, there's a bunch of stuff that's only apps and it would be nice people able to search them.  So I think I'm not sure this is a cannot coordinate effort.  It's just more like culturally, Google approaches these things with a sense of the web.  And so different teams are coming at it from different angles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good thing for content creators, for sure. It's a good thing for Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And it travel your content as with AMP, your content travels with your what your circumstances,  your business model attached to it. Right. If that's advertising, it's it's there.  If it's if it's transactional, as in the hotel example, it's there.  You know, I worked with the company called Repost on Us, which unfortunately isn't here.  But John Pettit is a brilliant guy who was the founder of it.  I was working with him to embed content, which I've talked about the show in the past a lot,  which is a kind of primitive version of what's happening now.  But he also found that embedded transactional units, hotel units, things like that,  work extremely well if they're in context and right there when you want them.  And this makes it this is much more user centered and much less media and brand centered.  That gets very confusing for us in media.  Because, you know, if somebody comes in and they see your Andy Weir interview with that at that minute, you know, 36.  Right. Do they know that it occurred on triangulation?  They know it's Twitter network. That's that's part of the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to have to do looks like the apps well branded that you'd see.  You know, this came from hotels tonight.  Obviously, Google would have to do that. Yeah.  They don't want to. I mean, I would be upset if Google were extracting our content for their benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the other opportunity here, that's what they've done with the web forever, isn't it?  It's like they've crawled the web and they pull out search and they and the process for that is somewhat opaque.  You can influence a bit by marking up some ways, but basically they'll decide which they show and in what order.  And they're doing here. They'll be doing that for the apps as well.  They decide which ones they think are relevant based on their AI magic.  But it'll it'll pop up with information from the inside the app as well.  So it's not quite clear what they're doing. I need to find a real real tech discussion.  It sounds like what they're doing is actually running the app.  They'd have to would they actually actually run in the app, but running it loading it piecemeal.  So they basically as a virtual patched into a partial a partial in the search results.  No, no, no. It says it runs it through the Google Play Store.  So it's that is that is being given permission.  It's already got permission to install stuff on your thing and download it.  It runs at a high level permissions than most other apps.  So it's able to pull bits in, run them through a bit and then throw them away and put the sound of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this doesn't just work on the mobile.  This works. Does this I mean, is this searches everywhere or is it just on your mobile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought it said only mobile. Maybe I'm misreading it.  Ah, well, that's less useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a ridiculous distinction to me. The problem with Google is so it's only system with Android apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That makes sense. If that's the case, if it's only Android apps and only on mobile, then I think you're exactly I think you nailed it, Kevin.  That's how they're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that also makes sense for things like the Pixel C and things.  What about which which which wins?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cardner and I chat and ask an interesting question. All well and good for free apps.  What about paid apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Same issue for paid content.  And I've been part of discussions with paid publishers who say to Google, hey, if a if a Wall Street Journal subscriber know that not that discussion gets a little bit better.  Wall Street Journal subscriber searches for something on Google search and they come up on Google News, either one.  Right. And and there's journal content that's there.  They've already paid for it.  Why can't you do them a favor because they've already shown the preference for it and give some preference to that.  And, you know, Google doesn't spin at that idea.  There's not in around the room and, you know, query query list looks.  But that's something that the paywall publishers have always wanted.  So I think that there are ways that it's basically, you know, an in-app purchase and another and another model.  There's an option that comes and the user can say, don't show me stuff I haven't paid for or, you know, show it to me.  Google could get us could get a sales spiff on causing new sales because this is this is premium sampling.  There's all kinds of new business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't even do it for paywalls yet.  So having them do it in apps is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they well, they do it to the extent that they will show you paywall content now on Google News.  A snippet.  You just curse when you get there.  Yeah, they'll show you a snippet.  You'll curse when you go to it, right.  Which is very frustrating.  Or in the case of The Wall Street Journal, though, you will if it's through search you found it.  You will get it for free.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the question is, could you know, if this is this what interests me about this so much is because there's potentially an exchange of consumer data, which is what I keep pushing for.  So if The Wall Street Journal revealed to Google, hello, Leo Laporte is one of our dear subscribers.  Please make sure that you give preference to our stuff to him because he's shown that preference because he subscribes and Leo.  At some point you get the chance to say yes to that or don't do that.  You know, but OK, it makes sense logically.  Similarly, so I could do that relatively anonymously just with a cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a Wall Street Journal cookie set that I'm a paying subscriber.  That's all I really need.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what happens is it's also it's also a data exchange.  So now Google knows this guy's a money guy.  He likes The Wall Street Journal or he's right wing.  You know, one or the other.  And we don't want that.  Right.  And the no politics emails, please.  People, it's just a joke.  Come on.  Come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to read that book about the righteous mind.  Then you wouldn't say things like that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a data exchange that occurred there where Google learned something about that user.  Now, similarly, what I want, of course, is for the publisher to learn something about from Google about that user with the user's consent, with the benefit to the user, with transparency to the user, with the data.  With the opportunity for change for the user.  But that kind of data exchange is where the only real value is in a world that goes from mass to relevance.  And and when you when you get away from this idea of, well, I'm going to The Wall Street Journal site now is bye, honey.  I'll see you now.  Or I want to drive off to the journal now and see what their site says.  If instead you say, oh, I found this journal stuff through search and I found it through Twitter and I found it through here and I found it through there.  And sometimes I looked at a web page and sometimes I looked at their app and I don't even know the difference.  I just got what I wanted.  That's the way the Internet ought to operate.  Except for that was intended to operate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Except for all the people who say and then then Google's tracking me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And well, that's where we've got to come up with new standards about how this occurs.  And the standards to me are fairly straightforward and simple.  Number one, there has to be a consumer benefit to me.  You don't just gather data on me for the sake of gathering it.  Two, there has to be a business benefit to you.  The same reason, you know, just gather data to gather it.  Three, you give me transparency as to what you're doing and why you're doing it, what you're doing with it.  And four, you give me some measure of control that I can go in and correct things, which only means that I give you more data about myself.  What's wrong with that?  Under those principles and implicit of that is the option to say, no, don't do this.  I refuse to I don't like Google.  I don't like The Wall Street Journal.  Whatever.  That's fine.  You know, then you know, it's OK.  You're going to lose out on some relevance, but that's that becomes your choice.  I think that there are ways and principles to do this that become beneficial to everybody in that transaction.  It may be too late.  There may be too much mistrust, but I think there's still an opportunity here.  And to me, it is the it is the crux of new media business models.  It is the only thing that's going to save us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, as you know, you and I don't care about privacy so much, but poor privacy advocates have a fair share.  Privacy advocates have a field day with them.  We have to come up with some sort of opt in opt out.  Yes, we got to help.  Do not track has to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we define one and then the publishers said screw you.  Yeah, we don't want to use that.  Now we're doing it through force majeure.  Right.  Opting out by running blockers.  Right.  Airplane issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, drone over Kevin.  Drone coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you're exactly right.  Because do not track stop, you know, wasn't supported and stopped working.  We went to a block.  Congratulations.  Well done is a howitzer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do not track is a howitzer.  Do not track has no subtlety at all.  It just says everything is all data is evil.  And if you're watching me, that's bad.  Well, no.  How about example?  Example.  We're all stuck with with retargeting programmatic ads where you look at the boots on Amazon and the boots follow you around forever.  Yes.  Yes.  And the Interactive Advertising Bureau said one thing that we should have on those dear dads is a frequency cap as a standard because we all get sick of that's why they do tracking things like that.  Exactly.  That's why you have to have the cookie to do the frequency cap.  And that's a benefit to the user to say we are not going to overload you with those stupid boots.  But what do we do now?  We overload you with the boots.  We've done a terrible job in the industry of a terrible, terrible, awful job in all of our industries.  I think that's a big part of the problem in media, in advertising and technology of giving people some measure of transparency and control and knowledge about what's happening.  But I don't think it's too late.  And to me, Kevin, you're exactly right.  The publishers blew it here because they're the ones who said we don't do that because we're holding on to our ad avail every precious ad avail we can have.  But you take publishers, they should be the ones who should be concerned about trust and faith with their users.  And they should be the ones to work with a Google and Facebook to help set these standards.  I'm going to Google Newsgeist in Phoenix this week and tomorrow.  And I hope that's one of the things we'll talk about because out of Newsgeist came AMP.  So other good things could come out of it going forward.  We're going to take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You should get me on the on the invite list for that.  I'd like to do one of those again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. I know.  Did you you've gone to the news food before?  I went to news food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yeah, that's basically the week.  I mean, if you and I and Marissa did a thing, but but no, I've actually never been to news food.  I get on that list, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the recristened news food.  When O'Reilly dropped out, it's now Newsgeist.  Different t-shirts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Always, always up for a new t-shirt.  Kevin, do you think you could talk about Ethereum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not with a great deal of knowledge.  It's not something I know in depth.  I know somebody was asking that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying. Yeah, I saw that in the chat room.  And I think it's a great subject.  And, you know, I'm trying to get we're going to take a break.  But just trying to get Steve Gibson to do a full show.  He's done a full show of Bitcoin, but I want him to do a full show of block chain and other applications for block chain.  And Ethereum is a very interesting application for block chain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can I mean, I can I can at least give us some sense of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kevin, what you think what you think is a light bit of knowledge, believe me, it's going to be more than enough.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. When we come back, lots more to talk about.  Jeff Jarvis is here from the City University of New York.  Always a pleasure. Author of What Would Google Do? Public Parts.  Gutenberg, the geek and geeks bearing gifts.  BuzzMachine.com is his blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now out in German as ausgedruckt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it.  That's the title.  Uncharacteristically short German title.  Out of print.  Out of print.  Oh, I like it.  That's good.  Kevin Marks is also here from KevinMarks.com.  He's all about IndieWeb.  And I know IndieWebCamp is coming up.  So we'll get we'll get your IndieWebCamp plug in soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also, Homebrew website Club Snite.  Yes.  It's the second anniversary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? Congratulations.  That's awesome.  Our show today brought to you by Ring, the Ring Video Doorbell.  That's the greatest thing.  You know, every once in a while something comes along  and I show it to people and they go, oh, yeah.  And they show it to people and they go, oh, yeah.  And it just like spreads like wildfire because it's just  it's such a great simple idea.  That's exactly what people need.  It's kind of like caller ID for your home.  What it does is it replaces your regular ding dong doorbell.  It's an easy replacement. I did it myself.  It's just a couple of screws, a couple of wires.  But all of a sudden, and by the way, when you press the button,  your doorbell still goes ding dong, but not only your doorbell,  but your phone, your tablet, your computer, ding dongs everywhere.  It's so awesome.  You don't even have to have a wired doorbell for this to work.  You could put it on any door because it's got a one year lithium ion battery in it.  You can rechargeable.  Once you get on there, there's a camera, nice wide angle camera,  give you a full view of your front stoop.  And by the way, there's that there's that ding dong dong.  Love that sound.  But it also will give you a view of the street beyond.  It's got motion sensing in it.  It's also got a microphone and speaker.  So when somebody rings your doorbell, you could say, yeah, what is it?  Even if you're across the world.  That's the beauty of this.  The ring video doorbell. I love it.  I know when people come and go my house, when my daughter comes home late at night,  I could say, hey, look at this.  You came in at 3 a.m.  I have the video.  And, you know, burglars come during the day when you're at work  and there's no one to answer the door.  They ring the doorbell.  Nobody answers.  Go around back and break in.  Now you can answer the doorbell even at work.  Plus get nice crystal clear video of that guy.  This time of year, you probably get a lot of packages.  You can see those packages.  You can see when they arrive.  You can watch them like a hawk.  Make sure nobody comes and takes them.  You get an instant alert when somebody comes by and the HD video of the whole thing.  It's like having a neighbor keep an eye on your home 24-7 without the judgment.  I love my ring doorbell. I love it.  We're giving one to our brother-in-law because he had some packages just the other day.  Stole him off his porch.  Installing ring is easy.  I'm no handyman. I was able to do it.  It will work with either existing wired doorbell or using its battery.  Ring.com.  200 bucks.  Time Magazine said it was the product, one of their top ten gadgets of 2014.  I'm just a huge fan.  Go to ring.com slash twig and you'll get free expedited FedEx shipping so you can get it just in time for the holidays.  Ring.com slash twig.  This would be a gift.  I want to give it to everybody in my family.  Ring.com slash twig.  Free FedEx shipping in the U.S.  With ring, you're always home.  Thank you for their support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Another story about the ring as a follow up to Shark Tank.  And losing on Shark Tank.  It's the greatest story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says, I'm glad I lost on Shark Tank.  Well, it all worked out for him.  If he had gotten an investment from Shark Tank, he would have a considerably smaller stake in the company.  And by the way, just got a $28 million investment from Richard Branson.  So that's, you know, he said he thought his company's worth $7 million.  When he, Jamie S. Semenoff, when he went to Shark Tank a couple of years ago.  What was the company?  DoorBot. Remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, the DoorBot. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, and Ring is, by the way, you know, several versions later.  Well, now with that $28 million investment, I don't know what its value, but it's a little bit more.  So actually, the Sharks did offer money.  Kevin O'Leary, Mr. Wonderful offered his $700,000 loan.  Took 10% of all sales until the loan was paid off.  And then a 7% royalty in all future sales.  Plus 5% of the equity.  And by the way, they don't tell you this, but the producers get a chunk too.  That's not even mentioned on the air.  Oh, yeah. Oh, it's a...  You do it for publicity. You don't do it to get funding.  I agree. I agree.  Anyway, he's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To make a big point about how the Sharks use their own money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they do. But you also have to give up.  You know, where do we find...  I think Scott Jordan, when he took his Scottie vest to a Shark tank, kind of revealed the secret of that.  There's Richard Branson with his Ring video doorbell.  I should use that in the ad, frankly.  That's a great endorsement.  A Ring customer was vacationing at Branson's Necker Island a couple of months ago  and used Ring to talk to a UPS delivery guy who was at his house in San Francisco.  Branson said, what? What? What did you do? What happened there?  So he emailed Simonoff and became an investor.  Nice story.  Just a couple of things that we'll get to, Ethereum.  You can now get free Google Drive storage if you help out with Google's local guides.  Do some reviews, get some storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the first world version of mobile minutes being a currency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can get early access to new Google products and features.  You can show up in the Google Maps app with your official local guides badge.  Get a free terabyte upgrade of your drive storage, but that's going to take you two to 499 points.  And the very top level local guides will become eligible to attend our inaugural summit in 2016,  where you'll be able to meet up with other top guides from around the world,  explore the Google campus and get the latest info about Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Two years ago I went to a local New York guide meetup where they had people who were really into Google local.  It was kind of fun. There were nice people. It was cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I am very grateful to the people who put reviews on Yelp, good reviews on Amazon,  tips on Foursquare, tips on local guides. I think that's great.  Local guides is more than just like a review though, right?  You have to say here's the secrets of San Francisco pizza or whatever.  So I think it's appropriate for them to give you something for it.  Yeah.  Because you have to put some work into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like there's a marketplace for this. It's Google's frequent flyer points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, nice. And it's kind of a big contribution, I think, to the internet when you do stuff like that.  Anything you put on the internet is a contribution.  That's why we like the homebrew website club and all that.  Get people up there on the web. It's not over.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's hope not.  It hasn't even begun.  It's just beginning, the web.  International calls to France were free thanks to Google and Hangouts.  I don't know how long that's going to last, but that was of course because of the terrorist action,  the attacks in Paris over the weekend.  Thank you Google for doing that. Facebook did a great job as well with its safety check of helping people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it was just great. And I was really unhappy that everything has a naysayer.  So for the first time they decided this thing was designed for natural disasters,  Facebook said let's use safety check for a man-made disaster.  Then they got all kinds of crap that they hadn't decided to do this the day before with Beirut.  It's racist.  Since then they've done it with Nairobi, with Nigeria, and bombing there.  But it was something that got the spire to do it, they decided to do it.  Well, you didn't do it fast enough. You didn't do it soon enough.  Geez, give them a break.  The web is an outrage engine, isn't it really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think? I think there are certain people who are always outraged.  You know them, we all know them.  Do you think it's just that they have been given a voice on the web so we see more of them,  or that the internet is turning normal people into outrage engines?  It's catching. I think it's catching. I think outrage is contagious.  Yeah, I don't know, it's a good question.  I wish optimism were contagious. Good feelings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've tried that. Believe me, Leo, there's no business model in trying to make optimism contagious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've always been positive, but you're absolutely right.  The negative commentators, the cynics, they're funnier, they're more persuasive, they're more entertaining.  Media also likes them better and they get more attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Media likes them because they're better on camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if it's the media...  Dvorak taught me that. He said, you can't go wrong saying something sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a role model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Live the life there, yeah.  That should be honest, not that we want John to go anytime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we love John. But see, that's the thing. You know that that's John's persona, so you go along with it.  It's part of the mix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But has that potential to be something like, I told you it sucked.  I told you so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I have to say the web is an outrage engine. This is to me an example of that, the Facebook thing.  It's like, all right, you can't win for losing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is a challenge there. What threshold do they set this for? What time do they find it useful?  And they had set that threshold very high, which was a large natural disaster over a large area.  And they decided that the Paris thing was of that scale because they were seeing similar requests about it.  It makes sense, though, that...  So bringing it to other things as well, it does make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can overdo it, too, right? You don't want this constantly going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, exactly. I'm safe, I'm safe, I'm safe from everything possible.  And they make the point that it doesn't work for an epidemic and it doesn't work for a war because there's not a definition of safe.  I wrote my New York Observer column today about this and just said that when Katrina hit, I had recently left the company that started NOLA.com.  But that site became the place people went to.  I remember there was a story of a woman who was stuck on a roof and she texts somebody in like Utah and they go to the NOLA.com forum so that the National Guard can find the post and then pick her up.  And that became a gathering point and Craigslist is a kind of gathering point.  And media lost that entirely.  The reflex is going to be, I'm going to tell people I'm safe.  I'm not going to go to a newspaper. My people aren't there.  I'm going to go to Facebook. I'm going to go to Twitter.  But something else that we blew in media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin Marx agrees. Stop calling Google Cardboard Videos VR.  Yes. Well, actually, I'm the one who said...  You said it's immersive video. We talked about it on...  Yes.  On Twitter twig after the New York Times piece.  It's immersive video. That's what it is.  And I've been trying to call it that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Marcus Sullivan, the ombuds person, the public editor of the New York Times...  She wrote a nice piece on that.  Yeah.  Yeah, about the ethical issues of setting up a shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And she said it better. This is what I was trying to get at, but she said it so much better than me.  But when I'm watching the video, this is the New York Times piece on the children of war, displaced children.  It was three or four actual children whose lives have been torn apart by war.  And it was video of them going through their daily lives.  But I, you know, and maybe because I'm in the business, but I always think about what's behind the camera.  And in the case of immersive video, nothing, because it's immersive.  So and this is what I was not expressing well, but this is what I was trying to express.  When you're watching that kind of video, you have to remember that all of it is essentially staged.  Because in order for it to be set up, you have to set up this say to the kid, don't move, set up this camera, say, OK, wait till I leave the frame.  And then you could do what you would normally do.  And you walk off. And it's I think that's a fundamental problem.  Same problem with any media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But no, but OK, if we do a fly on the wall documentary, we're doing the same thing.  You're saying, OK, TV admittedly, ignore us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Admittedly, observation, you know, it's, you know, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.  Observation changes the observed.  But Jeff's about to say that there is an ethic in television journalism of not staging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, look at where they do stage. Right.  I think B-roll is absurd, offensive.  It's made up. It's fictional.  The naughty shot. Yeah.  Yeah. You know, that broadcast news, one of my favorite movies of all times, with the second camera tier.  TV's always done that.  Whereas we've in newspapers, we had an ethics supposedly where we would never set up a shot.  We would never tell somebody what to do.  I don't think that's terribly true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But when I worked for NBC with good producers, we were always told, you know, if you said, hey, could you put your hand on that mouse and move it around?  So we get no, you can't do that.  That's staging. So there used to be.  I grant you it's probably a long gone ethical tenant.  But there was for a while this idea that you when you go to shoot a news story, you can shoot what's going on.  You cannot tell somebody.  OK, can you walk in that door again?  An interview is a little different, right?  An interview is a synthetic environment.  And all you're doing is you have one camera and you're trying to get the reverse so you can edit it.  I think that that's different.  But when you're going to cover a news story like these children and you want to show their lives, and I agree with you, Kevin, the very nature of the camera being there changes the situation.  But as best you can, what you don't want to do is say, hey, do you think you can walk over there, look out the window, look sad?  You don't ever do that.  Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's you know, but that's the thing is.  This stuff is much harder to edit.  You know, with classic video, you shoot it, you shoot a lot of it, shoot documentary, you shoot as much as you need, and then you edit and tell the story with the edit.  With this stuff, it's a through shot.  So if you're going to edit it, it becomes an effort like making Birdman or something.  It's like I've got to make them walk into a dark corner and walk out again so we can edit it.  You can edit it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, you know, it is.  In a way that makes it better, right?  Because editing can retell a story.  It can change a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, so this article is slightly off in that it says it doesn't let you do the head bubble to get perspective.  Depends how they shoot it.  If they shoot it with that Google 16 camera rig, you can do that because they have enough overlap to do that.  But if it's just shot with a single 360 lens, then yes, you can't do that.  And then it makes you sicker.  So there are variations on this.  But if you look to the stuff that they shot with that 16 camera thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't. I would love to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because that stuff, you get a better sense of space because they've got like cameras that are close enough to being where your eyes are.  You can you can something there can actually have parallax as you as you move your move your head.  But that means you can do a kind of there's two ways you sense depth.  You either sense depth by convergence of the eyes or you actually do it by moving your eyes and seeing what moves.  So if you if you actually think about how people do it, they do a little circuit where they move their head.  And that lets you know, oh, the microphone is here and the right umbrellas over there and the orange is over there because it didn't move as much.  And that's a natural thing you do.  And if you've got a single viewpoint camera, you can't replicate that.  Whereas if you have that, the 16 camera rig, those are spaced far enough apart that you can get and they can interpolate it.  So you can get actual things moving as you move your head in planes.  So you get you get a little piece. I mean, obviously you can't move far, but you can rotate a little bit.  And that does make a difference.  But yeah, there's but the full thing of we're actually simulating the environment and remapping it so you can move your head anywhere and move forward backwards through the space is a different model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The by the way, Margaret Sullivan is one of the best columnists in the New York Times.  She's the public editor. Her role is as ombudsman to represent the public interest and speak truth to power.  Her employers, she quotes the former managing editor of the Washington Post, Robert Kaiser, who complained that the time seems to be touting a process that will often be very difficult.  A process that will often be based on tricks and deceptions by the photographers and cameramen.  The editor's letter for Mr. Silverstein, which is the Jack Silverstein, the editor of the Times magazine, whoever saw it, described how the virtual reality filmmaker works to ensure that the quote the action unfolds the way he imagined.  Mr. Silverstein wrote that quote VR tote usually involves more coordination between filmmaker and subject than in traditional video journalism, a subject may be asked to repeat in action or wait until the filmmakers out of sight to complete a task.  This, Mr. Kaiser said is tantamount to faking a scene. And that's not sound journalism. I kind of agree. It's more filmmaking than it is journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it actually if you're doing the stuff, it's actually more like staging a play. Right. This very reason you can't edit. So you have to set it up like a like a theater performance.  And also in the same way that you when you were staging a play in an in a like a nonconventional theater, you have to encourage people to look in the right direction to see the action.  So you've got people running past things going on. If you're looking if you're looking the wrong way, looking out the window, then you then you then you can miss it with these things. So you actually have to cue it with audio and things as well. So to do this stuff successfully is is much more like staging a play than it is like editing video. It's going to require different production skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's appropriate for us to bring this up because what we what you what everybody wants is an informed readership that understands what they're seeing and understands what might or might not be involved in the making of that. And so understand when you're looking at immersive video, that is really much more of a creation than

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the point is, you know, when when I was young, learning video production was a dark, dark art that you had to do that nobody had. Whereas now everyone has like three cameras in their pocket and understands about framing shots carefully for hopes. Yeah.  Take me. I also think editing and editing the vine to six seconds to make it work. You know, the fact that all of us can do this individually and anyone growing up with these tools gets that media editorial education built in. I think there's a certain sort of excessive hand rigging here about people can edit things and we cut things so stories. It's like, yes, we know that.  There's a reason that my headshot looks good on Facebook is because I took 45 of them to get the one that worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think I think the Times should do a behind the scenes how it's made because that is part of the education. I was the first time I went on on the show on the media as we're walking down the hall. The young intern producers said I should let you know we edit a lot.  And in fact, when Barbara Garfield does it, he'll start over a question five, 10 times sometimes. And in the end, the miracle is they they make it sound like it's one question and the other miracle is they'll take out my right, you know, and make me sound smart.  I kind of hate that.  I'm fine with it.  I kind of hate that.  Well, yeah, but but they did a great piece.  There's a wonderful show they did where they actually explained this process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  Yes. And it was it was really good because it is like the person who produced it since died and it was one of his favorite things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As I remember, but it was great because it gave you that sense of the transparency behind it. If anyone should be transparent about that. So in a sense, what I want to see from the Times is a view of the journalist standing there with Rick and know where that person is.  Or I want to see a separate video saying, showing how she runs out of the frame and how that works. So we have a sense of what we are watching and know that context.  We have a kind of I've always had a kind of ethos.  And this came back from doing tech TV up to then all the technology television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that time it was computer television that had been done.  They would edit out things like crashes. They would add out the time it took to install a program.  They did. And what happened is they communicated miscommunicated the experience of computing.  And and it has a couple of, you know, negative effects.  One is it oversells it, but also makes people feel bad when there's crashes and takes forever installs.  Like, what am I doing wrong? Those guys seem so fluent.  So when we look at the TV, we see that there's a lot of people who are not as well informed about the process.  So when we did the screensavers and call for help, I said we will always do this live and we will not edit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought of it that way, but that's really important. You're right. That's part of your credibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And stuff would crash and stuff wouldn't work. And that's we didn't hide that.  And so when we started doing Twitter, we kind of had the same idea.  You know, the shows are edited, but they're never edited for content.  They're always edited. If somebody swears, we put a boop in and we never rearrange stuff.  We try to edit it as little as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The only, the most major edit is when we have absolute hell with communication.  Yeah. Sometimes we'll cut it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll kind of say, OK, let's stop it. We'll start again.  Mostly because I don't want to waste people's time, but I don't want to misrepresent people.  And I don't want to cut out us because if somebody's stupid, I don't want them to sound smart.  I want you to hear them as they are.  Anyway, I just, I maybe have a different kind of point of view.  I think I want to show things as they are.  Yes.  But I don't know.  By the way, thank you, Kevin, for the link to this on the media show from Friday, May 25th, 2007,  pulling back the curtain, if you want to listen to it.  Oh, just listen to it. That's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A lot of public radio does this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think people don't understand that Terry Gross does this.  And a lot of public radio is heavily edited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the latest episode of Startup, was it Startup?  Was it Startup? I think, talked about this.  So you know the, what are they called, Gimlet Media?  Yeah.  That does the bunch of podcasts.  So Startup is the one where they talk about themselves as a show.  A little solopsistic, but okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Early podcasting always was, but anyway, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. But the point was that, yeah, so it's called the secret formula.  Yeah. And what they say is, what's our secret formula for success,  and how do we get these people to do well?  The answer is that we edit them a lot and work really hard to make them sound good.  And they talk a bit about the process they go through in editing these.  And it is very much that very high touch, high production, lots of planning thing  that comes from documentary radio, from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I understand that.  And that's very much the public broadcasting model always has been.  And I just come from a different side of the fence.  I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I enjoy listening to public broadcasting.  Although when I found out that Click and Clack worked so very differently from the way I do call-in radio.  You know, when I do call-in radio, it's live.  And the calls come in and you answer them, and the next week calls in.  Click and Clack would solicit calls. You'd call the 800 number.  They'd call you back if they liked your sound.  If they would record you with Click and Clack, they would record four or five hours  and edit the best down to an hour worth.  And so the problem is it's hard for me to compete with that.  I'm never going to be as funny and as tight and as wonderful as public radio  because I am doing more than all production.  But it's my personal ethos. That's the way I like to do it. I prefer to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure. I mean, you make it up in volume. I mean, that's the thing.  Yeah, I make it up in volume. Exactly.  If you were doing it with this thing, then we'd do the same two-hour conversation we have  and cut it down to a half-hour show.  It'd be a half-hour show, yeah.  And you could do that, and that would probably work.  It would be a different kind of show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it would not be as timely, that's for sure.  That was the other reason that we don't edit, is we want it to be timely.  We want to get it out the door as quickly as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you also just get rid of the conventions driving you nuts.  And I've railed on about this for the show, but I'm standing in front of the fire  where nothing's happening.  Yeah, a lot of that.  A B-roll, Noddy's, handoffs.  You know what drives me nuts these days?  What drives me absolutely nuts is after you finish a story on, let's say, ABC Nightly News,  whatever they call it, and we come back and they finish the story, it's done,  and then they anchor us to say, well, yes, that's a terrible situation.  Boy, we're going to think a lot about that tonight.  Yeah.  So this meaningless, absolutely meaningless coda, right, well said.  These are all of the orthodoxies of old media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My favorite is, only time will tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, yes.  That's a very difficult situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it is.  And that added a lot to my understanding for you to tell me that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of what's interesting is people have internalized that from watching so much television,  and I see people doing that completely unnecessarily all the time.  There's this kind of, it's something actually we have to deal with with new hosts a lot,  is they do a lot of tropes that are mainstream media tropes.  You can stop doing that now.  Yes, no.  We don't care.  Well, another interesting thing, later today I'm going to come back at 11 at night  and do a thing with Good Morning America.  They're celebrating their 40th anniversary,  and one of our good friends and hosts, Becky Worley, is their technology reporter.  Oh yeah, you're doing this very neat thing.  They asked her to put together an hour or two,  and instead of going to the Computer History Museum,  which they wanted to do and actually made her do it yesterday,  she said, can we do it from Twitter?  And it took them some convincing, I understand, but they agreed to do it.  Of course, remember, it's 11 p.m. Pacific, 2 a.m. Eastern.  It's not exactly prime time.  But, and you know, we do our thing the way we do our thing.  I think it's fascinating to see my team interact with network television.  Oh!  Talk about an impedance mismatch.  Oh, yes.  No, you guys are doing great. I'm not knocking you.  Just saying that they have a different way of thinking of things.  I'm used to it.  You're a strange alien.  Yeah, I've worked in mainstream media for years, so I understand.  In fact, one of the reasons Twitter exists is because I hate it so much.  I'm so allergic to it that we decided to do it differently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Guys, don't change. Don't change.  I like what we do. Is it 10 p.m.?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's 10 p.m. Pacific.  Oh, well, it's only 1 a.m. Eastern.  And oh, that's another thing, mainstream media.  The only time is New York time.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Nothing else matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I watched The Voice with Rosie last night.  They're like, and you can save this artist.  No, you can't. No, you can't.  We got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, confession.  Confession.  We got the tweet at 523 Pacific time saying, do you want to save this artist?  But the show's not on for three hours.  And then you watch the show and it says, too late, voting's over.  Guess nobody counts on the West Coast.  In fact, nobody outside the Eastern time zone counts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now we know.  Kevin, I wouldn't have thought of you as a voice fan.  The voice is good. Who do you like?  Tell me you don't watch Dancing with the Stars.  Please tell me that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The voice is good.  The voice is actually well structured.  Yes, it's very well.  I watch it for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I watch it to look through the lens at the producing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, God, they needed some work on their editing.  They have this hideous habit.  Basically, they need someone to take their shows and chop out the repetition so that you get them down to like the early stage ones with the chair turns.  They're OK because those are actually edited.  But then the next stage where they're like, and now we're going to have these people dueling.  And it was something funny somebody said.  And then they repeat that funny thing somebody says four times in the trails.  Then eventually they're saying, you're like, yes, I heard that three times.  It has no impact on Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know why they're doing that.  They have many ads to sell and little content to show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's just in fact, we skip.  OK, now I'm talking about ad blocker.  We skip to the singing so you can watch a two hour.  The voice about five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, you want some of the by playing the conversation a little bit.  But you you you you learn to watch when they're about to start the package and you skip over the package.  Yeah, exactly.  They've got a ramp up package and I break around down package.  If you just chop that out, then yeah, you can watch the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Half the time, we watched the whole thing in half an hour this morning.  But in our defense, we're in the gym.  We're working out while we're watching it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's not that maybe I should do that.  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good rule. When is the ABC thing, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tonight, 10 p.m. Pacific, 1 a.m. Eastern.  Although tune in early, a will be here and be we've already been informed that we might end early.  So you'd be ready to go early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's on ABC. No, no.  Where is it streaming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's on ABC. Go dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will they then? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only live.  It's only live stream.  That's so the idea was they wanted to do 40 hours to celebrate 40 years of GMA, but they can't do 40 hours of ABC network time is too valuable.  So they stream it.  And some of it, I think they probably show.  And but most of it's just streamed.  Can you get them?  And by the way, do you feel for ABC that they didn't get ABC dot com?  They got go dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that was that whole early Disney thing.  They were all proud they had.  I went to meetings with them way back in the day in my corporate executive mode.  They were so proud that the whole web was going to be go.  This is going to be the most valuable thing there was.  So stupid.  It's everybody had their Yahoo moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speaking of Yahoo, do we talk about them hiring McKinsey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's talk.  But hold on, because we got to do it after this word from Linda dot com.  I know you guys like to learn.  I like to learn.  I like to learn.  I to me, that's my hobby is learning how to do stuff like coding.  I always like to learn different programming languages.  I never write anything, but I like to learn them photography.  Right.  And then you learn how to use Adobe Photoshop and all of that stuff.  If you like to learn or maybe you have to learn for your office, maybe maybe the boss just said,  Smithers, you know how to do Excel pivot tables, right?  Have that for me in the morning.  You need Linda dot com, Linda L Y N D A dot com.  Three thousand plus video courses, tens of thousands of hours that will help you strengthen your technology, your business, your creative skills.  It's it's fantastic whether you want to learn how to develop an app, take better photos or sharpen your Photoshop skills or all three.  By the way, you don't have to decide ahead of time when you subscribe to Linda dot com.  You get the run of the place.  You can watch any video, any course, any time.  They just put up courses, Android essential training, switching from an iPhone to an Android.  You need this.  An introduction to data analysis with Python.  Here's what I'm sure to take.  I can't wait.  Up and running with Go.  That's, of course, Google's systems programming language.  By the way, a Kernigan is part of the I just got his new go book.  There's even a new course on producing professional podcasts.  You can learn anything you want to know at Linda dot com.  L Y N D A dot com.  That's the old Android essential training, by the way, you were showing.  I don't want anybody to think this from 2014.  There's a new one that just went up.  They update these all the time.  There's up and running with Go.  It was a great language for concurrency.  If you want to learn Swift, they got that, too.  What's nice is you could take the course beginning to end, but the courses are divided up into little chunks.  You can watch a little bit at a time.  You can even search the written transcripts for each course and find the part you want and watch just that part.  It's fantastic.  You can even download the tutorials and watch them on the go.  Access on your Android or iOS device.  Linda dot com.  Here's what we're going to do.  Ten days free.  The run of the place.  Just kind of like being a subscriber for the next ten days at Linda L Y N D A dot com slash twig.  Oh, go command line tools.  That's fun.  That'd be like much better than bash, right?  L Y N D A dot com slash T W I G Linda dot com.  It's fantastic.  There it is.  Forty for forty.  Watch the live stream now.  I wonder what they're doing right now.  The they, you know, they brought back the old hosts and everything.  I mean, it's kind of cool.  But but but the stuff we're doing is in the middle of the night.  So they don't really care.  This could be fun.  Becky Worley will be here and we're going to do wearables, do some fun stuff.  I'm excited about it.  Jeff Jarvis is here from the City University of New York, CUNY, where he teaches journalism.  Kevin Marks, man about town.  And tell us about the indie indie webcam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's actually two events I want to talk about.  OK, so there's Hombre website club, which is tonight in San Francisco, Portland and  Yoderberg, though I think that one's actually happened and Brighton, which I think has also  happened because of the time difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So time difference because they're in there in the Yoderberg was at the steampunk bar.  Yes, that sounds like fun.  And there's actually two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's one in Malmo as well in Sweden.  So we've got two in Sweden.  Yeah, me too.  So yeah, so tonight in San Francisco, it's the second anniversary of Hombre website club.  And the idea of this is if you want if you want to have your own website or if you've  got your own website, you want to improve it and work on it.  This is a group where we get together and do that and talk about it and show things off  and so on.  And they're probably a decent sized group there tonight because it's the second anniversary.  I'm sure everyone's actually RSVP on the wiki.  But so Ben and Ben from known will be there and me and Tantec and some others.  And the but the point is, it's like a sell for building your own web stuff.  That's that's the Hombre website club.  It normally takes a couple of hours in the evening and it starts fairly early.  So you can if you're in San Francisco or Portland, you can get there after work and then go  home.  Indie webcam is a bigger thing.  It's it's either one or two days.  I think the next one is in San Francisco at the beginning of December.  You look at the actual date, December 3rd from December 3rd, 10 to 1800.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's that's also that's that will be a mazilla in San Francisco.  And that the pattern there is more.  It's a hack.  It's a hack.  The normal web pattern is not is a two day thing with an unconference day and a hack day.  Yeah.  And this one we're doing basically doing a hack day because a bunch of us are in town  for the social web working group meeting.  So we're going to spend some time arguing about sounds and then spend a day actually  building things on our sites and put them together.  So people are invited to that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really cool.  I should really come down to these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You should.  Yeah.  I'd love to love to go.  I mean, I think it'd be tricky for you to come down for the.  It's too early for you know, you can fish out for the show, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you could maybe do that.  I might be able to run out the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  But yeah, the if you want to drop by for the the other the other ones we normally do at  the weekend, but this time it's midweek because it was it was time to come on the other event.  But we can we can help you identify your website even further.  You've got we've got.  I haven't known.  We've got a website that does all the indie web stuff.  But I'm sure we could make your main site more indie web friendly.  That would be good.  With a little bit of editing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What could possibly be wrong with that?  And there's a Google Plus post all about this as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, ecumenical.  Full circle.  Yeah.  So part of it.  And there's a there's a Facebook event and so on.  So part of the point of the indie web is not to say we are going to replace Facebook with  our own websites.  We want to make it possible to do that.  But clearly we're not going to get everyone on Earth to switch from Facebook to their own website.  So we want to make sure that the protocols we define, we can have versions that bridge back and forth  from the social side as people already use.  So there's a cycle bridging that does that that translates between indie web protocols and  whatever proprietary API that the site uses.  So as a developer, you can just use the indie web staff and there's the work for translating Facebook or Twitter to that is done once that you can use.  And the other thing is thinking about is learning from the user experience that these sites build and saying, oh,  they've done something there that's interesting.  There's something in Google Plus that's quite nice.  Something Facebook that's quite nice.  Something Twitter that's good.  Can we learn from those and work on those in a new way?  So, you know, so the big fuss a couple of weeks ago was Twitter changing the star to a heart and the likes.  I'm sure you talked about that on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yeah, most people got upset.  The heart didn't last very long, did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, but the thing that struck me about that was that they missed a trick in that if you actually look at how people use Twitter,  which is the classic way to use web features, people react to things by using emoji.  And we have a vocabulary that is fairly large compared to Heart of a Star because it exists.  And so if you just if you just if there's a thing called EmojiTracker.com,  which if you go to that, it will show you all the emoji being used on Twitter in real time.  That's neat.  And the one that the most popular one is the one that they just added to the OED.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They actually do it so fast that they have to warn you if you're an epileptic that might be flashing at you.  So if you're an epileptic, please don't watch this.  Holy, so this is in real time.  This is in real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you notice the top left corner, there's almost a billion of the laughing with tears in my eyes emoji.  You know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because the Oxford English Dictionary declared it the word of the year.  No, no, that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's been declared the word of the year, but it was the most popular one before that.  Oh, really?  They didn't get to a billion in the last week.  Oh, interesting.  They're not quite a billion.  They're like nine, nine, nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So maybe the OED or whatever it is that does this is looking at this face with tears of joy.  So you can see that they're flowing by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if you scroll down, you get less popular emoji.  And there's a parallel as usual.  What's the least popular emoji?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The customs officer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Clock face 830 is really down the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the least popular one is going through customs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The little blue guy opening your suitcase.  Oh, this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody ever uses this guy.  I think I used it yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is not exactly flashing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they've had 28,000 of these in the history of the thing compared to a billion of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do they have the fire hose?  No, probably not.  So this isn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do.  They seem to have the fire hose, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, but this is the fascinating thing for me is like if you actually look at this and you look at any of these,  if you look at the hearts and the stars and the exploding heart size and whatever all the other emoji reactions,  people are using these continuously.  And that's...  So my suggestion is if you miss the star on Twitter,  what you should do is instead of hitting the heart button,  you hit retweet and it says add a comment and just add a comment.  That gives you the ability to send a star,  but it also means you can send them a newspaper or a turd or whatever.  Right.  But it doesn't have the same...  It doesn't save them as something that's been...  It doesn't have that added functionality.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although you could do a search, right?  Twitter's search is not good at finding emoji.  That is the slight drawback.  What's really interesting is that Twitter is not good at finding emoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter's search is not good at finding emoji.  That is the slight drawback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What you're heading toward, Kevin, is emoji tags.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, exactly.  I mean, you know the way...  I wrote an essay on this.  Just put it in the thing.  I will put it in the thing.  But the...  Do you use Slack?  I don't know if you guys use Slack.  I love Slack.  Yeah.  So Slack has a very clever thing with emoji reactions.  So you can respond to a post in Slack with an emoji.  And it'll put it underneath.  And if someone's response was different, it'll put it underneath.  And the other people can just click on those to vote.  So you can respond with two different emojis to say...  Slack is amazing.  Star or heartless.  I love it.  So the thing they've done there is they've actually compressed the like, star, heart dichotomy,  expanded that into a...  Could be any emoji.  But also can provide that with a voting mechanism that's better than Twitter's voting mechanism as well.  That's awesome.  So there's a...  The pattern there is very smart and worth...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stuart needs to take Slack and take over Twitter, become the next Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there was a post this week, somebody was in some percent test at Twitter where the heart was replaced with a pop-up of a choice of emoji.  So they're clearly testing this somewhere.  And it makes perfect sense.  But what I hope is that they do it that takes advantage of this existing flood of emoji that people are using in the classic way that they did with Hangul.  In the way that they did with hashtags and ats.  We're learning from what the users do rather than adding a thing on top that isn't really part of it the way they did with polls where the polls don't even show up in the plain text.  So if you're using anything else that parses Twitter apart from the clients that have been updated, because not all of them have been updated, the official ones, you don't see the polls.  You just see the question.  You don't see the possible answers, which is a design failure in their part of my part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a new idea for a show.  I think we should sit and watch until the this goes to a billion.  It's going to take a while.  It might. It's it's does as close as it looks.  Nine hundred ninety seven million three hundred two thousand one hundred and twenty four crying face emojis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we've got the time it would work out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yes, three million more to go, although it's going up fast.  But you're right.  It's we're days away.  Yes.  Probably longer than that.  Yeah.  Why is this card with a heart more popular than the heart?  So it depends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They look the same on iOS, I think.  Ah, it's those damn iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are two different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are two different houses.  So that one was supposed to be the suit and one was supposed to be the heart.  But they look the same on iOS.  And there are some.  Yeah. If you actually add up the various hearts, there are there are lots more hearts and actually the hearts do at a rank start.  So you can say Twitter maybe was doing data on this.  But then these different hearts and stars and faces do have different nuances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there is my favorite completely unintelligible emoji person raising both hands in celebration.  Yeah.  One hundred fifteen million eight hundred thirty one thousand four hundred twenty three uses.  The one two up from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The thumbs up.  The hands together.  No, the one above that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, that's culturally the thumbs up could mean a variety of different things.  The hands together.  Yeah.  The praying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The iOS one looks like high five, whereas actually it means it's supposed to be praying or namaste.  Right.  So and depending on we get into emoji dialects here.  So depending on what your emoji set looks like, these can these things look very different, which can be confusing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The semiotics of emojis next.  Yes.  On Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it is a fascinating thing that basically in the same way that we added hashtags and apps to Twitter to mean things.  Yeah.  Because that was that was what we had.  We now have this vocabulary of things that are being added to it and being used for all kinds of stuff.  And making sense of that was interesting.  And the Instagram guys did a bunch of data stuff on this to try and work out that what they basically did was correlate the emoji with words that people use to try and calculate the emoji.  To try and come up with a.  So if they co-occur a lot, then they assume it's a similar meaning.  And they did a bunch of posts on this.  So all they have is like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or Twitter have.  Or Twitter have is like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but all all Instagram has is a heart too.  No, but Instagram has comments.  Oh, but they have comments.  So.  I see what you're saying.  So they did analytics on the comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The comments are actually subsidiary to the post.  So in Twitter, the replies are a sort of a first order object.  When I reply to a post, I'm making a post too.  And it can stand alone.  Whereas Instagram, they're definitely subordinate.  So the comments are comments on the photograph or video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I decided to order a Blackberry Priv today so that I could type emojis faster.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's a.  I'm not sure the Priv makes you type faster, Leo.  I'll just go ahead and refer you to last night's All About Android.  Did you guys have a Priv there?  We had a typing contest.  So we had two Privs.  You did?  And then I had a Google keyboard on my 6P.  How did I miss this?  And Ron had a SwiftKey.  And we did a typing contest to Twitter.  And neither Priv entered the finals.  No kidding.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, SwiftKey is first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Priv is getting a lot of positive reviews all of a sudden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a secret option in SwiftKey.  There's a hidden option in SwiftKey.  You can make it suggest emoji when you type words.  Right.  I got to turn that on.  So turn that on.  That makes them quicker.  Well, I made a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I ordered a Priv.  I probably should have watched All About Android.  I left just as you were starting.  We need a Priv in the house.  You know the camera's f1.2?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  F1.2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a really fast camera.  Yeah.  With a Schneider Kreitzer lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I just stuck the Instagram emoji meaning post in the chat as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's an Instagram emoji for post?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So basically what they did was they did a bunch of data science where they looked at the, if you scroll down a bit, they looked at the emoji and saw what words and hashtags came with them.  And so what they found is that some of them are really obvious.  So yeah, crying laughing was the most popular one there as well.  And that clearly maps to various incoherent web expressions for laughing.  That's Edvard Munch's The Scream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why are they calling that anything but The Scream?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the official name of it is something else.  But isn't it The Scream?  So if you scroll down a little bit from that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  There's a middle word I love.  Wow.  This is really interesting.  There's quite a bit.  Deep machine learning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then they start doing translations.  And so they say basically these, what are these emoji correlated with?  So crying laughing is correlated with all incoherent expressions of laughter.  Whereas eyes with hearts is clearly lechery, misspelt beautiful and gorgeous and so on.  What is the deal with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Perf-huts.  Huts.  Bay.  Wow.  Yes.  So this is the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're trying to translate emoji to English.  I'm actually translating emoji into sort of strange post-English internet nonsense.  So heart is XOXO with various numbers of X's nos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  And moi.  And boubère.  I love you and babe and moi moi moi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So in a sense they are, you know, non-verbal expressions of emotion.  If they're actually correlated with these things then that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You both know Jonathan Harris's We Feel Fine?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is it?  Brilliant.  Jonathan went and used the word feel and feeling.  I'm feeling this.  I'm feeling that.  And did a brilliant-  Oh I remember that.  Yeah.  Graphic visualisation.  You could watch it in real time.  Yeah.  Right.  And it's a sense of correlating to other words like this but also age, time of year, time  of day and other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at the regular expression for matching variants of XOXO, OMG, moi, babe, bae, LOL,  HAHA and hee hee to make sure that you get all of the versions with multiple letters,  repeated letters in it.  That's an extra, there's a lesson and grep right there that's just fantastic.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love this article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is my, that's my kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it was fascinating to like, we're trying to match emoji to English and we don't actually  have any English, we just have more gibberish but we're trying really hard to run big data  science on people-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a tag cloud right there.  An emoji tag cloud.  Now really if they'd done it right they would have made the emojis that are most popular  bigger, right?  Yes.  I don't know what they're trying to accomplish here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well they're trying to say, they're trying to do a relaxation map of which ones co-occur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see.  So these all co-occur.  So you get facial reactions together, you get food together, and then you get clocks

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  together and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a great article.  It's came out last, four years ago, October 2011, Instagram engineering blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not what they wrote.  They wrote it more-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's more recent ones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is like last year I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is 2000 of-  Oh no, they're saying in October, I see you're right, this is only six months old.  So this is, they're saying Apple added the emoji keyboard to iOS in October 2011 and  so this is, that's when this all began.  In fact you can see the jump.  Here's where the iOS keyboard added emojis.  Here's when they launched on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there weren't emojis there so this is a percentage-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then Android stocked emoji keyboard.  So your best emoji keyboard on Android is SwiftKey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I use SwiftKey for everything but yeah, I like it in that it will, without setting  it'll suggest emoji for when I type words as well.  Yeah, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But not like a colon cry colon.  Like you're just typing a word and it says, you know, instead of using English you could  use an emoji.  Yeah.  Oh I love that.  Because I want to be like the kids.  K-I-D-Z-Z-Z.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or I use the beta.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Z-Z-Z-Z.  Z-Z-Z-Z.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, what else do you want to talk about?  But this is fun.  Oh Ethereum, we were going to talk about Ethereum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh actually, I want to talk about Instagram because I've just said nice things about it  because they just announced.  They closed their API.  They killed, they're shutting down their APIs.  Which is annoying because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're pulling a Twitter.  They're basically harming the third party ecosystem that uses their read only API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so and you know, I'm, I've kind of got a dog in this fight which was that I wrote  a thing that made a web view for Instagram in 2012 before they had one.  And mine was a sort of a joke where it gave you a Pinterest flavored view of Instagram.  And that has stopped working recently.  I need to go and give you the key.  But it's exactly, if I read the list of things I don't want people doing, it's exactly this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come June, if you are doing for instance an Instagram gallery, it's bye bye.  It will allow apps, third party apps that add like their own apps that add frames or  titles or things like that to Instagram images and then send it back to Instagram.  They'll allow those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they still won't let you post.  I mean you've never been able to post.  It's a read only API, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yes, I think, yeah.  But yes, it was, I don't think you can post comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but you could, but you could, you could get the stream.  Now it will only be your stream.  You can only get your stream.  That's the chief switch is you can't get anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  First, they're getting rid of the public.  Well, the two key things getting rid of the stream of things that you're subscribed to.  Right.  You can't get that anymore.  Right.  And you can't, you won't get the public.  You can search by tag and get public feeds by tag and by geolocation and so on.  And they're taking those away as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're doing this because there was a malicious third party app that people signed  up for was stealing their passwords.  That's their bad because they didn't use OAuth, right?  Yeah.  I mean, right.  If they had used OAuth, these third party apps wouldn't have access to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The API has OAuth, so I'm not sure what that's about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they should, you know, the simple fix, if that's what you're worried about is turning  off anything, any form of authentication except OAuth, right?  Oh, I guess you can't do that because, well, you could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can still scrape the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you can do, basically there's ways of doing this.  There are, I've got some tools that other people have written that you give it, you  go and fetch your quickie from the browser and give it to the tool and it then logs in  looking like you and pulls stuff out of the website for you, which can be very useful.  So stopping that would be harder.  And to some extent, if you take away the official API for this, that will be the only way to  get my feed out of Instagram.  So that's, they're going to actually encourage more people to do those kinds of hacks.  So there's a bad trade off there, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But come June of next year, you will see the apps I've been using, because for instance,  there's no Instagram iPad app.  So I've been using a really excellent program called Retrogram that lets me view my Instagram  feed on an iPad in a very nice way.  That's going to be broken.  That won't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I wrote one of my rants about people thinking the iPad and iPhone were completely  just different things and this was a massive design flaw and use Instagram as an example.  And I wrote that like three years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Zuckerberg said the iPad is not a mobile device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's like, Instagram still haven't fixed that.  If you want to browse Instagram on the iPad, you have to use the web version.  It's ridiculous.  Ethereum.  Explain it to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I can't give you a...  He can't do anything right now.  He's frozen solid.  There we go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You thought blockchain, bitcoin was confusing?  Well, we've decided to make it more confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let me see if I can, in a layman's form, describe what's going on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The kind of one of the central keys of making bitcoin more secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me see if I can, in a layman's form, describe what's going on here.  The kind of one of the central keys of making bitcoin work was this ability to have a decentralized  authentication system, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  I mean, basically it's a public-private key system.  So it's like PGP.  To use bitcoin, you have to have a public-private key pair.  So if you're using a bitcoin client, you've generated one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To give people money in their bitcoin wallet, you need their public key.  To access your own bitcoin wallet, you need your private key.  That's sensible.  Anybody who's used PGP or any other form of encryption understands that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if you use bitcoin...  So that's if you use an actual bitcoin client, but there are proxies that let you use bitcoin,  which is where people have lost most of their money on bitcoin because there are things...  That's complicated.  We'll give you a website that lets you buy bitcoin and we'll store it handily on our  servers for you and you won't have to worry about this.  And then it all vanishes overnight somewhere.  The price of bitcoin crashes for a couple of decades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's not really blockchain because blockchain is more than just that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the point of the blockchain...  I'm sure I can get the description of the blockchain.  So the blockchain is a register of who has which bitcoins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a decentralized central bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well it's kind of decentralized.  Transaction log.  It's basically every bitcoin client has a copy of the entire chain.  And when you want to do a transaction with bitcoin, you send your transaction in signed  with your private key saying, I want to transact this and feed that into the system.  The miners then construct a block of transactions put together and then they do the math brute  force nonsense to generate the signature to say, this is the new block.  And they're competing to do that.  So in parallel, there are millions of variations on a theme being generated that contain some  of these transactions.  When someone actually solves a puzzle and gets enough zeros in the hash, then here's  a block you can build on top of that.  As that percolates through the system, eventually everyone will start building on that block.  And each block has to contain a hash of the previous blocks.  So therefore it is all hashed back to the beginning.  So each one is provably in sequence after those.  But the actual sequence is speculative until this is locked down.  The miners are fighting over that.  And so the transaction time is not just one block time, which is 10 minutes, but to be  sure your transaction has actually gone through, you have to wait several blocks to be on top  of it.  So unwinding it is too expensive to redo.  So that's the sort of the principle of Bitcoin and how it's centralized.  It's basically there are miners burning computer power to try and find the key that others  will accept and therefore they will get the coins, the minted coins for generating that  transaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this can be used for much more than money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it also means that everyone who is using Bitcoin directly has to have a copy of the  entire blockchain.  Which is not good, because how big is that?  It's growing.  It's a few gigs.  Yeah.  So and it's growing by a fixed amount every 10 minutes, growing by a meg every 10 minutes.  And there's a fight going on that they're saying we need to make the block size bigger  so we can get more transaction and otherwise it's going to overflow.  And there's all kinds of stuff going on like that.  So that's the sort of the core Bitcoin thing.  Now there's other bits and pieces inside Bitcoin that let you do.  So the basic thing is a register of who has which Bitcoin.  But you can also put some information in those blocks as well.  So people said oh we can use this as a public database that everyone shares that stores  this information.  It's like well you can, but you're requiring every user to store that information.  So if you start uploading stuff into that, that's going to be annoying.  It's not very efficient.  You're basically using space for that data that could be used for other transactions.  So you're in some ways effectively undermining the system and costing people money there.  And so there are these various sidechains ideas that what they put into the blockchain  is a sort of marker for the state of this other database that's out there.  So it can be verified by the blockchain that that thing has been updated, but it's updated  by a different mechanism.  So I think it goes.  I haven't poked into it in great depth.  And part of its goal is to let you have programmable transactions in it so you can set things up  that will trade under certain rules.  So you can build your own rule based things in it.  I have not played with this enough to understand it because it's like a bunch of extra work  you have to do to do this.  The challenge it has is the same as the challenge of Bitcoin is that it's mostly a user experience  problem, which is actually using these things is annoying and fiddly and hard.  And when you try and simplify it, because it's trying to do these complicated crypto  things, and when you try and simplify that for normal people, then you have to leave  those stages out.  And then they're not actually getting security that they thought they were.  And that's been the continuous battle with Bitcoin and blockchain ongoing.  So I spent a chunk of time understanding this last year, and I haven't spent as much time  on it this year.  So things will have changed since I did that.  But my question was, this actually has a bunch of awkward failure modes that make it unlikely  to do well, one of which is it is actually very hard to use and it's intrinsically hard  to use.  It's very hard to build an alternative to Bitcoin because the miners exist in the Bitcoin  realm.  They have rooms full of machines that can brute force hashes.  So you can't build a separate blockchain using the same model because they will brute force  you instantly and take over your blockchain because the amount of compute power needed  for the Bitcoin blockchain is now so high that any other one you do can be swamped instantly  by it unless you end up using some different method they can't accelerate yet.  But then you're basically getting into that arms race.  The other thing is that there's a lack of decentralization there in that it is centralized  by the cartels of people who have rooms full of hash cracking machines.  The other centralization point is that they need to be running the same code or very close  to the same code to actually interoperate and have this make sense.  So the politics of changing code has been complicated and that's where the fight over  block size has been going on.  So there what you see is effectively different contributors to an open source project arguing  over the direction of that project and that sort of reveals again that there's a small  number of people who decide on the direction of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So.  So someone in the chat is giving us a nice one sentence summary of what Ethereum actually is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should I read that?  Jams says, Ethereum is a combination of blockchain database, decentralized storage with incentives  for storage providers, decentralized massaging with incentives and smart contracts to program  its biggest logic.  It is a decentralized finance system on AWS.  Meanwhile, T-Mobile is writing a manual on how to f up the internet.  I love this.  Thank you for writing this article in the verge TC Sadiq.  Because I think we, you know, mentioned this and a lot of people celebrated T-Mobile's  announcement of Bin John.  This is the ability to watch as much video as you want on some selected networks without  going against your bandwidth cap.  That includes of course Netflix, HBO, ESPN, Showtime, but not YouTube.  And as TC points out, this is exactly what people were worried about without net neutrality  is that incumbents like T-Mobile would get to decide who has a free and fast lane to  you and who doesn't.  And we talked about this at length on the twit on Sunday with Jeff.  So I won't go over this again too much.  We've got to apply and see if they would let us in.  I guess that would reassure me a little bit.  I worry a little more about the next Netflix and how they're going to fare because of course,  if you've got free bandwidth on Netflix, why would you look at the next Netflix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing you raised is that on twit is that this makes trying to fight for net neutrality  really hard and really hard to explain people.  I can't get free use of Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you doing to me?  Yeah, this is not my interest.  This net neutrality thing means I don't get free Netflix.  And I understand that people are mad.  We love Bin John.  So sometimes it's hard to explain why this is not in your interest, even though it appears  to be, which is probably exactly what T-Mobile is hoping.  Vik Kondutra has gotten a new job.  He was the guy who championed Google Plus, then left Google.  He's a long time Microsoft employee, went to Google, left Google after Larry Page stepped  upstairs into Alphabet.  Actually we have before then, but I think he saw the writing on the wall.  He's now announced he's going to go to work for an interesting company that makes an electrocardiogram  for iPhones.  It actually is FDA approved, which is interesting.  So it's a smartphone connected heart monitor from a company called AliveCore.  And he'll be the new CEO there.  A bunch of shorties.  Here's some really good news.  Amazon has announced two step verification.  I don't know why it took them so long.  I didn't see that.  But you know, we've always advocated that if a company offers two step to use it, Google  does of course.  So does Facebook, so does Twitter.  Amazon kind of late to the party, but better late than never.  I have to set it up, I haven't set it up, but I'm going to turn it on.  But I don't want to do that on screen because it might give away some of my personal information.  But it will require you to enter a unique security code in addition to your password.  You go to your account.  I guess I can show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can use like Authy against all these, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Authy or Google Authenticator.  They specifically mentioned Google Authenticator.  But if it's a Google Authenticator, that means Authy will work too, because that's the standard  for authentication.  Go to your account, change account settings, edit, advanced security settings, and get  started.  Good.  You can add a backup phone number, which I think is a good idea, so that they can text  you security codes.  You can also use an Authenticator app if you wish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now for you guys, do you use mobile bank apps and do any of them use two step?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do.  Oh yeah, all of them.  All of them that I've used do.  I use USAA, Chase, and Bank of America, and all of them have fairly sophisticated authentication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't tend to use them.  You don't use them?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My wife handles all that.  Oh, aren't you lucky.  You have a CEO.  I have a wife as well, and she pays the bills and all that, because she knows if she left  it in my hands.  Exactly.  It'd be the end of the world.  It was almost.  I can't tell you how many times the power was turned off, the water was turned off.  Oh, I think I forgot to pay that.  Netflix is launching an open source project ready for Amazon Google Clouds.  Additional deployment support for Microsoft Azure, actively underway.  It's called Spinnaker, and I guess it's a replacement for Netflix Asgard, which they  use to manage AWS resources.  Hmm.  Don't know if you'll be able to use it, but if you want it, it's on GitHub.  That's something we would use probably, an open source, multi-cloud, continuous delivery  platform for releasing software changes with high velocity and confidence.  Thank you for open sourcing it, I guess.  That's what I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey Jason, have you heard anything about a date for Pixel C?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want it so bad.  No, I've heard nothing lately that has any sort of information about that.  Come on, Google, send us an XSC.  And it would be weird if we got into December and we still hadn't heard about it, it seems like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said by Christmas, by the holidays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't heard anything official though about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Having now used the iPad Pro for a week, it's too damn big.  It really is too big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a step back to the classic iPad where you have to have a sofa to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm going to send one to my mom for Christmas because she's an artist and she loves to draw.  I think she would get a lot out of it.  So for some people it makes perfect sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, in the same way that the big iPad, it took Apple a while to realize that an iPad this size was a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Didn't it?  Remember we all loved 7-inch iPads.  Or 7-inch tablets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because the 7-inch tablet is a perfect form factor for something you can use with one hand while on public transit,  which no Apple engineer does, so they didn't think of it.  But the big iPad has a lot of value in that it is a very, very high resolution screen and is very good for stuff where you've got high data density.  So it is good for reading scientific papers and doing data fears.  And the pen thing is, from what I've seen from people who have experienced with it, they like it a lot.  They've got the latency down very low and the pressure thing seems to work.  So people are getting very nice drawing effects compared to the surface stuff that Microsoft has, which hasn't quite closed that loop to the same degree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Makes me wish that I were an artist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's, yeah, you know, it's a weird product because of the price point.  So it's like the price of a large number of Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take a break when we come back.  Some tips, some predictions, some numbers, whatever, you know, whatever back of the book material you'd like to throw in.  But first a word for those of you on PagerDuty.  Don't hate the pager, man. Hate the game.  No, don't hate the. Yeah, that's it.  Or another way to put it is your sass on the line.  PagerDuty is an operations performance platform.  You know, you know what it is.  It's it's something that will get alerts to the right engineer at the right time.  The person on, you know, on call on PagerDuty.  But because they've added some really nice features, it does more.  It lets you increase the uptime of your apps, of your servers, of your websites and databases.  How does it work? Well, let me explain.  PagerDuty connects all your systems into a single view.  You can see critical events across all your monitoring tools, not just, you know, PagerDuty, but Nagios, New Relic, Keynote, App Dynamics.  They've got APIs that will work with anything.  And and they have 100 ready to use integrations out there.  When an incident occurs, PagerDuty notifies the right team and the right member based upon on call schedules.  It's smart. It knows who's on call right now.  And does it in the way that team member prefers personalized alerting preferences.  And then if an alert is missed, PagerDuty automatically escalates to another team member and continues to do so until it's responded to.  This is this is just what you need.  Alerts can be dispatched by on by everything.  Of course, text and pagers.  Yes, some people still use pagers, but also automated phone calls, email push notifications.  You can resolve an instance on the go.  You can live your life. Yes, Slack uses PagerDuty.  Everybody uses PagerDuty. Boeing uses PagerDuty.  Decrease the noise.  Incidents are delivered automatically filtered and deduped so that only actionable alerts are delivered.  I love that you don't get 18 alerts from the same for the same problem.  And now here's where it can help you improve your performance.  They have analytic tools that will identify common problems.  So you can proactively make system improvements and prevent future outlet outages.  So if you're on PagerDuty, you want the boss to get this.  It'll mean you get fewer calls, fewer alerts.  And of course, needless to say, PagerDuty is relentless when it comes to reliability.  Fully distributed, multiple data centers, multiple hosting providers, multiple contact method providers for every method.  You're not going to miss an alert.  And of course, you can customize it to fit how your team works.  Microsoft uses it. GitHub uses it.  Nike, Pinterest, Box, Slack. They all use it.  HipChat.  I want you to use it. Visit PagerDuty.com slash twit.  Sign up for a 14 day trial. Tell your boss, whoever's in charge of this, that it's going to make their life better.  It's going to make your life better.  And it's as little as $19 a month.  PagerDuty.com slash twit.  And we thank PagerDuty.  PagerDuty.  Kevin, you already mentioned it, but you got a thing here.  The Indie Webcamp coming up. Second anniversary.  First of all, congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's nice.  Anything else you want to plug away at?  You're always full of wonderful stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was thinking about that.  What else do you like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been using your InstaWeather watch face. I love that.  Sorry.  Yeah, we have a little light.  It is good, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's been really useful recently because we've had these sudden bursts of rain.  I was looking at my watch going, oh, right. I need to take the umbrellas down.  There's rain coming tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I gave him some money. I thought this was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the things we're working on with Indie Web at the moment is,  I was saying, be able to do stuff on your own site and be able to translate it to and from the other sites.  What often ends up with that is we end up moving things between sites that they can't do themselves.  Right.  One example of that is Own Your Gram, which is...  I know. I'm so sad.  Is he going to be hurt by this?  I don't think...  Own Your Gram, which actually is my Instagram.com, is you sign in with your Instagram account.  Then when you take a photograph, it will post it to your own blog.  I've been using this on my known site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It will work on known, and you can make it work with others using silo.pub,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  which is a bridge that will translate Indie Web into Blogger and Tumblr and so on.  By combining these two things, by using Own Your Gram and then using silo.pub with Twitter,  you can get your Instagrams to post as Twitter as photographs,  which is something that they don't do because they're fighting with each other.  But by translating back and forth through Indie Web, we can bridge that through.  The next thing that we're looking at in the moving photographs between sites is,  we showed you the Swap Zero demo a while back where we had the ability to tag people on your own website  and other people discover it on their own websites and work through that.  We're now working on combining that model of tagging people in photographs with the silo websites,  so the ability to tag somebody on my website and have that propagate to Facebook or to Instagram  and then have that spread to other sites.  So that's actively being hacked on at the moment in the Indie Web group.  I think we may have some of that working tonight at Homebrew.  We should have demos of that by Indie Webcamp in December.  The point of this is continuing this process of what are the things we're trying to do,  how do we do them for ourselves, how do we do that for the community,  and how do we do that for the community to be able to do that for the community.  What are the things we're trying to do, how do we do them for ourselves in the simplest way possible,  and then how do we bridge those back and forth between the places that our friends are already.  We've seen that with the...  Known is a great example of this.  Known posting to Twitter is very transparent, and the replies come back to you,  so you can sit there and post back and forth.  Another one is the Indie reader Woodwind that I use.  That has the ability to like and retweet and star,  or I suppose now should be hard, posts,  and therefore that propagates to my site and can potentially propagate back out to other sites as well.  So there's this sort of confluence of these different pieces plugging together,  and at the moment there are some configurations set up to plug these pieces together,  so there is some overhead that, but that's getting simpler with time.  So there is a lot going on with that, and it's worth looking at it.  Even if you have your own WordPress site or other sites like that,  we've got a series of plugins and things that help you put this stuff together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it, and I'm a fan.  Indiewebcamp.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, and also the other one I will mention is IndieWebify.me,  and what that one does is it walks you through, if you've got your own site,  marking it up so that more web staff on your site can interoperate with the IndieWeb staff.  So it walks you through the different pieces of marking your site up so you can log in,  adding the ability to mark your posts up so they show up as replies and so on.  Basically, you put your URLs in, and it says,  okay, you've got this thing, you haven't got this thing, you've got this thing, you haven't got this thing.  If you put known in it, it'll say, oh, you've got all these things.  If you put WordPress in, it'll say, you've got some of this,  but here's the things you can change to improve this and so on.  So it's sort of incrementally helping you test out these pieces as we add them.  This is great.  The trouble with own your gram is, the other thing that Instagram has said is,  you can't use the word gram in the name of your product.  So everyone is going to have to own your gram and paste the gram and what else,  even if they can keep them running, which is kind of annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at that.  I'm not getting your feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I pulled it out by accident.  So this is something that IndieWeb really needed, which was just kind of like a tester.  Yes.  I really like this.  And then just a place to find out how to do these various things,  the rel.me and all that stuff.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this site was actually built a couple of years ago,  but it's just been updated recently and now more people can edit it.  So we're hopefully making this better over time.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  IndieWebify.me.  I have a couple of things.  You probably saw that.  Well, let's start with your number, Jeff, and then I'll do mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK.  I found this interesting.  Forbes, a Forbes staffer, said that out of the 500 companies and the S&P 500,  five companies have collective returns that account for more  than the entire return of the index year to date.  Amazon, Alphabet, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and there's an odd one in there, General Electric.  Without them, the S&P would be down 2.2% this year.  Instead, it's virtually flat at 0.1%.  Interesting.  And that's how important those stocks are to our perception of how the economy is doing.  Very interesting.  I found that interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I have a number, too.  Do you mind if I step on your numbers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Please do.  I'm done now with my numbers.  They're all free for grabbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a number.  That is the value of asset forfeiture recoveries by U.S. authorities from 1989 to 2010,  and they've been going up 19.5% a year.  This is the civil asset forfeiture law that allows law enforcement to confiscate assets  even without an arrest or criminal charge.  And I don't know, remember the Good Wife where there was a guy patrolling a particular corridor of road  because drug dealers were often driving.  He didn't patrol the northbound, just the southbound.  This northbound was the drug dealers coming back with the drugs.  The southbound was them driving down to get the drugs, and they had all their cash.  And so he made sure he made those arrests and took the cash.  It is a huge source of profit for police departments.  In 2008, law enforcement took $1.5 billion.  In 2014, $4.5 billion.  But get this, and this is the headline.  According to the FBI, victims of burglary offenses in 2014 lost $3.9 billion in property losses.  You're losing more money to law enforcement now  than to all U.S. burglars combined.  Jesus.  John Oliver did that on Last Week Tonight, so you might want to watch that episode.  More money due to civil asset forfeiture to law enforcement.  It's become a profit center for law enforcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Talk about a moral hazard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  More than in all burglaries combined.  Fine, and those numbers come from the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI.  I'm not making them up.  That's just stunning.  Anyway, I'll leave you...  Oh, I have one more thing, and actually I got this on Google+, but I like it.  You know, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, UFC, they have a problem  because the fights tend to be short, easily jiffable.  And so they've really had to go on Twitter and do takedowns  because people are posting basically the entire fight in animated gifs on their Twitter feed.  And the money, of course, is from the pay-per-view, but why watch a pay-per-view?  So this was a big shock.  Rousey, who is the queen of Ultimate Fighting Championship, got taken down in 52 seconds by home.  You can't post the video, but I can show you, somebody made a Street Fighter edition  of the Rousey versus home fight.  Any audio?  Well, you don't really need the audio. I think you'll enjoy it.  This is a reenactment.  A reenactment of the fight, and in fact it only took 52 seconds.  She's out. Oh, not quite. Wait a minute. One more time.  And... boom.  And if you paid $90 for the pay-per-view, my son watches UFC.  I don't watch it, but he says, no, it's worth it.  It's worth it because you got the lead up and you got all the excitement.  Thank you, Richie Branson, for creating that video.  I mentioned it on Twitter, the Google car getting stopped for driving too slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just think we have to have that for the record here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just for completeness?  So the self-driving car apparently is limited.  They don't want to scare people. It's limited to 25 miles an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's actually a golf cart, isn't it?  Yeah.  They don't want to scare people. It's very expensive.  Yeah, if you don't see it going around 50 miles an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So apparently it was driving around Mountain View, holding up traffic in a 35-mile-an-hour zone.  So a Mountain View Police Department officer pulled it up.  The officer noticed traffic backing up behind a slow-moving car in the eastbound lane.  The officer stopped the car, made contact with the operators to learn more about how it was choosing speeds along certain roadways  and to educate officers about impeding traffic.  There wasn't a driver, but fortunately there was a passenger who explained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There were a lot of peeved Tesla drivers behind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, get out of the way! Get out of the way! I can't! I'm not driving!  The officer decided not to write a ticket after explaining the rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the picture is just so great to have.  There's no one driving!  You would think they would have given an orientation to Mountain View cops since it's in Mountain View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or just stay off the higher-speed streets.  Yeah. But it's like 22 miles an hour is the maximum speed for that?  Twenty-five, and they were in a 35-mile-an-hour zone, which means in Mountain View people were driving 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People as grandma.  Some of the Mountain View streets are narrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're flashing their lights, they're honking their horn.  Move over! Move over! I can't! I'm not driving!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you guys watch The Good Wife this weekend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I heard it was about self-driving cars. I have to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm still binge-watching into season four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm back in season four too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I savor it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Me too. That's why I'm not done with it.  But it's also an easy-going show.  So after we've watched Daredevil and Sensate, and we just finished Fargo season one.  Oh, season one? Yeah, that was fun.  Oh my God.  So after we watch all that ultraviolence, we like to watch something relaxing.  Like Walking Dead.  Yeah, The Good Wife. No zombies, no woodchippers, no hamburger grinders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But also quite a lot of tech.  Yes, it's very smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't Ridley Scott's son do that show? I think so.  Yeah, it's Scott Productions.  Yeah, it's him and his son.  So it is. They talk about Snowden stuff and encryption.  By the way, we don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So last week was about hacking-related stuff, and this week was about self-driving cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's very... I love it.  Ripped from the headlines, as they used to say.  There is.  But used intelligently, Don.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree.  There's CSI Cyber, which is just like ripped from the headlines and made into nonsense.  Right.  Whereas this is actually... there's a complicated legal issue here, and we've got to explore it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a smart show, which I really enjoy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know what I want. I want a Chum Hum... I just put it on the rundown.  A Chum Hum t-shirt for Christmas. That's what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chum Hum is the Facebook clone that is prominent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Facebook or Google, or I'm not sure. It's kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a large tech company.  It's a client of one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A Chum Hum t-shirt.  This week in Chum Hum.  I wouldn't mind a Hoolie t-shirt.  I got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, nice.  I went to the Four Square...  Lazard Four Square Conference, and they have a goody bag, which in the old days was a heck of a goody bag.  Got DVD players and all kinds of...  Now you get t-shirts for fictional companies.  But I got a Hoolie t-shirt.  Which I'm now... we're already for Jake.  I said this would be a good...  Oh, Jake.  I'm talking stuff for Jake, but my wife said, no, it's a white t-shirt.  He'll never wear a white t-shirt.  I said, I don't know. It's a Hoolie t-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Hoolie. It's pretty good.  It's a Hoolie t-shirt.  We could talk a little bit about encryption after in the wake of France.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I did my bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was on or I will be on on Friday, the Bill Handel show.  We pre-recorded it on KFI in Los Angeles, number one morning show in Los Angeles.  And he says, you know, what are we going to do?  The terrorists are using encryption.  And by the way, Jake just signed up for Telegram.  I'm getting a lot more action on Telegram all of a sudden, because it's one of the three apps that police speculate.  Maybe, possibly the terrorists use Telegram, WhatsApp and Threema.  Threema is of the three, the truly most secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they're also speculating that they use PlayStation 4.  Also speculation, because they don't know.  They don't actually know because they captured some this weekend, haven't they?  Yeah.  They got their cell phones.  Evidence trail is difficult.  I'm just waiting for the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, we got their cell phones.  But thanks, Apple.  We can't find out what's on them.  They're just scapegoating encryption.  Well, we've had this.  This is going on at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The UK is trying to pass the snoopers charter, which is there every week.  Right.  In a wonderfully Brazil-like touch, they said, oh, and your ISP bills will have to go up to pay for the data retention that we're requiring them to do.  Because we're not going to pay the ISPs to do that.  It's like, wait, you're making us pay more to retain data.  It's a spy on us.  And you also have GCHQ and the cable taps and all the data you've already got.  Yeah.  And that was like, hmm.  But yeah, but they were quick to shroud wave and say that these attacks were the fault of these encrypted systems because they want to pass laws that make no actual sense.  They have literally said they want to have a system that's going to be able to do that.  And they have they have literally said they want to have a way to to break encryption as a legal requirement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And incidentally, this story just breaking on the intercept from Dan Frumkin, signs point to unencrypted communications between terrorist subjects.  Yeah.  Suspects. Now we're going to have to ban unencrypted communications.  That's the real what's really going on is, oh, we didn't we didn't do anything about it.  And let's we need something to blame quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm afraid some of our presidential candidates will allow Christians to have encrypted conversation.  Only Christians can have encrypted conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, the thing is, it's like there are lots of ways to have secret conversations where they're like being in the same room without my crones in it.  What are we going to do about that?  You know, there's there's book key ciphers.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, just a goodography and all the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The terrorists planned the attack with emojis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that was one of the nonsense stories.  It was like they picked up the communicator using PS4 and said they could be communicating by laying out coins on the ground in Mario.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, they could.  Yes, they could be doing that.  They could be bouncing signals off the moon as well.  It's like, OK, you know, there is an official chum hum T-shirt, by the way, available at the CBS store.  If you it's not as good as the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Say again.  So Douglas Adams, I should get the exact quote so that I introduce him.  But basically, he said, there's all this this fuss and worry that broadcasters say that this crime was banned, was planned on over the Internet.  And they said in such a way as if it's a it's a scary thing.  Planned on the Internet.  It says the thing is, you could say the same thing about it was planned over a cup of tea.  Right.  But somehow they don't doesn't mean we want to ban tea.  Damn you, Internet.  Damn you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is a professor of the Internet and you'll find him teaching at CUNY.  Yes, I found the exact quote.  Hang on.  It's I don't think anybody would argue now that the Internet isn't becoming a major factor in our lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  However, it's very new to us.  Newsreaders still feel it is worth a special and rather worrying mention of the Internet.  It's a mention when criminals use the telephone or the M4 or discuss their dastardly plans over a cup of tea.  Each of those was new and controversial in their day.  Yeah.  This is Douglas Adams from 1999, which is 1999.  One of the best things he's written.  Love him.  Jeff Jarvis, thank you.  Thank you.  Buzz machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, thank you.  Thank you.  Buzz machine.com.  We'll see you back here next Wednesday.  Sorry, I was gone for two weeks.  We missed you, but we're so glad you're back.  And we had him on Twitter too because we missed him so much.  Kevin Marks, we love having you on too.  Just always, always great.  Thank you.  You can find Kevin at kevinmarks.com and indywebcam.com.  Oh, this was his article, How to Stop Worrying and Love the Internet.  I remember that.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's worth reading.  This is 16 years old now, but it's spot on.
