It's time for Twig this week in Google, the show that covers everything Google, which  means everything the internet.  Kind of a dry, dry week for Google, but we'll try to make the best of it.  Joining us, I'm filling in for Leo Laporte, by the way, who's in France.  So joining us as usual, unlike me, Gina Trapani from Smarterwear.org.  Hey Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hello, hello.  Christmas came early for Twig this week.  I know.  Very excited.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Packed with stuff.  Also with us, of course, Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com.  How you doing, Jeff?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm not pink yet.  I will be as the sun sets here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you look human this week, which is good.  That's a good thing.  Kind of.  And also joining us, Kevin Purdy from Lifehacker.com.  How's it going, Kevin?  Hello.  Greetings from RIT.  I'm happy to be on Twig with you guys.  Thanks for letting me join along with you.  Let's start with, I don't know, where do we start?  Let's start with the big one, right?  The Chrome OS announcement from yesterday.  This was long and got more interesting as it went on.  They started by going over Chrome's browser, which I think, I don't know, do you guys agree  the biggest thing there was Crank Shaft being added to the V8 JavaScript engine?  I didn't hear anything that was entirely new otherwise.  Was I missing something?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That was about it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, basically, Chrome is really fast.  Chrome is getting faster.  A lot of people are using Chrome.  That was the summary.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  And security.  They did a big security thing, which is nothing new for them either.  The whole sandboxing of different things.  The Google Chrome Web Store was also unveiled.  That was new.  It's a curated web store with apps that can work offline.  You go in and you install an app in Chrome.  You can access the store from other browsers, but you have to be in Chrome to take advantage  of the apps.  They are HTML5 apps.  Payments won't be integrated until Q1 in the United States, but you can go check it out,  chrome.google.com slash web store.  What's the opinion across the board here?  Let's hear from everyone.  Do we need a web app store?  Because it's a little different than an app store on a phone.  Maybe, maybe not.  Jeff, what do you think?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sure, we do.  Sure, absolutely.  I think Microsoft, as I think they said at the presentation, Microsoft was nice enough  to provide an app for the web.  Listen, at some point does the web, Wired said the web was killed by apps.  I don't think that's true.  Is it killed by new devices?  I don't really think so.  But I think that the idea that I can buy anything there, my son, who's a developer up here in  Rochester, was asking him last night, I think it's a new place for developers to write.  It's a new place to earn some money.  to get new kinds of variety and apps for the web itself that can go far beyond what a mobile  device can do.  Sure, I can't wait.  What do you think, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think that when I started to use it, I thought, well, this kind of just seems like glorified  bookmarks.  But what it really is about is just discoverability, right?  Like, Google needs to show consumers what they can do on the web.  Like, yet they were asserting that you can do anything on the web that you can do in  a native app, which was quite, quite an assertion, I thought.  I'm not sure I totally agree.  But they need a place to show people, hey, if you want to listen to online radio, here's  where you go.  If you need to edit an image, if you need to create an org chart, if you need a web  app or a text editor, and all those things are in the Chrome web store.  So while on one hand, they felt like, ah, this is a little underwhelming, on the other,  it was like, this makes complete sense because Chrome OS needs to have a place to install  stuff and needs to be able to show, convince consumers that you can just work on the web.  So absolutely needed, I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Two out of three agree so far.  Kevin, you would make it anonymous or unanimous?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Yeah, I really like the web store.  It caught a lot of flack from a lot of snarky corners for being basically like Gina said,  you know, like, oh, I click Gmail and then I get a link to Gmail in the browser.  That doesn't seem all that great.  But they've figured out a way to make offline apps really much more convenient than Google  Gears was, which was the predecessor.  Google Docs is going to come back with offline capability, which is great.  I think it's just a really cool way to show people, you know, what's really capable in  a browser, if nothing else.  Maybe not everything right now is a slam dunk, but it shows you what is possible and where  it's headed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was one of those snarky corners.  You're talking about it first.  No, I looked at it and I said, well, this is just a really nice portal.  Why do I need an app store or call it an app store for something that's just a directory  to sites on the Internet?  Because that's all these apps really are, except for the offline.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let me ask you, Tom, at some point, don't you get the successor to Microsoft Word as  an app that you'll have an account with?  And it's your portal to that and to your little corner of the cloud with the functionality  there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've got Google.  I type docs.google.com in.  Why do I need to install an app?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  When we get to HTML, we get to fancier things.  Maybe I'm completely full of crap that's happened before.  It's the discoverability for sure, I think.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Just finding this.  I ran a blog that Kevin's at right now that for years, 90% of it was just like, hey, look  at this cool web app.  So now the store is just an entry point for people who don't know about, well, most people  know about docs.google.com, but a lot of people don't know about Aviary or that Tweet  Tech has a web-based client or that kind of thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If it was just a cool directory of places to go on the web to do cool web app stuff,  then I would get that.  I think the installation and the idea of treating it as if they're independent applications  is what I was getting hung up on until something you said, Gina, which was the idea of it being  the app engine for Chrome OS.  Once they started showing Chrome OS, it all made perfect sense to me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what it's all about.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  There are apps in the app store right now that only work on Chrome OS networks.  Like Google Talk, you actually can't install in the standard Chrome browser, oddly enough.  So they're definitely holding some stuff back until Chrome OS really gets out there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That was the final part of their announcement was Chrome OS, which is essentially Chrome  browser running on a thin operating system.  They're touting the quick setup, the instant resume, the ability to sync with other devices  so you pick up a Chrome OS, you log into your Google account and that is your machine.  It has all your apps, all your data.  Everything is stored in the cloud and other people can do the same.  They're talking about the security of that and how it's protected from somebody finding  your data that way.  Then I thought the killer was when they started talking about the built-in data.  So they've partnered with Verizon here to give you 100 megabytes free data every month.  But at least if you have a Chrome OS device with 3G built in, you have some data that  you can get without paying anything, a la a Kindle, even though there's a cap on it,  and then you pay for the rest of it.  It is a freemium model, isn't it?  Which is like, hey, you get enough to get by for free, but if you really want to make  better use of it, you pay.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  That really makes it the device you can take anywhere because I mean, literally, even if  you're the huge cheapskate and you don't want to pay a dime for data, you can always  send that emergency email.  Or if you use services like Google Voice, you can always send that emergency text, email  that emergency document.  It's really cool to have something in your backpack that can always get online whenever.  That's part of the big appeal, I'm assuming.  Question for you guys.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's the requirement for being able to work offline?  Does each app need to be written differently?  Does your data store differently?  How is that going to work?  Or can I take any app with any data and be able to use it offline?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure that your app has to be written in such a way that it takes advantage of HTML5's  offline storage capabilities.  All apps, just any app won't work with it.  It has to be kind of HTML-ified from what I understand.  I haven't actually done this myself, but that's what I understand.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That makes sense because there are HTML5 sites right now that you can't just save to your  desktop and use offline, but there are some you can.  In fact, there are some cool apps for phones where it's not an app.  You just save it.  There's a whole marketplace for those kind of apps.  That's an independent app store where it's just HTML5 sites that you save as bookmarks  and they run inside of the bookmark.  You don't have to actually be connected.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, and they take advantage of the offline storage, just storing inside the browser,  storing data inside the browser.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Has everyone signed up for the Chrome OS pilot program?  Twice.  Yep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Twice.  Me too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I signed up during the announcement as he was talking.  I was frantically going over to the website.  It's google.com slash chrome notebook.  You sign up if you're part of a business or you may already be signed up through your  they have a few partners that they're doing it with.  And then there were people who signed up on the Facebook page with this QR code that get  sucked in.  They had no idea they were going to do this.  And then if you sign up and you can apply at google.com slash chrome notebook, what  they'll do is send you a netbook called the CR 48.  It's a play on an isotope of chromium.  It's 12 inch display, full size keyboard, 3G dual band Wi-Fi, eight hours of active  battery, eight days standby webcam.  No caps lock key though, even though it's otherwise a full keyboard and no function  keys either, but also no hard drives.  It's all solid state and you'll be able to play around if you're selected with Chrome  OS in advance.  I was kind of snarky during the coverage.  Why is it almost four pounds?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Why is it four pounds?  That's a really good question.  I thought it would just be this really light, wonderful light thing that would beat the  air.  That's the whole advantage of being web only.  And you take all this stuff out of it and it's 3.78 pounds and it's big and ugly.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Unbranded though, a lot of people really like that.  It's totally almost just black tab that you carry around.  What is making it that heavy?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's got a solid state drive in it, so it's not a big old hard drive in there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We haven't seen a price for it.  Is it because it's just bigger, it's cheaper right now?  I haven't seen any pricing for it, have you?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They're not going to sell it.  It's just a prototype.  It's totally just a prototype.  Yeah, it's not going to be for sale at all.  I think it's only for the pilot program and for internal Google testing.  I didn't realize actually how heavy it was.  I thought it was interesting that on the CR48 site it said, we left out the caps lock key,  the function keys, the spinning hard drive and the lap burns.  So that felt like a little bit of a jab at Apple notebooks.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sometimes I want to use the caps lock key when I want to shout.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I saw a report that said they have 60,000 of them to send out.  That's a lot of prototypes.  That is a lot of freebies if you're right, Gina.  Not only are they not selling them, but people who get them get to keep them, you think?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I was so hell bent on just trying to acquire one.  I wasn't thinking about the sending pack part.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What are the terms of service, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I just clicked, yes, I agree.  I shouldn't have said that aloud.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Samsung and Acer are following up with netbooks after this prototype goes out, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  Mid 2011 is the target date when we'll actually be able to buy them from vendors.  They say other vendors will join in after that.  I'm excited about Chrome OS.  As much as I was skeptical of why I needed an app store in my browser, Chrome OS looks  like a fantastic device to try out.  I would be willing to…  That's the whole point of it.  It's not for the browser.  It's for that.  Yeah, exactly.  I said in my application, I would be willing to try to live in Chrome OS for a week without  using any other computer and see how it went.  You hear that, Google?  I'll do it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I need Skype.  I need Skype to do Twig.  Well, yeah.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Gina, you said in your blog post that you questioned their statement that anything can  be built as a web app because it can't compile code, right?  It would be hard to create a code compiler or some kind of programming tool in a web  app.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm running Rescue Time, which is this app that monitors all the applications that you  use on your computer.  My top applications are Eclipse and the Terminal because I'm primarily a software developer  these days.  Then after that, it's Gmail, Google Calendar.  It's all browser stuff.  I was thinking, a true code IDE and doing full-on development.  It amazes me that there are thousands of Googlers who have been using this prototype full-time.  Google engineers are using the Chrome OS prototype to do their work.  What are they developing in?  How are they doing advanced engineering stuff?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Unless Google has web-based tools that they haven't shown us for their employees.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  But the idea of editing code in a browser, I know you can do it.  There are a few apps that you can do that with.  There's a couple of collaborative coding, code text editors and that kind of thing.  Compilation is an issue.  I just never got into it myself.  Then there's always the, what about Final Cut Pro or heavy video editing?  I know you can do that to some extent on the web, but it still feels like it would be a  light experience.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe they're using the Citrix thing to do the code compilation where they just push  their code through there.  The Citrix guys came up and did a good demonstration of how you can actually have your enterprise  apps through Chrome OS.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, that's true.  Like a remote desktop kind of situation.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Was it John Gruber who said that the iPad is like the bicycle?  It's not the car that you drive to get a long distance.  It's not the walk you take around the corner to grab a cupcake or Chipotle.  But it's your bicycle.  It's the in-between tool for when you need to do a little bit more than a walk and a  little less than a drive.  Is that what the Chrome OS netbook is?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think that that's actually, yeah, I think that that totally works.  I have a netbook that I love.  It's my kitchen living room computer.  I look at Epicurious while I'm cooking.  I get on Facebook while I'm watching TV.  This seems like that.  It takes a long time to boot up and I share it with my wife.  It sounds like Chrome OS would be perfect for that.  Also a perfect travel computer because I'd be able to get online wherever because of  the data connection, the built-in data.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I was thinking travel because I don't know, maybe it's a powered bicycle, but it's  a little bit more than I use my tablet for.  I use my tablet sort of around the house the way you're talking about.  You use your netbook, Gina.  It's really hard to use that when you're traveling and you need to do a little more.  You want to have multiple windows, cut and paste is clunky.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Where this really goes is an architecture too.  It's not just the device.  It's the architecture of this.  It says that when you can be connected through any device you find, you can almost imagine  a new kind of phone booth and I can go on into the cloud from a device, from a friend's  device, from whatever.  Just like the iPad, I think these are transitional devices that lead us to being connected to  more and a lighter way and more into the cloud.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Almost overshadowed in all of this is the fact that Chrome 8 has gone final with the  PDF viewer, Web Store support and some more of that sandboxing.  All three operating.  Yeah, go ahead, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  They had actually released the...  This was the version that they were talking about at the announcement yesterday, but it  came out last week and a couple of bloggers had kind of said, hey, it looks like the Web  Store is in this.  And I kind of noticed these new features and they hadn't made a big deal about it.  So it was funny, yesterday, I think John Grupper was saying, there's no new version of Chrome  and it's like, well, yeah, it's just it's been out for a week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's no new, new version of Chrome, but there's still the old new version of Chrome.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And then on Monday, we discovered Google eBooks.  This is what was previously referred to a lot of times as Google Editions.  Google eBook Store is not going to wait for them to figure out the legal status of orphaned  works.  With the traditional public domain, that's not controversial and some other dealer deals  that they've struck with publishers and will have the ability to read a book you buy from  Google anywhere you have an Internet connection.  So you can read it in a browser or they have some apps available for different platforms  that you can read it in as well.  And this looked to have a little bit of a trump on Kindle because with Kindle, you had  to actually install Amazon.  But with Google, you could read it right in the browser.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, but Kindle also doesn't have a browser app coming up.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, it is coming out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They demoed it actually during the demo at Google, during the Google announcement, which  I thought was interesting.  It was interesting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Now you see a Google Books app on the Kindle.  That's what I want to see.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, I have the Google Books.  I downloaded the first book and unless somebody can tell me otherwise in the chat room, please,  there's no way to mark the book.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you mean notes or bookmarks?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, anything.  Just leave any fingerprint on it.  It feels rushed.  It's nice text.  It looks good.  I think it actually uses pages, which is a beautiful thing versus the Fakakta Kindle  locations.  But I can't do anything.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it actually tells you how many pages you have left in a chapter and stuff like  that rather than the...  You're 62% through your book.  I hate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It makes you crazy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It kills footnotes.  The Kindle kills footnotes because you can't have a common location.  It takes away...  Books were the original URI.  The page number was the original URI.  And you could find it again and somebody else could find it again and Kindle broke that,  which is stupid.  So yes, page numbers is good, but I also need to be able to mark stuff and make notes and  do other things and that functionality, unless I'm crazy, I cannot find it in the Google  Books app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't tried to find that either.  I know the footnotes thing in Kindle though, you just click and it takes you to the footnote  and then you click back.  No, no, no.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm saying when you're writing and you need to make reference to footnotes, you don't  have a URL.  You don't have a universal resource locator.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't have that for any page in the book if you're reading a Kindle book.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  So that page numbers matter and they are a common point to be able to create links and  things and Amazon broke it.  Kindle brought it back.  I mean, Google brought it back.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I am unable to figure out how to add notes to Alice in Wonderland.  I'm trying right now.  Chat room, help us.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Can you even mark words, right?  None of that.  I can't find any of it.  So it feels like it was a rushed app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe this is just early days, the proud tradition of long betas.  I like the idea of being able to get my apps in a browser anywhere and Amazon says they're  going to do that too.  But I guess the advantage Google e-books still has then is you can read a Google edition  book on a Sony reader or on a Barnes and Noble Nook.  You can't read it on a Kindle because it doesn't support the format, but it's available on  a wider variety still than a Kindle.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  It's weird to have to make the call as to which is, sorry, Jeff, the way it's weird  to have to make the call.  If someone's looking to buy an e-book reader now and you usually try to buy devices like  the network behind it, who do you believe is going to stay in the e-book market longer,  Google or Amazon?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  What do you think?  That's a good question.  I've been thinking this too.  I'm pretty invested in the whole Kindle sphere and when I think about books, I think Amazon.  So I've already got a bunch of books in my Kindle app, which I can use on my Android  phone.  It's a decent enough app.  I've gotten used to it.  I'm not sure that I would switch to Google Books just yet.  I also just hate the idea that I'm going to have e-books in different places, behind  my Google account or behind my Amazon account, but I guess this is just the way it's going  to be for a while.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Even if you have to go on the web, you still have to choose which website you're going  to and which web reader you're going to pull open.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, right.  And competition is a good thing.  I'm not complaining about that.  Choice is a good thing.  Competition is a good thing.  But as a consumer, it's like, oh, but I've got this whole library of Kindle books and  I know how that all works.  So I'm not totally convinced on the Google e-books yet.  It's more fun when you don't find something on Google e-books though.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They have a better 404 page.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, they do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They created what's called WhaleFail.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google Books is charging sales tax in New Jersey and Amazon digital books don't as far  as I know.  In New Jersey or Amazon digital books?  That's where I live.  I live in New Jersey, so it depends on what state you're in.  But I don't believe that I pay sales tax on Amazon.  I don't pay it for physical.  I don't believe I pay it for digital.  Google Books is charging sales tax.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I think eventually they're going to have to get sales tax figured out for all  of these things, don't you think?  I mean, the government...  It's not a question of figuring it out.  It's a question of assisting them.  Well, yeah.  And I think the governments are going to decide either that there's going to have to be some  national internet sales tax that's split up or local governments are as much more commerce  goes on the internet.  I'm not saying I want that, Jeff, but don't you think that's inevitable that they're going  to push for that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I still don't think it is.  You know, maybe in some far future.  But I think that right now this is still about growth and about encouraging this.  And you know, it's an issue in many states.  New York got it.  But I think that it's going to affect how the internet grows.  And that's an issue right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We have the whale fail page if you want to take a look at it.  Oh, never mind.  We don't have it.  Perk, close the page on me.  There we go.  So there it is.  It's a playoff on the Twitter meme.  Instead of a fail whale, you have sort of a Melvillean whale fail.  Google's having a trouble finding that page.  Does that mean that that page is that's when you're reading the book and it just can't  get to the next page?  Because that's not good.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that wouldn't be good.  I don't think it's that.  I think it's more just like like, yeah, broken permalink from elsewhere.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google's Andy Rubin also showed up showed off a secret tablet at D Dive into Mobile.  It's a it's a Motorola device and it's running.  It was running gingerbread, right?  Or it's going to.  And you know, it's running the next one.  OK, it was it's supposed to run honeycomb.  The honeycomb was known as Gina's tablet.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, that was my tablet.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And he's got to hand it over.  I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  The those screenshots in the video showed a few very tablet specific changes that it  looks like they'd already made.  The lock screen was slightly different.  I think you like tapped a point as opposed to having to do that big slide that you do  with Android and a few other things.  It's it's really interesting you would bring that out so early.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, this seems to be a new pattern for Google is to go and find a suitable stage and kind  of secretly, secretly pull out a device that they haven't announced.  Eric Schmidt did it with the Nexus S without saying what it was.  And now Andy Rubin does it with the tablet a day before they have an official announcement.  So they try and different strategies here.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was thinking about how that, you know, that kind of prevents, I think, the excitement  of this like brand new launch or something that's available right away.  I really like that they show things early and that they iterate and that things have  sort of a long you have a long time to kind of think about it and digest it and for them  to iterate and get feedback.  But at the same time, you don't have that same like I waited online all night around  the corner to get this new secret thing that I know I'm going to love and can have in my  hands instantly.  I don't know.  It's two different.  It's two different strategies.  I like Google's approach.  But again, it kind of takes away that exciting kind of launch bang, you know, when it when  it actually does become available.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And we've seen that now the strategy is going to be Android on the phone and the tablet.  Chrome OS is meant for the netbook, right?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much.  That's it's strange that there I mean, the only Android tablets previously were very  unofficial type tablets.  But now they've got the Galaxy S and they've got the secret $10,000 Motorola prototype  that Andy was showing off.  I don't know.  I don't know that anyone would really want Chrome OS on anything but a netbook or like  an old laptop.  I mean, I can see the other way.  I can see how people might want Android on a netbook.  But I don't really see Chrome OS seems like a pretty specific use.  I don't know if you guys agree.  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, a lot of people are saying that the Android Chrome OS divergence is this,  you know, indicative of like this, you know, split within the company and how they shouldn't  be pushing these two products and their competing platforms.  But it just seems like Android's the touch operating system and Chrome OS is the computer  operating system is the difference between iOS and OS 10.  And you know, they're very different because, you know, it's yeah, it's the Chrome OS is  the operating system for the device with a with a real keyboard.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  And the constant connection.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, I mean, you can argue that Android does as well.  I mean, there's definitely some overlap.  And some Android devices do have keyboards, you know, physical keyboards.  But I yeah, I definitely want Android on my tablet.  No, I don't.  I don't want Chrome OS on my tablet.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think that I would take Chrome OS on even if there are left in the world any desktop  machines, you know, a shared machine in a library.  Oh, yeah.  A bigger screen, that kind of stuff.  I can see the fact that it's just it's it's what, you know, Sun talked about years and  years ago and wanted for years is the is the dumb device to the smart network.  And I think I can see a lot of uses for it, actually, as instant on and all that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's great for shared machines.  You're right. Because of the fact that they silo you, you have to log into your Google  account. But is that a good thing to have to log into Google to get into your machine?  I mean, that that is one thing that makes me a little.  It's the master plan.  If you have nothing to hide, Tom, why are you afraid?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  And just like Android, there's a there's a back door in that, you know, a company could  take the chromium OS and build a Bing netbook that you log into Bing and all that, I think.  And just like Android, you could technically build a phone that was entirely open source  and, you know, doesn't have any Google apps on it if you wanted to.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And there is the guest account on Chrome OS.  If you just want to be tinfoil hat paranoid, you just always use the guest account.  You never actually sign into anything.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a trade off. I mean, the interesting thing about Chrome OS is that it's a sort of  this new operating system, computer operating system that has been developed after the web,  like as we know it. Right.  I mean, Windows was built at a time where you're buying software in boxes off shelves.  OS 10, too. So this is like the kind of the first postmodern web, you know, computer  operating system. It's really interesting, even though it's not the sort of hot touch  mobile device craze, you know, that's happening right now.  I think that a lot of people are like, oh, whatever computer operating system.  No one uses computers anymore.  It's these hand hand held devices.  But it's still kind of interesting.  I'm really I'm really excited about the security stuff and that tight cloud integration  that no other OS really has.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Android on the tablet is doing well.  Samsung says they've sold one million Galaxy Tab units.  Has anybody heard whether this is shipped or sold?  I still haven't found a clarification on that.  Either way, it's still impressive.  I don't know what it is.  Yeah, shipped being that Samsung has made a million shipped them out to retail, but  they haven't necessarily been bought yet.  Sold would mean people actually are bragging how many of my products.  Yeah. But is one million.  That's good, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's good. I'm saying I'm liking the thing.  This is the second week I've had it.  And I had to print, you know, I had to type a memo on the airplane and use it.  One box is the killer for this.  One box is absolutely great.  And it goes back to what Chrome is going to be like.  And so my everything is there's no such thing as thinking, really.  It's just there and I grab it and it's the same in both places.  And that makes this thing really good.  Using it as a GPS device in the car today here in Rochester, you know, just follow the  road with snow on it.  It's I'm liking it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte

Best Buy is going to sell the Nexus S from December 16th.  It'll come with Android 2.3 Gingerbread.  You'll also be able to get it at BestBuy.com after December 16th as well.  And this is officially now the reference design for Google.  But they're changing the strategy a little bit, right, Jeff?  I mean, this isn't the same as the Nexus One.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. I mean, they're not selling it directly.  Google's out of the phone store business.  Samsung reportedly didn't want to call the Nexus Two.  It would be second in line. So it's the S.  They have the Google, the Best Buy deal.  And I think it just becomes the confidence it gives me is we'll always have a pure Android unit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's going to sell for $529 if you want it unlocked.  Although, I mean, I don't think it works on the AT&T network for data.  You'd be able to make calls on the AT&T network, but I don't think it has the right band for that.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  You get edge data, not you get a store.  You go and get edge, right. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is $199 with a two-year service agreement with T-Mobile.  Are you salivating over it?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Except for the T-Mobile part.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Is that the part that brought you down, Kevin?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Well, yeah. I mean, I'm a T-Mobile customer and I have a Nexus One and I like it fine enough.  But T-Mobile is really a good enough network.  I mean, if you don't mind, you know, if you live somewhere where you have good coverage, great.  But I wonder how they're able to get such a sweetheart deal with Verizon for the netbook.  And then to release the next reference device, they decided to go with T-Mobile, unless it's just something inherent about GSM technology that makes it more apt for their phones.  I don't understand it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think so, Kevin, for their worldwide distribution, I think the GSM is just a better move for them to get it going.  Oh, good point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it's got it's got the world bands.  Couldn't they have squeezed in the AT&T band as well?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's a really good point, Tom.  It's really irritating and it would be a slap at the iPhone.  Take take your SIM out of the iPhone and try something new.  You know, yeah.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  The iPhone is a micro SIM, though, and this is a full SIM.  Not to get too nerdy about it, but that's right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, OK. That's easily remedied.  It is. It is technically right.  There's an article on Lifehacker for that.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I'm sure there is, but I'm pretty sure that's where I read about it.  Probably. I don't know.  I think they're still they're issuing the Gingerbread update for Nexus One.  I wonder how much longer this guy is going to stay around and still be relevant.  I hope it does for a while, because buying an unlocked device a year ago, it would be nice to have longer than a year on a five hundred dollar plus purchase.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Take full advantage of the unlock-ed-ness of it, right?  The unlock-ed-ness, yes.  Four inch contour display in the Nexus S.  It is it is built on a Galaxy S design, but it does have that curved display.  One gigahertz application processor, like you mentioned, comes with Gingerbread.  Sixteen gigs of internal memory and near field communication.  Gina, what do you make of this?  Or is this going to be used or is it just kind of, oh, did we lose Gina?  Oh, that's why she's been so quiet.  Near field communication, Jeff, what do you make of this?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, now that we all should be giving up our visa and MasterCard and support of WikiLeaks, just a joke.  Well, not half a joke. Half a joke.  You know, I do think that that I was thinking this week a lot about I write in the chapter in my next book, Public Parts, about Blippi.  And as I was thinking about that and what Pudd has done there, it really becomes interesting when you realize the data that flows through your credit card, your purchases,  and the extra value that is inherent in that.  And so going away from the credit card and being able to put everything on an account through a device like this, I think has even more power than we can yet imagine.  Gee, you just bought that. Do you also want this?  Here's a cheaper price. Here's the service contract. Share the price with everybody else.  Here's transparent pricing for everything.  Here's trendy items that are just being bought in the last hour.  There's all kinds of things that can happen if that data is live.  And if we through our device have a control on that data.  Yes, I want to share that. No, I don't want to share that. Yes, I want to do this with it. No, I want to do that with it.  And it takes away some of the control of our data from the credit card company, though they may still be doing it.  But we become a conduit for it instead of the box, just the box in the store.  So I think there's a lot to it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it can make things a whole lot more convenient if you just, you know,  even if you didn't, in some cases, you might not even have to take the phone out of your pocket, right?  Right.  Gina's back with us. We were talking about the Nexus S.  What do you think? Is it something you'd want to run out and get?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Sorry about that. Yes, do want the Nexus.  The Nexus, yes.  Absolutely. Although I don't think it's such a huge upgrade that I'll run out and buy it when it gets released.  But I will try and arrange some sort of flight so that I can borrow Kevin's at least for a little while to play with it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nice. Should you buy it unlocked or should you buy it with the contract?  That's the one question that Eileen and I, my wife, when we first heard about it that morning, we were debating.  Should you just go ahead and get it with T-Mobile?  Because in the United States, you're pretty much only going to make best use of it on T-Mobile anyway.  Or, Kevin, should I go with the unlock-ed-ness?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Yeah, I would, unless you're really into T-Mobile and you found it had really good service.  I think this has the HSPA network, the HSPA Plus that T-Mobile just installed.  That's the, you know, I think technically maybe one of the highest speed 4G, I'm doing air quotes, networks around.  But that's actually, I think, a few dollars extra on T-Mobile's network.  I might be wrong, comment chat room.  But I really wouldn't, I wouldn't sign up for two years of T-Mobile if I could avoid it.  Unless they're really going to start stepping up their coverage area.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, and I just looked up the specs.  It doesn't say that it has HSPA Plus.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that was a question mark for me.  I thought it would, but...  Yeah, it is, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Kevin, I agree, except when I bought my Galaxy Tab, I went in and bought it unlocked.  And I thought that I was going to use MiFi and just get this on.  And then I realized I can't take advantage of any of the geography.  And so I could do it month to month on this, but it's a crappy deal and you get one fifth  the bandwidth.  So I finally just surrendered and I did it two years on this.  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you don't mind the size of that, right?  Seven inches, it's plenty for you?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's perfect because it fits my pocket.  And here's the thing I discovered.  It's just the right width for thumb typing with fat thumbs.  Wider, you can't do the thumb typing because it's too far away.  Or don't I know that it's too close and I'm clumsy.  So it's a very good width actually for typing things and doing things.  And it's Kindle sized, which is for reading books and stuff.  It's great.  Video I haven't used it a lot yet, but it seems pretty good so far.  So yeah, I'm fine with the size.  The convenience of carrying it in the pocket is huge.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And one of the other advantages of Nexus S, right, is that you get gingerbread.  We got more details about that on Monday as well.  What are some of the best things about gingerbread in your opinion?  Gina, have you briefed up on this?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  A little bit, although Kevin's going to be the expert.  I just want Android to just look prettier.  Is that so wrong?  Does that make me a bad nerd?  I just want it to look prettier.  And I think that gingerbread does bring that.  But Kevin's my Android guru.  So Kevin, tell us more about gingerbread.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  The design is a little more unified across the OS.  A lot of the minis have gone from gray and white to black.  Black background, white text.  Most of the improvements are pretty small.  The keyboard actually got a pretty good upgrade.  The text selection is more Apple-like or even HTC-like, where you have two cursors.  Yeah, there you are.  Two cursors that you would drag around to select the width of text.  Previously, you'd be using the trackball or even your finger if you were very brave.  Google says that they rearranged the keyboard and made the keys bigger or just bigger targets.  I haven't had a chance to play with it hands-on yet.  But really, it seems like most of the improvements are just corners and details and little niggling  bugs here and there.  Although someone suggested, and I don't know if it's true, that Google is making a push  for more AMOLED screens, A-M-O-L-E-D.  And that's why they went with the dark design, because I believe that you'd then be able  to save some power from your battery.  And Android notoriously does not have a great battery life.  Most of them don't.  And I believe with darker designs and darker menus, with certain kinds of screens, you'd  actually get more battery life out of it, which is interesting if that's what they're  doing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And you can actually get the gingerbread keyboard on the current release, 2.2.2, right now,  if you root it and do some sort of black magic.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  It's a little bit hacky, but I don't think it's full-scale rooting.  So yeah, you can get the gingerbread keyboard pretty quickly on your 2.2 phone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm just so happy that there's no Windows-like pointer that shows up when you select text  anymore.  That always freaked me out.  I was like, oh no.  It's too close for comfort.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  There's no other white diagonal pointer in Android except for when you went to select  text before.  It seems like it was dropped in from outer space.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And it gives Jarvis an excuse to call Android Windows again, which always freaks me out  too.  Or Leo.  Or Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  That's right.  Gingerbread ROMs are also starting to get cooked.  There's some folks who are making them for the Evo 4G, the Droid Eris, and Wildfire.  They're still in development stage, so unless you're really wanting to contribute to development,  they say that you should hold off on them.  But that's good news in many ways, right, Jeff?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's advanced the religion.  We'll take it as soon as we can.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would like to have a gingerbread ROM running on my iPhone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You could do that, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Eventually.  Go back to your question about Chrome on one device and Android on another.  You start to wonder whether you can put these things in all kinds of different devices.  Can I put the gingerbread ROM in my car?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's an interesting idea, because then you could have an in-dash tablet, essentially,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly.  And so you get to the fabled connected refrigerator.  If you had a ROM, where all could other manufacturers put it?  Now, the problem with that becomes the account problem.  It becomes the problem of, oh my god, I've got to have 10 phone numbers now, and that's  not going to scale personally.  You can just use Google Voice.  In terms of connectivity, if you wanted to have mobile connectivity for your car, you  have to have a connection to a cell network.  But if they get past that idiocy, if we have multiple cells and one account, multiple SIMs  in one account, and I can just go back and forth from device to device to device, and  I carry something with me that says, Jeff's here.  Connect his account now.  That'd be pretty cool.  Yeah, it would be.  That would be really cool.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Amen.  I'm going to use the Android enabled refrigerator to let me know that my milk has expired when  I'm at the grocery store.  Can I have that Google?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Would you hear about the folks who are trying to develop a food tube internet-like system  in Croydon, England?  No.  They want to connect supermarkets, public buildings, and schools.  It's like a big pneumatic tube where you put the food in capsules and then it's run like  the internet.  So that your food just goes through the tubes and then it's delivered to you because it  knows it scans the capsule and says, okay, this one goes over here.  So you combine that with your refrigerator running the Android.  You don't even have to go to the store.  The refrigerator orders the milk for you.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  And what if they run another tube and you can just shoot into the supermarket yourself,  jump into the floor in your kitchen and there you go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Transportation problem solved.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Oh, goodness.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And you know what?  The beautiful thing about that is that a Chipotle burrito will just fit in the tube.  Oh, perfect.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, the capsules are big.  You could actually get the whole family order at Chipotle.  With guac.  With extra guac.  Why do they charge for salsa there?  That always bothers me.  Salsa should be free.  I'm for socialized salsa.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Hey, would you guys in the cabin, to me a favor, would you guys in the cabin take Leo  on a field trip to Chipotle for us?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll find out where the nearest Chipotle is.  Why does he, I see he doesn't, he doesn't dig the Chipotle, huh?  I don't think he's ever been.  Yeah, okay.  We'll introduce him to the waves.  He's not joined our cult.  He still thinks they're owned by McDonald's.  That's probably the problem.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Salsa wants to be free in the chat room.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Salsa wants to be free.  It does.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That sounds like a show title to me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's Lawrence Lessig's next cause.  I'm going to push for him to take that up.  Free salsa culture.  Yes.  So we have another story here.  Business Insider ranking the top flops of the year and some Google products showed up.  I've got my opinion about this.  It's a pretty good list.  I want to hear yours.  Would we read all 15 of them?  I don't know if we have time to read all 15 of them.  What's your favorite, Jeff?  Well, no, I'll read them all.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Just list them real quick.  Let's go real quick.  15 Nexus 1, 14 Palm, 13 Hot Potato, 12 AOL Seed Platform, 11 Blackberry Torch, 10 Sorry  Gina.  I won't even say it.  You know what?  Nine, Twitter's Early Bird, eight Google T, seven Guala, six Apple iTunes Ping, five  Crunchpad Juju.  Oh yeah.  That's a good one.  Four, it's you, which is the three Google Buzz, two HP Slate 500 and number one, the  number one failure in the Business Insider list of failures in 2010 is KIN phones.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ah, the KIN.  Ah, the KIN.  It is back though.  You can still buy it.  It's called something.  It's called, what is it again?  They changed the name of it.  They put it back out and then called it the KIN-D or something.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  At least they followed up with the Windows 7 phone.  Right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean.  Well, yeah.  Windows, nobody understood.  I don't think anyone at Microsoft understood why they were doing the KIN.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's a decent list.  Although I called BS on Nexus 1.  I mean, Nexus 1 may have been a mainstream consumer failure, but you go to any conference  where there are like serious Google nerds and they're carrying a Nexus 1.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't think the Nexus 1 is the failure.  I think it's the attempt to change the way cell phones were sold is the thing they didn't  succeed at.  That idea that you just go online.  Right.  And God bless them for trying.  Yeah.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I thought it was a great attempt.  Right.  Yeah.  Fair enough.  you are messing with the fundamental forces of nature and they just had to shirk away.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Even Google wasn't big enough to shoulder the carriers out of the way.  Is that what you're saying, Kevin?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Yeah.  To try to Europeanize it where you can just buy the phone and then buy your service and  not worry about it and not do two-year contracts.  It's just unfortunate.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do we ever get away from that?  Because that is a fundamentally anti-consumer system that has been kind of organically mutated  out of the conditions that we had in the 90s when they built out the cellular networks.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Well, people now are so used to the idea of their phone being something that they can  replace every X years and if I drop my phone, no big deal.  I'll just get a new one when my credits come up.  It's hard to replace, I think.  It's a very sticky situation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they went from one-year contracts to two-year contracts.  There's even been some three-year contracts.  So though I think people have drawn the line, they're like, no, I'm not going to do a three-year  contract.  Not the way phones are changing hands all the time.  So anyway, on this list to the other Google things were Google Wave.  I'm sorry, Gina.  It is not dead though, right?  I mean, it's still an open source project.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It'll live on as an open source Apache project, which I'm excited about.  Wave in a box.  Buzz was certainly a good choice here.  Google TV is kind of early to say, but it sounds like you can't really use our company.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's been pretty roundly, soundly.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, the G1 of...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mine's back in its box.  I took my Logitech review and I put it back in the box.  I was this close to returning it when I talked to somebody who mentioned that it was going  to get a firmware update that included the marketplace after the first of the year.  And I decided, all right, I'm going to hold out because Google TV might still turn it  around with the right apps in a marketplace, don't you think?  Good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  May I recommend that you do a re-boxing video?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll unbox it again and do a re-boxing.  That's a good idea, Jeff.  I might take you up on that.  That would be a good series for just sort of demonstrating, you know what?  You don't want this.  We're going to re-box it.  I like that.  All right.  Let's thank another sponsor for this week in Google, Ford and the new Ford Fiesta with  its EPA estimated 40 highway miles per gallon.  No other compact car is more fuel efficient.  Fuel economy is just the start though.  A 2011 Ford Fiesta can be driven at a dealer near you.  Ford is committed to the environment.  It's got the EcoBoost V6 engine.  It's a 365 horsepower engine.  And you can feel it when you drive the Ford Fiesta.  It's got pickup and fuel efficiency at the same time, if that's what you're looking for.  You get a lot of power.  You essentially get the power of a V8 and it does with direct fuel injection.  You can test drive a global test.  Ford Focus global test drive now through December 31st, 2010 submitted video saying why you  should be selected for the test drive and what charity you think Ford should donate  $10,000 to in your name.  And they'll send you and a friend to a secret location in Europe to test drive the all new  2012 Ford Focus.  You can learn more at there's a Facebook page you can get to very easily by typing in twitfordfocus.com  And upload your video by December 31st.  That URL again is twitfordfocus.com and we invite you to stop by a dealer, Ford dealer  and drive a new Taurus show, the SHO or Ford Fiesta this week.  See what the innovations at Ford are all about.  Another Android phone that was leaked out is the oft rumored PlayStation phone.  Kevin, do you have any info on this?  Is this real?  It looks more real every time we see a video.  We finally got a clear video this week that showed someone using it rather than a blurry  video from a Greek train.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I am sorry.  I got nothing on this one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You got nothing on this.  Anybody else got anything on the PlayStation phone?  No, no takers.  I want the PlayStation phone.  What do you think of the control system, Gina?  Have you seen the little nubs that are supposed to be the joysticks?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I, we saw this a couple of weeks ago and I was like, oh, that's just sort of  silly, but it's real.  It's interesting.  So it uses the thumb pad to navigate around Android basically.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Can you play Angry Birds better on it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Possibly.  I mean, well, the idea is you've got the two little nubs, right?  And so there's the, there's, there's thumb pads just like you have on a PSP, but then  the control sticks are those two little nubs in the middle so that it's like a touch interface.  But though you can't really see them in the picture we're showing in the video.  It's right below that S there's, there's those two little things.  And then that tells you where the center of the control stick is.  And you just move your thumbs around in order to, in order to send the control with that.  So they don't have to build an actual movable stick in there.  And that allows it to slide under the screen.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Interesting.  So is this like the iPod touch kind of game, you know, the, of, I don't know, I guess it's  not really a direct parallel.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's similar to the iPod touches little circular thing, except with that you kind of have to  remember where your finger is, but there's a little physical cue.  So you know, like, okay, that's the center of the stick.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  But for those who can't see it, it looks like from these preview shots that the whole Android  system is in there.  Settings, places, phone navigation.  It's not, it's not, you know, some kind of, you know, rigged together Android device.  It looks like it's running a full Android system with just probably a few built in games  or, you know, focus on games.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, they claim it's running gingerbread in the story I saw on Android community.com.  Everybody's got gingerbread, but me.  You don't have it either, do you Gina?  No, no.  Everybody's got gingerbread except me and Gina.  Please send ROMs.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Until Gina knocks the Googler off his bike and runs away.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's why those bikes are scattered all over their campus.  It's people knocking them off trying to steal their gingerbread.  Twitter ran into a security issue a couple days ago now.  And it was reported on search engine land that it was goo.gl URLs that were the security  issue because there's no preview on that.  So they were circulating on Twitter.  People would click on them.  They would get infected.  And then it would propagate.  It was a cross site scripting attack.  Is that essentially what was going on, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, that is what was going on.  Actually, I got the email from Google because I apparently signed up for website optimizer  at some point about this as well.  And I'm actually not totally using it.  But I thought that Google handled it pretty well.  They're pretty quick to explain what happened and issue the fix.  I actually didn't see reports of this on Twitter itself.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I never experienced it in real life.  I just read the stories about it.  Jeff, did you or Kevin either one?  Did you see it in real life?  No.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I didn't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I don't believe it happened.  If I didn't see it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It didn't happen.  Yeah.  It's the quantum uncertainty of URLs.  But I'll be honest, I don't see goo.gl short URLs all that often.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, me either.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Unless you follow Matt cuts on Twitter.  Yeah, OK.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google Cloud Print was also part of the Chrome OS announcement that we talked about earlier.  This is their attempt to get rid of drivers.  They say actually across the board, they want to get rid of drivers so that you just connect  to the devices directly.  God bless.  Oh, please.  Right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jeff.  How long has it been?  We've gone through this stupidity.  I have a new HP printer that I can't, I give up.  I can't get the Wi-Fi going.  I can't hook up to it.  I just give up.  My Galaxy Tab.  I can't print to it unless it's a Samsung printer.  How stupid is that?  It's just a stupid printer.  Why?  They don't do any different.  They go ABC.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I love Jarvis Brands.  Kevin, you set this up.  How does this work?  You actually upload your drivers to Google?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I tested it out.  I set it up in Windows and you know, then I used a different Windows computer to test  it out.  Basically, it seems like when you set it up in Chrome, you have to be running the latest  version of Chrome in Windows.  I think even the dev version at this point.  There it is.  You have to give it a little chance to check out what drivers you have on your Windows  computer.  And then when you plug in somewhere else and you're running Chrome and everything's synced  up for you, you can then print to any of those printers that you had drivers for on your  Windows computer, you know, there on this different computer.  And so I was able to print to my HP Deskjet, you know, three and one or whatever and worked  fine.  I mean, the test page worked fine.  I didn't really try much beyond that, but it looks like it's working in this very niche  case for Chrome dev users on Windows to have it set up for syncing.  But it's really promising.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So you don't have to be on the same network.  You can do it over the Internet and your computer obviously that has the printer connected to  it has to be on, right?  Yeah, right.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Yeah, you could.  That's the idea is you could print back to your, you know, desk, presumably desktop or  mini computer that's hooked up to your printer.  So just as soon as I start selling tiny little computers that hook up to printers and do  nothing else but accept Google connections will all be free.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, right.  And you don't have to install anything else.  It's just Chrome that like figures out that just Chrome and you go to the preferences

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  and set it up in the under the hood section.  And that's it.  They must be kind of doing some kind of mini driver in the background for it.  But we're trying to HP and even work fine on, you know, my little PDF printer that I  have installed.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Vitaly Borker, who ran the decor my eyes dot com site, you guys talked about this, I know  last week, right on Twig is under arrest.  For the fraud charges.  So so Jeff, he not only didn't get his site really as far up in SEO as he claims, but  now he's in jail.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  And, you know, the guy was an idiot talking to the Times and he was an idiot for screwing  people around.  He was an idiot for claiming what he did.  And now the government's going to go after him with a heavy hand.  I think he's just a schmuck.  And but, you know, he'll never do he'll never sell another pair of eyeglasses in this  country again, I'll bet you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not to be the counterfeit knockoff eyeglasses, too.  Right.  Well, it just goes to show that insulting your audience doesn't pay after all.  We can all rest assured.  Finally, just didn't make any sense.  That whole thing.  All right, let's finish up with with WikiLeaks.  4chan is rushing to WikiLeaks defense, forcing the Swiss banking site that was holding  their money offline.  They froze the account because they said he had given an incorrect address.  Also, now there are denial of service attacks against MasterCard and there was one set up  to supposed to be against Visa because Visa and MasterCard are going to throw this stuff  off.  Is Jeff, is there a way to get money to WikiLeaks if you if you wanted to?  I mean, are they cut off entirely now?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I believe there is the site.  People have sent me a couple of tweets on it.  I haven't seen it lately.  Interestingly, WikiLeaks leaked today a document that says that the U.S.  government did favors for both Visa and MasterCard in Russia.  Hmm.  Connection.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We also have to ease the way into Russia so that they could set up business there.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  At Low Web, the head of PayPal said that they did in fact get pressure from the government  and this got booze in the crowd.  You know, I it's all very, very uncomfortable, but there is one good punchline out of it.  I see I can't see who gets credit for this.  I think Pick IHH on Twitter gets credit for this line that press freedom is priceless  for everything else.  There's MasterCard.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I should correct myself.  4chan not rushing to WikiLeaks defense, but Anonymous, which is a group that organizes  on 4chan quite often, rushing to WikiLeaks defense.  Subtle but important difference.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  For anyone in New York, this is a last minute thing.  I want to plug on December 11th, which is Saturday in the morning.  Personal Democracy Forum is going to hold a teach in about WikiLeaks starting at, I  think, 10 a.m.  to 1 p.m.  with folks like Arianna Huffington, Dave Weiner, me.  And I think it'll be a really good bunch.  And I think it's time that we have a different discussion going on.  We have Newt Gingrich, who just according to Alan Rusberger, the editor of The Guardian,  I just saw this pass by, has called Assange, quote, an active enemy combatant.  This is an act of war.  The rhetoric out of government is becoming frightening about free speech.  As Matthew Ingram wrote at GigaOM this week, WikiLeaks is acting as a member of the press.  And if it loses its rights, so does the rest of the press.  And this is a dangerous and important moment.  Whatever you think of Assange, whatever you think of WikiLeaks, it's still they do what  the New York Times does.  And if you stop WikiLeaks from doing it, you may well stop the New York Times from  doing it in the future.  It's important.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is interesting that all of the anger is being directed against WikiLeaks itself when  much of the same information is being printed in news organizations around the world, in  Der Spiegel, in The Guardian, in the New York Times.  And yet they don't seem to think that those publications are as threatening.  They're going right after the source.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, Joe Lieberman did come out this week and start talking about trying to try the  New York Times under espionage as well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, OK, there you go.  Do you agree with John Battelle?  He wrote an interesting article on BattelleMedia.com saying with all of the different  mirrors of WikiLeaks that are going on, which just shows the ridiculousness of trying to  stop information once it's out on the web, it's an infinitely copyable medium.  And once something gets out, it's out.  There's no there's no way of stopping it.  Battelle says shouldn't Google mirror WikiLeaks as part of its mission to organize the  world's information and make it universally accessible?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Very good question.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I think so, but it would get them PR problems.  What do you think, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  I thought it was it was an excellent, excellent question.  A very, very good piece.  It would be a huge PR issue for them.  But but a very good point in question.  If that if that is the Google's mission, then isn't this something they should do?  Excellent question.  So glad that he asked it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I would love to know.  Dave Weiner also wrote a really good piece talking about about BitTorrent as the real  architecture of this kind of distributed freedom.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Absolutely, because that was that was WikiLeaks safety valve through all of this was to  have an encrypted file on BitTorrent in case they got taken down entirely.  And that's still being traded around.  All right, let's thank our last sponsor for this week in Google.  This is, of course, GE and the GE Eco-Magination Challenge.  It's a new program from GE for entrepreneurs.  They're trying to give 200 million dollars.  In fact, they're giving 200 million dollars to invest in great ideas for improving the way  energy is produced, transferred and consumed here in the United States and abroad.  Three categories. First is renewables.  GE wants to encourage better ways to integrate renewable energy into the power grid.  Grid efficiency is the second category.  They want to convert the smart grid to digital energy, improve transparency, reduce waste,  give more choices for consumers.  And the third investment category is eco homes where you live and buildings where you work.  Energy consumption is growing so quickly, it's creating an imbalance between demand and supply  and the mismatch is leading to higher energy costs for businesses and for you, the consumer.  GE wants to help change how and when we use energy to lower energy costs.  So they're making 200 million dollars available to invest in great ideas in each of these areas.  Renewable grid efficiency and eco homes.  If you'd like to learn more and read the ideas they're investing in and you can even comment on them,  they want to hear your comments, go to eco-magination.com slash challenge.  We thank GE for supporting this week in Google as well as Green Tech Today.  Be sure to listen or watch Green Tech Today in iTunes or at twit.tv.  All right. Let's finish up with some tips.  Kevin, did you have a tip or?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I have a very quick plug and a very quick tip.  And the plug is for my book, The Complete Android Guide, because for all you twig listeners who out there  who are maybe have someone who is getting an Android phone and they've asked you too many questions already  about it or you yourself have one you want to explore a little bit more of it.  My book, which you can find at completeandroidguide.com.  If you type in the code during Google checkout, twig 2010, T W I G 2 0 1 0.  The book's half off. So normally it's nine dollars.  It'll be four fifty.  And if you're wondering about all this gingerbread news, you know, well, OK, so what?  And then this new version comes out and your book's relevant.  As soon as I get my Nexus S at home, I'm going to upgrade the book and get a new edition out as soon as possible.  And anyone who buys the ebook can upgrade to the next, you know, gingerbread version of the book for 99 cents.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you have a better upgrade plan than some phones.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah. My many of my friends have already pulled out, but especially those with, you know, AT&T phones.  But yeah, so twig 2010, if you buy it through a completeandroidguide.com.  And my really quick tip for iPhone users who want to use Google Voice to make a voice over IP calls for free, in other words,  use the same kind of calling that you would do through Gmail for free.  There's an app called Talkatone, all one word, talk A T O N E.  And it is a very cool app. I reviewed it on Lifehacker.  You just double tap the contacts tab at the top of the app and you can just hit Google Voice,  view IP call. And it just kind of works, which is kind of amazing.  You can call your friends free, call landline numbers for free through your phone's data connection, 3G and Wi Fi.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, really? So over the 3G as well. That's great.  And it's just audio. I believe so.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  It's just audio, but it's the same kind of free Google Voice calling you get through Gmail.  So, you know, this type of thing, I usually say get it while it lasts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina, I know you've got a tip that might actually help Steve Martin.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, that's what that's what it looks like.  They added something really, really helpful to Google Calendar this week.  The ability to set your time zone when you create an event, which really isn't a big deal until you fly cross country.  And then it's a huge deal.  I have actually missed appointments because I when I entered in my calendar had them in the wrong time zone.  When you create a new event in Google Calendar now, there's next to the date and time, there's a time zone drop down.  So you can you can even set kind of a time zone, a separate one for a start and end of the event.  So if you take off on a flight in San Diego and land in New York, you can put in put in those times, you know, based on the time zone.  So hopefully Leo got to use this before he went to France this week to schedule his events.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He was on time this morning when we streamed his talk.  So he showed up on time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, cool. Cool. Good, good, good. Good to know.  I didn't realize you guys streamed it.  Will that be available at TwitSpecials?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a good question. Are we putting that out as a TwitSpecial?  Yeah, it's already out.  That's already out.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Look at that.  GTV, the Twit Cottage right on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's what's the the tweet of what Leo talked about?  I didn't see it.  What's the.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to put you on the spot there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was a roundtable discussion.  I know he had Louis Conn and Dennis Crowley.  And yeah, another guest.  So, you know, it was it was what he does here, except there and on a stage in front of French people.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Without us.  Yeah. What's that about?  We get left at home with you, Tom.  It's a pleasure.  Well, thank you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You guys are you guys are being very helpful.  I know I'm half brain dead slogging through Leo's schedule.  I don't know how he does it.  We don't either.  And the reason I wanted to explain the reason we thought this might help Steve Martin is he  called into Leo's tech guy a couple of weeks ago and his question was about calendaring and  have being able to put in things in the time zone where he is and not have them get all messed up  when he moves from time zone to time zone.  So great tip, Gina.  Thank you.  Jeff, do you have a number for us?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you almost got to before.  Thank goodness you didn't.  The number is one thousand two hundred forty one, which I checked about an hour ago was the number  of mirrors put up for WikiLeaks, which is pretty incredible.  They made it pretty easy on the site.  Just do this, this and this.  Give us access.  And you got a mirror.  And now there's twelve hundred forty one, which says that you can whack this mole as much as you  want.  You're never going to get them.  Caddyshack.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, no matter what you think of WikiLeaks, the idea that you could shut down WikiLeaks  is naive.  There was another interview with the BBC and I can't remember which government official from  the US was saying we ask WikiLeaks to return the transcripts and the documents.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm like, really?  Welcome to the Internet, folks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, we'll print them out and send them to you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that's the absurdity of the White House.  The White House decreed that federal employees should not read the cables, even though they're  up online and you can read stories about it, but you can't read the cables because they're  still classified.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, we had a listener write into Tech News today explaining that once you read a classified  document on a machine, that machine becomes classified and then can't be used for anything  non-classified in certain government institutions.  And since these documents are still considered classified, even though they've been leaked,  it's just a bureaucratic nightmare.  If you read it, it's an IT problem.  They just got to switch to Chrome.  And do incognito mode.  All right, I have a tool.  You guys may have talked about this before.  Have you talked about Boomerang for Gmail?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We have not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is from a site called Bayden.com.  They do a few different Gmail plugins.  This one is a...  I use it as a Firefox add-on, but I think they have a Chrome add-on as well.  It allows you to set a time to send or receive an email, which the sending part makes sense.  Right?  You're like, oh, I don't want this to go out until tomorrow morning.  So that's cool.  But receiving it, if you, like me, and I know Merlin Mann would shiver maybe,  use your inbox as a sort of a to-do list sometimes, what this lets you do is say,  you know what?  I want to get to that one later.  You Boomerang it and it leaves your inbox and comes back at a time that you set.  So you're like, you know what?  I can't deal with this now.  Send it back to me tomorrow.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's really cool.  I tried it out with an invite code.  It's not public yet, but they were really quick to get back.  You can either sign up at the website for an invite code or if you follow them on Twitter  and then DM them, or I'm sorry, if you tweet that you want an invitation,  they'll actually DM you an invitation code.  And they did that really quickly.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  The genius of that too is that you could tell somebody you didn't get their email and say,  look, look at my inbox.  I didn't get it.  And then later that night say, oh, geez, Google servers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Or you could set it to send you particular emails when you know someone's going to be  sitting there and then, oh, I just got this email.  I have to go.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Yes.  It's like having a friend call you during the data scape.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I just got an emergency email.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Oh no.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right.  Well, thank you guys very much.  This has been really fun for me.  I hope I've done an adequate job filling in to the big shoes.  You're awesome, Tom.  Jeff Jarvis, buzzmachine.com.  And what are the other plugs?  What are the other things?  What would Google do?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's sufficient.  What would Google do?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  In the Google ebook store.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Check it out now.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, is it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, it is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina Trapani, I'm suddenly and embarrassingly blanking on ThinkUp.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  SmartAware.org, right?  And I developed ThinkUp, ThinkUpApp.com.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've been using ThinkUp.  I actually need to upgrade it to the latest release, but I love it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Awesome.  I'm so happy to hear that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I installed it on subbrilliant.com and I use it to analyze my Twitter stuff.  So I will send you feedback about it once I've kept up and I have the latest version  because I know right now I'd probably send you a bunch of stuff that you'd be like fixed,  fixed, fixed.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Hopefully.  Hopefully.  Yeah, yeah.  We love feedback.  So absolutely.  Cool.  So glad to hear that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Check out smarterware.org.  And Kevin Purdy, thank you so much.  And go ahead and tell people about that book again because I think that's a really good  resource for anybody interested in Android.  Cool.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Thank you.  So completeandroidguide.com and it's an ebook, 280 plus pages of Android how-to in detail  and how to get more out of your phone.  If you buy it now, the ebook, it is half off, 50% off, about 450.  And the offer code is twig2010, T-W-I-G-2-0-1-0.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And of course you can find Kevin's work on lifehacker.com as well.  That's it for this week in Google.  I'm Tom Merritt.  Lee will be back next week.  You can find us at twit.tv slash twig.  See you then.
