Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, unfortunately.  None the wiser.  Hello, none the wiser.  Bottle top young Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And loaded with cupcakes.  Gina, of course, blogs at smarterware.org and writes for Fast Company.  Fast Company dot com slash work smart is her new feature on Fast Company.  It's great to have you, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good to be here.  Gina, are you older than half age?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am 35.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's not half our age, Jeff.  She's a third of our age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That makes me very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm officially middle aged, I think.  Is 35.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't know middle age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, we may not be twice your age, but we're 50% older than her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is here.  He's actually in Amsterdam.  I'm as old as I am.  What are you doing in Amsterdam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The picnic conference, which is here, which I think out on last year because I had my  prostate out in the year before because there was a scheduling mess, so I'm here this year.  And Amsterdam is a great city, so what the heck.  I'm here to speak five times tomorrow.  I'm going to be so sick of myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What fun.  Is picnic about journalism?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's more kind of the European South by Southwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, let's go, Gina.  Next year, picnic.  I'm there.  We need more South by Southwest.  Once a year is not enough for that party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's not, you know, because we need to do that.  Well, Gina's not committed to going to South by yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm feeling kind of maybe, maybe not.  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many have you been to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been every year since, I mean, I think 2005, 2006.  So you're bored.  It's changed a lot.  And like, you know, the girls hanging out, hanging out the Red Bull, you know, just the  whole vibe has kind of changed.  It's become super, super commercial.  So I don't know.  I'm having that the hipster South by Southwest go or like, guys, jump the shark moment.  So I don't know.  I haven't missed in a really long time.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, I'm the guy who goes to South.  This is my first time last year.  I'll be going to Burning Man this next time.  And that I'll be that guy.  No, I'm that guy.  I'm the guy who goes, oh, are you really going to Burning Man?  Yeah, no, I don't know.  My son says we're going to Burning Man next year.  Basically, I'm the jump the shark guy.  When Leo shows up, the event, the conference has jumped the shark.  It's over.  Forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you guys are going to be there, it'll be very difficult for me not to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We had such a good time this year.  I did a good time together.  Yeah.  It was really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The highlight was dinner with you, Leo.  The dinner that was to cost you $25,000.  Oh, that was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where they came with the skewers of meat.  What did it cost?  You remember?  I showed it on the live stream.  I don't remember, but I showed it on the live stream.  There were about 30 or 40 people.  We took everybody who was in our party and then a bunch of other friends of Twit out  to what was it called?  It's got a name.  It's got some Churrasqueria.  What was it called?  Churrasqueria kind of restaurant.  What was it called?  I don't know.  I know.  I know.  It's something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I took a vegetarian Indian friend there the year before.  He couldn't even walk in because the odor of dead meat was so strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is too meaty for me, Jeff Jarvis.  They actually had a wonderful salad bar because they want to fill you up on the cheap stuff.  It was one of the best salad bars I've ever seen.  I think a vegetarian would actually be very happy there.  But if you're really a vegetarian and the guy comes around and he's got a sword loaded  with meat and says, what do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tina, this has to make you want to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really does.  Actually, you're changing my mind right now.  I'm like, God, that was such a good dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll see.  We shall see.  It was just fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was really fun.  It was really fun to see you guys.  You see the pot that you put in the panel and he and I are on it.  Basically, we're going to argue whether or not companies must be evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's great.  Yeah, it's a great topic.  What a good topic.  Now, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tina is there to be our moderator if she will so deign as to attend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  There's no way I can't go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, now do you have to be voted in?  Jeff, how is what is the process?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there a well, I was talking about this.  Yeah, I think you basically do.  I put in a panel about public this and I haven't heard crap.  So I guess I didn't get voted in.  But but you know, they have some leeway.  Hugh does to to put in things that he's producing the event.  He should be able to put in things that make sense for the event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fogo the chow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's it.  That was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a chain.  There's one in San Francisco, I'm told.  It is a very good restaurant.  I really enjoyed it.  And in fact, my friend, an engineer for the radio show, Luis, who is Brazilian, just lived  his whole life there, said it's actually very authentic and very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to sue you when I end up in the hospital on cardiac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll be the guy on the other gurney.  What are you talking about?  My correspondent, Eric Schmidt, shows up on the Colbert report.  Now, Jeff, I know you didn't see it.  Gina, did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really enjoyed it.  Well, if you don't want to get in trouble, do you want to do a dramatic rendition of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it?  That'd be funny if I had the transcript.  I would.  But since I don't, let's just play it.  What happens, by the way, is that YouTube has a very effective there was a good article  on was it coding horror dot com, Gina?  I think it was this week about this YouTube automated system that flags it looks for a  fingerprint of copyrighted content, flags it, and then the copyright holder gets to  decide what happens.  And we've had stuff we've had.  I had a tweet last week's tweet pulled by NBC, just automatic.  I mean, there's no letters from a lawyer or anything.  And this is a news show.  So I'm of the opinion it's fair use.  But nevertheless, by playing this clip, I believe that I will be flagged and perhaps  pulled off YouTube for doing it.  But you know what?  I got to go on with the news.  The news must go on.  This is from the appeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a structure to appeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to appeal.  But it's yeah, I mean, but it just creates so much work.  What we want to do is a blanket appeal that says, look, anything on the Twitch channel,  because we're a news operation, you shouldn't have that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And trust me, I'm Leo, the nicest guy on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would I?  Would I?  Here is this Colbert report from last night.  I'm sorry, the Colbert report from last night with Stephen Colbert and Eric Schmidt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My guest tonight is the CEO of Google.  At least that's what it said when I looked him up on Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm inserting commentary here so that it is clearly not a reuse of this clip.  But there is commentary.  Oh, look, he made a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please welcome Eric Schmidt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was told by somebody who was on the Colbert report that you are instructed before the  show, do not try to be funny.  That's Colbert's job.  Just be a straight man.  Let's see how it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lovely to see you.  I get to put another notch in my billionaire belt.  Wonderful to meet you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, sir, you are the head of Google, which I love it when I love it when moderators tell  the person they're talking to something that the person you are the head of Google.  Really?  Wow.  It's like, OK.  Oh crap, I better get to work.  Yeah.  What am I doing here?  I thought I was out of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The biggest most important companies in America.  Thank you.  Now, hey, I didn't do it.  You guys did it.  You and your algorithms.  Yes.  Right.  It's an algorithm.  Yes.  That you guys make your cash by doing essentially data mining on what we Americans can do.  I'm bored already.  I'm sorry.  Not true.  I'm going to go with my explanation.  All right.  But you do know things about Americans that we maybe when we were children don't think  people would know about us.  Our likes, our dislikes are codified regionally, if not individually.  Correct?  I love the blank look.  It's true.  From Eric?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's just silent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh-huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm supposed to trust you on that.  Not only do you have to, but it's the law in a lot of countries.  Yes.  You can remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I guess my point is, I try not to.  They're pretty disturbing.  Now, by the way, why don't I get more hits when I put in tall women carrying heavy things?  Can you get on that?  Can you do anything about that?  Is that a site you're trying to promote?  No, just a general interest.  No ads come up for that.  Well, you need to work to get more content.  Okay, fantastic.  In that area.  So you wouldn't call that data mining?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we actually don't do data mining.  Awkward!  What we do is we go...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or data mining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Either one.  Data or data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why is that awkward, Jeff?  It's...  That was awkward.  No, just in a basic party kind of way that Eric's trying not to be funny and he's always  not being funny.  Right.  It's like listening to the Howard Stern guys call the dork on the phone who doesn't know  it's a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't watch his show on a regular basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is, you're right.  That's what Eric is told to do.  That's what he's supposed to do.  He's doing the right thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doesn't this happen all the time though, Gina?  It's kind of awkward because people are trying to...  They've got a funny guy and they're trying to be serious.  Yeah, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And listen, I mean, it's interesting.  I mean, Colbert says, you mine this data and Schmidt's like, whoa, we don't really  do data mining.  Does Google not do data mining?  Would you guys say that?  I mean, because data mining is like a very scary way to characterize what Google does.  But I mean, I don't know.  What is the technical definition of data mining?  I would say that Google...  Sure, you're right, Gina.  ...mines data from web pages to determine search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Data mining is the process of extracting patterns from data.  Well, hell yeah, they do data mining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I realize this is not a technical show, you know what I mean?  But it was interesting to see him say, well, we don't mine data.  We just figure out...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They do data strip mining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Talk about data mining.  They do mountain top removal mining.  So obviously what Schmidt is responding to is the underlying fear that people have that  it's your data that they're personally like somebody's old look what he looked at.  But it is exactly what data mining means is what Google does, extracting patterns from  data.  I wonder how he's going to justify that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our computers go out and they find out everything going on on the web and they figure out what  points to each other and that gives us the algorithm, which is called PageRank.  And that's how we decide how to rank the results.  And this algorithm...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, what he's done here is very clever.  He's changed the subject.  Well, we don't data mine when we spider.  But that's not what Colbert really is asking.  He's saying, are you paying attention to what I'm searching for?  Do you data mine search queries?  Which Google does.  By the way, is Eric wearing loafers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now I feel like we're being really mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry, but brown loafers in a gray suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, to his credit, he did say Google forgets over time.  Google forgets.  And they're talking about two different kinds of data in this conversation.  They're talking about like individuals browsing or search history and then like the data on  the web, the public data that's on the web.  There's nothing scary about the public data on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's what Schmidt did.  He gave a very clever sleight of hand, I thought.  He redirected this.  That was worthy of a...  He's clever.  That's a politician's answer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he's also...  Eric has had to learn not to try to be funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  His line about people being able to change their names at age 21, which I first heard  three years ago, he talked about it on the show.  He was joking.  Colbert asked him about it.  But he said it most recently.  Does he?  The whole audience laughed.  They said to press, all irony lost gets translated into German, all irony lost and Sledgehammer  added.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He admits that it's a bad joke in this interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At what point will Google's algorithm become self-aware and turn on its master?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hopefully not in our lifetimes.  It turns out that this algorithm is pretty straightforward.  It deals with really large things, enormous numbers of information, billions and billions.  It's what computers are good for.  Humans aren't very good at that.  Humans aren't very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Computers, that's why computers will eventually take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Humans are not very good at dealing with billions of things, whereas computers are.  I should scrub ahead of on this.  Where does he work?  There's one China, basically there's Hong Kong.  Oh, he's going to ask about China.  Oh, he talked about China, yeah.  There's one China, basically there's Hong Kong and mainland China, one country, two  systems.  We like the Hong Kong system better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, you famously said, and I completely support this, the idea that someday young people,  privacy for the things that they put up on Facebook, being able to expunge that since  once it's up there, it exists forever.  That one day they'll just erase their histories and change their names and they'll be scot-free.  It was a joke.  It just wasn't very good.  I guess that's too hip for the room.  No, it just wasn't a very good joke.  I was all for it because I think it would be very enticing as an employer to go, you  have no history and you changed your name yesterday.  Welcome aboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seriously what?  The serious goal is just remember when you post something that the computers remember  forever.  Whose computers?  Your computers?  Well, it's actually on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google just collects them.  That's a very good point.  Very good question.  Whose computers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we went kind of both ways.  Like at first he said, well, Google's computers forget after a certain amount of time because  that's a law.  And then he says, but don't put anything online that you don't want kept forever because computers  across the internet will remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I have to say, I think Schmidt has intentionally confused people.  There's two kinds of data.  There's the what's on the web data, the scrubbing data, and there's the search history data.  People's privacy issues are all about search data.  But when you post something on a website, Google saves that.  Just go to Google's cache.  The history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that's public information that someone has published.  There's no reason not to save it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You published it.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's a copyright question still not settled about caching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, I know...  Even about scraping a whole site to analyze it and though you don't serve it up, keep  it on your servers.  I think that that should be allowed, but there is a copyright fight that's going to come  at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and then there's people like Brewster Kahle at the archive.org who are saving terabytes  of data a day.  And on the side of the angels.  God bless them because that's our history and nobody else is saving it.  But if you're a teenager and the picture of you smoking pot is in that archive...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't have any in Amsterdam.  I didn't have any.  I swear to you, I haven't had any pot here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All you have to do is walk down the street and inhale more Google.  It's all out there on the web somewhere.  You just collect it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We collect it.  But where are the computers?  They're all over the world.  And if it's really juicy, there'll be copies everywhere.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was a bad thing to say.  The PR people are going, oh, we did it again.  Eric just loves...  See, he was trying to make a joke, right?  But that was exactly what you don't if you're Google PR.  He was trying to be smart.  He was being smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there anything that you don't want people to know about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, everybody has privacy and privacy is pretty important.  Not me, my life's an open book.  Well, we actually think privacy is pretty important.  We're actually making it possible for you to know what kind of stuff we have on you  and actually delete a whole bunch of...  Talking point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your company, famously, your motto is...  Don't be evil.  Don't be evil.  Right now, your stock price is $513 a share.  How low will that have to go before you say, that's it, we're going with evil?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You'd never be evil?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not even a little bit?  No, we were not evil when we had no stock price at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All men are sinners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Companies are legally people.  Welcome to America.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The company...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say, I love how Colbert injects actual serious content into a comedy show  because those are actually legitimate...  Absolutely.  At that point, I would have just been like, okay...  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead, Gina.  Gina first, then you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say, in that point of the conversation, if I was Schmidt, I would have just kind of  put up my hands, laughed along with the audience and let the interview end.  I mean, it was funny, but there's no way to come back from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's when did you stop beating your wife?  Right.  No, we're not evil.  No, we're not.  You can't win.  No, really, we're not evil.  Really.  You don't even want the word your evil associated with your name.  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that was smart of Schmidt to go ahead and finish it for him.  I know what you're going to say.  Right.  We're not evil.  But it just makes you...  And God bless the PR people.  They got to do what they got to do.  I'm not against them on this.  But you really wish you could instead be a webcam at dinner with Colbert and Schmidt  because the matching of those two brains would be awesome.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think we saw a little bit.  I'm not going to run anymore because...  We'll see little bits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've already probably done enough damage to this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There goes the YouTube clip, kids.  Get it from iTunes.  You have to watch it on iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So basically to summarize, and Publius has done this for me in the chat room, we don't  data mine.  We're not evil.  We don't store data.  But the web does.  I think these are all...  These are what the PR people sent him in with.  Those are the cards that Google would like to say, what's the point of having Eric Schmidt  on Colbert?  Jeff, is there any reason to put him on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting question.  I'm in Europe again and I'm watching the Germans go berserko again and Google got called before  a government commission here about street view again.  Supposedly hundreds of thousands of people have demanded their buildings be pixelated.  It's wacky over here.  So what's Google's problem in the US?  He's got a huge problem around the world, especially in Europe, especially in Germany.  I don't know what their PR problem really is in the US.  It's surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's no upside to Eric being on Colbert.  I'm really surprised he did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  I don't know.  I would say that Colbert is a younger audience.  They heard that quote about changing your name made the rounds.  I think Larry and Sergey have this kind of image of being sort of young nerds.  But Eric has that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's who you put on.  Why put Eric on?  Put Larry and Sergey on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's true.  Oh, because they can't do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Eric does have a sense of irony and humor in his own geeky way.  But I think that Larry and Sergey are just too serious in their way and couldn't ever  deal with Colbert.  So if Google is going to put anybody up there in front to be able to deal with this kind  of humor situation, Eric does have a sense of humor.  He's in a gray suit with brown pants, brown shoes.  Yes, he looks like the geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Baltimoreans said he should have worn an ice cream suit, ice cream uniform.  I would have laughed at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you wonder whether that was the condition of the interview that they don't show that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Better to do Colbert than Jon Stewart than The Daily Show.  I think The Daily Show would be a better...  I think it's hard to look good with Colbert.  Yeah.  I mean, it's like...  I mean, do you think Eric should go on with Howard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He can write off everything on Colbert to a joke.  Everything on Colbert at some level is a joke.  Whereas Stewart, that's not necessarily the case.  Stewart could sit down and start lecturing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true.  As he did CNN.  And he would probably.  Yeah, that's true.  It's an interesting choice.  And you asked the most important question.  Why does Google PR think that this needs to be done in the US?  What is the thing that they are fighting?  And Gina, would you say that young people, the people who watch the Colbert report, are  concerned about Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that he needed to come out and say that thing that I said about changing your  name, it was a joke.  It was a bad joke.  I think that that was probably worth doing the interview.  I thought so.  I think so.  I mean, Jeff had said that, so I knew that.  But I think that that line really got repeated.  And I think that young people that would watch the Colbert report were aware of that.  So mission accomplished.  Yeah, I would say so.  I think it was worth it just for that.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to move on.  More stories to talk about.  Let me ask you this.  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it the issue that Google has now about not being cool enough for employees?  Is it even a hiring issue to make Google cool again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe.  Maybe that's what's going on.  I think there are other ways they could have done that.  All they really have to do is hold some rock concerts on campus.  Things like that.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We've got to come back with more.  There's lots more to talk about.  Froyo on the DroidX, a new Gmail client for Android phones, some new Google services,  and a new way to find Google services, which is all coming up in just a second.  Before we go on, though, I do want to talk about our friends at squarespace.com.  If the time has come for you to build your own website, Squarespace is the place you  need to know about.  Squarespace is amazing.  I am a huge Squarespace fan.  We use Squarespace for our inside Twit blog, inside.twit.tv.  I'm moving the radio show to it.  Squarespace is both hosting and software.  So it is a content management system, but you run it on their servers.  And there's a real advantage to doing that.  You don't have to worry about security updates.  They're done for you automatically.  You don't have to worry about running out of bandwidth.  Squarespace can survive any attack.  You've never seen it be dug or slash dotted or tweeted to death.  Squarespace really has some great technology behind their servers.  Templates that aren't templated.  Every Squarespace site looks unique, is an expression of the site's creator.  And you don't need a designer if you're doing Squarespace.  You'll start with a really great template.  You could do like my friend Kevin Rose at dig does, which is use a very simple basic  theme.  That's what he's looking for.  Very clean or simple.  Or you can go have something a little bit fancier like Jeff Kanata from the Totally  Rad Show.  If you know CSS and JavaScript, there's nothing you can't do.  Here's the Miles Davis fan site and blog.  This is just beautiful, beautiful site.  Using the Squarespace gallery technology, the commenting engine.  I got to tell you, it is just really a great platform for your blog, your website.  If you're a photographer, go to squarespace.com slash twig right now.  You can try it for two weeks absolutely free.  You don't even need a credit card.  If you decide to buy, use the offer code twig and you'll get 10% off.  Ten percent off not just for one month or two, but for the life of the site.  Squarespace sites start at $13.33 a month, but even a gigantic, enormous, massive business  site can cost as little as $32 a year.  I mean really, really, I mean a month, I'm sorry, for a two-year commitment.  Really great stuff.  Import and export from all the major blog engines.  You give it a try, won't you?  Squarespace.com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  I was up late last night because my Froyo came in on my Droid X.  This is, I have to say, and you know, it runs great.  It's fast and everything and I've been using Froyo for a while on Nexus One, but it really  underscores as little as Motorola has done to customize this.  It's really a shame that the carriers and the manufacturers do modify the basic Android  operating system because in almost every case, they don't improve it.  You could make the case that some of HTC's widgets are pretty nice, but I don't think  they improve it necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, I'm out of town, so I don't know if you talked about this on Twitter, but the Samsung  tablet device, the fact that evidently it is not allowed to talk to a phone headset  or anything in the US and US only, is that evil?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're carriers, you know, you make a deal with the carriers.  It's going to be expensive if you don't get it subsidized, so everybody's going to want  to get the 3G version subsidized from Verizon, Sprint.  But then you can't use it as a phone.  But then you can't use it as a phone.  You can't even use Skype.  You can't even use Google.  Well, I don't know.  How are you going to use it if you can't put a headset on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't use Google Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you and there's questions about whether you can even get a Wi-Fi only version of the  thing.  Carriers are so evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, I mean, and, you know, M.G.  Siegler in the TechCrunch, we were going to have him on a couple of weeks, but and we'll  ask him at that time, wrote a post.  He's it's interesting because Mike Arrington over at TechCrunch is very much of a Android  fan. In fact, he's a Nexus One user, wrote a post this week saying, God, I tried the  iPhone. What a piece of crap.  I can't make a call.  You know, I just can't make a call.  It's worthless.  And M.G.  Siegler is saying Android, how horrible.  It's not even.  And so it's really interesting to watch.  But but one of the points M.G.  makes is how can you call it open when, in fact, because it's open source and anybody  can use it, all we ever get is these closed, limited versions.  You know, that was a good post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Open needs enforcement.  That's a net neutrality kind of argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't know, Gina.  I mean, if you open source something you're saying to people, do something with it, do  what you want with it.  Right. That's part.  That's what choice means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it is.  You know, M.G.'s post was was was interesting.  It gave me pause.  And I mean, I mean, his point was basically like in practice, openness is not necessarily  open. I mean, so what what can Google do?  Can Google put as a part of their Android license, you know, what what carriers can and  can't do with the operating system?  I'm curious on your droidex, Leo, what is how is Froyo different than on the Nexus one?  Are there have you noticed that there are certain parts of the.  Yeah, a lot of it's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For instance, I love the Froyo bar at the bottom where you have the browser stuff.  They Motorola modifies it.  So it's the same as the two point one bar that a modified blur bar that Motorola offers.  So you don't get that as an event.  Now, idiot made that decision.  That's stupid, isn't it?  Because that's an improvement that Google made and they basically turned off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they listen to people saying they love that change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I you know, I don't it baffles me.  Now, I'm I have two things to say.  One is cyanogen.  Yeah, because it's open now, admittedly, you have to be a geek to take advantage of this.  But because it's open, you have alternative ROMs which you can put on your system.  So you really do have choice if you know what you're if you're a sophisticated user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then but then someone could argue that the iPhone is just as open as you can jailbreak.  I guess so. You know, once you get to that argument, everything is open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you can jailbreak it, but you can't modify the OS.  I mean, true.  We have access to the OS source code so we can modify it.  Also, I'm not running the stock.  And I think this is somewhat because it's open.  I don't run the stock Motorola Blur.  I put Launcher Pro on there, which I was a pick a few weeks back,  which is an alternative launcher, which I like better than Froyo.  And it works fine. And I get all the advantages of Froyo.  And minus kind of the Motorola Blur stuff that I don't like.  Actually, I get the I get the best of both worlds because I can use  there. You know, there are blur widgets that I like, I guess.  I could use them if I want.  There's some features in blur I really like.  Can you do this, Gina? Can you highlight a widget?  Let me see if I can do this.  Maybe it's not going to work on that one.  Highlight a widget and then resize it.  On on your standard Nexus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm trying it with Pandora.  No, all I can do is trash it. I can't.  I can't resize it. So you can tap and hold and I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like a window and I can drag it and make different sizes.  So I can fill up as much of the screen as I want with this widget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That might be a per widget thing. What widget is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is a launcher pro widget, but it isn't it isn't it isn't per.  It doesn't seem to be per widget because I could do it with the audible widget

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  as well. Can you do it with Pandora?  Let me see here. I have that one as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In a truly open source world, that just means something  that the community could then choose to implement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can do it with Pandora.  So now, of course, depending on the widget, I don't know if it'll have  you know, if it'll use that space intelligently.  But that I'm pretty sure is a Motorola feature.  I think that that's something that looks that way.  It comes with the blur.  It doesn't come with launcher pro.  Doesn't come with Froyo comes with Motorola.  So that might be an improvement.  I guess.  You get a couple of there's a couple of bad things that happen.  One is you get a lot of phones that like this galaxy tablet  are crippled in some way.  The other issue is you it's there's no standard look or feel.  So your users are confused a little bit, even with Windows,  with as much choice as you had with Windows.  When you get a Windows machine, you know how to use it.  You have the start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to get worse with tablets because things are going to work  with various sizes, five inch, seven inch, ten inch. God knows. Right.  Let me ask you both, though, in an open source ethic.  When Motorola does that neat change to change the size  the widget, shouldn't that be part of the general code base?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe in the ethic, but not in the requirements because Google used.  OK, now correct me if I'm wrong, Gina, but they use the GPL for the kernel  for and I think for Dalvik, but they use the Apache license.  For other stuff, which means doesn't have that viral thing  that's in the GPL, which says if you create something with our code,  you have to use the same license for the thing that you create,  which is a controversial, but I think critical feature of the GPL.  I think it's very important.  It's what made open source work is that you couldn't just use somebody's  open source creation, modify it and then keep it closed.  But the Apache, I think it's the Apache license they're using.  Let's let you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Apache license is more liberal.  The GPL says that if you distribute modified code, you have to  you have to make that code, you have to contribute it back  or make that code code available.  But the Apache license is more liberal.  It doesn't. It says you can distribute without right.  Without necessarily giving it back.  And, you know, there's so many layers to Android.  There's, you know, the front end, there's the kernel.  So it really it really depends.  I mean, you know, even for something that's just themable, you know,  is a theme isn't necessarily protected under the same license.  So I'm actually not sure what the layers are, are what the licenses are  for the different layers in Android.  But if you're right, Leo, it sounds like the carriers can make these  make these changes without necessarily giving them, you know,  getting back into the Android core.  And even if they do send them back to Google, Google doesn't have to accept them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. It's my it's my sense that that's exactly why Google chose the Apache  license and blur and the HTC sense and the Samsung modifications.  Those are all examples of non open source modifications.  But maybe the other reason Google did it is because remember,  Cyanogen got in trouble because there are some Google apps on top of this  that are not open or related to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gmail is one of those apps.  So Gmail is a closed source app that's distributed by Google, separate from Android.  And what was happening is any time you got a new release of Android,  you would get the new update to Gmail.  So they just decoupled Gmail from Android this week.  So if you want you there's a new version of the Gmail app for Android,  which, in my opinion, is one of the number one reason to use Android  if you're a Gmail user, because the Gmail experience on Android is unparalleled.  But now it's in the market.  So you download the Gmail app separately from from Android.  And and the new Gmail updates are minor, but they're really awesome.  There's preliminary support for priority inbox.  So if you have priority inbox and Gmail, there's now an important label.  Yes. And you can actually you can even add a shortcut to that to any Gmail label.  But you can add the shortcut to the important label on your home screen.  Right. So you just tap on it.  Important. It also the scroll.  You can high show quoted text the same way you can do in the web client.  If you open up a thread and you scroll, it fixes header information at the top.  It's just the experience.  The reply button is top and center and a lot more a lot more prominent.  So it's easy to reply. It's just it's a it's a great update.  So if you have an updated Android on your or Gmail on your Android phone,  grab it in the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Must have. It just really is great.  And, you know, they did they make a big deal about it because I didn't.  You know, I just noticed there was a new Gmail app.  I didn't see some. Oh, get it, get it, get it until I started.  People seeing tweets about it and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they did a post about it, I think, on the mobile blog, just saying,  hey, we decoupled it from Android.  So you have to wait for a new Android release for Gmail, get it in the market.  Use QR code.  They made too much of a big deal about it, but I was thrilled.  I mean, especially the priority inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So how can I so I can make important.  I can make the icon.  You're saying the icon on the on the desktop, which right now goes to the  whatever I've picked the last time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you if you just tap and hold the home screen and add and add a shortcut.  Oh, OK. I can choose what that it's.  Yeah. So just tap and hold the free area.  OK. And then go to shortcuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then it'll be a Gmail.  OK, we're going to scroll down Gmail label.  There you go. Email label.  Yeah. And say use the important label.  OK, because it's then choose the important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. Oh, oh.  And you can rename it something and then and then hit done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is great.  They also change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a funny I had a funny moment in my class this week  where I was extolling the wonders of Gmail's priority.  And half the class, half my class hates it.  And it turns out those who are organized don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, because you're already doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. It's so funny that you say that, because I was this just this week,  I was realizing how much email I just wasn't paying attention to at all  because it wasn't priority.  Like before, I emptied my inbox all the time.  And now I just empty my priority inbox.  But stuff is getting, you know, some people are sending me stuff  or my prof, you know, kind of cold call emails that I wasn't paying attention to  because they're not marked as important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it. Well, I'm disorganized, too, and I love it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that it's created a neat split in the world.  Yeah. Where Google was solving a problem for only some proportion mankind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. You well, if it.  Yeah. So but that makes saying gives you a choice.  If you're disorganized, we'll do it for you. Yeah. Yeah.  We'll fix it.  And it does a good job as you have to train it a little bit.  You do. But yeah, it does a very good job.  So all three of us are really depressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hit one point this week where my important  thread and more than one page.  Yeah, I said all of it.  Oh, it's our first three ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, that is my that's my breaking point.  When my Gmail conversations go off the first page, that's when I that's when I'm like,  OK, I really need to stop and deal with this. It's weird.  It's this 50.  You know, I had one of my developers who I communicate with on the mailing list all  the time emailed me individually and I hadn't responded.  And he I am me like, was I a victim of your priority inbox?  Am I not? Did you get my mail?  Is it in your inbox?  Is it important?  So that's been that was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see. Let me think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got Arrington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, let's I want to take a break and then we're going to come back.  And I want to get your opinions on what's going on with Mike Arrington.  I'll tell you one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a show. There's a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One thing and it happens every week, but one thing is very clear.  We should do this week in Mike Arrington, Twima.  The one thing is very clear that Mike really knows how to stir the pot.  And of course, if you're a blogger, that's probably your primary skill.  It's an important skill.  On the one hand, he's being applauded by people who say,  you know, Mike, this is the this is the future of journalism.  Mike is a real honest thought in the world journalist.  On the other hand, he's being decried as a sensationalist.  We will let you be the judge in just a bit before we do that, though.  I would like to talk a little bit about our fine sponsor hover.com.  If you're doing domain registration, I want to point you to hover.com.  These are some nice guys.  In fact, Elliot from Two Cows, who runs two cows and who runs this company,  came up to me at South by Southwest and said, hey, I really applaud  your stand on GoDaddy.  I've been kind of critical of GoDaddy for a lot of reasons, one because of their  silly sexist ads, which really bugged the heck out of me.  But more importantly, because  you try to register a domain there, it's 80 clicks before you can check out.  You got to they sell so many other.  No wonder they make eight hundred million dollars a year.  They sell so much other stuff.  So he said, you know, we've got something called hover.com.  It's it's we just kind of updated Domains Direct, which has been around for a long  time. I used it years ago and he said, I want you to just take a look at it.  We've decided to really simplify  the domain registration process to make it clean, simple and effective.  This is a good business model.  I love it. Yeah, it is, isn't it?  It's just kind of responding to the clutter.  There are always going to be people who say, hey, we're going to make more money  by upselling you by cluttering.  And you know what? If it doesn't bother you, go ahead and use it.  But see, I go to hover.com.  It is as simple as can be.  They have the domain name search that you look for and they do all of the TLDs  that you'd expect, including some oddball ones like me.uk and tell and BZ  and of course, TV and CA and US and so forth.  But then it's simple.  You say, yes, I'll take that.  You click it and you're done.  No upsell.  In fact, if you use Twig, if you go to twig.hover.com,  you'll save 10 percent right now on the domain registration.  They don't do hosting, but they do do domain forwarding with no email  starting at fifteen dollars a year.  If you want them to do email hosting, they do do that.  And I think this is a great solution for somebody who says,  I don't need a website, maybe, but I would like to have my name as my email  and use forwarding so that I don't have to change my email address  any time I change email providers.  This is a great way to do it.  Register your name.  Register your kid's name when they're born.  So they have their own email address, their own site.  If they want to attach a site to it, of course they can.  Meanwhile, at Hover manage the email forwarding.  Twig.hover.com, clean, simple.  And I really like their no hold policy for calls to come in during business hours  Monday through Friday.  They promise to get you right to a service rep and won't put you on hold.  Twig.hover.com.  Give it a try. They're really great people with a great service,  very affordable and 10 percent off when you use twig.hover.com.  We thank them for their support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm excited we have a non-evil domain registrar to that sponsoring the show  and also that I can recommend.  I also am on a crusade against GoDaddy and people always ask me,  so where, you know, where should we switch to?  So check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is one to use.  Yeah.  It's just, you know, I use GoDaddy.  And in fact, I think I still I've been moving all my stuff off to Hover.  I think I still have one or two domains still on GoDaddy,  because frankly, they make it very hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They may. They do. They do make it hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I could go on and on, but I won't.  Not Hover, GoDaddy.  GoDaddy does not want you to move.  And they keep changing my password.  They just do all sorts of sneaky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like trying to cancel an AOL account back in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speaking of names, have you guys seen about.me,  which kind of lands squarely in the Google profiles arena?  What is it?  It's a it's a basically it's a personal it's a personal page.  And they're beautiful.  It's actually it's like a Google profile, except it's really beautiful looking.  It's got a really nice design.  So we go to about.me.  You can reserve your name.  So it's this kind of, you know, gold rush for people's people's names  to get their names.  It's not open right now.  I signed up and said, hey, you know, give me my name.  Here's my email address.  And I actually literally just before the show started, I got my, you know,  come set up your page.  So I haven't set it up yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody's already got Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Yeah, try.  Try Leo. Sorry, I should have told you this before we went on the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody's already got Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eric Arangin has a good looking page there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, there's some really beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody's already got Leo Laporte.  OK, I guess they all registered.  This is, you know, that's fine.  You know, this is kind of I saw this as a trend a few months ago  where people are putting like their business card basically as a web page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, right.  If flavors.me is a similar service.  So, yes, it's kind of kind of interesting about that.  Me happens to be a fantastic domain, but it's interesting that it kind of  during this time of Google, Google me and the profiles.  But I mean, I think people really just want the definitive page  that describes them.  And Google profiles does a good job of that, but it's not it's not that pretty.  It's got that kind of Google UI look about it.  And some of these are just really, really nice for designer types,  design types.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They gave Ryan Block and Peter Rojas and Veronica Belmont a page.  They gave. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they did manage to get a lot of the A list to to try it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Howard Linsen has a page.  Well, I guess I won't be going there.  Well, I can't get my name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, so so Leo Laporte is already taken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But this is a Chris.  It looks like Chris Saka is the number one person.  It's probably Chris Saka's site. Here's Veronica's site.  So this is cool. So you put a picture, you put what your Twitter is,  you put your bio. It's not that's it.  It's one page. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I believe it does some social media.  It connects your social media accounts and it does some analytics there,  which, like I said, I haven't set mine up yet.  So I haven't seen that. But on the front page, you can see there are some graphs.  And obviously, I'm interested in this because I think so.  I'll try it out. Are you going to be Gina Tripani?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gina, what are you going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to be Gina Tripani. I'll just be my full name.  Why not be Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or what's the argument pro and con on Leo, Leo Laporte or Gina versus Gina Tripani  or Jeff versus Jeff Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For me, first of all, I can't get Gina, not with like Gina Gershon.  It's just too short a name. It's too common and too short.  And I mean, if I had to do it all over again,  I may have used my middle name to be sort of even more specific  because there are just other people with my first and last name.  But back in the day, when I started using first last name,  I just didn't hadn't thought about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Danette. Bernadette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Marie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Marie, of course it's Marie. A nice Italian name.  Of course, a nice Italian name.  Maria. Oh, that's Marie.  I don't know. I always think I just I use Leo Laporte just everywhere.  Leo seems...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's your brand, Leo, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not Elvis for crying out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you have gotten to a point where I say Leo.  When I talk about you, I just say Leo.  I'm not even Dion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I guess I mean, there aren't any other Leos, I don't think, in the tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you remember last week, I got in trouble for saying Uncle Leo  and he thought it was him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's right. But that was the Seinfeld Leo.  I don't think he counts.  Wait, let me see if Uncle Leo is taken.  Now that I could live with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure you could talk to the About Me folks and get Leo Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is an interesting it was a hipster trend for a while.  And mostly web designers who would create this wonderful, beautiful,  you know, like business card page.  And sometimes people just use and you could do this at hover, by the way.  Gina Trapani dot me.  Yep. Or dot name, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dot name. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's pretty. If Google doesn't point to those pages, then they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's why the profile ultimately doesn't have the inside track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And all this. Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll see, though, if they ever take advantage of it.  I can't get can't get Uncle Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't mean to derail the conversation.  I just been. No, it's a good conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Mike Harrington, a blogger, walks into a bar.  Actually, is is is it's actually kind of the the title of his  a blogger walks into a bar as his tech crunch post.  Mike Harrington's again, he's showing he's just brilliant in terms of driving traffic.  Mike hears about he was tipped off, he says.  And Mike's a storyteller.  So some of this may be, you know,  dramatization.  Yesterday, I was tipped off about a quote secret meeting and quote,  secret meeting and quote between a group of quote super angels and quote  being held at Bin 38, a restaurant and bar in San Francisco.  I was told, do not come.  You will not be welcome.  So I did what any self-respecting blogger would do.  I like it that Mike said blogger.  For some reason, that that kind of like validates it, right?  I drove over to bit 38, parked my car and walked in.  And you got to commend him for doing that. Right. Thumbed his nose.  At the back of the restaurant, a private room was, by the way,  I think that's right there. That's distinctive good.  I don't know. Is it journalism, Jeff? What do you call that?  Yeah, of course it is. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's the thing is that as you talked about this, Leo, before,  I was thinking that there are the accidental journalists.  Harrington never intended to become a journalist.  He's a lawyer who wrote about this stuff because it was going to help as a BC fund.  Right. Henry Blodgett, an analyst who went through hell and comes back out.  And as a journalist, I hesitate to throw Mark Cuban in there,  but he's invested in things that are quasi journalism.  I like that. These are people who believe in journalism,  who believe in finding stories and telling the truth to people.  That's frigging journalism. And that's what Harrington does in this case.  No one could say that he was he was off in the conclusions that he drew,  but in process journalism, which he and I talk about each in our own way a lot.  That's part of the story. Hey, these guys were really good.  These guys were out at dinner. What do you think happened?  You think they were doing no, no, you think there was OK.  You tell me what you think.  But I, gee, it's worth asking you, isn't it?  And that's what it is. That's a new kind of journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said in the back of the restaurant was a private room with a long oval table  sitting around the table, Godfather style.  Or Last Supper style.  I mean, you could have been  where 10 or so of the highest profile angel investors in Silicon Valley.  These investors known as super angels because they've mostly moved on  to launch small venture funds of their own are all friends of mine.  I knew each person in the room very well, very, very well, he says.  I certainly didn't think anything was amiss.  I expected a friendly hello and an invitation to sit down for a drink or two  before being shooed off while they talked about whatever they thought  should be kept off record.  Instead, it went something like this. Me. Hey.  Person who is talking. Oh, oh, no. Me. Hi.  I heard you guys were here.  I wanted to stop by and say hi.  Them. Dead silence.  Me. So them deafening silence.  Me. This is usually where you guys say sit down, have a drink.  Them. Not one sound.  Me. This is awkward.  I guess I'll be leaving now.  He says, I've never seen now this is where OK.  So far, so good.  This is where it goes downhill.  I've never seen a more guilty looking group of people.  He says, lively conversations often die quickly when I arrive.  I've learned not to take it personally.  Well, I know if that's the case, but but I did sniff around a little after.  I think he takes it very personally.  But but I did sniff around a little afterwards.  And I've spoken to three people who are at that meeting.  And this is where things got interesting. He says.  These guys were colluding.  They decided they wanted to counteract Paul Graham's Y Combinator  because of its growing power.  They were complaining about rising deal valuations  and deciding to act as a group to reduce those valuations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How would be a definition of that's collusion and illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Clearest definition. I don't know.  Is it illegal? It would be illegal if.  Company's price fixing.  Well, but is there a price?  This isn't a price. This is how much we're going to invest.  I don't know, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, but you're going to you're going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's more it's morally wrong.  I'll grant you it's morally it's morally wrong.  I don't know if it's illegal.  I don't know if it if it's a legal issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the weird thing is price fixing usually happens on the sell side.  Right. These are buyers.  Fixing on the buy side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You and I can collude not to pay more than a certain price for a product.  In fact, if I can get everybody in the country to say  we will never pay more than five dollars a year for domain registration.  Is that illegal? No. That's called consumer action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but investors and consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I admit that certainly it's ethically challenged,  whether it's illegal is the question.  Yeah, how the group can.  It is fascinating. Yeah.  And you know, how the group can act together to keep traditional  venture capitalists out of deals entirely.  You know who would of course and who it harms is the the startup.  Trying to get money.  Apparently, there's a wiki.  He says one source says there's a wiki that the group  which the group explicitly talks about how they should act to keep valuations down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, is that stupid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If there's a wiki, that's a mistake.  Now, now, Dave McClure, who was one of the guys there, said, this is bogus.  We weren't talking about anything like that.  We're we're we're drinking and having fun.  We just didn't want Mike to be there.  He says, Mike, you don't get invited to everything.  I don't get invited to everything.  That's just the way it is in life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On the other hand, Henry Blodgett, these guys now have enough power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well, they could be. You've got to be careful.  They could be colluding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Henry Blodgett. I sat I sat in meetings in the newspaper industry  where they made sure there was a lawyer in the room before so much as the wine was  ordered. My father walked out of a price fixing meeting back in his day.  One of my things I'm very proud of him.  And that's part of the issue of the newspaper industry with this idea of  everybody going behind a paywall.  That is collusion.  And there the newspaper industry is going to the feds trying to get  antitrust exemptions so they can just talk.  So these guys hold a power in a market.  And you may think they're innocent, but what we know so and they may well be  they may not have been there, but Aronson one way or another, raised  a really important issue.  Good. So we're Fred Wilson on his post saying, I don't think it's bad  happen, but boy, I'm glad he did it.  Now, Fred, you've got to say exactly was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fred is a VC who might be might be somebody who would be harmed by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, because Fred's a VC rather than an angel, though VCs are more and more and  more becoming angels. Fred is investing at the level that he wants the system to  be. He never would put in much smaller stakes, much smaller companies, because  that's the new reality. So VCs are not competing with angels.  Angels can come together because they do in the VCs world, stupid stuff.  And now they can hold a sway.  You've got the seed accelerators like Y Combinator, Beta Works, Seed Camp  versus the angels versus the VCs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mike, at the end of the post says, and he's a lawyer, so I'll defer to him, he  says, it's absolutely unlawful for competitors to act together to keep other  competitors out of the market or to discuss ways to keep prices under control.  And that appears to be exactly what this group is doing.  That's a little strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that appears to be.  Unless he has them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, he doesn't know.  I mean, he has sources.  He says on a side note, this is a difficult post to write because I call  nearly every person in that room a friend, but these actions are so completely  inappropriate. It has to be called out.  He says included just about every.  I salute.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I salute him because he's raising an issue and fine if nothing happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These guys are not going to go out and have drinks together in an organized  fashion again.  And they're going to be cautious about this now.  And they're going to be cautious about this now.  And that's the role of a journalist is to be a watchdog and to say we are watching  you. And I'm fascinated that nothing is secret or private.  These people could get together.  Somebody smelled a rat and they called the rat keeper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say, I didn't mean if you're going to do it, though, don't have it in a  public place. Have it at somebody's house.  God knows their houses are big enough to host a party.  Then you don't have to worry about Mike pulling up.  Maybe they're too cheap.  Ken Sheppardson, our VP engineering, says this is just one ad for bin 38.  It's just a bit. It's just a.  Where great deals get made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like that movie that wants his name in the movie that's just out.  That's all it was out to be a fraud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Joaquin Phoenix, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. Oh, yeah, that was wild.  Yeah, that whole thing that he did on Letterman with the beard and he was like  stoned out. That was all an act.  And it was for a movie that was a weird document, a fake documentary  about a guy who is weird.  Man, that's that's commitment to your art.  Be willing to have the entire world think that you are a drugged out  nutcase for your art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think that was was right or wrong in this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, I'm not sure.  I'm not sure. I think somebody besides Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's say it. If it were anybody but Mike, we'd all go, yeah, that was great.  That was the right thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that that's a very good read on the situation.  Yeah, it's I'm hesitating to say that I think he did the right thing  because Arrington is, you know, he's he's funny.  He's he likes to stir the pot.  He's big drama. He's yeah, he stirs the pot. Exactly.  So so, yes, I agree with I agree with Jeff, but I I don't trust.  Arrington fully, so I that's why I'm hesitating.  It's a little sorry, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. So so what you're saying, Leo, I think, is that Arrington  went with this in a journalistic sense prematurely.  The New York Times would have verified more.  Oh, God, yes.  It will do him before having said it.  But that's why Arrington's view of process journalism, he throws it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and of course, we know that it might Mike.  And this is the only problem I have really with TechCrunch all along is  that he will get a source and he'll go with it.  And he's and he's even said, and I'll correct it later if it's wrong.  And and that's why I underlined right at the beginning that he said as a blogger.  He didn't say as a journalist, as a reporter, as an investigative reporter,  he said as a blogger.  And I think even he is consciously saying, explicitly saying  I'm going to I'm going to throw these accusations out,  even if they're unfounded, unsupported, even if they don't stand up to a test  that a journalistic entity like the New York Times would insist upon.  I as a blogger, I'm going to throw these out.  And that's what to me is the most interesting about this.  I think we could acknowledge if it were anybody but Mike, if it's if it's  Ryan Block, who wrote this article.  Well, first of all, I don't think anybody besides Mike would  would jump to this collusion thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, anyone with a history of being a little more measured,  I think we would take this a little more seriously.  This is what we're saying, right?  I mean, yeah, and that's and that's Mike's, you know, clean up the mess later.  I'll put it out there and clean up the mess later.  That's his that's his M.O.  Right. And that's that's that's fine.  That's one way to to to do it.  This means that people aren't going to take you as seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  So he's never been, you know, secretive about that.  He says that's what I do.  Yeah. And Mike, that's that's this is the price you pay is that people go,  well, Mike's saying it. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I went to work for a big media company.  I was trained in  the sensitivities of the company to our number one union stuff  and number two antitrust because it had been burned before. Right.  And that kind of meeting would never happen in the newspaper industry.  And if it did, I'm not saying I should take it back.  It would happen.  But if it did, certain people would would run away from it,  knowing that there was trouble to be had.  Yeah, I think it did happen in relation to paywalls.  But I think certain people in the industry would say,  I'm not going anywhere near that because it's trouble.  So at one point, I think went too far on how he expressed it.  He could have expressed everything he said as a question.  What if? Gee, why would these get together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he says he has sources who were at the thing.  Dave McClure is at the thing, said this is bogus.  We got together to shoot the breeze.  And, you know, it's he said, she said.  But so but and I and, you know, we're now here's the funny part. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All the people there, they're starting to get there.  There's now lists coming out of who is there.  So they're all now I forget that game  theory thing, but they're now all looking around each other,  wondering who called Arrington.  So they don't trust each other. You're right.  This is the funny thing.  He has instilled a lack of trust in the most powerful angels  in the most powerful industry in the world.  That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to kind of appreciate that.  You do have to appreciate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to appreciate Mike in general.  I mean, the guy is very good at what he does week in week out.  He comes up with this stuff.  Three days ago, he said Facebook's doing a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Equally, Facebook denied it, and he said  the PR people are on the need not to know list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is this is Mike for Mike. This is perfect.  He says, my sources says Facebook is doing a phone.  It makes sense based on Joe Hewitt being there and the Android guy being there.  And and I love this defense of his story.  Yeah, that's what Apple and Google said when I said they were doing a phone.  Oh, well, that proves it.  But but.  So really, what I'm saying is this is the new era of blogger journalism.  And for blogger journalism, as opposed to traditional journalism,  getting the page views is all that matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A little unfair. OK.  Not wrong, not wrong, but not always fair, because I think that it's also  what Arrington would say, and he and I use this phrase together,  is that in process journalism, you throw it out there and you see what sticks.  Now, I'm trained and you're trained to throw in so many caveats  reputedly, I asked them and this and that.  He says, screw it, I'll throw it out there.  If it's right, as you said before, if it's wrong, correct it.  And that's not the standards by which we operated or the New York Times operates.  And I think that I would probably if I were in Arrington,  she was putting more caveats nonetheless.  There is a move to process journalism, which is true of Arrington and Denton.  It says throw it out there. See what's right.  Here's what we know. Here's what we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, by the way, Mike, as a result of the Facebook story,  got a face to face interview with Mark Zuckerberg, who began the interview  by apologizing to Mike for the miscommunication.  Our folks are trying to reach out to you and weren't able to reach you  before we issued our statement.  Zuckerberg explains that, well, we're not doing a physical phone.  We're looking at making software layers on phones.  So. Wow.  Yeah, but Mike was saying they were going to build.  I don't know now if Mike's pulling back and saying, oh, OK,  so you're not going to make the phone.  It I don't know, I haven't read the whole thing in great detail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this is where I got into a screening Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm so excited about this.  Amber MacArthur saw it last night and loved it.  Everybody who's seen it says it's one of the best films of the year.  This is we're talking about the social network, the Facebook movie,  whatever it whatever its accuracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Zuck says that it's not it's not accurate and he's not going to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I wouldn't go if I were him, I might.  Well, I guess he has amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or the hoodie entire movie about me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to know what they're saying.  But what if they said that, like, they really trashed you as a person?  Wouldn't wouldn't that be painful?  And there's really no good way to respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Well, right.  But at least I mean, you're going to get asked questions about the movie.  At least you have to have answers.  You know, you have to have the context.  Listen, I'm sure that it would be difficult, like, you know, from an ego,  for your ego to see the movie.  But at the same time, the movie is, you know, getting released nationally.  This is the impression that people are going to have of you.  Whether or not it's true. Right.  I think that you'd want to know what that impression was so that you, you know, could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't we talk about this last week, the article in All Things Digital? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The New Yorker profile, you mean?  Well, there's a New Yorker profile, but then you're crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then the guy who saw it at all things digital, his name escapes me, said,  I feel for Zuckerberg because this paints him as a terrible person.  And it's the only thing most people are ever going to see.  So and that's why Mark's doing, you know, that's why Mark's talking to Mike Harrington.  That's why Mark's talking to the New Yorker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apologize to Eric to start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he'll be on Colbert. You're right.  Has he done Colbert ever?  That would be awkward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interview I'd want to see. Awkward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, boy, is that the train wreck you want to see? Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they'd spray him with water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think Colbert would know what to do with Zuckerberg.  You know, here's I haven't seen the movie yet,  but here's what I want to be on the watch out for.  I wonder whether there is a geek bigotry backlash coming.  You mean anti geek that these geeks have taken over the.  And we don't understand them and they're all weird.  Yeah. And we're going back to the jocks making fun of the geeks.  And that's what I'm afraid of here.  It always goes back to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll see. You know what, Jeff, it always goes back to that,  especially in the US.  I don't know. You're you're more an expert on international, but in the US,  we hate intellectuals. We will always hate intellectuals.  They'll always have that egghead, you know,  and and I think when they're billionaires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if if there is even this short period of honeymoon period over over geeks,  it ain't going to last because eventually people are going to know  there's two smart, they don't like smart people and you're rich and smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, and when I when I did get the chance to sit down with them  for an hour straight on the book, I was kind of looking and this is this is  I can't say this and there's no way I can say this right.  So I'll just say it is that I was looking for popular renditions of Asperger's.  Right. Right. Is this kind of this is commonly held character trait?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Commonly held or common characterization of Mark is that  maybe he's got a little Asperger's or something.  Maybe he's got some social issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And I didn't see it. Yeah.  And I think it's the same.  It's the same with Eric Schmidt telling a joke.  Geeks are different and we can celebrate that when it's on Big Bang Theory.  Right. But in real life, we don't know how to deal with it.  And and the truth is geeks are in charge now. Yeah.  We're going to have a geek president.  You know, Eric Schmidt or somebody like him is going to be president soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, then I'm a little scared.  Is he going to wear his ice cream?  Hey, kids, vote for me.  I already know everything about you.  Will we have you know, we had arguably we did have a geek president.  His name was Jimmy Carter and he was thrown out of office in four years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was a frigging disaster.  They sent me his book for free and I immediately my wife  to just give away to the rummage sale.  I couldn't stand Carter. How thick is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it really thick? Oh, oh, I'm actually dying to read it because it's his diaries.  It's his diaries from the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to make me so mad.  He's just such a screw up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he was a geek. He was a nuclear engineer.  He was an absolute wonk.  He was a policy wonk.  He was very thoughtful. Right. You're right.  He was the he was our first geek president.  Actually, Thomas Jefferson was our first geek president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That come to think of it, Jimmy Carter could not have run a company. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He wasn't an administrator. You think? No. No.  I, I, of course, live, breathe and work with geeks all the time  and have come to love them.  But I fully understand their social issues.  And I think if you are not used to them, they do come off as being something wrong with them.  You know, a normal person goes, what's wrong with them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You are a normal person and a geek. She's both.  You know, right. How do you see.  This relational quandary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The normal people not understanding the geeks being weird introverts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Is there is there kind of a geek bigotry?  Greek geek backlash, do you think or or if they're weird?  Are you treated as a geek?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, when you meet people, do they go you're kind of strange?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, but that's because I'm not sort of a nerdy looking guy.  Like, I don't look like a geek.  I don't look like you don't act like a geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're also charming. You relate to people. Yeah.  You look people in the eye. You smile.  I mean, you can make the case that every you don't have any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can make the case that everybody in this room is a geek.  But I don't think any of us are that particular, any social type of geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I mean, I think that we all probably share.  I mean, you know, I have like a very strong, like sense of introversion  during the show is hard for me because it's kind of so public.  And talking like really drains me.  And like I tend to being very sort of brief and to the point, you know, an email.  And I have to kind of force myself to say, hey, how are you?  I mean, kind of go the other way.  And this is just kind of how I decided to deal with it, because I realized that it  just, you know, when you when you relate to people, when you greet them, kind of,  you know, in those ways, those friendly ways, you get a better response.  I think that that some geeks are so sort of intellectual that it's just hard.  They just like there's not the point.  You know, there's no point to that.  And I get the impression that Mark is a very terse speaker and he doesn't go.  It doesn't go to do those niceties.  That's why I was actually honestly surprised that he opened up that interview  with Arrington by apologizing for the miscommunication.  That seemed like a very sort of warm thing to do.  Even the New Yorker  reporter who profiled him said that he's his communication style is is off putting  he kind of looks off to the side.  He speaks in very short sentences.  You know, he you know, he's not and he's not a great, great interviewer either.  I don't think that there's necessarily a backlash going on.  I think geeks are actually kind of culturally like over time, really,  since the early 80s with Gates are becoming sort of more accepted.  And I think that now you're much more likely to hear high school students  identify as geeks and laugh about it.  Whereas, you know, back in the day, you would never admit to being one.  And that was a bad word, you know.  So I don't think it's too bad, although I think with with with Mark,  it's like people say he's 26, he's a billionaire,  he's stealing everybody's data, then he's horrible.  I mean, I think that that's the impression people have of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You talk to him, Jeff, what I want to say is a vulnerability is all of that accurate.  Is that is that the mark that you talk to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it actually isn't.  But the thing is, I've watched Mark.  I go back to watching him at a four square conference like three or four years ago.  And the interesting thing about him is that is the I loved him at the time  because he just gave direct answers.  He didn't put any flowers in the bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I love engineers. I love engineers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. Here is the answer.  That's that. Yeah.  You know, the other example that occurs to me as we talk about this is is how Craig Newmark.  In trying to respond to the CNN  ambush on him, who who didn't call himself,  I don't think he called himself aspirate per se.  No, Craig is very geeky.  I can't change subjects. Yeah.  Oh, I'm a friend of Craig, and I've said this in my blog that that  he's as hard for me to read as a Proust, the C++. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he's got a very bland affect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, there's irony there.  You can't tell what's irony, what's real and all that kind of stuff.  But but but he says of himself, his self-awareness is  I have trouble changing subjects.  I have trouble relating to people. I have trouble doing this.  I have trouble doing that. This show and this network is the last place

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would ever say, you know, oh, you geeks.  I mean, that's that's we're just a bunch of neck beards  that we happen to have shaved today. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a new one on me, Leo.  That's a new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You see, every other day of the week, I look like a complete troll.  And I don't say anything more than two words.  I just transformed into, you know, the twig princess on Wednesday,  just for you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Rotten Tomatoes, this is the chat room.  Just sent me this link to Rotten Tomatoes.  Only seven reviews so far, 100 percent on the tomato meter.  Only the godfather and Citizen Kane come close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

You've already done a tip, but do you want to do another one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, sure. I've got this is this is pretty cool.  This is actually more of a tool for my inbox zero folks, fellows and ladies  and arms, the number zero Boxer dot com zero Boxer dot com.  It's pretty cool. It's a Chrome and Firefox extension.  You install it and it gives you points and you earn badges for all  for the way that you deal with your email.  So every time you archive an email, you get you get a point.  If you delete, you know, send email.  Make it a game.  So it adds this game mechanic to processing your inbox.  And then, you know, if your friends are using it,  you can see how they're doing.  They're just leaderboard.  And I just installed it. And it's really kind of fun.  It makes archiving email and emptying your inbox like really satisfying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's easy to do. Use a ZOA.  That's fantastic. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it just adds points kind of across the top.  So when you hit that wide archive and email, you get a point.  Very, very satisfying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I can't wait.  Does it put the points on your on your Gmail account?  I mean, do you see it? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You see it across the top of your Gmail account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is on Tripani. It is on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've always thought that would feel like dealing with the inbox  is kind of a game of Tetris.  You know, it's just like they keep coming in.  You have to clear them away, you know, faster than they come in.  And this kind of gives you that same that same kind of satisfying game mechanic

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in your email process. I love this.  Oh, I'm so excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And thanks to Lifehacker for that tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you select a couple of emails, you'll get points.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Gina, could that get leaked?  Because if somebody hacked that,  you then tell someone Gina doesn't think you're important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This, you know, this is the thing.  This is an interesting question because you use all off to say  zero boxer can have access to my to my email.  And with that always comes the you know, from I paused and it's like  zero boxer reading all my email or they just detecting when I archive and send.  I think they're just detecting when I archive and send.  I don't believe that there's no reason why they should be able to detect labels  and all that.  But hopefully no one will will hack zero boxer and see that  that I don't think they're important.  Nothing happens when you mark an email as not important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They got badges just like four square.  Yes, you get badges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of a new service.  It's kind of it's kind of beta.  They kind of say straight out, you know, there are some bugs help us out.  But it's been it's been kind of fun so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, you know, it's like typical.  There's somebody already with seventy nine seventy six thousand points.  Of course. Probably the developer, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, when we I think it was the show we had Chris  DeBona on and Chris said, hey, you know, what how many messages  do you have in your all mail?  And we had that discussion while I had people on Twitter later saying,  well, I've got more mail than Gina has.  You know, it really the geeks definitely do have this, you know,  sense of competition about their email inboxes.  I think this is a brilliant idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's totally brilliant. I love it.  It is zero boxer dot com.  Thank you, Gina.  Our number of the week for Mr. Jeff Jarvis in Amsterdam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank goodness for the Pew Internet and American Life project  that came in at press time here,  telling us that 35 percent of U.S.  adults have software apps on their phones.  Yet only 25, 4 percent of adults use those apps.  And 11 percent of cell phone users are not sure whether their phones have apps.  Among cell phone users,  29 percent have downloaded apps, their phones.  And 13 percent have paid for them.  So this is the argument about how much has the apps culture taken over life?  Yeah. I think it's a little bit overblown in the idea that this is just one thing  we do and you have fun. I download an app once.  And, you know, I still want stats on the unused portion of life.  How many is the top list?  How many apps are not updated on their end on the supply?  And how many apps have I downloaded that I have never used

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  or haven't used in months? I don't want to know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many tweets go unread?  Oh, that's the big stats be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a huge, huge number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And, you know, I guess you could say the same thing about the same calculation.  We blog posts aren't read by most people on earth. That's fine.  But you supposedly subscribe to or follow tweets and I go through.  I haven't done it.  You know, if I go to my I've been gone all day,  going to saunas in Amsterdam, which are very nice, by the way.  And, you know, I'm going to end up with with I can end up with 3000  tweets in my feed that I just then ignore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think it's possible that there is that there are unread tweets in the world?  Like nobody that a tweet fell in the forest?  I guess so, especially if you have 20 followers and you and and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they don't they're not good at reading. Absolutely. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure. This is our new platform.  When I run for geek president, no tweet left behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No tweet left unread. Yeah.  Look at how depressed we are at the thought of one of our tweets  not getting read. Look, we're such broadcasters.  We're like, oh, I can't amy reason for existence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're just so hard.  Yeah, I got I got a number for you. Zynga.  The folks who do Farmville and all those mafia wars and all those others,  speaking in Oracle's open world, their CTO offered some interesting stats.  Zynga moves one petabyte, petabyte of data every day.  What? Every day.  They add 1000 new servers every week.  What the hell? What the hell is right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So so you go back to Clay Shirky's cognitive surplus clay.  Sorry, they're not using it to make Wikipedia's.  They're doing it to feed fake cows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was Gilligan's Island. Now it's Farmville.  Oh, boy. A petabyte a day.  That's an unimaginable amount of traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I used to I used to cover conferences in San Francisco.  My favorite one to go to was the gift show,  because the only thing that required in that show was that absolutely  everything on that floor was useless.  Utterly completely useless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. And that's what the thing is.  That's what Farmville is.  There is no socially redeeming value whatsoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's fascinating when you think like when when a human is given  a very clear cut out task, even if it's completely virtual,  I will do it, that that's more attractive to do than like do crap in life.  Because life is just messy and sloppy and not as well defined.  Like from a productivity standpoint, it's really fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So geeks like it. It's neat. It's tidy. It is.  It's like cleaning up your desktop. Yeah.  It's what it's why I think Windows sold so well for so many years  is because it gave you some things you could tweak and stuff.  And it gave you stuff to do on your computer.  And I'm sure it's probably why Android will do well to  our product, our tool of the week.  And I know you you notice this as well.  Gina, Google has announced Google new.  So this is the who knew it's Google dot com slash new products.  You go there and you will see all the new things from Google.  In fact, there are so many new things from Google  that you can select by product to make it easier to find.  I wonder if there's anything new in or could lately.  Why, yes, there is.  Why, yes, as a matter of fact.  So if you want to keep up with the Google verse,  you can do what we'll be doing every week from now on.  Visiting Google new at Google dot com slash new products.  And now we're let's end, shall we, with another little clip.  This is from Trent Reznor's site.  Newly code dot com.  Another trailer from the social network, which is coming soon.  Gina Tripani is the blogger at Smarterware dot org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

And of course, he blogs at Buzz Machine dot com.  Thanks, gentlemen and ladies, lady and gentleman.  And we will see you next time on This Week in Google.  And now. The social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that a question?  In the 16th email, you raise concerns about the site's functionality.  Were you leading them on for six weeks?  No. Then why didn't you raise any of these concerns before?  It's raining. I'm sorry.  It just started raining. Squirrels.  Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think I deserve it?  What do you think I deserve your full attention?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had to swear an oath before we began this deposition,  and I don't want to perjure myself, so I have a legal obligation to say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, no, you don't think I deserve your attention?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think if your clients want to sit on my shoulders and call themselves tall,  they have a right to give it a try.  But there's no requirement that I enjoy sitting here listening to people lie.  You have part of my attention. You have the minimum amount.  The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook,  where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room,  including and especially your clients, are intellectually or creatively capable of doing.  Did I adequately answer your condescending question?
