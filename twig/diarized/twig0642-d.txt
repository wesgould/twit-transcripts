Stacey Higginbotham is here.  Stacey on iot.com.  Oh, look, you put up a bow and a Snoopy.  There's Snoopy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, other side.  I have a point set up, but it's like over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can't see the point set up, but believe me, there's more than enough point set as on my set.  To cover all the needs, the point set of needs.  Stacey is the MaiderD at stacey on iot.com.  Lots of events there.  There's a free newsletter.  And of course, she does that great podcast with Kevin Tovel, the iot podcast.  Now in episode 8052, which is very impressive.  No, it's not that many.  It's very impressive.  Also with us, Jeff Jarvis.  You know who he is, the Leonard Tao professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark  Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  A little overproduced, I know, but that's our Jeff.  And Mr. Ed Proett from Hands On Photography.  You going to take some time off?  And I think you are coming up soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will, sir.  I will take next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you going to go to Carolina?  Where are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, sir.  I'm going to stay here and sit strategically in the butt groove of my couch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just rolls right into it, doesn't it?  Just fits perfectly for you.  As if it were custom ordered.  Nice.  That sounds like a good thing to do.  Sounds like a wonderful thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Simple pleasure, sir.  Simple pleasure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The world is abuzz with Log4j.  The vulnerability is called Log4Shell.  It's a zero-day found in Log4j version 2, which is a logging program from Apache that  appears on a lot of company servers.  First discovered last Thursday, right after the show on Minecraft servers.  We now see it everywhere.  And yes, nation states are hacking it, including the Chinese hacking group.  I want to call them Fozzie Bear, but I don't think that's right.  But the Chinese hacking group is...  Although it would be kind of funny if they were called Fozzie Bear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They laugh into the grave, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point.  This is such an easy...  It's really not a surprise.  It's such an easy hack, apparently.  Steve Gibson talked extensively about it yesterday on Security Now.  You could do it in a browser.  You could do it.  It's so simple.  And it gives you full control over the server that is using it for logging.  And so it's devastating.  And a lot of people worked over the weekend.  Some have called it the worst exploit, the worst vulnerability in a decade.  I think maybe even more than that.  Patches are going out.  The thing to us, at least to me on this show that's interesting, and I wonder if you talked  about it on Floss this morning, is that this is an open source project maintained by volunteers,  part-time volunteers who spent a lot of hours over the last few days fixing it.  And yet it's used by some of the biggest companies in the world for profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I'm trying to understand is that a lot of hackers played with this tool right out  the gate.  And I'm like, wait a minute, this is an open source tool for hackers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, it's not for hackers.  It's for anybody running a server, pretty much.  It's a logging utility, part of the Apache logging services.  Because Apache is used so widely, it's pretty much installed everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had a question about this.  They talked about it a little bit this morning on Floss Weekly.  It seems like this is a file that's not really, or I guess a service that's not really touched  often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, yeah, very frequently you'd install it and just forget about it.  People don't pay too much attention to it.  And the thing that's interesting, and Steve talked about this a little bit, is that the  thing that they're exploiting was actually a feature.  They knew about it.  It was a feature.  Oh boy.  It had support for user-defined mesh objects, and it didn't do a lot of protecting, filtering,  preprocessing.  Oh boy.  Yeah, so it's quite a vulnerability.  It was discovered by the Alibaba cloud security team.  Pretty much every server in the world runs it.  And because it's so easy to exploit, it was exploited almost, it's a zero-day immediately  by nation-states, by anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With that said, though, who are most vulnerable?  Not end users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, not your end users because you're probably not running logging software on your  PC, but if you run a server, absolutely.  I'm running a bunch of Minecraft servers.  First thing I did is run over there and figure out if that was vulnerable.  Stacey, what were you going to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I was going to ask, once it's exploited, what kind of powers does it give them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A remote code execution.  Remote access.  Oh.  Yeah, that's what we call as bad as it gets because you can get anything to run on the  server as a result.  And these are servers including iCloud, Amazon Web Services.  These are services that are used by everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically, Ant, if you think about Apache as the A in the lamp stack, which is on almost  all of the servers running any sort of cloud and web-based service out there.  So if you're running a web-based service somewhere, you have a server that's running that and  it's probably running, it probably is vulnerable to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was thinking about it from the aspect of say the big tech companies out there.  Are they the ones that are most affected or is it more the mid-range folks?  Well, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All of the above.  That's the beauty of it.  Everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now we just need to wait on the attacks.  Oh no, they're on right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody and their brothers are doing it.  The Chinese, nation state hackers, everybody and their brothers are doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Mr. Bennett was saying that some of his clients were affected by it and he's not dealing  with huge tech companies, but I was just wondering how many more of those smaller clients  out there are seeing the results of this flaw?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and that's the other problem is that you could patch the flaw, but that's  closing the barn door after the horses got in the way and there could be still code.  After the hackers are in.  They're already in.  Too late.  Yeah, so version 2.15.0 suppresses the hole.  If you can't update, well, there are some workarounds, but in some cases at least the  workarounds might be as bad as the...  Well, no, they're not quite as bad, but they're pretty bad.  Time to go to terminal.  Yeah, should I?  Would you like me to?  I'm ready.  Yeah, show us how to install it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Put your hoodie on too now.  You gotta make sure you put on a black hoodie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're programming town.  Essentially, you can with a malformed URL trick the server.  There, you look good.  You look scary.  Well, actually, you know, you look more like an aged monk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He looks like a Sith Lord.  Sith Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe somebody in the Sith Lord retirement community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, ages of man coming from someone who's also old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And a lord he goes after.  A lord.  A nice brother of the Internet Society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what they do at the Sith Lord retirement community?  They sit on the front porch and they complain about Luke Skywalker.  They just go, damn Jedi, I swear.  Get off my lawn.  So, yeah, it's so it's bad.  We're just going to, you know, it's going to be around for a long time.  It's just it's the COVID of exploits.  Yeah.  I mean, you can fix it.  But the problem is there's so many servers running all over the place.  People aren't maintaining them.  People aren't paying attention.  You know, this is this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's my plug for S-bombs.  Yeah, we want to talk about software bill of materials.  This is a good way to like this is why it matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you been dying to get into software bill of material?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God, I have been so excited about this for three years.  What is S-bombs?  Tell me more.  Y'all.  OK, you know how we're building like patchworks of services like we're calling APIs from somebody else.  We're using software, you know, from third party vendors.  We're cutting and pasting.  It's just a Wild West and it's a mess.  And the challenge and this is actually part of the new cyber executive order that was signed late.  Oh, no, we're still in 2021.  It was signed earlier this year is that you have to create what's called a software bill of materials.  And what this is, it's a list of all the software that comprises your particular service or software.  That's actually a really good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Because you would be able to check it.  You'd see J4.  Log for J there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And people have been like the cybersecurity community has been like, we got to do this.  We got to do this.  And everyone's like, no, it's a freaking pain in the butt.  Let's not do it.  And now we're like, thanks to the government finally being like, yeah, you got to do this because it's cyber security risk is way too high.  So this is a perfect use case of why we need this sort of thing.  So you can track quickly and you're like, oh, am I running a version of this that's going to be affected?  Why, yes, I am in this server over here in this weird, weird, random thing I'm using.  So, yeah, so that's why SBOMs are important.  You're going to hear a lot more about them in the coming year as people try to engage or implement them.  And you're going to see a lot of new tools come online.  So super nerdy moment.  No, that's a, that's a really great.  Pretty cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the, so here's the, here's the,  we don't have to go into detail of how it works.  It's just, it's bad.  It's bad.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I was going to show you the exploits of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't need to know that.  You don't need to know that.  Julian Assange extradition is full speed ahead.  Ruled.  We're waiting.  I guess you have to the Home Secretary has to say, OK, but the UK High Court granted an appeal by the US government asking for a new version of SBOMs.  The Home Secretary has to say, OK, but the UK High Court granted an appeal by the US government asking that they allow him to be extradited to the United States to be tried under the fairly controversial espionage act.  Eighteen counts connected with WikiLeaks.  Now the Home Secretary in the UK gets to decide.  I am curious.  I asked this on Twitter as well.  And I don't know if we reached a consensus.  Look, there's a lot to say negative about Julian Assange, but the US government's going after him for the Chelsea Manning revelations, including the leaked videos of airstrikes against journalists and civilians that he definitely spoke truth to power.  And to some degree, the charges are trumped up.  They're saying he taught people to how to, I guess, Chelsea Manning had a hack in his conversations with her in the chat room.  I think those are pretty weak.  This is that espionage act, which can be used as a as a weapon, as a cudgel, as much as a law by the US government.  On the other hand, you know, you can make a lot of you can give a lot of examples where Julian Assange may have acted as a agent of the Russian government.  You know, that he, you know, there's there's like we like we don't have others of those around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's your take on it, Jeff?  Can Julie A can Julian Assange get a fair trial in the United States?  Is are these charges fair?  Or is it a chilling?  Does it have a chilling effect on people, those who would speak truth to power, including journalists?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think, you know, Julian Assange could be a real jerk, but isn't it always the case that you defend rights by defending the rights of jerks?  And as journalists, we should be standing with him here for the for the chill that it could put not only on the journalists, but also on the sources we have and how we could be held liable for being involved with those sources in any ways.  And interpretations, you know, here's my phone number.  Did you just did you just explain to them how to use a phone?  You know, it can reach absurd levels.  And can he get a fair trial here?  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, a journalist, if a journalist, suborned somebody to hack to do an illegal act in order to get information that journalists that's that's that's illegal.  And as a journalist, professor journalism, you would tell your students, don't do that.  Yes, yes.  Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't tell someone to go steal documents.  You just if they give you the stolen documents, like, oh, thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the prosecutors say that Assange helped Chelsea Manning crack a password, did some hacking, which I don't think actually happened, allowed her to log into the which allowed her to log into the super net government network.  Using a username that didn't belong to her so that she could sneak in and steal these documents.  I think there's a fairly weak evidence that he that Manning that Assange actually got Manning to do that or taught Manning how to do that.  But if that is a criminal act, I mean, we're not talking the First Amendment here.  If if Assange did that, that would be a criminal act.  Well, let me ask you.  How about how about how about Stacey actively encouraging Manning to leak information?  You saying that's a beyond the pale as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to think about like in reporting, especially around like computer issues and digital files and assets.  Like like I have sent people like bash script to run on their computers to track like trace routes for like tracking peering.  Like when I'm ready, this is not government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wouldn't do that anymore if I were you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's actually probably this is how traffic's flowing on the Internet.  So I'm trying to think about like if you're if you're handing someone like I'm trying to get information from a wide I'm reporting out something from a wide arrangement, like a wide geographic spread.  So I'm sitting here thinking about that.  I'm just pointing out the Espionage Act was written in 1917 and it's pretty I mean, I know not to convince my sources to like, you know, I don't I don't tell them, you know, here's how to pick a lock.  I mean, but what if I sent them a YouTube video on how to pick a lock to go get?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  Yeah.  Or just told them to Google.  Yeah.  So the Espionage Act prohibits obtaining information, recording pictures or copying descriptions of any information relating to national defense with intent or reason to believe that the information may be used for the injury of the United States or the advantage of any foreign nation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but this is also where we have to decide Chelsea Manning was whistleblowers as you as you animated earlier.  And so is this espionage or is this patriotism?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the same question with Snowden, right?  Right.  What's his name?  And winning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's your name winning?  Reality winner.  Reality winner.  How can I forget her first name?  Reality winning.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Winner.  I often want to forget reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Winner.  Or Daniel Ellsberg.  Absolutely.  Going back to the Watergate in Vietnam.  No, he leaked the Pentagon Papers to the Times.  He also was charged in the Espionage Act.  The judge dismissed charges protecting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, right now we have a judge that's trying to prevent the New York Times from publishing material that they have as reporters on James O'Keefe.  And that's prior restraint.  And we've won that fight before our prior restraint.  And right now, the New York Times is losing it.  And there's tons of threats to the press and freedom of expression and freedom of speech going on right now.  And so, you know, this is this is troubling.  That's why Snowden's in Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was charged in the Espionage Act and rather than facing those charges, fled the country and sought asylum in Russia.  Much like Assange did in the Ecuadorian embassy and then later in the UK.  He's in prison in the UK.  And should the Home Secretary approve, Priti Patel approve the request, he could be on his way to the United States.  And I think I kind of agree with you.  It's not that he wouldn't receive a fair trial so much, Jeff, it's that it's just like throwing the dice.  You don't know.  It depends on the judge.  It depends on.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.  Welcome to Justice in America.  As I say, that's all cases.  For people with a lot less attention.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Well, we'll keep an eye on that one.  So I'm very confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  About?  The Elf of the Shelf is over your right shoulder on the three shot and your left shoulder on the one shot.  Oh, he's crossing the line.  Elf of the Shelf, you're crossing the line.  You see there?  You're going to make our audience nauseous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nauseated.  Can't cross the line.  All right, Victor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been pressing every button like when you're off screen to try to figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Victor's trying to figure out how the Elf of the Shelf works.  Only John knows that.  John's on vacation.  He's sitting there like, Jammer B.  Yeah, Jammer B ain't here.  Jammer B's not here, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Giggling right now.  He is at home laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see.  I would like to take a little break and then we come back.  It's time to talk about the man of the year.  No, it ain't.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Giggling.  No, it ain't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, the man of the year.  But first a word from Codecademy.  We were talking earlier on the show about the fun little exercises I'm doing with the advent of code.  And I have to give a little pat on the back to Codecademy because it's where I learned.  I think it's Python.  I've been taking classes there.  It's so much fun.  It is a great place to learn how to code.  In fact, over 50 million people already know Codecademy is the best way to learn to code  because Codecademy not only teaches you job ready coding skills,  but helps you build unique projects for your portfolio.  You'll have those certificates you could put on your LinkedIn, even prep for technical interviews.  All the things you need to get a new career as a programmer.  Programming is so much fun.  So much fun.  But I have to say, it's important when you're learning a program that you get a hands-on experience.  And that's what Codecademy does so well.  You'll be writing code from your very first lesson.  And instant feedback too.  As soon as you submit it, you hit the submit button, you'll get feedback right away.  You'll know if you're on the right track.  It's a really great way to learn.  What is it?  A record number of people quit their lousy jobs in the last few months.  Maybe you would like a better paying job with better conditions and a lot more satisfaction.  Maybe you'd like to learn to code.  This is the place to do it.  No matter what your experience level, you'll be writing real working code in minutes.  And code in a lot of languages, Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript.  They just added a whole Swift program, which is so exciting.  That's the language for iOS and Macintosh.  If you want to write iPhone apps, this is the place to go.  You'll really be learning.  And if you're not sure where to begin, you should still go to Codecademy.com  because they've got a great personality quiz.  It's not a coding quiz.  No math will be asked.  No coding questions.  They ask you about the things you like, what your personality is.  And they give you, and I did it by the way, it was very good.  Said you should be getting into computer science.  You seem to have an affinity for that.  It'll get you tailored career advice and course recommendations  based on your personality, on your interests, your strengths.  They told Lisa she should get into statistics, which is exactly right.  She's very good with numbers.  You'll get instant feedback.  Your code is tested as soon as you submit it.  It's an interactive platform where you'll learn by doing.  You'll be building a portfolio.  You'll get that certificate of completion.  And then your dream job awaits.  Web development, programming, computer science, data science, statistics, tons more.  If you want to learn a new skill, whether it's to build websites,  troubleshoot tech issues, transition to a new career,  it's even just fun for a hobby.  Check out Codecademy.  And by the way, I use their cheat sheets at Codecademy  because they're really good and they're really helpful even when I'm not studying.  Join the 50 million people learning to code with Codecademy  and see where coding can get you.  I'm a big fan.  Get 15% off your Codecademy Pro membership.  Just go to Codecademy.com.

Don't forget that promo code.  Twig, we thank Codecademy so much for supporting this week in Google.  It's really a clever platform.  A very clever way to learn how to code.  Time Magazine has not always made the person of the year a good person.  Very famously, Hitler was Time Magazine's person of the year during World War II.  So it's just influential.  I bring that up because Time Magazine's person of the year this year is Elon Musk.  Look at that guy.  Look at that guy.  Wow.  I guess that's reasonable.  Somebody who's made his mark on, for better or for worse, on the country.  Tesla's introduced electric vehicles and now everybody's making them.  SpaceX has been a huge success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he didn't make the electric vehicle this year.  That's old news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, although he did become the richest man in the world this year thanks to the success of Tesla.  That's the criterion.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's one of many.  Has Bezos been?  Yes, Bezos hasn't been the man of the year.  No, I truly don't know.  This feels like one of those silly, it's kind of like people's sexiest man alive in my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, Stacy, let me tell you about that.  I was in the room.  The managing editor had a cover and couldn't think of a cover billing for it.  We just had the story.  That was it.  The elf went flying there.  There was no news peg for it.  It was just a celebrity story.  Pat Ryan, she had no idea what to do.  Finally, he said, oh hell, why don't we just call him the sexiest man alive?  Cover sold like crazy and became an annual institution.  Right?  Of course.  It's cheap magazine tricks.  It's worse than meaningless.  If we say we have news, judgment, news, what about the pandemic and how about the insurrection?  And those are more important than Elon Musk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the pandemic was last year, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they had the mRNA scientists as a group or something.  They do these like secondary.  But for time, isn't it also like a moneymaker gala kind of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They turned it into that where they have the like hundred most important people.  They've exploited it yet more.  It's all BS.  It's pure, utter, meaningless, manipulative, desperation BS.  Okay, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're talking about it.  Well, not anymore.  We're done talking about it.  Don't blame me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like the idea of a person of the year.  See, if I had put together the rundown, it wouldn't be here.  But I did.  But you complained last week about me on the rundown.  So you can't blame me for this being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, now it's just in the Financial Times Man of the Year, Elon Musk.  It worked for time.  So, all right.  Yeah, we don't have to mention it.  We don't have to make a big deal out of it.  By the way, Bezos is not in the Man of the Year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have a problem with person of the year if it's someone that has done noteworthy  things for society.  It was Greta Thunberg two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was Biden and Harris last year.  See, nobody remembers this actually.  Khashoggi and other journalists who faced persecution in 2018.  The MeToo movement in 2017.  Donald Trump in 2016.  Angela Merkel in 2015.  In 2014.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The 2016 is where they got that great video of an eagle attacking him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my gosh.  Yeah, that was funny.  The Ebola fighters in 2014.  Pope Francis 2013.  Barack Obama 2012.  When was it us?  Us?  Oh, God.  That was 2006.  You.  It was you.  You're the piece.  Which is us.  Individual content creators on the World Wide Web.  I guess it was us because we were doing the show by then, weren't we?  Yeah.  I guess it was us.  Bill and Melinda Gates and Bono in 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Again, those are people doing something for society.  It was Rudy Giuliani in 2001.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  Bezos was person, I keep saying man by the way, it's many women have won, person of the  year.  Bezos was person.  Oh, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  That's prescient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  They knew ahead of time.  He was going to be the person of the year.  Yeah, you're right.  It's just to sell magazines.  I'm sorry I gave him any time at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, if you want to talk about NFTs and gaming the market through social media  and then I guess that's relevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, we talk about him at least every other show.  Leo, I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You didn't have his shenanigans tied to all of the things that he's done from a research  standpoint.  He's a shenanigan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're fine with it.  Shenaniganist of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, I think the twit should make a new feature every December.  The twit of the year.  How about we call it the twit of the year?  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Better, far better.  Our twit of the year this year, Ant Pruitt.  I didn't need an editorial panel or anything.  Congratulations, sir.  I'd like to present you with the official twit of the year award.  It is this lovely Golden Deer Award for the twit of the year.  This is the first annual.  We'll engrave your name.  Can I have the receipt for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually, if you do want to return it, the price is on the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, the twit of the year, Ant Pruitt.  This costs $59.99 in Canada.  It's called Shimmer Noelle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the crowd goes yawn.  I give you the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, would you hand that over?  I'll pass it over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can pick your award up in the metaverse, Ant.  It'll be waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an NFT.  Send me the receipt, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see the guy?  I don't feel sorry for him at all.  He sold the board chimpanzee NFT.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For the wrong rate.  Was it .75 of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says, I fat fingered it and only charged $3,000 for it.  I meant to charge $300,000.  And it sold almost immediately for like that much.  So whoever bought it knew what they were doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are bots out there looking for stuff that are devalued like that.  The whole thing is just so stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just...  I'm sorry.  I'm trying to be open to that.  I have a little hate with it, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's great for artists that can get some additional revenue  and have people that have an appreciation for the actual art that they're creating.  My problem is the minting process and all of the fees associated with it.  It's just ridiculous.  Not cool at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, just write...  The Verge has the picture of the board ape.  And you can just right-click it and save it.  And then you have a copy of it for free.  Yeah, you got a copy of it then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What does it cost you to make one of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like 12 bucks, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It depends on the fees at that hour.  Sometimes it's a lot higher.  Sometimes it's a lot lower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, I don't really feel sorry for the guy at all.  And he had the good sense of not saying, oh, whoa, it's me.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He owned up to it and he's like, yeah, anyway, I'm moving on.  Silly me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mistakenly made $3,000 instead of $300,000.  Yeah, exactly.  Damn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For something that's utterly worthless.  Yeah.  It's not even very good looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and that's another thing that sort of I don't quite get.  But again, it's art, so I shouldn't be so judgy about it.  But some of these crypto pieces of art that goes for gazillions of dollars, I'm like, I just don't see it.  And then the fact that a lot of the artists are using some sort of automated system to create macros or whatever, to just spit out versions of these apes.  It's not a lot of work involved in it.  It just sort of cheapens it, in my opinion, versus someone sitting down going through the process of creating this piece of art.  And I put my heart into this, not a couple of hotkeys to create it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How would you feel about Jeff Koons, who does factory produces like his balloon dogs.  So there are a series of artists out there today who come up with an idea and then just get it replicated.  Andy Warhol had a whole room of people making his silk screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He knew what he was doing.  He called them the factory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, but for him, he was aware of it.  That was part of the art.  It was a statement that I think it's fascinating.  I will say that I think all of it is so like, could we not have gotten excited about something that doesn't look like something like a kid doodled, like a boy doodled on their textbook at school?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. You know, I look at my guest last week on Hands on Photography, Mr. Peter Adams, and he took photos of some giants in the tech industry, you know, going back to Mr. Vint Cerf.  And they're NFTs now.  And people are devaluing that versus what's currently selling with these stupid apes and things like that.  And I'm like, what he did right there is way more valuable, in my opinion, versus these little graphics that are selling all over the place for a gazillion dollars.  Yeah, he even has Mr. Torvalds and Mad Dog and lots of people in there.  Doc Searles is in there.  There's legit people in this industry that have left the mark in technology for a lot of the stuff that we're using today.  And yet they're not getting it.  He's not going to get much credit for that work and for that art.  But, you know, he put it out there anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you, Ant, I almost think this should be in the Google change log, like a new feature of Google.  I woke up this morning and I got a storm warning for a storm coming to the Philippines.  Did you get that?  I got one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A PG, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like the basic, you're not on the west coast maybe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no.  Everybody in the world, in the world, got this public storm warning signal number one from PAGASA.  It's the Philippines weather warning.  It's about a big cyclone coming to the Philippines.  There's a whole Reddit thread on it right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's noteworthy, but not really for me.  And I chalked that up to this is some other issue with Android 12.  So I just ignored it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You expected nothing less.  Right.  I've never heard of this happening before.  That is a substantial bug.  I didn't know everybody got it.  Everybody got it.  Look at this thread.  I got it in central Florida.  I got it in Switzerland.  I got it in Michigan.  Montreal.  Everybody, here's a picture of it in case you, I guess it wouldn't look like this unless your wallpaper would look like that.  But that was it.  And you know, I saw that and I thought, I actually asked Lisa, are we getting a big storm?  She said, yeah, in the Philippines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  I was excited.  I got to learn about a whole new storm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like I Googled it and I was like, oh.  And then I'm like sitting there for like five minutes learning about different stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's so Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw it and thought, okay, we've had the atmospheric river over here on the.  Yeah, I thought it was for us.  But it's come.  I was like, okay, all right.  Here's another one.  It came from the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then look closely.  It came from the Philippines.  But I have to think it wasn't really from the Philippines, but it was from Mr. Google himself.  Right.  Who else could set that off on every Google Pixel phone?  Who else?  Right.  And that I don't know.  Nobody's doing UAT.  Nobody's testing.  We were talking about on Windows Weekly about this bug.  Microsoft Teams blocking 911 calls on Android phones.  Oh yeah.  I heard about that.  That should, that, I don't know if that's an Android 11 bug or a Teams bug, but that's  not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I've been hearing mostly people fussing that it's been a Microsoft Teams bug more  so than.  Well, it only happens if you've got the Teams app installed and you're not logged in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the fix for Microsoft is we'll just log in.  I can't log into Teams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hate it so much.  Oh, I refuse.  I'm literally about to switch my computer.  I'm literally about to switch my computer out.  Not because I'm switching my computer out, but I think that's going to be the only way  that I can actually log into Teams.  Freaking hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  So it isn't completely Teams fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is actually a bug in Android 11.  Wait, wait, Android 11?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not 12.  Oh, I think it's, oh, wait a minute.  Let me check.  Cause we're all on 12.  I don't think it's specific.  I don't know if it's specific to Microsoft rolled out a new version of Teams, but that  just fixes it with Teams.  And it is a bug that could still block calling 9-1-1 until Google fixes the Android problem.  It's kind of unclear what version of Android it is because it's not all Android phones.  Google said, we believe the issue is only present on a small number of devices with  the Teams app installed when the user is not logged in.  Or fools who have Teams on their phones.  Well, you might need, like, unfortunately we have meetings with sponsors and all kinds  of people all the time and sometimes they want to use something else.  Yeah, well Zoom is the default, but it's not the only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, isn't Zoom about the best we've ever had here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For video?  It is, but we'll say something.  Last week we had a problem on Windows Weekly and we had a problem yesterday on MacBreak Weekly.  And the problem with Zoom is you're going through Zoom's servers and if they're having problems,  maybe it was related to Log4j, I don't know.  But we were having some very inconsistent results that weren't our fault or the host's fault.  But it was, I believe, built into Zoom.  You know, the Zoom servers.  You break everything.  Yeah, we're going to break everything.  Yeah, thanks.  But you're right, Zoom is going to terminal.  So I don't know if this really is appropriate for Twig.  We certainly talked about it on MacBreak Weekly, but you remember the big furor when Apple announced  that they were going to put a scanner for child sexual abuse material on each and every iPhone.  So yesterday they did roll out one of the other features they announced at the same time,  which was an ability for messages.  If parents turn it on to scan for incoming naked pictures and to warn the kids,  you don't want to see this.  It actually gives them three warnings before they can actually see it.  In its initial form, it alerted the parents.  Now it does not.  Apple turned that off.  And some bright eye at MacRumors noticed they've removed all mentions of  that child sexual abuse material, CSAM, scanning from its child safety web page.  It's all gone.  And there's some thinking that maybe Apple doesn't plan to keep going with this.  Seems like they're backing off.  An Apple spokesperson told The Verge that although the CSAM detection feature is no longer mentioned on the website,  plans have not changed since September, which means it's still coming.  But they want to make improvements based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups,  researchers, Sith Lords in retirement and others.  I'd listen to the Sith Lords and just not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nickel millionaires too.  As well you should, my son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did.  We mentioned, I think we did last week that the better Zoom call where the CEO got on and said,  all of you on this call, you're fired.  I think, what was it?  600 people at the same time?  900? Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was the only way he could have done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're on this call, you're part of the unlucky group that's being laid off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If anything, he could have been a little more human about it because one of the reports I read said that he was sort of like lackadaisical about it and just sort of...  Well, he wasn't that lackadaisical because in the town hall afterwards he said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you will not be allowed to fail twice. You will be encouraged to fail once but not allowed to fail twice.  Not meeting deadlines will not be acceptable.  Are you going to make an excuse for him, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I was just going to say it's hard to fire people and you may emotionally distance yourself from it so other people may perceive you as being something that you're not feeling.  Yeah.  Well, he's gone.  I try to give people the benefit of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He fired himself.  Vishal Garg is taking time off effective immediately.  An email sent on Friday morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's just leaving though, right? That's not necessarily...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if he's coming back. Better.com is a digital mortgage company.  They have hired an outside firm to quote, do a leadership and cultural assessment.  Yeah, you're screwed.  Yeah.  He also apparently called one of the top investors sewage.  So that might have something to do with it.  Okay.  He's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure he has a nice golden parachute awaiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure he'll be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As Motherboard reported this week, Garg's temperament has been an issue repeatedly in the past.  He called the top investors sewage and told employees that rather than take indigenous people's day off, their time was better served earning the company capital and therefore our freedom.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did anybody record video of him doing this? Have we seen him actually doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I bet there is video somewhere. I bet there is. Yeah.  How about this? It can be challenging to work at MGM resorts in Las Vegas and elsewhere.  Casino and hotel company. So before they hire you, they're giving you a VR headset and giving you a chance to experience what it's like working at MGM resorts, including nasty customers.  People yelling at you and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why would you do that? You're going to lose all the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the problem is they have a lot of a lot of attrition. There's a lot of churn.  Yeah. And so at the Bellagio, the MGM Grand, so they figure, look, if you can't handle the heat, stay out of the kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be nice if they would actually train people like using VR to train people to deescalate situations and or to help their colleagues would be a possibly a better way to handle this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder how much they're saying. Who's to say they're not implementing that? They might. They have that there as a warning.  Say, look, this is what you're getting into. Who's to say they're not already. They don't already have this in place as part of their onboarding procedure once you're on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Laura Lee, MGM resorts chief HR officer said, sometimes candidates accept jobs without realizing how difficult they may be.  Yeah. So we're going to let them experience the job beforehand. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It also should do that for a newsroom. Nobody ever get to take the job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and by the way, we're going to underpay you at the same time as you get yelled at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, yes. I was going to say, actually, my journalism professors did a good job. They made sure you weren't in a newsroom.  No, they actually like I had classes where they would actually like I had a financial journalism class and it ended.  It started at like four o'clock. So when we arrived, he was like, OK, 30 minutes by 30 minutes. I need your market story.  That's good. Yeah, that's a good. It was great training. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what it's going to be like. Might as well get used to it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He did not scream at me like some of my other editors while trying to write this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that was new. Hey, how about that pandemic?  How about it? How about it? So we're back in California. We're back with mask mandates.  So it's very confusing here in California because the state said you got to wear a mask and then our county just said, no, you don't have to wear a mask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I don't know. Well, here in New York, the federal government employees required to get vaccinated.  City employees required to get vaccinated. Private employees are required to get vaccinated.  But me and CUNY, because we're a state institution, nope. Faculty and staff are not required to get vaccinated.  Oh, it's awful. It's just awful.  Meanwhile, NYU is now requiring all faculty, staff and students to be boosted by January.  Yeah, I got to get my booster. I got my boosters. Yeah.  But here's something pretty amazing. The can't get my just came across this.  How dare I look at Twitter during the show? But I but that's how I found this.  I'm not shopping.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. How's that for sobering? How lucky we are.  How fortunate we are. As bad as it is, we have tools in front of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I also saw an estimate that about of the almost 800,000 deaths in the US, 160,000 could have been avoided by getting vaccinated in the first place.  Google. This all ties into an actual story about Google. Google is threatening to fire unvaccinated employees.  They're giving you seven months, one of which will be paid.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure about all of the labor laws in different states and whatnot, but is this something they can legally do?  Yeah, you serve you serve with their pleasure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have white hair. Well, you can't you can't do with white hair, but you you know, you you pick your teeth after the free lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can get rid of you. Google gave its employees until December 3rd to upload proof of vaccination or receive approval for a medical or religious exemption.  The company says anyone who doesn't do either of those things by January 13th will be placed on a 30 day paid administrative leave.  After the 30 days, they could face unpaid leave for up to six months and then be terminated.  So they're going to get you out of there.  OK, so they're not around that. They're getting you out of there.  If you haven't done it yet. Yeah. Good. Good. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it makes sense. I'm OK. You don't have.  But well, I'm just thinking from a purely cold business perspective, right?  I would if your employees get sick, then you've got well, worse if they get everybody sick, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. They get other people sick. The whole department goes out.  I would feel weird requiring our staff to be vaccinated.  We haven't gone that far, but we don't let you in the building if you're not.  So if you can do your job from home and you're not vaccinated, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What if you can't do the job from home and you choose not to be vaccinated?  Then you they're pretty much worthless to you. Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That hasn't come up. Thank God. Thank God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an interesting. I wonder about stuff like that, because you look at that's Google and with their self-imposed mandates,  this is Twitter with its self-imposed mandates and compare that to say a hospital that may require it.  It seems like it makes more sense to me because the hospital is doing public service and trying to take care of people.  It just makes sense. Yet people will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about public teachers? Because they're like if you're a teacher, you've got a vulnerable population that can't get a vaccine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So does that fit? That's why I was like maybe the hospital sounds like it's more lawful than anything versus what Google or any other entities doing.  That's why I was asking. I mean, we don't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there's no OSHA requirement, for example. But if you think about like I can see someone filing like an ADA, like if I'm immunocompromised, for example,  and a vaccine just doesn't work, I'm no longer. Yeah, they're not making you do it in that case.  No, no, no. What I'm saying is I would argue that if I'm immunocompromised, if my employer doesn't protect me, that is I might sue for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have two 9-11 cancers, a 9-11 heart condition and a respiratory condition, and I'm obviously an old Sith.  And you're a vulnerable, vulnerable, a 95 year old father I visit.  And so the fact that some of my colleagues are not vaccinated puts me at risk and my family at risk.  And I'm required to go into class now.  So I tweet constantly and my university doesn't do a damn bit of good unless somebody cares.  But I'm just enraged that they're not taking care of everybody in our community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand why it's difficult, you know.  But it's a difficult time. It's a tough time period.  Yeah. Speaking of tough times, of course, tragedy.  Those tornadoes in the southeast, the Amazon warehouse collapse.  OSHA has now decided to open a probe into the Edwardsville, Illinois, collapse, which killed six employees.  We've heard stories that the employees were told they could not leave work even with the tornado coming.  Of course, they weren't allowed to have their cell phones, which might have given them an early warning.  Site leaders at the warehouse, DLI4, told employees on duty at the facility to take shelter around 8.16 p.m. local time.  The tornado likely formed in the parking lot, then rolled through the site at approximately 8.35 p.m.  Walls on both sides of the warehouse collapsed in, the roof went down, killing six.  OSHA is now investigating, they investigate all workplace fatalities.  So that's normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I will say not having, like forcing employees to come to work in a non-essential job, that's a really like, I don't know the rules around that.  But I think about the safety precautions in place.  I mean, like, Leo, we have, you know, you have to put on a show, right?  So what's your take on if there's a tornado warning headed for your studio?  We get the hell out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When the, I don't even have to ask because it's not even hypothetical.  When the wire fires came through two years ago and we were in an evacuation area, we immediately told everybody, go home now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With tornado warnings, you don't get a, do you get an evacuate?  I've never seen a tornado.  You see, that's the thing.  That's the hard part.  Exactly that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't get much warning necessarily at all.  And they're bad.  And the forecasting is bad.  I'm not defending Amazon or the Handle Factory for a second.  But if every time you had a warning, you shut down, right?  Warnings aren't necessarily reliable enough to warrant that.  So when's it bad enough?  And the problem is that when you knew it was a bad storm, the warning you had was a matter of like 10 minutes.  It's usually too late.  Coming through.  Yeah.  That's the other problem.  And they don't have a safe place.  If you're in the same shape on the road, then you might be in the building.  You don't know.  True.  Yeah.  Okay.  So it's, I'm not defending that.  If a candle or company employees were told that if they left, they'd be fired.  That ain't, that ain't looking so good.  Yeah.  If the Amazon employees can't have phones, that's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Had they had phones, there was a 30 minute warning from the National Weather Service.  The question is, you know, would they, would they even have taken that seriously?  I mean, you know, we get warnings.  We get warnings from the Philippines.  Oh, I get the, I get the, the phone all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hello, Philippines.  You know, you could have ducked under your desk because of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  But Amazon for years has prohibited workers from carrying phones on the warehouse floor.  We have, I have heard stories reported.  I haven't, I don't know if it's confirmed that some managers said, told employees, stay on the floor.  Even with a tornado on its way.  So I'm not sure.  But I guess this is what the OSHA investigation will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  In six months, we'll have a clue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm curious to see what the SOPs are for, for them when, when they have these emergency situations.  Yeah.  You know, there's something for fire.  Just, you know, I wonder what they, what they have in place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Given climate change, it is, I mean, we're, we're reassessing our infrastructure, right?  Because of climate change.  It's possible that we should be reassessing our safety protocols because of climate change and possibly how we manage things, like how we construct our office buildings.  So you might see, I doubt we'll see this anytime in the short term because government takes forever.  But like, maybe you need to build a, I don't know what a tornado shelter looks like, a basement.  Yeah.  No, that makes sense.  But you should start, if you're a pro-active business, you probably should have something that's a little bit better than like a phone tree in terms of like understanding how you're going to react to the dangerous weather conditions in your area.  And I mean, it's scary, but nobody wants, I don't think, I mean, no one at Amazon is excited that people died.  I mean, you don't ever want that.  Let's take a little break.

Transcript:  Did Facebook start this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like Facebook.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Did Facebook start this?  I feel like Facebook.  I don't know.  Everybody has captions now on Facebook because they expect you won't have the audio on when you're looking at your feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think it's an accessibility thing.  I think it's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the captions have gotten so much better too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Voice tweets and spaces both have captioning and they'll be captioning on video as well.  It's so generated, making it more accessible for deaf and hard of hearing users.  But I have to say these days everybody is having a hard time hearing and we're all using captions.  I don't know.  Do you guys use captions when you're watching TV shows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I only do it on, it seems like Netflix most of the time.  As beautiful as a lot of the Netflix original movies are, the audio mix is always a mess to me.  The sound effects are just tremendous and rich and then the dialogue is just a bunch like this.  Actors mumble.  Why is this dialogue so rich?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't record it well.  They mix it poorly.  I turn up my set on channel but a lot of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm doing it on Succession because I want to catch the lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Succession is another story because they sometimes have Soto Voce stuff that you wouldn't hear but then...  I think maybe you told me to do that.  Yeah, it shows up in the caption.  So did you watch the last episode of the season?  No, I haven't yet.  No, shh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Halfway through.  There are some that I missed, visual clues the first time around that I missed but I saw later on Reddit that actually kind of help understand what's going on.  It's a wonderful season ender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got to start that season.  I've yet to start that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff and I are the only people who like it but that's because we're really off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I love the first two seasons.  It's people like us, Julio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's people like us.  It's our people.  It's our people.  You're far too nice to watch Succession.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, hold on.  Now, I thought I told you when I first started watching it, I was angry.  I was angry when I first started watching it.  I'm like, this is bulls.  I was too, Ant.  I was the same way.  But now it's...  I can't watch this.  It was right at the beginning of the pandemic and people were struggling.  I agree.  I was angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Completely agree.  You're utterly right, Ant.  But then I was so bored I ended up watching it and everybody said you have to watch it so I'm a sheeple and I watched it and I'm glad I did.  Oh, yeah.  I think it's the best show.  It's the best written show on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pure Shakespeare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I also see bits not only of Murdoch having worked for all these moguls.  I see bits of Conde Nast.  I see bits of Time Inc.  I see bits of Robert Maxwell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in a larger sense, this show is about an old, old media empire trying to figure out how it survives in the new world.  Yeah.  So, I mean, it does apply to what we talk about all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I found fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And they, by the way, they still haven't solved it.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to pick it up eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe over to Holiday Break.  I'll pick it up.  I want to watch it all over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you'll either come back and curse us or thank us, but I think you'll thank us for saying that you should watch it.  All right.  But it was interesting this week there was news that I actually see as somewhat related is that Vox is buying nine media.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's talk about that because Lisa said they're merging.  And I said, I, Vox can't, I mean, I think nine media is smaller than Vox.  And I think you're right.  I think they're buying nine media, which is essentially, but it's a stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a stock transaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Merge, the phrase is merge in the Washington Post and in buy in the Wall Street Journal.  So I'm not sure.  Group nine.  Group nine.  Sorry.  Group nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so what struck me about this, you also have obviously Buzzfeed acquiring Huffington Post and whatever it was they acquired.  And they went through this back and Jonah Peretti has been arguing for quite some time that they've got to consolidate to compete with the big guys.  It struck me as I was thinking about it that it's this is the last supernova gasp of scale in media.  These guys have to do swimming upstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think this is against the trend?  You think we're going niche and not aggregate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do. I do.  And so they're but they're stuck in an ad market where either through getting RFPs from big agencies, that still exists, or getting programmatic to compete with Google and Facebook.  They want scale.  So they're all saying scale, scale, scale.  I think, you know, in the sense that's advertising on the subscription end.  Substack and Spotify also go for scale on that end.  But I don't know that that's where the future of media fully is.  I think I think I'm not going to say it's all small, but I think it may be an agglomeration of small.  We may be back to the big media giants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Listen to what Vox owns and then what they'll get with Group 9.  They own SB Nation, which is their which was their basis.  Original sports.  They're a blog company in their culture.  Right.  New York Magazine.  They own The Verge.  Of course, we know that very well.  Vox, Eater, The Cut, Vulture, Polygon, The Strategist.  And then Group 9 has The Dodo, which is, you know, cute animal stuff.  Yeah.  Now this, Pop Sugar, which is a female focused, Thrillist and Seeker.  So this is this is not so very different than when Jason Calacanis sold his little blogs off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, but at the same time, you have the opposite happening with Time Inc.  sold to Meredith minus Time Magazine and Fortune and Sports Illustrated.  And then the combination just sold to Barry Diller, right, where they're going to become similarly.  They're going to compete as content back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Verizon selling off a bit by bit the pieces it bought of all the the you know, the Time Warner media stuff.  It's funny, the both aggregation and disaggregation is going on.  I think it's just people jockeying to try to figure out what makes sense in this kind of confusing.  Which goes back to Succession.  Where there's that fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you can't beat them, join them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it's also debating, you know, it's constantly the is it is it content or distribution is king.  And my smart ass line is neither is conversation.  This.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm.  That's why we're getting the big bucks, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But some content leads to conversation.  Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  But conversation is still king.  Conversation is still the goal.  Content is just a tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, who's dissolving.  This kind of is a surprise to me.  Yeah.  The Internet Association.  Which was really the lobbying arm of the of the Internet.  Represented Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft is going to close by the end of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm actually disturbed about this because somebody's got to defend the Internet against stupidity in Washington.  And now they're all splitting up and they're all going to be targets and they're going to be worse off.  I'm I'm I'm I don't know if I should be, but I'm bothered by this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were.  They pulled out first.  Yeah.  They describe themselves as, quote, the unified voice of the Internet economy.  But was it a traditional lobbying organization?  They were in Washington, D.C. and then go and they go to members of Congress.  It would be wonderful if you would get rid of this net neutrality thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I never heard of the Internet Association.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, unless you were a member of Congress, you probably wouldn't have.  But believe me, the briefcase is full of money had to come from somebody.  Mm hmm.  Google is going to give the staff a big bonus this year.  Don't get your hopes up, man.  Oh, shoot.  All employees, including the company's extended workforce and interns, will get a one time cash bonus of sixteen hundred dollars.  Everybody, everybody gets it.  That's what's up.  And you get sixteen hundred and you and you and you.  This is in addition to Google's work from home allowance and well-being bonus, which is all covid related.  Earlier in March, Google's internal survey showed a drop in its employee well-being over the last year.  So they started starting to give them money.  Sure, that fixes everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which, by the way, is old, old bosses of mine would say, oh, I see that everybody's having a rough year.  Let's let's have an offsite.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, that doesn't fix anything.  I don't want to spend more time with these people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's why I'm having a rough year.  Those are the days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't I haven't done an offsite in a long time.  Thank you.  Good.  Yeah.  They try to make that OK.  So in fact, I don't think I've ever done an offsite.  I'm trying to think they try to make it fun by going somewhere good.  Right.  If you're a rich company, go to Hawaii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're just kind of a regular company, you go to Monterey and then what these people you try to get away from every day at five o'clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you have big like lots of brainstorming sessions and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get drunk and people do embarrassing things and women get it comes right after hit on.  Sounds awful.  They're awful.  Oh, they're awful.  Speaking of my brief time, my very brief time as an executive of Time Inc.  I'm taking the company jet down to the Bahamas.  Wow.  I just didn't I didn't I you know, I sat there saying what I thought that was not that was not welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the last time they let you on the jet.  Yeah.  Well, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's out of the club.  I was soon thereafter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For 10 years, Taya Mae Bowman has been on Instagram as at Metaverse.  I think you can see where this is going.  This is going to see where this is headed.  The minute Facebook decided to call itself Meta, her account was disabled.  The app said, quote, Your account has been blocked for pretending to be someone else.  I've been pretending to be me for 10 years, she said.  It came days after Facebook announced its new name.  She told the New York Times, the account is a decade of my life and work.  Imagine if your Facebook account were just I mean, Instagram account were just shut down.  All those images.  I didn't want my contribution to the metaverse to be wiped from the Internet.  This happens to women in tech, to women of color in tech all the time.  I don't think it has to do with that.  I think it has to do with at Metaverse.  But, you know, she started Metaverse makeovers in 2012 to showcase her art and technology.  She's an Australian woman.  She created an app that would display virtual holograms of her company's fingernail designs.  Anyway, it doesn't matter what she was doing with it.  But but for crying out loud, Facebook, I mean, please, you can't just stomp on everybody.  It's prior to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And the thing was what's going to happen with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, she went to the New York Times, right?  And then suddenly it started working.  That's what's going to happen.  Facebook said the account was incorrectly removed for impersonation and we've now restored it.  We're sorry it happened.  Never mind.  Never mind.  I thought that they would probably send her a check and say, you know, we'd like to.  That would have been the smarter thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other thing was, I think there's another story I put in there about how they got Meta.  And when I was in the business, if you wanted to buy somebody's domain, you never did it yourself.  You had a third party go in and say, I have a client would like it.  Oh, they're just a little they're just a little Philip.  It's a family thing, you know.  And so you try to buy it first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there was a little U.S. regional bank called Meta Financial Corp.  Oh, that's right. It's there.  Meta Financial Group.  And I guess Meta went in guns a blazing because they ended up giving them 60 million dollars for the name.  Sixty million dollars.  And Metaverse, what did she get?  She got her Instagram account back.  Instagram hits two billion monthly users, two billion monthly users.  You're not surprised, Ann, are you?  You love Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it. I have a decent community there on Instagram.  I just hate the fact that every time I open it up, it says a Meta product.  That's that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't know how many of those two billion users are Finstas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought Congress was going to outlaw Finstas by now.  Haven't they done anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nope.  No, they're still trying to figure out what it means, sir.  Give me time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it.  Let's see. I want to let me see here where we are in the in the flow of things.  Let's do a few more.  Then I'll I guess we could do the change log too.  I do have the change log.  All right. So let's we're going to get a couple more than the than the change log.  I mentioned this on on Sunday.  I think it deserves the shaming.  Democratic, Illinois, Democratic State Representative Marcus Evans,  noting a surge in carjackings around the Chicago area, has decided it's because of Grand Theft Auto,  which came out, by the way, in 1997.  And he is planning to introduce a bill in the state of Illinois to ban sales of the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  State legislators could be some of the dumbest people on earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Carjacking is not normal.  And carjacking must stop, says says Marcus Evans.  He paired up the cause.  He paired up with early Walker, a community activist, to start Operation Safe Pump,  which could mean so many things.  In this case, security teams patrol gas stations to protect people while they're pumping gas.  Now, tell me the truth.  When I said Operation Safe Pump, is that the first thing you thought of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be no. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This guy is not it's not the sharpest tool in the shed.  I'm just saying.  And apparently, early Walker, the activist, agreed with Evans about the game.  Representative Evans and I, says early Walker, have researched.  They've researched.  No.  And concluded that these very young offenders of carjacking are greatly influenced by the Grand Theft Auto video game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this sounds just like the late 1980s, early 1990s with the warning labels on the hip hop albums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, God, this has been going on for years.  Oh, yeah.  I truly believe there is bipartisan support to ban this game from being sold in Illinois.  Well, you introduced that that bill.  We'll see.  We'll see.  We'll see exactly how much bipartisan support there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It goes back, obviously, to comic books.  And I just read a wonderful, wonderful book.  Oh, I have the whole book.  This is the British version.  But the US is out called The Library of Fragile History by Andrew Pennegrae and Arthur de Vettel.  I'd love to read it.  It's really, really quite good.  It's also audible.  And and fiction was seen as a really dangerous influence on especially women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  And gives them all sorts of ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Library shouldn't be stocking fiction because it can do terrible things to the morals of women and young people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  Andrew Pennegrae and Arthur de Vettel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He Pennegrae is the dean of book historians.  He's he's quite I've read tons of his books.  He is he's brilliant.  University of St. Andrews.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am going to I have two credits I have to use in six days.  I have just purchased that book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Better be good.  I don't know if I plug this or not.  We talked about.  Yeah, we talked about this.  Matthew.  What's that?  So Matthew Kershenbaum wrote the book You and I Love, which is Track Changes, a Literary History of Word Processing.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  So this is about the future of digital literacy heritage.  Right.  How do we save that which is passing by us now?  I'm writing a post right now about how it really is oddly a continuum because this is how we were saving things in libraries and how things passed by and some got lost and some got burned and so on and so forth.  But it's a process.  And I'm finally learning that it's just a natural process.  This is about how we do that in the future.  And so there's a kind of a continuum from one to the next.  So fascinating.  He goes into the archives at Princeton University, for example, and Tony Morrison's beloved.  They have the complete archives there.  Well, there was a house fire in Tony Morrison's house and the manuscript was singed and smoky and burned.  And he goes through the archiving of the disks and everything else and who made what change when.  And this is the bibliographer's dream.  So how do we look at creativity and how do we save that?  What do we save about it?  What's worth saving?  So anyway, two little book recommendations there for geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see that Pedigree also wrote a book about Luther.  Yes, it's very good.  Brand Luther.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that good?  It's very good.  The invention of news, I think, is spectacular.  The book of the Renaissance is very nerdy for me.  In the Gutenberg parenthesis, I quote him just constantly, constantly in the manuscript.  He's brilliant.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, thank you for that recommendation.  Sorry, a little high tone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are we already on recommendations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't get your hopes up.  Are we done?  Oh, we're so lucky.  December security patches rolling out.  Let's see if I got it here.  Still waiting on mine.  Still I keep checking every time I see this story.  System update.  You got yours?  Nope.  Nothing for me.  Wait, is this for Google?  Is it for Android?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I got my Pixel security update this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The person who hates their phone the most gets the update.  So jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Count them.  Bug fixes.  Squeaky wheel, man.  Yeah.  This might be what you've been waiting for, Ant.  It's complicated.  Who's going to get it?  It depends on...  Google put it out a while ago.  It depends on your carrier and your manufacturer.  And if you have a Pixel, it should be right away.  There's a feature drop with UWB letting you hold the back of your phone toward the other  device for nearby share.  You can aim your phone at somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know a lot of people care about this stuff.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  UWB will be cool later on.  It's coming.  That's kind of a lame implementation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's similar to what Apple does with its flicking things from one phone to another  phone in the room.  What is that called?  AirDrop?  AirDrop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is it similar to that?  Yeah, it's like AirDrop, except on...  Actually, I think Apple had this too, because Apple supports UWB.  Ultra Wideband as well.  You can aim it at AirDrop.  You can aim at people.  So you could say, I want to...  Because there's six people all who have AirDrop turned on.  That one.  I think I could aim the phone at that person that would AirDrop over to them.  Stacy, you said AirDrop is in Bluetooth.  Do we do the opening theme?  We're not in the changelog yet.  We're not?  Oh, okay.  Okay, we could be.  You want to be?  No, I just want to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to tell Ant why he would like this feature.  Okay.  Because as a photographer, you can share your photographs really easily with people, so  you don't have to do like 18 things or email photographs.  You can just send the file directly to them.  I mean, that might be interesting for you.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not for me, but I know people that would get a kick out of that being able to just flick  a photo.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cool.  Family gatherings.  Instagram.com.  That's a good way to share them.  Proo it.  Yeah, because how many...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still have people hand me a clattering of phones.  They're like, hey, can you take a picture?  And you get like 20 phones and you're like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's the worst.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you're like, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that like the flock of phones is the clattering of phones?  Oh, I like it.  Clattering.  I like the clattering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a collective noun for phones is clattering.  I think you've just done it.  The two of you in collaboration.  A clattering of phones.  I like it.  Actually, can you get the changelog thing going here, Victor?  Yeah.  His finger was hovering on the button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, I think you were playing with Victor there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was teasing Victor.  Well, I realize if we're going to talk about the things that are coming in the dump...  I was starting to talk about the update, but the feature drop...  They don't call it a dump.  The feature drop is a big deal.  Although, there's a lot of messes in Android 12.  As you've been saying, there's a security patch, 100 Android 12 fixes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you still unhappy, Ant, with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, sir.  Very much so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there anything in this list of fixes that might make you less unhappy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The list that I saw was trimmed down to 60 or so, and it did not address anything that  I complained about, in particularly Bluetooth connectivity and functionality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's more base control for Pixel Buds A series.  Users can now adjust how long you have to hold the power button before Google Assistant  activates.  The Sound Amplifier app on Pixel phones gets a conversation mode.  You point your phone via the camera UI at the person you want to have a conversation  with, and then you can put the phone down.  You don't have to keep holding it that way.  Quick tap.  You want it like this?  Huh?  What?  What kind of conversation?  I don't get that.  Look, it's a hearing aid.  Watch.  I'm going to go explaining.  Let's turn on the sound.  Where's the sound?  Come on, man.  It's not sounding.  Oh, we didn't test.  Here we go.  The irony here is not lost on us.  I'm clicking the speaker button and nothing's happening.  Anyway, the idea is we're having a conversation.  I'm a little deaf.  I can use the Sound Amplifier and my earbuds.  I aim the phone at the person I'm talking to and then put it down.  It then figures it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then if she moves around, the phone...  No, I can't notice her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think so.  The residual life-slipping issue is fixed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although if you had a UWB device on that person and they were compatible talking to each other,  then you could.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ScooterX is saying, this is all old.  Okay, but it's coming now.  Car crash detection is now available in Taiwan and in France.  They did announce that.  Yeah.  Android 12 fixes the residual light flickering issue.  Increased access to Internet QS panel while on lock screen.  No idea.  Anyway, you're right, Ant.  It's all just little fixes.  One of the fixes will be to support high-speed charging on the new second-generation Pixel Stand,  which should start arriving tomorrow.  Yay!  You already ordered one, right?  I did.  I don't know why I did because I have the old Pixel Stand and I never use it.  This one's got a fan built into it anyway.  It's noisy while you're trying to sleep.  It's like white noise.  It's a Bluetooth charger and the idea is it's smart.  It knows the Pixel and so it does special things.  I have a Pixel Stand as well.  But you have the old one.  This is the new one.  Second generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, actually this is part of Logitech's keyboards.  Oh, that's different.  Yeah, I have a few of those too.  And my Pixel sits on it, so it's a Pixel Stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess anything with a Pixel Standing on it would be a Pixel Stand.  Okay, so that's, so if you, you know, if you ordered one, get ready.  It should be coming soon.  And now you can get high power 23 watt charging on the Pixel Stand if you have the December update.  The battle rages on between YouTube TV and this and that.  In this case, it's Disney, ABC, and ESPN.  YouTube TV could lose channels from all three providers if they can't make a deal.  Google's been saying that YouTube TV is becoming a more important streaming vehicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's important to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when I use, I really like it.  I really like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I really, like, retrans disagreements are so anti-consumer.  I know this is a check by retrans.  Well, it's the same idea though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the same idea.  Oh yeah, it's the same idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just, it's less, it's actually less defensible when it's over the public airwaves.  So the FCC has an excuse to get involved.  If you're talking about this, it's really just like there's no reason for government to get involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google says it wants Disney to treat YouTube TV like any other TV provider.  In other words, the same, get the same rates and services of similar size pay across Disney's channels for as long as we carry them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder what the, how many viewers does YouTube TV deliver versus, you know, Spectrum?  Comcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's probably a small fraction, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fraction, but I wonder if it's proportional in the payment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google says it's inactive conversations with Disney, but if a deal is not reached by Friday, YouTube TV will lower its monthly price by $15.  It's $65 to go down to $50.  While Disney content remains off our platform, again, Disney owns ABC as well and ESPN as well as Disney.  So it's actually a lot of channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you're not, if you're someone like me who doesn't really care about ABC or ESPN, that'd be a smoking deal.  Because then you just go over and subscribe to the Disney Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, do you like National Geographic or National Geographic Wild or ABC News Live or the Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, Freeform, FX, FXX, FXM,  ESPN 1, 2, 3 and 8, ESPNU, ESPN News and the SEC Network.  Oh, I bet Aunt likes the SEC Network.  Of course.  That's the South Eastern Conference.  That's what I was like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, oh my God, that must be worse than C-SPAN.  Oh my.  That's like watching Leo Kuber.  Bye, bye, bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you get your Clemson games on the SEC Network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Only when we play the SEC Teams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're not in the SEC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're in the ACC, but our rival is an SEC team that hasn't scored on us in about three years.  Well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can watch that happen on TV, except not on YouTube TV, if this deal isn't made by Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can get some of those.  I mean, there's Disney Plus and Hulu.  You can get FX on Hulu.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I just, again, I hate these carrier battles.  Nobody, it's just ugly.  And usually they resolve it before the plug.  Yeah, it's a game.  It's chicken.  They're playing chicken. Game of chicken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I worked around the cable industry, which I did for a while, they prided themselves.  It's macho pride.  We never leave a scrap of meat on the table.  Even if we don't care about it, we fight over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's succession.  Yeah, there's that big swing in energy.  Oh, is there ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of big Richards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's why I'm starting my new initiative.  Watch out for the pump.  It's going to be a chance for anyway.  Google releases a new Wear OS 3 preview offering a better look at the design outside of Samsung.  That's the headline.  I don't know what it means, but there you have it.  I'm going to see if I can parse it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is Google doing with Fitbit and Wear OS?  My goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is the new watch maybe going to show us some sense to this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you get on your Galaxy Wear 4, which I have, you can get Wear OS 3, but that's the only thing you can get it.  That's why now there's a developer preview of Wear OS 3 for those of you not on Samsung watches.  It's nice.  It's still a watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would love to see a pure Android smartwatch experience or what have you.  But after seeing what's happening with Android 12, I'm like, I don't know.  It's probably just going to be more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you souring on Android?  Do you wish you had a Samsung phone instead?  That would be no.  That's bad too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you want an iPhone?  Lord, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lordy, Lordy.  I do not save.  Get that iPhone away from me.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  iOS is pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Away with you devil.  That all I can say about it.  It is really pretty.  But I've never been able to just get down with it and function with it.  Especially if I'm doing photos, downloading from one place and then trying to find it on that phone.  It's like the file system doesn't exist on iOS to me.  Oh, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't want you going anywhere near it.  None is true.  Yeah.  And that's the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's not a lot of news this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got one for you.  Let's test you.  Stacey Higginbotham of stacey on iot.com.  Do you know who coined the term iot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin Ashton in 1996 while working at, well, it was Procter & Gamble, but he was on the Revlens lipstick team.  Wrong!  Wrong?  No!  Gotcha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In 1985, a black man, Peter T. Lewis, coined the term and conceptualized the Internet of  Things in his speech to the Congressional Black Caucus.  Once again, robbed of their just desserts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This courtesy of Kim Gallin, who's a brilliant professor of news and street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did he call it the Internet of Things?  Yes!  I want to see his speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here it is right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here it is.  See it.  Seek and ye shall find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The current thinking is the term first originated at the Auto ID Center at MIT around 1999.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But in fact, this is a long article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's from Chetan!  Oh, I love him.  Oh, you know Chetan Sharma?  Yeah, he's so delightful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Peter was at the head of his time, but didn't get credit.  He's so deserved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  He actually didn't just coin the term.  According to Chetan, he brought together the vision of IoT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, I've got to get him on my show.  Yeah.  Tell me he's alive.  Is he alive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he seems to have a LinkedIn page still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, what's really sad is Chetan found all of this, took his findings to the media,  let them investigate and publish it.  Every single one of them declined.  They didn't find it interesting.  He should have brought it to you.  He didn't email me.  He should have brought it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to email Chetan right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So where did Chetan put it up?  Where was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Peter wowed the audience.  Some of the stuff he was saying seemed science fiction at the time, said one person who was  at the event Chetan published his findings in a paper correcting the IoT history.  You can request it.  It has the entire original speech from 1985.  There you go.  But here's an ex.  Meet for Stacey.  Yeah.  So good.  Here's an excerpt from the speech.  I predict that not only humans, but machines and other things will interactively communicate  via the Internet.  The Internet of Things or IoT, he even got the acronym, is the integration of people,  processes and technology with connectable devices and sensors to enable remote monitoring,  status manipulation and evaluation of trends of such devices.  When all these technologies and voluminous amounts of things are interfaced together,  namely devices, machines, supervisory controllers, cellular and the Internet, there is nothing  we cannot connect to and communicate with.  What I am calling the Internet of Things will be far reaching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cannot be more explicit than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's exactly right, Peter Lewis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's awesome.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Meanwhile, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By connecting devices such as traffic signal control boxes, underground gas station tanks  and home refrigerators to supervisory control systems, modems, auto dialers.  See, he thought we'd have to have an auto dialer and cellular phones.  We could transmit the status of these devices to cell sites that pipe that data through  the Internet and address it to people near and far that need that information.  This is exactly the only thing missing is he didn't get how pervasive the Internet would  be or how easy to use.  That is really remarkable.  Oh yeah, in 1985.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That makes sense.  Great.  Yes.  That's an awesome story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But gee, gee Stacey, guess who put it on the rundown?  You.  Mr. Howe.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I just emailed Chetan and I'm going to be like, Chetan, what's up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Stacey, Nick Dover, Nicky Dover suggests that the Internet of Things boldly  asks, what if everything in your house works like that new printer your mom just got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see my, I did like an article probably two or three weeks ago on the unbearable fussiness  of the smart home that basically talks about.  Yes, it was great.  We talked about it on the show.  All our hardware is soft.  Oh, we did?  Yeah, didn't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have no idea.  Yes.  No, you were here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I believe you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody suggested that I purchase this for the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, my bike.  I need a bike.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is the Sumberg foghorn.  Oh, look at the size of that thing.  It's got a big old compressor.  Oh, man.  He's he's like this.  I like that oil can.  I want that.  Is that great?  This is like whaling the tin woodsman.  That's what I was thinking.  Spin the little thing.  There we go.  You're ready.  Oh, he's going to pull that lever, isn't he?  He's squirting something in there.  I want this job.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This is these.  Here it goes.  It's warming up.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder what that that head holds for in case you've got to do it manually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do do it manually.  Someone has to sit here and this I need this on my bike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are they going to play it?  Yeah, they are.  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to need a person with a sidecar.  It's a lot of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not an emergency horn.  Let's put it that way.  Clearly is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you got a staircase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to climb.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this Scotland's got to be Scotland.  Oh, there's a clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know why there's a clock.  There's a clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, because, you know, it's got a timer.  Oh, oh, oh, you're getting ready.  You're in up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's beautiful.  I was coming.  They have actually the San Francisco 49ers have a foghorn at their new stadium in Silicon  Valley.  Yeah.  When they score a touchdown, it's great.  It goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's great.  That's fun.  We have foghorns because the ferry goes by our house in the morning.  It's not awesome.  But in the morning, like around four in the morning, you're like, oh, why is it that early?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who goes to work at four?  They've already been at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're.  Yeah, I guess.  Oh, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it is it round the clock?  The ferry to Bainbridge Island is around the clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It stops between like two and four in the morning.  That's not too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not too bad.  Here's a nice story about the future of everything.  Toyota has a key fob, as many cars do, that you can use to remotely start your car.  It's a subscription service now.  That sucks.  You have to pay eight dollars a month or eighty dollars a year to use your key fob to remote start.  Who do they think they are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The time men of the year?  So hold up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold up.  Apparently.  So Kevin and I talked about this, but his wife had a I think was a Camry, but I could just be picking and inserting Camry in there.  And he said it was very clearly disclosed when you bought that service.  Like that was a service that was offered to you when you bought the car.  And if you said no to it, then you did know what you were getting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you could still get in the car, drive the car, lock the car remotely.  You just can't start it remotely.  I'm not saying that this is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This shows what they're trying to do.  So I thought it was a bait and switch thing.  Like they didn't tell people and they were just like, oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Like this feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the same thing.  BMW wanted to charge for CarPlay.  And by the way, after a while people got upset and they gave up.  But yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And this is a really interesting thing.  Like as we implement more software features on hardware, we're going to like right now you value your software usually on like how much time it saves you or things like that.  But when you look at buying hardware, you tend to evaluate the cost based on like what went into it, plus some experiential stuff.  Like the leather seats might be worth more to you.  Right.  But when we're starting to put more software and things that traditionally we think of as hardware, it makes sense that the companies want to push to charge for that value as opposed to the actual cost to offer it.  Another revenue stream.  We're fighting that.  It's a really fun dynamic.  We've got subscriptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You should be able to buy your car and run your car with all the functionality it has.  This was started by Musk.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you want to go faster now?  You can walk your butt out there and turn your car off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You used to update your maps in your cars before Musk.  You had the option at least once a year to be like, yeah, I need to update my maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And thank goodness Google came along and made that business go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, maybe Toyota will fail at this, but I do think it's just it's a really interesting question because we're seeing, I mean, again, most of the value in a lot of our stuff is becoming software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's bad enough.  You've got to go there and have them overcharge you for changing the oil and rotating the tires and doing, whoa, you know, dances around the car to perfect that they've done something.  You know, give you this huge long sheet saying we looked at all this stuff when you should be able to go to any bloody gas station you want.  But oh, no, I don't want to mess with the warranty.  I don't want to do this. I want to do that.  So you're stuck going to the dealers and you had to buy the bloody car through the dealer.  You don't like anyway.  It all sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those are some regulatory issues.  We're getting right to repair.  So that'll help with some of this stuff and they'll have access to the software codes.  The dealer network.  That's a state thing.  And Lord knows that the dealers spend a lot of money in local politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, right.  So, so everybody three billion people use Facebook untold billions use Google.  They're generally liked in the services that they do or whatever.  Yet everybody hates the cable company.  They hate car dealers.  They hate the phone company.  But who does Congress go after?  The internet companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's take a break.  Your picks of the week.  Coming up next.  The show's going fast.  Yeah, we could do a whole lot more if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to talk about regulatory capture.  We haven't touched more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got cookies to bake.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to make macaroons this week, I think.  You know, they're really there's nothing to a macaroon.  It's just some egg whites to hold all that coconut together.  You don't like it?  Oh, macaroons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought you were talking about macaroons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Macaroons.  Yeah, I'm not that fond.  Lisa loves macaroons.  No, I'm not either.  Yeah.  I don't either.  Macaroons.  But macaroons I do like.  Dipped in chocolate.  Yeah.  I'll put a little cherry on the top just for you.  Do you use that machine of yours to make them?  Oh, probably could.  Really, pretty much we use that machine of mine to make mashed potatoes and  risotto.  It's so good at that.  I haven't tried anything else.  Oh, risotto would be superb at wouldn't it?  Yeah, because risotto you have to stir the whole time.  This does it automatically.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, so Stacey's face right now.  Oh, the sadness in her face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're talking about a $1,500 Swiss device called the Thermomix that occupies a massive  amount of space on your counter and requires a variety of cheap plastic implements that  also occupy space in your counter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  However, $1,500 with cheap plastic implements.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  However, it does make a fine set of mashed potatoes.  You can make soup in it and stuff too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It chops.  So the important thing to note is you just stick your ingredients in the order it tells  you.  It chops.  And it has a scale in it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it says three ounces of milk you just pour until it says, ding, you're done.  And you go to the next.  And it heats up.  So it's like a crock pot, but also has a blender in it.  So it's like a cooking blender.  Stacey's so jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a robot chef and I want it so badly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you some other things you can't.  Every time, every time with that fail that I turn it on and says, I need to update, we'll  be with you in ten minutes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  With that fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's because it's Android, right?  It's got a big Android tablet in the front.  Yeah.  So it's got to update without fail every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I heard it's getting in the way of your espresso machine.  Oh, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing's getting in the way of my espresso machine.  My espresso machine has a counter all to itself, Ant.  Sorry.  Sorry.  It doesn't have to share.  The two of them are just lusted.  Oh, God.  They want my gadgets.  It's like they're waiting for Uncle Leo to die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll put you in the will.  I'll put you in the will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To Ant Pruitt, I give my coffee machine.  To Stacey Higginbotham, the thermo mix.  The reading of the Twitwill.  To Jeff Jarvis, I give absolutely bupkis to that nickel millionaire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, we got it on tape right now, folks.  I'm happy.  And Ant, you can get your award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, Ant, is he in his right mind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the end of a long week.  He might be punching.  He is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a little bit punchy.  Let's take a little break when we come back.  Your picks of the week.  I think I said that already.  Our show today brought to you by userway.org.  This is, I think, really important.  This is more than a commercial to me.  This is about doing the right thing for your customers, your website.  You know, a very famous pizza company.  We don't have to name names, but they're a national chain.  Said, we don't have to make our website accessible.  We have a phone number.  People can just call us.  And it went all the way to the Supreme Court.  They fought it and fought it.  I don't know why.  And the Supreme Court finally ruled, no, that's called separate but equal.  It's a public entity.  It has to be accessible.  That's the federal law, the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Every website without exception has to be accessible.  Now, you might, as a website owner, say, Leo, why are you telling me this?  I prefer not to know.  Well, I'm only telling you because there's a very good, affordable, easy way to make it accessible,  and that's userway.org.  And by the way, you want it to be accessible.  It's not just about doing the right thing or avoiding ADA lawsuits.  It's also because that's 60 million Americans who can't use your website.  So if you want your shopping cart to be accessible, if you want your forms and your images to be accessible,  you need userway.  Userway is an incredible AI-powered solution that automatically enforces the hundreds of web content accessibility guidelines,  the WCAG guidelines.  And it's kind of amazing with one line of JavaScript.  Now, obviously, somebody said, how could one line of JavaScript do all that?  Well, it pulls in other JavaScript.  I'm not saying you see other stuff going, but all you have to do is paste in one line of JavaScript and you're done.  It can do more than an entire team of developers.  And I'll tell you what, it works.  So many people use userway.  One million websites, including Coca-Cola, Disney, eBay, FedEx, UNICEF uses userway to make their site accessible.  And now userway is making its best-in-class enterprise accessibility tools available to small and medium sized businesses for a very sweet price.  Because I think they're on a mission to make the web accessible.  When you scale, you need userway.  It's good for business.  It's just the right thing to do.  Millions of people will require userway to purchase your products.  Fix all your images with alt tags automatically.  That's that computer vision at work.  Fixes complex nav menus.  Even sighted people have a hard time figuring out.  It ensures that all the pop-ups are accessible.  It'll fix your vague link violations, your broken links.  It'll make sure your website uses accessible colors.  Now I gotta say, this happens all not on the front page, not on the thing sighted users see, but on the accessibility layer where the screen reader sees it.  So it doesn't change how your site looks except to people who can't use your site.  And for them, suddenly they can use it, they can customize it to fit their needs, and they're going to love you.  You also get a detailed report of all the violations you fixed on your website.  If you're curious, there's a free scanning tool at userway.org slash twit that will tell you if you're compliant.  You probably aren't. I hate to say it.  Userway works with WordPress, Shopify, Wix.  It's cost effective. It's easy to add.  Same goes for AEM, Sitecore, SharePoint.  Userway integrates seamlessly with every website.  Even that website I wrote, I built myself.  As long as you put that JavaScript in there, it works.  Help your business meet its compliance goals and prove the experience for your users.  Userway.org slash twit.  Just ask Susan Bennett, the voice of Siri, what she thinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Userway is trusted by more than one million websites and 60 million users with disabilities.  Visit userway.org to learn how one line of code can make your website accessible.

Making the internet accessible for everyone.  Visit userway.org slash twit.  We thank Userway for the job they're doing and for the support of this week in Google.  Thank you, Userway.  Now, Stacey Higginbotham with her pick of the week.  You're muted.  I was.  It's because I went to get a cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to give you two picks.  One is a holiday cookie pick.  The New York Times has a recipe for peppermint brownie cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, done.  We're cooking this weekend.  Peppermint brownie cookies.  They're freaking delicious.  Are they like brownies with peppermints in them, but they're cookies?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Just yes, but they're so good.  Are they like peppermint bark?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're like the consistency of a brownie, a really delicious brownie.  It's like a pan cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking at it.  No, it's not a pan cookie.  It's a round cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, am I looking at the wrong one?  I don't know.  What are you looking at?  Show her what I'm looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She didn't put it in the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, I didn't put it in the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is New York Times peppermint brownies, but it's brownies, not cookies.  Ah, I see where I went wrong.  It's Vaughn Greenland's recipe.  Oh, God.  This recipe, y'all.  Oh, you may be an edge person or someone who loves middle pieces, a fudgy fanatic or a  cakey purist.  These cookies will please all brownie lovers.  And you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you don't like peppermint and chocolate, I don't know what's wrong with you, but if  you don't, you could put like vanilla extract and they'd just be brownie cookies, or you  could put like a bourbon extract and then you have like...  I'm making these.  Now you're talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bourbon.  Now you're talking.  I'm clicking...  Just put bourbon in there.  Smash that save to recipe box button.  That's good.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Sorry.  That is not my thing of the week, but having just consumed them.  Okay.  Today's thing is the Flick Buttons and Hubs.  And I got this because I love buttons.  I can't help myself.  I love the IoT buttons and the Flick Hub.  This is the hub and this is a Flick Button.  It is like IFTTT, except it has a physical thing.  So you can link a couple different services together.  So you can link Slack and...  Oh, so this is how you would punch me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd have a Flick Button at that end that activates the boxing glove at this end.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be an option.  If you want that to happen though, because the Flick Buttons are Bluetooth, you can use  the Flick Buttons are Bluetooth and will work only with your phone without that hub.  So if you have the hub, that gets you Bluetooth to Wi-Fi.  Got it.  So they're super fun.  If you have like, I run a lot of different light bulbs because I test them.  So this way it's very easy for me to like my Nanoleaf, my Hughes, my...  I don't know what else.  Another light bulb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because the first stage of IoT, we wanted to eliminate switches so we could say, hey,  turn on the lights, turn off the lights.  Now the second stage of IoT, we're bringing the switches back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true.  And each click you can do a single click, a double click and a long click.  And so you've got each button has three options for you.  You could also do things like Spotify.  So like you could put it, you could have some fun with this if you want.  You could stick it in there and you could have a button that plays your favorite Spotify song.  Like you hit the button when you come in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still want to do the project where when my phone joins the Wi-Fi, it starts playing my theme song.  So I can have my theme song as I come in the door.  Nice.  That's the one I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not going to...  No.  I don't have that for you yet.  But if you want to press a button when that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could hit the button when I come in.  Short term, maybe that's the solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could put it on your key fob and just be like, no one has to see.  They'll just be like, oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remote rocky key fob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So anyway, that's my pick of the week.  I've been having a lot of fun with these.  I gave this to my husband because I had the only button that controlled our bedside table lights.  And he was mad about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this hub has an ethernet connection, which is nice.  I like that.  I don't want everything to be Wi-Fi always.  I like that.  But it could be Wi-Fi as well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Either way.  Neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, I'm out of ports on my switches.  So I need to go buy another switch.  I bought a 48 port switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm pretty, pretty set.  Of course, everything has to be in the closet.  So that doesn't solve a lot of problems.  Can you turn on the lights?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Let me go to the wiring.  We're really going backwards on IoT.  Let me go to the MDF.  F-L-I-C.I-O.  Flick.  F-L-I-C.I-O for the flick.  Buttons and hubs.  Jeff Jarvis, a number of the week, JJ?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We could do a few things.  For one thing, I could sample.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is that you've got there?  That looks like a delicious salt.  So good you could eat right out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that salt, Hank?  Salt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, gosh, that came fast.  And you got some too, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did.  Which one is that?  I should have sprinkled some on my brownies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, baby.  This is the essential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is my favorite.  We have the flaky sea salt blend with truffle and garlic.  Oh, that's pricey.  Did you get all three?  You got us all three.  Oh, wow.  You got us all three.  And the flaky sea salt blend Calabrian Pisto.  I have an N.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to put that up.  That's going to be delicious on your Cacio e Pepe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I might do that tonight.  Salthank.com.  They're almost sold out.  This is my son.  Look, refresh the page.  You're cutting off my kid's beautiful face.  Show my page.  You don't need to pull up these pages.  I do it.  So you don't have to.  There you go.  Salthank.com.  A premier blend of sea salts curated from around.  Look, he's making Cacio e Pepe.  Just for you.  Just for you, Jeff.  Look at that.  That is my son, believe it or not, who is a TikTok phenom with 1.7 million followers.  One in seven now.  Yeah, he's growing fast.  It wasn't that long ago at all when he passed one.  No, I remember when he was just a kid, but that's another story.  He is a good looking boy, though, I have to say.  And it's a perfect gift for the holidays.  They came fast, so that's good news.  That means it's not too late to get your salt.  Hank salt at salthank.com.  Thank you, Jeff.  So I want to say that I have a couple of numbers here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One is interesting.  The elevator company cone, I presume is pronounced that way.  Kone is released stats on elevator use with the pandemic in the top 10 European cities.  The average number of elevator journeys plummeted 80 percent between February and April of 2020.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right at the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The return to office buildings in Paris, Munich, Helsinki, Berlin, Milan and Hamburg has remained at 60 percent of pre-pandemic levels since the start of the year.  So we are still avoiding offices and such.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kone is very aggressive on IOT elevators and selling elevator maintenance and such as a service, just as an FYI.  That data could come from their smart sensors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, and they're going to start charging you if you want to go to an even numbered floor before long, just like Toyota.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even number fours cost you more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we did this one last year and I think we enjoyed it, even before last year.  But the 52 things I learned this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and who is I?  Because that's going to really have something to do with it.  It's Tom Witwell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So you can just pick some things at random.  Number 41 here, because we have the line number.  We produce 200 times more computers per second than new human beings.  Oh, that's a terrible stat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  200 times more new computers than new human beings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much energy does a computer use versus a human being?  Probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but who's using all these computers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you all talk about Intel and the metaverse and the demand for chips?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but yeah.  No, because I was not on the show.  I guess everything.  You know what?  This is because of Stacey's buttons.  If you count those as computers.  Oh, yeah.  I thought it was going to go a different way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, excuse me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I blame you and your dang buttons.  So this is just like a...  52 odd things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And number 51.  In 1970s, Kodak started to reformulate their photographic films to better represent dark brown colors because they'd had complaints from chocolate companies and furniture manufacturers.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a wooden furniture manufacturer.  Consider the wooden furniture manufacturer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey's brownie cookies that are the fault here.  It wasn't until 1995 they introduced a calibration card showing non-white faces.  Yep.  That's insulting.  Yeah.  So your brownies?  No, the people.  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, just to black people everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, it is.  It's awful.  I mean, just...  10% of US electricity is generated from old Russian nuclear warheads.  What?  That's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  I'm going to call VS on that one.  Where do we get these old Russian warheads and how come we turning them into electricity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Click through.  That's a very interesting...  I call BS on that one.  I mean, I understand...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  BS you called misinformation?  It's from NPR.  Okay, but...  For the past decade, two decades, 10% of all electricians have been...  It's part of a deal struck to end at the end of the Cold War.  Oh, we bought their old missiles.  We bought their final fuel shipments.  The deal ended...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they were never in missiles.  Okay.  No.  It's a little fudge factor there.  We bought fuel that was intended for Russian missiles to use for nuclear power plants.  It's not the same thing as old Russian missiles are powering our fuel.  That's true.  That is a...  Okay.  Good.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel better.  I could buy the real...  The missile is powering the foghorn, but yeah.  All right.  The battery in the new electric Hummer will weigh almost as much as an original Land Rover.  This is kind of...  This is your nightmare of me filling the rundown.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.  Good.  This is from Flux, F-L-U-X-X, a medium channel by Tom Witwell.  50 Things I Learned in 2021.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bailey's Irish Cream was invented in 45 minutes in 1973 by two ad creatives in Soho who had  very bad taste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bailey's Irish Cream was invented in 1973 in Soho.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like, oh, this is traditional Bailey's and Oaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels like a product of the 70s.  I'm not going to lie.  That's positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's positive when I drank it.  But that means, wait a minute, my mind is boggling.  There were no white Russians before 1973.  Okay.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The court has applied a patent, to patent a method to identify bad smells in shared

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a good one that you can add to his list for 2022.  NASA employs a full-time sniffer to smell things before they get put on the International  Space Station in case the odors are offensive.  That's a gig.  Because as one would imagine, if you're stuck on the ISS with a stinky something, you're  stuck.  What are you going to do?  That's miserable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this guy, there's no tuna fish in the space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, God.  So this guy, you want to see a video?  I've had sticky books and magazines.  This guy, he's NASA's staff sniffer.  This is from 19.  Apart from the stunning New Mexico landscape.  This is from a YouTube channel, the science channel.  This is the guy.  This is what his job is.  He sniffs stuff for NASA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let Mikey sniff it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But can he nose a glass of whiskey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I'm guessing that he probably has a similar skill set.  Yeah.  By the way, just want to point out, see this right here on the YouTube?  If you go to the front page of YouTube.  Yeah, I'll just do this real quickly.  This is a number you could have used, Jeff.  Oh, it's not saying it on the front page.  But if I click a video, it's right up here.  See in the left?  Oh, what's that?  One trillion.  Click it.  YouTube is celebrating one trillion viewers of Minecraft content over the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All that wasted life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Minecraft.  One trillion views.  It's the most viewed content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My daughter watches this Minecraft fan.  It's, it's, remember Red versus Blue?  Yeah, yeah.  So it's basically that for Minecraft.  It's a big deal.  It's huge.  It's called Dream, the Dream server.  So they have these like very loosely plotted episodes.  And it's like on its third season now.  And she is like crazy.  People love Minecraft.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, Mr. Ant Pruitt, it's your turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My pick of the week, which is funny.  I also saw it somewhere else in the rundown.  So maybe this is a great mind's think alike kind of thing.  Adobe has their new creative cloud express.  I used to use this app.  It used to be called Adobe Spark.  Oh, this is Spark.  Oh, I know.  That app and services so underrated for people that are just trying to put out, you know,  marketing content or, you know, messages, infographics and things like that.  It's super useful and you can do it on the web.  You can do it on your phone.  On the web, it gives you a little bit more power.  But they've, you know, basically done a little bit of updates and rebranded into it, if you will.  And it's now called Creative Cloud Express.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's mostly free.  You can pay for templates, but right.  We played with it on Mac Break Weekly on Tuesday and actually does a pretty nice job.  I thought it's great for people, you know, Instagram types and stuff like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anybody that's just trying to get a good message out that that can stand out from from other stuff that's out there.  And it's because they give you all the nice templates and properly lays it out to fit for all of the different social platforms, even down to YouTube thumbnails and stuff like that.  So yeah, I thought I'd give them a shout.  So I think they deserve it.  This is really great.  There's a converted gift feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's there's all sorts of removed background, reverse video, trim video.  There's all sorts of things you can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is I use it almost every day for something on social media.  Almost every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish I had the energy and time to do stuff like that.  That's really great.  You don't even like social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm exhausted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Social.  I just want to go to bed, honestly.  Well, let's get you there, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want to sleep.  Let's tuck them in.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The White Russians first appeared in 1949.  It's a black Russian with cream.  Yeah.  You don't need Bailey's to make a white Russian.  No.  Oh, you need Kahlua, right?  And milk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what's a black Russian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just the Kahlua.  No milk.  Anyway, so I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Kahlua and vodka, I think.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought you had to have Bailey's for a white Russian.  You have to have Bailey's for my mom's coffee.  Oh, yum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or a mudslide, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you ever drink mudslides?  I don't like sweet drinks.  When you were in engineer high school?  Okay.  Yeah.  Do you have anything else, Ann?  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  Sure.  My other couple picks is one that makes me laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On Instagram every single time I see it, and it's photography humor.  And we've talked about Instagram in the past recently, pushing more towards video content.  And I said openly that, yeah, I'm doing more video content myself on Instagram.  And there's a little meme right here from photography humor just sums it up perfectly.  I love it.  I love the sound effects of the background of her crying.  Because I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  I love the sound effects of the background of her crying.  Because if you scroll through Instagram reels, you see a lot of photographers doing this type of behavior.  And the meme reads, a photographer having to make reels to stay relevant on Instagram.  That's the joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  However, you do have some reels on Instagram, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do them fairly regularly because it's part of my marketing and promotion.  I love my show and I put stuff up there for my show.  Oh yeah, of course.  I love just shooting stuff of the family or other random things or tips and tricks that I'm doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Life at Twit, let's not forget, you post about Life at Twit so you can see behind the scenes stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was my first meeting a couple years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before we told you about long pants, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First time getting on the Twig set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh nice. Coming in for a landing.  Look at that.  I was so surprised.  We love having you here, Ant, I tell you.  Thank you.  I do enjoy Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's sort of a love-hate.  Because like I said, I don't like that Metta owns it.  But I have a nice community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Lisa loves it too.  If it weren't Metta, I would love it.  In fact, I did love it.  I was on Instagram when it first started and posted a lot.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I wish it weren't Metta.  That's my friend Matt.  His daughter was on the show on Hop.  She's excited to see herself on the show.  That's nice.  How did you meet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff asked.  How did we meet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was on Tech News Weekly for something I wrote for Tech Republic.  And then Mr. Bondi reached out to me later about being on Twig.  And then it just went on from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because Tech Republic, because of Jason Hiner and so forth, we've had a great relationship.  So I've been always aware of you working there.  So yeah, just like everybody else, we slowly pulled you in.  Yes, pretty much.  Into the black hole gravity that is slowly drew you in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I do remember getting the invitation to be on this week in Google and saying, I don't know if I really want me on here.  I'm not ready for that discussion.  Oh, yeah, you are.  No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, yeah, you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I want to share your final pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because this is the season.  I won't be here on the show next week.  But I love Mr. Scott Wilkinson.  And I remember being able to talk to him at CES a couple of years ago while we were in person at CES.  And I love that man's energy when he was talking about televisions.  But I love his energy when he's talking more about tubas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's all into tubas.  And this is they couldn't do Tuba Christmas L.A., which they do every year at Forest Lawn Cemetery.  They gather hundreds of tubas together and play Christmas carols.  So Conical Supremacy, which is, believe it or not, a tuba podcast.  Yes, there is such a thing.  Got Scott and his friends together in his friend's driveway for safety.  And they did a Christmas tuba concert.  Listen for a little bit.  So good.  You'd think a tuba would be kind of a lugubrious instrument for Christmas carols.  It's quite beautiful.  It is.  It's really nice.  So much talent there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they played some of Scott's original compositions and all sorts of fun stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He emailed that and it just it just warmed my heart.  Because like I said, I love talking to him while we were there.  And if people go back and look at those segments of him walking through the halls with you talking about the different televisions and stuff.  Oh, I miss that.  That energy, man.  It was.  Oh, I really don't think we're ready to go back to CES this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just especially with I'm still going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'd like to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I get it.  It's definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can go if you want, but just stay away from us for the next six weeks.  I'd love to go.  Yeah, I would love to go.  Well, you want to go.  You should probably should go.  We should probably send somebody.  Yeah, you're willing to take the chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm boosted up and I'm going to come back and wait a day or two in a hotel and then see my family on the backside after taking a test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So well, I'll book something if you if you approve.  I'll book something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll talk to Miss Lisa.  She's the boss.  Let me know.  And of course, Scott, I love working it myself.  Yeah, I know you do.  You're really a CES guy.  That's your place.  Those are your people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get your booster now, though, and if you're going to go, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't get my booster until sometime in January.  That won't work that they gave me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So just a cautionary tale.  Sure.  Lizard was on Twitter on Sunday.  Yeah, fully vaccinated.  But like many of us got her second shot in April.  So it's been eight months.  Went to visit a family, the family on Thanksgiving.  They all got covid-19.  She got her boyfriend got it.  She was down.  She's I mean, she was really down for two weeks, but really lost a whole month.  And she said it was awful and you do not want to get it.  So just a word of warning.  I mean, even fully vaccinated is not maybe going to be enough with Omicron out there.  Yeah.  Get that booster when you can.  A little tip.  You can go Safeway often has shots available at the end of the day.  You could run over to Safeway right now.  Oh, yes. Right.  Yeah. And see if they have you might be able to get it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  OK, I'll try that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Safeway, CVS, you know, Albertsons.  They all are doing a vaccination and it still counts.  Doesn't matter.  You got in the grocery store.  Still counts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  I'll try that.  Yeah, but I got an appointment, but it wasn't until sometime in January.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kaiser's way backed up.  I'm not sure why, but same thing.  I'm getting mine tomorrow.  Thank you, everybody.  Stay safe.  This holiday season, we all want to get together.  We all want to be with friends and family, but nobody deserves to get covid-19.  So wear your mask.  Be careful.  Socially distance.  Wash your hands.  All the things that we've done all along that have worked so well.  And yes, if you haven't gotten your shots yet, get them.  And if you haven't gotten boosted yet, get them because it makes a difference.  Thank you very much for being here, Mr.  Ant Pruitt, twit.tv slash HOP.  We're going to miss you next week.  Have a great vacation.  And thank you.  Wonderful.
