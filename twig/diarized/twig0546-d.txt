Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Turn the page and look who's here  Kevin turns the page on me

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's Pruitt

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pruitt is the star of hands-on photography at twit.tv slash hop and  Is not a former TV guide critic. Nope, which was one of the big selling points actually at one point hiring you in  The Mobile World Congress top story Mobile World Congress big show every year Barcelona Spain  It's the place all the phone companies go to show off their new phones  Except no one was going to go and so the GSMA the GSM Association which  Puts this show on every year has announced  We're gonna cancel a show

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're gonna my gosh, it's cancel culture. No, I'm kidding cancel culture  Well, I'm excited because you know, I was looking forward to not like having my my computer and my wallet stolen in Barcelona

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you ever had your computer wallets stolen in Barcelona I have not but my colleagues have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just a thing that happens  I've just been lucky  But were you gonna go? No. No, I was not I I don't like Mobile World Congress and it's not as I oh  It's not as IOT ish

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they never had a problem with it  Even though it's mobile world is supposedly all about phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like another extension of CES to me it was actually it got bigger than CES remember about probably seven  editions a bigger but  Seven years ago or so maybe even eight years now all of a sudden it moved from being a phone show to being like a I  Have something connected to the internet. Yeah, and Facebook showed up every I mean everyone was lots of stuff there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, not this time  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Imagine the car they're just the losses losses to hotels and restaurants in Barcelona

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People have already started canceling hotel rooms. They'll probably lose some of their  You know deposits so there'll be some airline canceling  Yeah, and all of this because of the novel coronavirus now known as kovat 19 or as  as Carson says cofever  I got a fever  I  Kind of a shock. I also think it's kind of a bellwether for the future of conferences. We don't really need conferences

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See this was interesting. I was looking at what was happening when we prevent people from traveling and we  interfere with the free range of goods  Things the the economy slows down by quite a bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so I'm great this trade is good for a lot of things good for the economy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's good for and understanding and understanding and seeing people in other cultures. That's that's the one problem  I I get the ecological argument against flying but now more than ever we have to have connections with people in other lands

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the internet has made that pretty much useless so futile  So I suspect that we're gonna see a lot of conferences kind of go by the way said everybody agrees that the only reason to go  Conference these days is to see people to talk to colleagues who wants to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but I guess there's still that that small group of people that go there for the sales  Opportunities to the network inside of it. They're not small. That's a huge like CES. That's who's there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what that shows about I think that's why CES

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Continues when Comdex and other trade shows have gone, you know see bit which is even bigger than common  Yeah, I'm gonna see bit gone because  It you know, but CES persists, I'm not sure those comics  I think we were calm that but it was too narrow maybe tied to PC  Yeah, it was too narrow as a field as was as was C bit  So maybe but so that's what's I mean, honestly without CES  I think a lot of stuff wouldn't get made because that's where you go with your prototype your early product  You talk to dealers you get a sense of whether they'd be interested in selling it dealers make orders of stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's important for a commerce so we people are just just irritants to the blood flow  Yeah, the journalists commerce. Yeah, but the journalists have

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Journalists are important too. I think I don't know would you I feel like we don't need to go to trade shows  Would you do you still want to go to CES next year? I love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's horribly efficient  I mean going to like Hanover Messe or yes because you get to see in one place  You can assimilate what people  One there's there's a value because it costs money to go to these things  So you can't just call someone up and be like I just watched a product. It's really randomly cool  So these people have paid money to get here. You can see it all at once so you can spot trends  You can compare and contrast. I think it's hugely valuable and hugely efficient. Yeah, just a devil's advocate

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can't you get all that out of the press releases at home? Yeah. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But also

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the whole network inside of it being able to look at those PR people eye to eye and  Get a feel for I want to deal with this person going forward because you know, we're content creators, right?  And it's nice to have a good relationship so we can continue to  create great content and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are tons of like going to be go ahead. Sorry  I was gonna say I have questions a PR release is nothing compared to like what you actually need to know  Right, you know in terms of how something were you learned things both of you at CES. Of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what were we going to learn the things that they don't want you to know  Because you can actually ask them in their press release  They're just gonna tell you what they want you to know true product  You actually go and touch it you can say so ask them. Well, what about this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  19 is this just hysteria and  We're gonna like we did with the Spanish flu in 1918 a couple of months forget about it and everything will be back to normal  Or will there be a long-lasting?  People did not forget about the Spanish flu

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The Spanish flu was terrible. It killed it killed more people than World War one. No, no  Are we talking about the 1918 Spanish flu?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the 2018 really was just a blip no the 1918 Spanish flu I know but we forgot about it right no we didn't  Well, I only mean in the sense that it it didn't stop  World travel no conferences were key. I know I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If the conferences had been canceled then then maybe people as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's interesting about that is we didn't have the kind of fascism in Spain  Yeah, we didn't have the kind of travel that we have today in 1918  For the reason it spread was it was right after World War one ended and a lot of soldiers took it home with them  So it was an unusual situation. I don't know. I wonder if if if this will just be you know, they're a little hysteria everybody  Forgets about it next year Mobile World Congress continues or should we start worrying about especially about the conferences held in winter?  You know, we dodged a bullet at CES and could it be easily right? It could have been a nightmare  There were a lot of Chinese companies Chinese  Staff there the the the  Covid 19 started in October and November so it could easily  Like it's a few weeks difference. Mm-hmm. We would all come home two weeks later. Are there any of the tech companies near one? Oh  Yeah, I think there's area. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. In fact  There's there this will also impact American tech companies like Apple who build stuff in China, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your kickstarters will all be delayed  We're starting to see that's a convenient excuse

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those dice we're not gonna send them to you this year either but car production for certain lines has stopped

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's I think GM is restarting their line this weekend. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What day is it? I think here's an interesting story that applicable to  Technology China has launched a corona virus close contact detector app  They're asking people to download it Chinese citizens to download it and it will tell you  If you've been near somebody who's had the virus you might wonder how would they know  Well, they know it's China China  So they have they have all kinds of they have different levels  For instance, if you were on an air-conditioned train everybody in the car  had close contact  Mmm, if you were on an airplane everybody within a few rows of you had close contact three rows  It's a really interesting and they know who was where when and where you were too for that matter  All you have to do is scan a barcode  And you can scan a quick response code on your smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Common get you in the middle of the night well and you in a camp  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and yet I bet you if it I mean honestly if we had something like that here wouldn't pandemics are a classic case of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  individual rights versus group health  I mean that's this is right. Yeah, it's part of it's part of like everybody's horror stories and like  one man standing up for the rights of his community kind of setups because it is a  classic tension

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  typhoid Mary  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was that Mary Mellon? Yeah, that was in New York, right? Yep. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ironically there were so many doctors in the 1800s that were like typhoid Mary's with  purple fever  like who didn't who would give birth to babies or  Deliver babies and then wouldn't wash their hands and then would go to the next mom and so they'd all  They were like typhoid Mary's times a million. Did you watch the Nick? Did you ever watch the Nick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, oh my god  It's a it takes place in a New York City  in the 18 somethings it's basically about the arrival of the invention of surgery the  Knick is they weren't really good at it first

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was thinking of nip-tuck, but that no K and I see K

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the nickname for the knickerbocker hospital Clive Owen was a star of it  and it was it was  Horrific Steven Soderberg directed it. It was horrific. It was 1900  But honestly without this we wouldn't have modern surgical techniques  It's just in the early days as you might imagine when they were first with everything. Yeah, it was pretty bad, right with everything  There's a beginning. It was pretty bad. There's there are scenes in it. And yeah, I don't think they had modern hygiene yet  There were  There were scenes in it where they had some sort of blood transfusion machine that an intern would have to crank by hand  To keep it running  It was all pretty bad  Anyway, if you want to feel good about what we've got today compared to then that's it. Can I ask a geeky question? Sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What were we expecting in the World Congress aren't phones just all the same now? Well, okay, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does this kill that whole I think this might kill mobile or mobile World Congress because it isn't as necessary  In fact to that point Samsung yesterday had an event announcing their new phone  They didn't feel like they had to wait the effect. They specifically didn't want to wait till mobile World Congress  It's only smaller companies that need MWC to announce phones, right? Well in

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Samsung hasn't been doing anything over there for a while anyway, so it doesn't matter to them Microsoft wasn't gonna go

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  LG wasn't gonna go  MediaTek the chip company wasn't gonna go. I mean the dropout was Sony

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they didn't go because of the coronavirus

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, I think also it didn't hurt that they didn't need to the need to write

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They still have their clout without right MWC, right? So has anybody announced like a web spectacular

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but I imagine that's the next thing. Well, we couldn't go there was an announcement today. I don't think it's related  Andy Rubin announced that he was putting essential down. It's over  What was essentially so Andy Rubin invented Android? He created the company Android was purchased by micro by Google  He became a Google executive where he continued development of Android  We talked a lot about it a few years ago when he left to pursue his dream of where let's discuss his leaving robots  Yeah, and then left completely he left  Yeah, I think involuntarily because of you know  considerable allegations  Considerable allegations about sexual harassment which actually seem endemic at Google, but that's another story  He received a 90 million dollar payout, which really irritated a lot of Google employees  Yeah  Took some of that money raised more money  in fact became created a billion dollar company called essential the idea was to make a  Perfect Android phone. In fact, I bought that first essential phone was a beautiful phone  I really liked and it had some interesting novel ideas that were going to be clamp on  Right. Well the thing that kept it from being a hit. No, I liked it  The thing that kept it from being a hit is that their camera app crashed  For the first few months after it was released so you couldn't take any pictures with it. They fixed that eventually  I gave mine to a father Robert, but I actually really liked it was a little smaller

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There were some nice things about the essential phone and he was also developing that extra little slim phone, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he had remember he announced and they were going to be the essential to he also Stacey was gonna do a lot of home

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Automation stuff, right? I remember the home automation but that never happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So never happened wouldn't you say that his departure and payout was the start of the entire movement of unhappiness inside Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. Well, I think there were a number of other  Events. In fact, we really have to give credit to the woman who wrote the uber memo  Yeah, I'm saying inside Google inside Google  But I think that so that was one of many that was the wave that swept through Google and then and then you're right  I think that the chief issue in the me too movement at Google was Andy Rubin's  90-million-dollar

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And now you have the head of HR or whatever they call it has left at Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Departing. Yeah now she wait a minute. I thought she just took a different role at Google just stepped down from that  HR leadership. Is that the case? I don't know. I thought she just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's head of HR leaves into  tumultuous times it says  Vox says  Actually recode says she's quit  She of course and you know quit or was encouraged to quit I'm not sure but she became  kind of the  Locus of a lot of unhappiness. She'd been at the Google for 13 years  Head of HR. She said she's stepping down to be closer to her family in New York  You know, I you know, she's the fourth long tenured Google executive to step down in recent months including  Larry and Sergey  It has to be unpleasant to be at the head of Google with all of this turmoil tumult going on  Yes, see when I first saw the report

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought it was just stepping down from that particular role into something else. So my assumption was  Maybe she's just sick and tired of all of this stuff. That's well  She's having to take the weight of it and who's to say that I think you're safe there  Yeah, but Chai is doing anything about it. But now I see that this is all right  She's totally gone so into our set over the past 13 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eileen has made major contributions to the company in numerous areas from meter partnerships to leading our sales and operations in the UK  And Ireland are leading our people operations team through a period of significant growth  She hired oversaw the hiring of 70,000 new employees. She says she wants to spend  Oh, that's interesting look forward to her next chapter at Google. So that does kind of imply. Oh, right  Oh, yeah, my husband and I have decided she said after six years on the road first in London now in San Francisco to return home  To New York to be closer to our family  I'll be working with Sundar and Ruth to find a great leader for the people operations team. So maybe she isn't  It's unclear. This is also look look for a lot more of this sort of thing to happen in the next few months

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is the end of the year  Sort of thing to happen in the next few months. This is the end of Larry and Sergey's people the people that Larry

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Charge that's interesting that yes under might be bringing his people. Yeah, what happened to Carson cam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We could do the car

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like Letterman did we should just strap a camera to Carson's head like the monkey cam and Carson could run around the studio work  Then we wouldn't see you Carson. We just see everybody else  so yeah, I'm clear but  Yeah, I'm not sure I would draw a huge amount of  Conclusions from this because it could be all of the above right?  And if you think about somebody's been at Google for 13 years probably has some significant stock options

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some significant trauma and probably need they probably need a break

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Has Google mishandled HR over the last 13 years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rhetorical question. Yeah, I I would hate to be in charge of HR at a tech company one. It's utterly devalued  to your  You're basically dealing with all of these people who people skills are not their their fort and it's not something they're  Again not valued. So I think it would be like just an exercise in futility and bashing your head against the wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We think about  The changes over time right when Google started you had to go to a top school you had to have  Mondo grades then they did all this data stuff and they realized oh, nope. You actually don't need that  You just need to be smart  You know they did all those stupid tests and they stopped doing that and then they had all these things about how  Your life is different and this and that and they they made themselves into the perfect place to work  Which for a long time people generally I guess I've ever talked to seemed fairly happy, right?  But it was always far more regimented than we know one friend of mine who left there said it is  Exactly like the Marines. Oh, wow  That it is it is that regimented. I think people have frustration obviously with any big company the bigger  It gets the less voice you have the harder it is to get things done  And so that that problem of getting too big to be innovative  Which Eric Schmidt always said was their biggest problem  Comes down hard on an HR department. I think because what can you do about it? I've had some previous leaders

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That were at larger companies like at HP and  The likes of that size and they all pretty much said the same thing far as with it being so structured and rigid on the IT  side of things  But it makes sense because you have these processes and procedures in place to not only protect you but also protect the company

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think about the counter example, let's say somebody like Equifax who  Nobody got around to updating their Apache server software for six months and then they got bit by as it turns out we've now  well, gosh, we live in a tough age for news because according to  Law enforcement in the federal government. It was the Chinese that hacked Equifax. I  Didn't see that yeah the PLA the PLA they indicted three PLA that's the People's Liberation Army  Were they officers probably hackers would probably be the other term to use  for hacking into Equifax and  according to our intelligence  Authorities that Equifax joins anthem big big medical provider and they even think the Marriott hack  Was Chinese and one of the what are the pieces of evidence for that is none of that data has ever emerged on the darknet  Mm-hmm, and if it were is there use for yeah. Wow. Well, that's a good that's a no, that's a great question  So instead of selling it on the dark web, which a hacker would do. What is the Chinese military doing hacking?  These places where you would get lots of information about people's movements and purchases go ahead get it  What's your what's your speculation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey they're trying to find both relationships that they can use offensively  To target like government people or industrial people they want so for really good  Spear-phishing attacks and then they're also trying to understand where these people are in time and space. It's it's basically digital spying  It's really what Google and Facebook and Amazon are doing is exactly what they do. Yes, but they're using it for  It's big data because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Used to be you probably have to do this on a kind of more retail way, right?  I want to find out what Leo's been up to we can blackmail him now  You just get every database you can the bigger the dossier the better and you can draw lines make connections  He's gay. I could tell he's gay or he's you know, he's he must be working at the NSA  He goes to McLean a lot and we should follow him  You could figure all this stuff out using AI based on big data sets and I think there's not a business  There's no business  Well, what no I take it back  There's also a business value to it because and I don't think you can see nice you should never separate Chinese the Chinese  Geopolitical aims from their economic aims. They're one of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But at an individual level if they know that I stayed in the given Marriott, how do they use that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's the single piece is not that useful  but if they can get a pattern aggregate and and not merely get a pattern but notice that every time Jeff Jarvis is in  Washington DC so is a  Person another person of interest and they both have dinner at the same restaurant and you know  I mean there it's it's an aggregate and it's the same exact thing Google does and Facebook does  Yeah, they do it on the behalf of advertisers, but you can imagine what the Chinese could do with this. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It just seems like it's  Thank you a lot a few needles in a very large haystack. Oh, but okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Jeff, this is why you're not tech. This is why you call this techno panic, but it's actually  Relatively simple to bring compute power to bear here. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Having access to I'm just trying to stick to the  The payoff to them. Well, let's say

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not looking so they're not looking  They have their needle in mind. So they might be keeping their eye on someone that they think is a okay  That's about it. They don't like to know is they start with the goal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a way to get maybe but I would like wouldn't you like to know the five highest ranking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  government officials who are secretly closeted gay or  I mean, there's blackmail opportunities. There's all sorts of things. I guess being gay is no longer. Thank God  blackmailable  Maybe it depends on the culture

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe the federal officials would tell the truth

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, that's right and in certain precincts of Washington DC it might also so let's say they want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Go after a high Saudi official there you go. Perfect example  So they they would say okay. He was in this hotel  Next to this guy imagine and he went to dinner with this guy  Yeah, huge and he went and he did this other thing with this guy. Maybe he and this guy are gay together

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you just say maybe he and this guy are gay together?  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Baguette

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe maybe this  Maybe they're in a relationship a homosexual relationship with this other man  And we not that there's anything wrong with that we can well in Saudi Arabia  There is there would be in Saudi Arabia so we can we can totally blackmail this Saudi Arabia efficient  I mean, I think if I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chinese government I think I want every bit of data there is why should only Google and Facebook have that  Shouldn't we have that too every bit of data there is we could do thousands of things  You know anyway  That's and and again the problem. This is where it's in a post-truth era really gets hard to do  to make any conclusions at all because this is  Just as we've received information this week from the US intelligence that there is definitely  We have definite proof that Huawei is spying using their telecom equipment to spy on us  But are they providing that proof? No?  So I mean I I think I believe them but  That's it's that's the damage by the way that not trusting now after

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Get political for a second. I'll make it late  But after you see what happened yesterday with the Justice Department  How do you trust you can any investigation or pull back from all this talk about antitrust and the big platforms now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry, but it's it's immediately suspect T mobile sprint T mobile sprint being fraught by all the state attorneys general 20 different states  The the feds have already approved it. You see said okay the FCC said okay  The states are pursuing it a judge just ruled this week  You know prices probably won't go up. We don't really need  Competition between sprint and T mobile you didn't prove your case  So I'm throwing it out and now there is one last hurdle the California PUC  Well, I don't think it's a very big speed bump, but there's one last hurdle to the T mobile sprint merger now  I'm not sure I completely disagree with the judge. I don't think sprint isn't the strongest, you know company these days  I don't know how much competition they provide as the fourth carrier. I don't judge  I don't think Charlie Ergen and dish are gonna become a fourth carrier. That's the premise right that well  Well, we're gonna make a new one. So it's okay boss  I think T mobile and sprint probably should merge purely from a technical point of view the one company be  But they've been trying to do this it's been a little while  ironically T mobile is owned by a Japanese company softbank and I mean sorry T mobile is owned by  Deutsche Telecom the German company and sprint's owned by a Chinese Japanese company called softbank  So it's kind of the new axis powers here if we could just get an Italian maybe we get all of Eddie involved all of Eddie  Yeah, I don't know where I'm going with that  There's nowhere to go  I'm going back to the world war the world war to the tooth

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So all of Eddie I listen to this book which didn't that great but all of Eddie lettera  An author is all about a lettera sold for like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $250,000 an auction because of the author. Oh my god, it's beautiful machine. Yeah, I love my old all of Eddie  We talked about this last week. So back to  Anyway, we tied about 18 different stories into one conversation  Here was very nicely sewn up such a pro one more one more coronavirus

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have you seen anything reliable on you know, is the supply chain for Apple phones gonna die? I haven't seen any stock  Impact on American tech companies. Everybody just mentions that doors can be tough for supply chain

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're talking about it on their earnings calls so  It will have an impact yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did talk about this Foxconn factory is closed down for an extra week  Oh, here's a verge article all the ways China's coronavirus outbreak is affecting tech  This is from a few days ago. The outbreak shows that what impacts China  impacts  everything Apple Samsung Microsoft Tesla and Google  Google closed for instance its offices in Hong Kong and Taiwan as well as some Chinese offices all have closed offices  factories have been closed  Apple's head of people Deidre O'Brien said that  Offices and contact centers are expected to open next week  Retail store or reopenings are still being determined  The problem is this is a kind of a moving target and I think that until there there's an all-clear from the World Health  Organization, you're probably not gonna see is it really Chinese government?  You're not gonna see anything reopening

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it really news that Google closed their offices during this time in in Hong Kong or wherever it is?  I mean, well, yeah, I mean it's worth noting. Yes. Yeah, it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pegatron both of closed factories  potentially delaying iPhone and AirPod production

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See that sounds more like news to me that sounds like what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google they can move they can move the functions right answer right good point. You can't move the physical right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tangible devices is yeah great story because of the way Foxconn

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And many of the Chinese factories work where the workers live on premises right in very tight quarters in dormitories altogether  The government of China is blocking Foxconn from reopening its Shenzhen plant  Foxconn is independently keeping its Jiangzhou plant closed pending government review. Jiangzhou is iPhone City  Where the bulk of the world's iPhones are assembled?  According to Bloomberg, Jiangzhou might resume limited production on February 10th where this might hit badly is not the current crop of iPhones  But Apple was expected to announce new iPads and a new small iPhone SE successor in March  Those would be devices that these factories would be working really hard on some Foxconn factories  Sorry, Sam Foxconn factories stopped making iPhones and started making face masks. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Leo given the  The trade war fears of the last what year and a half with China did a lot of these companies set up alternative

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Supply chains anyway, yeah, I mean that had been happening and  Partly that's also because of trade restrictions in India and Brazil for instance  Foxconn has to make iPhones in those two countries to sell them in those for Apple to sell them in those two countries  So the factories are there  But I think it takes a while to build a factory look how fast the factory in Wisconsin the Foxconn factory in Wisconsin  I don't even think they've broken ground on that one. You know  Maybe they never will so I I still think we're pretty dependent on Chinese manufacture

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's oh, yeah, and it's it's so flexible. That's that's actually the story about from iPhones to face masks  It'll is as long as it can it should be  We were screwed if it if the whole country breaks down because  We're screwed even if you can move it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if you move assembly to Thailand you still have to get parts from China  You'd have to you have to move the whole supply chain as well. This is a non-trivial thing  I mean China is really the man the fact the world's factory floor and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's hard, but they had to if they were fearing a total copy. There were threats of major  Tariffs on  Phone you think under China? Yeah, they had to have done alternative plans a lot of stuff is starting starting to move to Malaysia

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's starting to move Taiwan  Apple's talking  I was talking about Malaysia every day  Yeah, well India you have to because they are starting to move to Vietnam, but this is something that's gonna take years

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they told me they talked about that the move that Vietnam just doesn't have the capabilities that China does and  So there's a lot of training it took years  For Apple to turn China into the iPhone  manufacturing  Mecca that it is, you know  I mean and in fact we've all benefited from it a lot of the technologies that Apple, you know  Developed in China starting in 2007 with the iPhone. Have that's where the drone industry came from  This where so many other things have come from the ability to make those quickly easily effectively cheaply  So I yeah, I think this is I mean think about auto

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Manufacturing how long it took?  That's a move from America to China, right?  That was decades Tesla is post

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Three deliveries saying what that long delay one to one and a half week delay  It plans to resume production in its Shanghai factory or supposedly was going to on Monday  I don't know if they did I think part of the problem is that it's not a little bit the coronavirus is a little unknown and  Is it getting worse is it getting better and so  Like all of everything. Yeah, all these dates are kind of moving targets. So yes, the answer is yes now  You know who's not impacted so much by this?  Samsung which makes its phones in South Korea  They and they yesterday had a big event announcing new phones very excited they talked a lot about it on now about Android last night  So I won't duplicate that but I think  Despite, you know, of course all of the nice features and I bet you as a photographer excited about the s20 ultra and  You know the most megapixels the hundred X zoom and all of that stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I'm not sold on the hundred megapixels, but the the zoom is a nice feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  64 megapixels or 108 megapixels the way they do that those with pixel pixel thing  Yeah, so these are really actually 12 and 16  megapixel cameras and they take multiple images to give it effective 108 megapixels or  64 megapixels they're very expensive phones too. That's another thing that's kind of interesting  They started a thousand bucks go up to fifteen hundred Samsung also announced a flip phone, which I I can't wait to get I'm gonna  I am getting up at midnight on Friday  To order this and then I'm gonna run over to Best Buy the minute they open to get the Z flip  1380 bucks  Those people were at the Samsung event yesterday and played with it were somewhat impressed. Yeah, it seems like that's  Right, no, it's not I beg your pardon  First of all, I love it. There could be like a little smurf laptop  It's like this big and it can sit out because the hinge is stiff. All right, so it could sit like that  It's flexible glass not not that soft OLED plastic that the other ones are using all right, so so if money were no object  And would you get one the flip phone? Let's put it this way if Leo would buy you one would you get one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would rather go with the s20. Yeah, you should get the s20

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd rather go that because of the way Jason howell will be getting the s20 ultra  As host of all about it, but we'll get you one too. You don't want to get up early on on Friday  Karsten knows he'll get the old he'll get the old

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm thinking I loved I loved my clothes at the razor the razor

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's made for people like you Stacy fashion forward people  It's made clearly not for me with pockets like Stacy or purses people people

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I love the idea people don't have pockets for the s20. They've got pockets for the flip, right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's the size of a pocket handkerchief  So there's the original galaxy fold and other folding phones are tablets that are folded up, right?  So their phone size once they're folded up or a little bigger  This is the size of a pocket handkerchief that unfolds to a normal 6.7 inch phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I like I might I I'm very cautious about  Longevity mm-hmm  Should not buy it until I buy it. Oh, I'm not believe me if I have a thousand dollars to spend  I'm gonna buy like something exciting like a rowing machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you talk well, I already have one of those so I guess I can buy the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  On that in a second, but let's do a long bat here  And how about how long do we give it six months is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It a hot thing or laughing stock. Well Microsoft thinks it'll be a hot thing because in six months  Micros well more like eight months Microsoft has already said they're gonna announce the duo and the neo one is a folding  phone that's kind of the size of a  like  It with two screens and then one is a folding laptop Windows laptops  It's nine to nine inch screens and they're all in unfolding. This is the latest thing for Microsoft, which is I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It gives you more screen real estate, which is why our phones have gotten so big in the first place  so I think if we can get it as long as the  The folding works right and doesn't hurt the glass then yeah, I think that's a total it's not a fad

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's where Microsoft will win is where they're not dealing with the crease two screens

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, right. If you look at another industry that's dealt with this already  portable gaming machines  Nintendo you're gonna say paperbacks  They're both dual screen there but but Nintendo  Is the yes has not made a  Hasn't made well, they've made one  non-folding

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Portable gaming like the past 20 years and the switch is very successful. That's not folding but it's very successful. Yeah, I  Think I really like the I like the looks of the form factor. I think the potential is there  it's unknown how long the glass will ask or if we'll start it looking creased and  You know dirt will get into it and all court there's all sorts of potential issues  That's why I'm gonna buy it. I'm gonna take the bullet and take the hit and I'll let you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I will put my money on the Samsung before I put it on Motorola

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we already know the racers a flop. Yeah, I think the razor is more expensive  It's using plastic OLED and doesn't have the glass surface. They even warn you there'll be creases. They'll be  puckers and is that just a bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know say hey, hey, yeah now let you know we're gonna have some crew says this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Andrew Central says the Motorola razor is as useful as a dull razor blade  Pretty much that was the universal review  Interestingly now no one has the phone at least the embargo hasn't been lifted if they do  Nobody's been writing about the Z flip  But the people who saw it at the demo room yesterday and spent half an hour with it said, you know  Maybe this is something here right some potential there will also require software that understands the phone when it's half open  Google's duo does do you know that's the the video calling program that is on Android?  I love that if you're on a moto flip and by the way Google put this in Android some time ago  They this was they've got they've been ready for folding phones for a few months  So if you have the flip kind of like a little laptop the top part will be video the bottom part will be controls  So it won't split your picture in half  It'll have a little smaller picture which means you can put it on the table and aim it at you as you would a laptop  So the camera can be positioned. It's infinite, you know, and let you multitask on something else. Yeah  Google they also Google also made a YouTube player that this is a little less useful has the  Comments of the chat below it and the video above it  But I would I want to work on a twit app that would play our video at the top and have a little chat room at

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The boom IRC at the bottom. Wouldn't that be cool? You probably would write here's another question, but you might be able to read it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Will Apple ever have a folding phone? I asked that yesterday. I'm at break weekly. Is this an Apple aesthetic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think it is myself. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think they they're gonna put their money towards like a heads-up display personally  This feels like this type of real-estate real estate feels like a stopgap motion to like putting the internet around us

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think if other people manage to make a successful flip phone  Apple will make a successful will make another flip. Oh my god  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you in your mom's basement right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We let Carson work at home one day

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Think Apple has not made glasses yet because no one's made successful glass right yet. That's right  Well, I think they made their home pod because other people made  Successful voice assistance as soon as somebody soon as two or three people start making money on a flip phone  They'll make a flip phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I think the experience with the home pod shows that if Apple just does it because everyone else is doing as opposed to  Having some sort of quality vision that it's not an awesome idea. I agree with you. I I think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't know yet  If that is a new form factor for the phone that everybody's gonna want if it does become that of course Apple will make one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't have to be the form factor that everyone wants  What's nice about phones is now that you've achieved market saturation

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can start to differentiate between different and Apple will always be a laggard there. They won't that's Carson's point  They're not gonna innovate in that space

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm gonna bet  That I can make fun of you within a year

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you're saying there won't be any more flip phones after this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they'll be a they'll be a wacky little oh you think it's Google Glass. I see what you're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's well, it's certainly possibly the then these are all the next curved  Phones right remember curved TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, right nobody makes those oh, yeah that was they made curved phones very briefly

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe that was a terrible remember phones that used to have stuff you could do on the edge. Oh, yeah  They still make that but it's not quite

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They still that's still part of the Samsung UI, but I do turn that off  Here's the difference I think you can make a strong case for the practicality of a folding phone instead of having something this big  I'm pointing at my iPhone. I have something half as big they could put in my place  Well, it's a little thicker you're right thick  The thickness might is an unknown and the hinge is an unknown and the screen is an unknown  But assuming it's kind of compact and feels comfortable. I could put it in my hip pocket or here's the other question

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's opening how much is gonna be a pain with one hand opening that can't according to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does not flip that the hinge is stiff to take two hands in to open a so that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Killer

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Your mouth and your hand if I can't be James T Kirk with that phone no way  It's a good point. So you're because you guys are strap hangers  So you're strap hanging on the subway if I can't if I more importantly if I can't hang it up with a flip  Oh, yeah, oh you can't do that. I want to hang up hang up with somebody just like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's that's fun  But there is a practical point of like you have to be able to control your phone and work with it with one hand

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're gonna all be jealous because I'm gonna be sitting here next week with a nice purple  Flip phones gonna be sitting right here and you're gonna say well that is gonna  Oh, that's well be jealous for about a week and then I'll be laughing. I think it's gonna be great

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't it fascinating though that we've gone from the original razor that was you know?  Four inches flip to the candy bars that did not flip anymore to the bigger screen to the note being even bigger  And now we're saying the notes today can we go back down? I bought the very first note

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bought every note since because I like a big screen. The note was nice. This is a six point seven inch screen  It's a little tall but it's a six point seven inch screen in a form factor the size of a pocket  Which I like an idea bigger than the first note. Yeah. Yeah, I like that idea, but we want to fold it in  I acknowledge there's unknowns. I don't know what the screen folding the screen is crazy  Is that gonna work is the hinge can be too stiff?  You know will software use this the but I think on the face of it that form factor is is sensible unlike a  Curved freaking phone which is just goofy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like a banana phone and getting back to what you said earlier about  Apple being in China and what it sort of led to with other tech is it's interesting to see what could happen with these  With this technology on other appliances and things like that Samsung has been invested

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Essentially a sad story Samsung  Decided they want to make folding screens a few years ago and invested hundreds of millions of dollars somehow it leaked out in the other companies  like  Royal and Huawei and Xiaomi we started making folding for oil was nice though  Yeah, they using that technology that Samsung's  dollars  Nice is a interesting first thing. Well, you like the work we saw that  Yeah, so the second generation royal you like that  Yeah, it did but when it had a screen like ripples when you opened it  Because it has to have a little good stretches, right super tan  Yeah, I think my other fear you're all gonna be jealous of me. That's all I'm saying people in New York

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a new it's a new  Jerky thing to do in New York is to stop in the sidewalk because you've got to open up your phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I freaking hate that keep moving people keep moving. It was like yes  There were all these people looking at their phone moving a mile an hour  I want to hit him in the head. We need a thing  You know like in Quaker churches where the guy the beetle goes around and if you fall asleep  He bops you on the head. I want one of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What happens to people on the sidewalks now that stop and just look at their normal people run into I would assume in New York

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, they don't stop. They slow down to one mile an hour

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Aren't people like kind of nudging them as they walk by I hope so. No, we're just growling at them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And trying to do we doing what you do with a car it's like it's it's it's it's what do you call hate driving?  What do you call that?  There's sidewalk rage  What I do is I go

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Old man yells already. There's already sidewalk rage. I mean come on, but you're saying that as if a lot of a lot of units  Are going to sell

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Enriched New York where they want to show off they have this

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You think so? Oh, yeah, what's this? They're in LA. There's gonna be a lot of people with this phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, I have many many many many many years ago when I was the one time  I was on moonlighting and I was at the Paramount studios and I got to go and have lunch and I went in there was  This was way before the cell the real cell phone people had to carry a whole case  It was this big with a handle antenna and all right  They would they would walk into the commissary there and that you know just have their assistant call them right of course  It'd be so important to have a phone. I have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Picture actually of Jeff yelling at somebody as he tries to walk around  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just figure I just don't know that many units are gonna sell I figure boss man over here  Be be one of the people buying it that's maybe 20

That's why I'm ordering them right away  I don't I bet you this is hard to make

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I bet you're right. I'm just saying I love that sarcastic look on this Stacy's face

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It also is the best selfie cam ever made  Oh  She's like go on because on the other no on the flip side of it  Did you see the demo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you don't need it. You don't need a tripod anymore  You can I don't need a tripod I can put it on the desk in front of you, right?

I never tied it together. Don't worry  I won't get any detail

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Already said it. Yeah months. Yeah should ask Leo  I could have told you that this week in regular. I'm trying this week in regularity. It's a good show  It's a show I want to do  I'm looking for the so this thing has this little screen the other story to talk about  I'm looking for the selfie. So that's duo right? So they the guys to talking on duo and then it has the controls down here  Which is kind of neat  I'm trying to show the selfie the selfie. So okay, so this  Screen here is a screen  So if you use this as a camera selfie camera, it'll have a little tiny picture of you with your head cut off  Before I cut off which I think is kind of neat

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is neat. I think and I like the idea of  Being able to put it in more places  So you're not getting that up-the-nose view of people when you're trying to talk to them on do I think that they've made?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually a pretty strong case for what the flipping what the folding

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's more than what we really need is like a little drone cam for our selfies so we can just have this  They have those out there. They make I know they make drones, but I want my can't my phone just to be like  You want to simulate that I see I wanted to have like little quidditch wings

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  golden snitch wings pop out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what they should make a golden snitch phone. Oh, I would buy that  You powder how many years how many years before somebody comes on stage? Oh one more thing it flies  Forget self to get flying cars. Yeah, that's what I want. I want a flying phone  All right, what else we did virus I was probably playing the Leo role of  Arguer oh, I think it's it's weak in regularity again. No  FTC  Investigating Google and they're not just looking at now. They're look going back through Google's acquisitions fact not just Google  Turns out there were a number of acquisitions made by Google Amazon Facebook Microsoft  And Apple and Apple that flew under the radar they were so small they didn't have to get approval now  the FTC has decided to go back to 2010 and  Get information that wasn't previously required under existing antitrust regulations

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is what I was saying before is one has to wonder about the motive

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure feels like harassment of course on the other hand the president yesterday pointed out that  MAGA is stands for Microsoft Apple Google and Amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So there sure they're delighted right?  Some somebody's get those hats made up. It's not actually go. I think this is why Google changed its alphabet. Yeah, yeah, it's actually an alphabet so it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, then then he'll just make it  have to mention Amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do do do do mr. Jarvis you said this sounds like harassment. Yep, it does

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, although there are I mean, I don't know how you would undo this but there are several  Acquisitions and they talk about the ones especially where they bought the company and shut it down  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they they didn't investigate at the time. It's a little ten years later years now. Oh, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This doesn't and they're gonna do about it. I mean well, and that's the thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's like, we don't know what we're gonna do about it. He gets on that, you know on the conference call  He's like well, it's gonna unwind it we could but I mean as a journalist, it's exciting  You're gonna have access to public  Transcripts and files that otherwise we won't know so there's gonna be an interesting look at this sort of thing  Although while this is happening, it'll be interesting to see what happens to deal flow in the valley  Yeah tied to that is if Bernie Sanders actually becomes president which long shot I know  but if you're a private equity or venture capital firm and  Either Sanders or Warren have both been pretty vocal about changing. That's why it's a long shot by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's because you know every billionaire in the country every hedge fund in the country all that money that dark money is gonna start  pouring into anybody but Bernie anybody but Liz because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In 2020 so if you're really worried about that happening as a VC you're like, holy crap  I need to one have my plan B, which is funding all these other things  But you also need to or sorry, that's plan a plan B is  Prep in your stuff to sell so you can get your gains before your tax law changes  so right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was all the time. Is it a put down to call it South Cackalacki? No, okay. I say it all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know South Carolinians will say South Cackalacki likey. I like it in there. What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  South Carolina South Cackalacki the reason it came up is Saturday live on Saturday  They had a parody of the debates and they had Joe Biden saying well, I'm going down to South Cackalacki. That's right, and I thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, that's questionable

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So but I do remember aunt saying it. Mm-hmm pretty common. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Favorite story. Yeah is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The first one under Amazon. Oh, yeah, you said you had a story. That's hard. I laughed hard. He laughed hard  Oh, I  Had to say I did too. I put this in this is a tweet thread from Dave Messlin  Shall we just go through it? Let's just go through it. I think it's so great three weeks ago  I ordered a box of boxes. He wanted some packing boxes from  package wholesalers via Amazon Canada specifically out of a package of  25 boxes 6 by 9 by 6  When the delivery arrived at my door, it wasn't a box of boxes  It was a box of chocolate sea salt granola packets. I  Was frustrated but mistakes happened. So I went to Amazon.ca and saw that I could send the package back for free  I clicked on wrong items shipped asked them to reship the correct item a few days later another box of granola arrived. I  Shipped it back canceled the order asked for a refund then  Starting a fresh reordered the boxes. I figured what's the chance that it happened again two days later?  I got a box of Harry Potter coasters  The Marauders map coaster said four-piece I kid you not he says I kid you not a package of Harry Potter  Coasters I returned the item for reasons. I can't fathom instead of asking for a refund. This guy  Is a glutton for punishment. I again asked them to send me the correct order yesterday  I got another box of granola today  I figured out the problem the granola company and the coaster company by their boxes from the same people  I'm trying to buy my boxes from and the barcodes a  Scanners at Amazon are picking up the old sticker  The old sticker from the box company on the new sticker  It's underneath the new sticker. So each time I was getting the wrong order. I was getting one correct  Now I think I should just throw 25 packages of 25 boxes ship the season granola back to Amazon  Plastic bags and just keep the boxes. There you go answered  After this thread was posted. You got a nice message from Amazon help asking me to contact the support team following a 40-minute  Online chat. No, I was told you've been delivered the wrong items because there was some error  But now you'll get the proper items. I said the air has been fixed. It wasn't fixed the first three times  I'm skeptical Amazon said you will get the correct item. I don't want any more hassles for you. Please do now Ori  I reordered the package wholesaler boxes. I'll give you a nickel if you guess what happened next  I have now received a total of 12 bags of granola for Harry Potter coasters  I reached out to the package wholesalers folks. They brushed me off  I'm just gonna go to a damn store, you know a physical place things in it things you can see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would have done that the first time. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Canada this is why Canada is so wonderful  Someone with patience is nice who hopes for the best. Yeah, I love this. Yeah, just love this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way  This this story a number of people of course, it's Twitter  weighed in  Lots of ideas and thoughts and so forth, but it's it's that's a great story. Oh, I'm glad you like that  Yeah, I saw that I said we should talk about this on twig. Mr. Meslin. I like granola if you care to send

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chocolate clearly you clearly have plenty of it. I think he sent it back. Didn't he say he sent it back

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think he got to keep it  He kept sending it back. Oh, he kept sending it back. What should have done is is

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is a granola story he should have ordered two and then you'd have an extra box so he could send the  Keep sending it back. Oh, yeah in the box again. He would only have to order it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bless his heart we didn't even talk about Facebook's Twitter account getting hacked. Oh, man  Not much to say it was it didn't last that long but

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People are just proving a point out there that hey, we don't care how big you are  Yeah, you know, we'll come back to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So do we know Stacy did Stacy already tell us that nest was going to require two-factor?  Was that old news or new news? No, that's new news

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have not told you that Google to force and I think this is after the embarrassment

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That ring went through because nest went through the same thing a couple months earlier  I have my own theory on this you want to hear Stacy's crazy  Okay, so here's my crazy theory one they saw everything that was ring ring was going through and all the people were like  And this had happened to nest as well  So nest had also had their people's cameras hacked because their passwords were stolen and nest said hey  We've been making two-factor available and this has been very proactive and made it available  But what I think is happening is there's a law in California  It's the device Internet Device Security Act and  That went into effect in January and one of the provisions of that law is you have to secure your devices  Based it has to have reasonable security based on the type of data. It's gathering  So I think and I made this case. So that's why I think this because you know me  The AG has not talked about this yet, but I think companies are looking at this and saying hey  I do I mean a camera that has a full picture into your home  Or control of your thermostat is that sort of level of data like I'm home or not that feels pretty important

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So maybe we should make it extra secure for a day one. This isn't using the California law or anything, right?  It's not requiring that but they are responsible for securing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what the law wants though. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't specify two-factor that you say it doesn't say how you should do it  Here's what the the really cool part is if nest does this and hopefully if the AG does come out and say yeah  That's what we're talking about go nest  Then I think we'll get to a really interesting place where we start seeing things like  Google's in a good spot to do like face ID or they don't call it face ID  Whatever they do for two a full multi-factor and then we get more convenient  Multi-factor authentication which would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was my next question. I actually love how hard is this gonna be to do a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apps on my iPhone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will because Apple makes the face ID kit or whatever the iPhone will be a tricky one because you can't do face ID  Unless you are Apple. No, no, that's not true

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Today yeah Apple has has all your faces Apple hat no no women. Yeah, right Apple has  Kit for it. I don't know what they call it ID kit or something that any developer can use so quite a few of my apps  Including my email app  Not apples, but canary mail my banking app will use face ID as its second factor  And that is a hugely convenient thing and assuming that unlike Facebook  Apple keeps the face ID information on the phone. I think that's a harmless and excellent way to provide second factor

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like that idea and this is and this is  Honestly a good reason for Facebook  Stealing your face. It's like this is this is  They can use it for evil things selling it to advertisers  But they could use it for good things to to secure your account better. Nobody wants

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't want Facebook securing any of like they are they already know when I open apps which is really  I  Would rather do it with Google I do it with Apple no Facebook do it on device and both Google and Apple treat that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They've got my face already

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, let's not give them anything else Carsten I don't have to give them anything else

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're telling them I'm Carsten I'm on this device I'm opening this I'm here  I am in this place

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And all of a sudden everybody knows you're gay information every time I open their app now all I would give them is another picture of  my face

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey Carson Carson just accuse them of moral panic and that'll really set them on here's the thing Carson

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right. If Facebook uses it to unlock the Facebook app, that's fine  But if you use that to unlock your banking app now Facebook is getting the signal that you open the banking app where you opened  And who else knows what else because you're using your Facebook face ID on your banking

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't want to use face. I Apple's face ID to want to log into Facebook. I want to use Facebook  Yes, you do. Trust me. I would rather Facebook say is this you let us take a picture of you right now  To log you in what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Carson you are weird is this devil's advocate  I was advocating  Okay, okay stay in your basement

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Secure there that's why it's not a problem. He's in a secure location. That's right. You don't even know where he is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Facebook suspends accounts in Russia and other countries for misinformation. Oh  That'll help  Me and Mar Russia and Iran those accounts are now suspended so I guess I just have to remake them in the US like that's hard to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're doing everything they can right Jeff we're screaming at him to do something they do something let me say oh I'm gonna help

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it isn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've gotta be honest. It's not I guess we're supposed to appreciate the effort, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean there is a there is value in making the transaction costs higher by shutting things down, you know  Constant and repeatable way, but yeah  Is it the most effective thing probably not it's better than nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's about all you can say

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I would show this new Facebook  Design, but I am not on Facebook Jeff. You don't like I couldn't get it. I couldn't get it  Some well not everybody's getting it some users will get the new redesign  It will roll out later this year. Mm-hmm. Oh, wait a minute  You can enable it says the new look by logging into Facebook and selecting see Facebook beta at the top of your newsfeed  But I don't see it. Yeah, so not everyone will have that that says that's what life hacker says  Yeah, I mean I'm hard for you to carry

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There is we used to actually do stories with somebody to redesign now, we just don't care who cares. Yeah  So jaded like it like and we're jaded  Did you guys hear it was an excellent I had stopped listening to daily for a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they did an excellent one this week  Interviewing cash Maria Hill about her experiment was last week about her experiences with clearview AI  Did you guys listen to that highly recommend it? I have to listen to it at double speed  I know cuz my  Doesn't slow  but the good news is  It's not Michael Bob era doing the interview  Oh and she does somebody else from the New York Times  Okay does the interview in any event cashmere who was also a New York Times reporter had some very interesting  experiences with clear view clear view is the  Mysterious company that's been scraping YouTube Facebook  In fact the whole public internet for face images of you which they then can sell to  Law enforcement law enforcement their face recognition technology they claim and it seems to be the case is like 99.6% accurate  Weirdly though cashmere got a friend who was in the police department to enter in a picture of her and  Nothing came up  Zero and then even more for her and then even more weirdly he got  Suspended from his clearview account saying you've been searching for a New York Times reporter  And  Then she confronts this she finally gets an interview with somebody claiming to be the founder and CEO of clear view  Which I think is still in doubt it who knows who really is but he says oh, yeah, that was a bug

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She says a bug is this could turn out like Cambridge Analytica that everybody was scared of and they actually couldn't do anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, they're very good. This is the problem  They're very very good because they've been collecting billions of images  From the public internet by the way  Which we know is now legal. Thanks to high cues  LinkedIn successful suit against LinkedIn  Where the court said you can scrape anything that's like well, but wait a minute  That seems reasonable if it's publicly available and a company figures out a way to suck it up. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jason how and I thought you're sorry our different case though. You can like are they because  My  My a picture I take and that I give to Facebook is owned by me and Facebook  It's not owned by the public, but it's available in the public public is it's not about availability

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's about ownership. Well, but you own your face, but when you go out on the street long-standing law says if you have no right to privacy  pay

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Facebook and me for that they don't pay Facebook then they can use it  They don't pay and it's illegal for them to use I disagree

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Know that under that doctrine Karsten then you better your your VCR is your DVR is illegal  Because that was the argument that putting it up from here to there in a database was the same as copy

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because I'm not making money off of my DVR if I if if I'm DVRing  If I'm DVRing something  And pay and charging someone to look at my DVR that's illegal if  They're charging people to look at my picture. So that's illegal. You can't make money off of other people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We put methamphetamine in Karsten's coffee

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Karsten's actually right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This has been established now  What we could see is and what we probably will see is lawyers coming up with new legal doctrine around  These sort of interactions, but there is established case law about this  So even though we may not agree with it that we don't have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Clearview on their website says searches the open web clear view does not and cannot search any private or protected inflow  including your  Including in your private social media accounts its search not surveillance  Clearview is an after-the-fact research tool  Clearview is not a surveillance system is not built like one  For example analysts upload images from crime scenes and compare them to publicly available images the most interesting one of the another interesting thing in this  Daily piece with cashmere hill is how useful and this is the challenge clear view has been to police departments  They  She gave as an example a child trafficker  They were you know couldn't find this guy couldn't find this guy had a picture of him  Submitted the clear view database and the clear view was able the picture they had of him  I think is in the back the background like it like a dim his face is turned  It's not a good picture, but clear view was able to track him down and they were able to arrest the guy so  This is what complicates it. It's very valuable. It's a great tool for law enforcement clear view says we only give this to law enforcement  We don't give it to the public  We only do it with a legal investigation

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right so Carson your images on Facebook are strictly

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Make a private if you don't want to be scraped yeah, if they pay me for it then they can then well there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's not what I'm asking that's like saying then Google under that doctrine under the Carson doctrine then Google can't scrape you're  You're I found out you're German Carson is a German name after all  That's like the German publishers saying Google if you scrape by sight to link to me you must pay me for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, and they passed a same doctrine and exactly and they passed a law to do that and then and no and then  Realized oh wait this law sucks. No you can you can that's okay. You can use my stuff for free

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm looking at break every search engine in the world because that's how Google collects its search index. It's not a doctrine we want

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No  Google has has pushed back on that argument saying we actually only scrape things that say we can scrape them  They they're actually you can clear view said that to Google and Google said no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you can with robots dot-txt say don't put this in my index, but you have to do that  I would submit that's no different than you saying these are private photos on Facebook  It's the same thing and clear view says if you give us that indication we don't scrape it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what that's what should happen  But clear view clear view now has been told we don't want you to do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now Facebook saying it is a blanket thing, right? Right?  Well, what about high-q scraping LinkedIn data? You think that was a bad thing, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Which what data did they scry? I don't remember what they were. I think they were scraping

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're gonna say it depends on what they get it depends on that's a tough

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jason Howell and I talked about this last week on tech news weekly  I particularly don't pay attention to this type of surveillance talk or what-have-you  but back in Carolina actually just a few miles from where I live there was a  riot in a convenience stores some a bunch of people went in there and just  Ramshed just just tore the place up and the attendee was injured  They threw something at her and hurt the attendee, but no one could be identified  hmm, the police were a block away attending to  Pedestrians that had just gotten hit by a drunk driver  Yikes, so it was just it was a mess chaotic mess, but no one could be identified and I saw this clear view  Article and I was thinking man  This would have been helpful to find the idiots that went into that store and did what they did, you know  But then there's other people saying no  They shouldn't have this access to this public data here and scraping and being able to identify and help out law

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's helpful, but it was truly helpful and that's that was catchmere's point is you know, this is complicated  All right, we're gonna have a new segment on the show. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I was gonna say we talked about this last week get a warrant get a warrant get a warrant

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we're gonna have a new segment on the show moral panic or  privacy violation  You ready it's time to play our game ready  You're a big Wacom tablet guy you use a Wacom tablet. Mm-hmm Robert Heaton who is a software engineer was curious about  Why the Wacom tablet?  asked permission  To send stuff back to the home office version 3 one of its privacy policy  Wacom said would you mind if if we sent a few I'm reading  Robert's blog post bits and bobs of data for my computer to Google Analytics including  Agri usage data technical session information information about my hardware device  The half of my heart that cares about privacy sank the other half of my heart the half that enjoys snooping on snoopers  And figuring out what they're up to left. This is a great post. It is you read the post  Yeah, so it turns out Wacom  Sends back and he had to by the way do some real rigmarole wire shark wire shark and burp  he was able though to figure out that the burp suite that  They were sending information about every single application. He opened back to the home office  He thought that was a bit of a violation now it turns out you don't have to you can block it and the and the tablet works  He says basically this tablet is a glorified mouse. Why does it need to tell the home office?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Aren't they writing software around these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  very good, Mr. Moral panic because  There is a point the Wacom tablet changes its behavior depending on what app you're right  That's correct. So moral panic or privacy violation. You'll be the judge

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's panic lock in my answer and it's also you opt in on that too

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and if you opt out you still can use the way you can use it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is one of the reasons why I was upset with EFF  with their ring investigation where they were like they're sending data to like Google Analytics and like  Yeah, I'm not gonna get upset about that. That is like device behavior  So you can adapt and make sure things perform well and and do I think you should disclose? Yes  But now it is you want a more

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you I mean isn't that part of the California privacy protections in the GDPR?  You have to say when you're gathering that kind of data

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think if you're if you have a California citizen, but like I'm not a California citizen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna spend the energy to figure out if you're California citizen or not before disclosing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it has the effect of of disclosure and it actually be quite easy to figure out if I'm a California citizen. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mean it would you just basically could be using a VPN I wouldn't know  Yeah, or your ISP and IP geolocation is notoriously bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For how long for how long in the early days did did every site think we were all from Virginia because we went through aol  Right exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure. Anyway, I think you're right. I think it's moral panic, but it was an interesting story

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And actually are you want it? You want to know what I'm panicking about what?  So  Britain has decided that offcom the broadcast regulator is now gonna regulate speech on the internet. Oh, that's not good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh dear. That's like even the FCC regulation. Imagine that you could have a dirty words

Transcript:  Broadcast regulator so they're the FCC or the CRTC of Great Britain and what they're gonna what they're gonna use is the online  harms report which I've screamed about before which is not only going to have you take down illegal content, but  Legal and harmful content and the platform of a duty of care. It could be legal  But it's still harmful and they get so the model that somebody said today was it's like  Wholefoods having a duty of care to stop you from getting that cheese

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I want that cheese well, it's bad for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but it's a duty of care to stop you taste because if I don't stop you I'm gonna get fined  Maybe even shut down my CEO might go to jail  Not because you did anything illegal or I didn't think illegal just because some nanny somewhere thought it was harmful according

How yeah, it's fun  It's it's fun, but it was over  Will Spotify ruin I have started reading Matt Stoller's big blog because he talks about monopoly  I don't know if it's good or not, but I enjoy reading it. I  Really enjoy reading it  his newest piece  It has contains an interesting thesis that I wanted to run by you particularly you Jeff  will Spotify ruin  podcasting and  What he's likening podcasting to is the golden days of the internet 2000 to 2006 logs  the logs  If you built a highly trafficked web property you could finance yourself by selling advertising  It was a three tiered system  Production distribution and advertising operated in vertically separated layers. By the way, this is very similar to the podcast market  Today sounds there were some industry players like the New York Times which both distributed and sold its own ads  But no one had dominant power in any one layer  However along come Google and Facebook and  What happened why the open web and publishing began dying what happened was  Their advertising companies their middlemen in the flow of information  Google gets 80% of its revenue from ads for Facebook 98% and what they did from 2004 to 2014  Was if this is the question for you if this is an accurate description of this because I believe you were there  Was to redirect the flow of ad money from publishers to themselves  his thesis is  By acquiring gatekeeping power and distribution  Google is a gatekeeper in search online video and Maps Facebook a gatekeeper in social networking  so this is the thesis to get to users you got to go through Google and Facebook and  What happened was advertisers started to realize well if I want those valuable  New York Times readers I could buy an ad in the New York Times  But wouldn't it be easier just to buy the search results from Google at a lower cost and still get the same views same eyeballs  The money flows instead of flowing to the New York Times flows to Google  In fact, that's why the New York Times no longer relies on ad revenue. They've really as they worked hard  Yeah, they've really worked hard to to beef up revenue through subscriptions and they're doing a pretty good job of it  But that's not a viable  playbook for a lot of  journalism and publishing  with when most users going through their Google properties or Facebook properties  Corporations could decommodify the ad value of a publisher ad slot. No need to advertise in the times just buy it on Google  so first of all does that I  Mean that sounds like a simplification, but is that roughly it's a radical simplification on a few levels

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One is that publishers could have had their own first-party data. They don't they don't they treat people as a mass as I say often and  Google and Facebook have data about users that data is now useful. It's that data that modifies the publishers  Environment doesn't matter anymore data about the user and intent is far more valuable than the proxy that was environment

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know longer needs it magazine. Not only do I not need to buy an ad on New York Times to get a New York Times reader  I don't even care if it's a New York Times reader. I want highly educated income over 150,000

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I want somebody who's looking at these boots

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even more even more granular. I want somebody who's in the market to buy boots tomorrow

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I know what boots and I want them and I want to get them at the best price in a competitive  Publishers didn't stand a chance in that case. No way no chance because they didn't have first-party data  They had no discipline of doing that. They didn't build products that gathered wasn't that were mistakes were made  They couldn't have done that could they know they could have they could have they could they could have built product  I mean New York Times food  Knows things about you and food that they can sell directly with food because they have targeted data about you rather than  The problem was we relied on I have my students always repeat this students  What's the myth of mass media?  Repeated myth of mass media is that all readers see all ads so we charge all advertisers for all readers  I'll say it again students. Okay, all readers see all ads so we charge all advertisers for all readers  This is a knife. So that meant  This is class so that listen closely it'll be on the final, okay  So that meant that that it you know  That's why you had a bridge column in a newspaper and a food section in a newspaper in the golf section in newspaper  Good all that stuff because you wanted every reader because you charged every reader to every advertiser  Online came along and I'm not Google not Facebook online  Killed that right is it all you want to pay for is the ad for us instead of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Trying to build a podcast network that it gets everybody to say we're gonna try for a narrow slice is that enough targeting? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it depends on how narrow your slice or the quality of your narrow and it's pretty high quality

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think and even more narrow Stacy your only IOT users right and my advertisers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love that I may only get  like  Someone may this is a gross exaggeration  But my advertising may only get 20 clicks right and I charge a lot for it  but in the 20 are people who actually  Five of them will buy the product

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ultimately from an advertisers point of view it's all about return on investment if I spend a dollar and I make two dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When it's a good thing. Mm-hmm, right? So you make targeted products. You're not mass media either of you  But the New York Times, you know is an exception all rules. You're the Cleveland Plain dealer  That's a making a mass product in a small market. Yeah  Well, you have a no limit of competition

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alright, alright, so good. Alright, that's good valuable information and let's move on to the Spotify challenge and see what you think of this  Spotify which has been on a tear acquiring podcast networks. They bought gimlet for  230 million dollars they just this is this news story that triggered this column. They just bought the ringer which is Bill Simmons  Smaller network 30 podcasts, but it's all sports. Although there's some society stuff  He does a movie podcast you watch a movie with him and stuff the CEO of Spotify Daniel Ek said we've bought the next ESPN  Like this is if you know, this is gonna be as valuable as ESPN. We don't know how much they spent figure  It's probably a hundred million or more at least for a company with 30 podcasts 90 employees and revenue of about 18 million a year  Spotify is rolling up the Internet audio market says this column  And they're willing to spend half a billion dollars to do it over the last six years. They bought 15 companies  All of which are about data analytics music and audio production audio ads licensing podcasting networks  and his  Contention is that you know right now podcasting is based on RSS is a free and open platform you make an RSS feed your a podcast  What you do?  Yes, thank you Dave Weiner what's fine kiss Spotify wants to do is eliminate that there in fact one could argue  They're not even doing podcasts. They're doing  Any more than Netflix is doing podcasts. They're doing this is like this is like this is what happened to blogs, right?  They're doing yeah, they aggregated into larger platforms like medium  so Spotify  By the way, he said, you know  Spotify no other company has Spotify scaling audience around the globe seven and this is Daniel like again 78 markets where we do business  No other company has the two-sided marketplace. We've built a Spotify that benefits both artists and creators along with consumers  Nobody else has both anyway, he goes on to make the pitch what they really want to do is privatize open standards  Take over the already large public Commons and here's the pressure point  They have they can go to advertisers say we know more  Because we're like Google and Facebook. We are the gatekeeper  We know everything about the audience because they have RSS was open they RSS. We don't know anything but but Spotify  Matt Stoller says you know what proportion of the revenue of Spotify is ad versus sub. I'm sure I could find that  I don't he's I think they've talked about that a little bit  They have it a free ad supported version and they have a subscriber version version. But by the way real strategy  There's not no ads in podcasts in the subscriber paid version. I think those still pockets still have ads in them  Mm-hmm, right. So they're double dipping  So I think the Spotify challenge is they could their goal probably is to put RSS style  podcasting out of business and and they feel like the pressure they that they can exert is we can give the advertisers a better value  proposition because we know everything about the  Listener we can verify  That they listened that they we you know right now, you know, this is hard for us because people say well did they hear the ad?  I don't know. Oh, right. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Revenue at Spotify is 1.86 billion euros. That's total revenue. That's up 24% ad supported revenue is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  217 million of those euros. So a big portion of it is subscriber more than 80%  Yes, I showed 90% 90% Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So their goal isn't the advertising data their goal is to be who come Netflix no, I disagree because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have the Netflix problem. Remember the movie companies started pulling out their a-list quality content  And and Spotify is gonna have that problems. They live and die by the record industry the records what it bought it could kill them  So they want to be they want to be the place to go for not music but for audio  Period right and and they can own podcasting in a way that they can't on the record industry  So I think it's a I think it's too it's defensive move  Just as Netflix started making original content for the same reason they have they have to do that to protect

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they say in there they said in their earnings, which the they did earnings  Last week this week this no last week. Sorry. I don't know what day it is  They did say that podcasts are having a positive impact on the conversion rate of free to paid users

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what Stoller suggests is the Clayton Act?  It was passed in 1913  Antitrust yeah to stop monopolies through mergers even when such monopolies are in insipid  Scipiency he says the courts could invoke or the FTC could invoke the Clayton Act to block the ringer merger

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Way too soon their market share is tiny never happen. I'll never win

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they can do it the play next says even if it's an incipient market

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're right ever happen you got too many other players and your players who you know has Amazon blown this as audible blown this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, also more to the point and there were comments on hacker news about this article that there are plenty of podcasts  I'll include myself  Marco Arment  Who makes a podcast client who are never gonna abandon RSS we're not gonna become a Spotify explosive, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Plus there's Apple as a major unless they offer you a hundred million dollars, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They on well more to the point unless  advertisers  No, no, no, no, it could be worse than that if advertisers don't buy ads  Because they say well, I'm not gonna buy your ads. I have no idea whether those ads are working. That's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ask a devil's advocate question about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well since this is gonna be your company as soon as you met  Metabolize whatever it is you're doing. Why don't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Try to know as much about our viewers as Spotify does

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Freak I don't want to know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a segue to asking for the damned survey. No, is it? Well, it could be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the surveys not nearly as good because a survey is voluntary it's a select group

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Are people abandoning Spotify and DROVS because Spotify knows stuff about them. No, but here's the thing  Would they would they really abandon us because we know that they well that you know something that's the test that people like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bill Simmons and ringer are gonna try and say well what happens if we go Spotify exclusive?  Do we lose audience my my suggestion is they will because there's too many other shows, right?  And nobody wants to be forced which client they use and it's in our interest and this is why I'm Carson  We won't do that. It's in our interest to be everywhere. People want to listen to us. I want to be on Amazon Echo  I want to be on YouTube. I want to be I don't want to tell you we should be exclusive  We'd have to be if we wanted to collect that information. We'd have to say and you can only listen to tweet on the twit app  That would have to be the choice because otherwise we can't collect that information

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Podcasters could have come together years and years ago and come up with a standard but just like our just like bloggers  Just like newspapers to over the years  we were all independent minded and  Didn't want to do that and didn't want to lose the openness of it. And so we never had that data  So one who get one who can't go with that data, but it's gonna be very expensive from Spotify  To get that data across a what you know, the podcasters stole a long tail. God bless them and  There's tons of  stuff out there  They're not gonna buy and the people can listen to by other mechanisms and they're not gonna have that data. Yeah  And advertising is a smaller part. So I that's why I'm asking whether this is more of a Netflix play than an ad play. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't know I mean, I don't know what Spotify's plan is  I think that there's a virtue in this in a variety of different places and they don't really have to make that decision  They could benefit either way, but I just want us does it hurt us  Is all I care about. Yeah, I don't well, I don't want to spy on listeners either. I do I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want to know what I want to know  I want to know I want to know what our listeners want from us and I want to be able to tell our  Advertisers what I let's take the survey TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it that to slash survey 20. Are we still doing that thing? We are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wonderful by the way, please help us  Easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll go get like Cameron Tong's battle over these things because I don't want to spy on our audience  I'm willing to mine at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To help you and tell you what they like. So that's why I'm willing to do it. I don't want to do it too often

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll do it once a year. I don't want to but I don't look I want to make it a pleasant thing to listen to twit  Not a car not a e-commerce transaction. I want to make it  Family you're listening because you like us we like you we're all in this together  Who cares if we have ads I don't need to pay rent

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But at the same but our viewers want us to succeed  So if we can you know, I and I thank you viewers for going to twit.to slash survey 20 and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you. I think I have some personal  Animus towards marketing of any kind  To success all that stuff. That's just my own thing. We know you don't Leo 2.0 actually is Leo like 50 communist  Well, let not have that problem if this is family

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay  Google Google I can't I can't talk  Google's Chrome ad blocker will target three annoying video ads  This is the ad did you know that chrome had an ad blocker yes a standards backed ad blocker  It's been around the vids what yes last year  now banning things we all hate like  non-skippable pre-roll  Any group of ads longer than 31 seconds before a video and that cannot be skipped within the first five seconds by the way  Who does this benefit Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait what happens to YouTube? There's all kinds of crazy ads before my oh, but they're skippable right?  Not not all of them are some of them are some of the Mars about this before they've been working on this for

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  About a year yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mid-roll ads of it that's ads in the middle of content of any duration that appear in the middle of a video  Interrupting the user's experience that's all our ads by the way all of them  Any image or text ads that appear on top of a playing video?  And are in the middle one third of the video player window or cover more than 20% of the video content like Jeff  Jarvis is lower third which is actually a lower half. I'm making a fortune on this a fortune. I tell you  The coalition for better ads group has mandated websites stop showing these ads over the next four months or risk losing advertising  completely chrome enforcement begins  August 5th Wow  That's a big  Also is moving ahead with his plan to ban third-party cookies. It's commonly thought of as tracking who wins with that  They don't need third-party cookies they've got a no  But they're saying we we talked to you know we did surveys of 45,000 users  This is what they hated so we're gonna. We're gonna block it. I think that there's it's a virtue  There's a virtue in it as well, so  Google Chrome will also block a  Variety of file downloads that are potentially hazardous  HTTP will no longer be usable from exe to txt  unsafe downloads  If if it's they're also blocking mixed content resources like files images and scripts that get loaded over  insecure connections from a web page that says it's HTTPS  So that is you see this warning a lot right mixed content. Mm-hmm  It's just confusing to users is this secure my not secure is this file secure so it'll it'll protect your privacy and also  Protect your you can still get a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could download it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it's not gonna prevent malware. You know did I say that no you didn't but that's it'll be a little better  People will assume that they won't get malware insecure downloads are bad for privacy and security  An eavesdropper can see what a user is downloading an active attacker can swap the download for malicious one  The man in the middle attack that's prevented by HTTPS, so that's that's the theory  there and  I  Have to read this carefully now you period can text like this thanks period to Google's new speech to text period settings  Google's this is from the verge Kim Lyons writing Google's overly aggressive voice to text setting is  Auto-punctuating poorly. That's not really a change log. That's a change complaint  They've apparently the change log is that they push to fix out over the last the weekend  So if you're getting weird punctuation  It's not in G board. It's the voice typing mode, which doesn't have a keyboard attached to it, but Google says we're gonna fix that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thanks, Google. Thanks Google. You're swell see that's the way to be. Thanks Google. Thank you Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should are you ready for tidy QA  You're gonna have to explain this you're the queen of the data set

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lord, I don't even I was like I've never even seen this hold up

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a data set that aims to capture the uniqueness of languages  It's a question answering data set covering 11 languages inspired by  typological diversity  Sorry, the theory is it's different languages express meaning in structurally unique

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Way is it like the difference between like when I'm speaking  Versus like something like ASL where the subject verb like the whole structure of the language is different  Yeah, I assume other languages have things like that. Well, there's always the you know and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff knows this from his German German. There's the subject object versus object subject. There's actually three different ways  So what English does it?  What is it subject verb?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey runs fast Stacey runs fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now it goes subject verb  descript  Adjective adjective or and German puts the verb at the end, right? So right so Stacey Hill runs  Subject object verb. That's it. So we are he'll run. Oh, it's the other way around we in English. It's s  Subject oh, right German is  Sov  There are languages that are V. Oh s and V so as well. And so that's that's one structural issue  and  There's more apparently the researchers point out for instance that English changes words to indicate one book versus many books  Arabic has a third form to indicate if there are two of something so you've got singular plural and just two

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Gender issues as well Chinese has no genders Chinese China has no gender German has three genders  What's the oh neutral just like Latin neuter male female neuter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, interesting. So there you go. I don't know what you do with it. But there you there you have it and that my friends
