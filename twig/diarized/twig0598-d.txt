I see you every morning. Sighum Batum and Mr. Jarvis. Yes, I see you every  morning on Wednesdays. Hello, Mr. Ant. As you're doing Floss Weekly, next week, by the way,  a legend if he shows up. Yeah, we're hoping for him. ESR. Eric Raymond will be joining the gang on  Floss Weekly next Wednesday. That is worth tuning in for along with, I would say along with, well,  but I think he stands alone. He's a guy who wrote The Cathedral and the Bazaar. He is very important  to the open source community and an interesting fella, a character. I was going to say quite a  character from what I've been told. Yeah, so that'll be fun. Thank you for being here. Also,  that was, of course, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, the townite director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial  Journalism with Craig Newmark. Craig Newmark. Graduate School of Journalism at the City  University of New York. BuzzMachine.com. Hello. Hello, hello. Jeff's been watching TV all day.  That's why he looks a little sallow. That and my lighting is always off.  And fresh as a daisy from the beautiful island, it's Stacy Higginbotham of Stacy and IOT.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Hello. Hello, hello. We were watching commercials before the show. Yeah, we were watching Superbowl.  If you want to start with something fun, Norway answers Will Ferrell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. We showed the Will Ferrell GM ad where GM is saying, by the way, GM,  we should point out, had the first EV way back when. That was the, they made a documentary about  it and all that, was the EV1, right? I do not remember that. Really? Who killed the electric  car was the, you should watch it, was the documentary. So GM has decided to come back,  of all things, to electric vehicles. They announced that at CES and they announced it to the world  with the help of Will Ferrell, Awkwafina and Kenan Thompson, attacking Norway because they lead the  world in electric vehicles. So Audi of Norway struck back. There's three commercials.  So this is the big redheaded giant who is in Game of Thrones from beyond the wall.  He, I've seen him in many other things too. He's great. I don't know his name. He's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How can you hate us? Me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And remember in the Will Ferrell Super Bowl commercial, he punched a globe  and was wearing it through most of the commercial. There it is. The punched globe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want to punch us in the face? You want to do this to us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. To me, to the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't hate him at all. We're trying to save the world.  I love him. I like that. Now, what is ironic. Yeah, we don't even watch all of them. Okay,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but what is ironic here is that Audi is part of Volkswagen, right?  Yeah, it's VW. And Volkswagen had the huge diesel mine scandal.  So they didn't save the world. Now they're saving it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but that's exactly why they're doing this, by the way, is because their settlement  in diesel gate, by the way, it also involved a billion dollars to put electric charging stations  all over the country with Electrify America, which is VW.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  VW. Norway had a lot of policies. They actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  dictated that new cars. Which is something for a country that makes a huge amount of money off oil.  That's actually a good point. I forgot their big oil power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that they say by 20... And honestly, which would benefit from  climate change because it'd be warmer there. They said that that's true. It would actually be good  for Norway. So really they're acting against their own self-interest, aren't they?  Unless the sea level rise swamps them. Yeah. Oh, that's right. All those fjords.  All those fjords. Can I get... So Norway, the Norwegian parliament said that by 2025,  in four years, all cars sold in Norway had to be zero emission, either electric or hydrogen.  So, you know, good for them. Yeah, good for them.  GM maybe, you know, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So there was a really good thread on GM and the concept of predatory delay, which is basically,  look, the tide has turned towards electric vehicles. I was really excited when...  Against? Against them?  No, for them. For them, yes.  For electric vehicles. And now it is time to, you know, you better get on now or you're going to be  like a laggard. And so that's kind of... It was a really good thread about this.  Who's the predator in that? GM.  Basically, putting out as much of the ginormous trucks and gas guzzling vehicles for as long as  they could. And they recognized at this point, they've got to flip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They created the EV1 in 1990. They sold 1,117 units between 96 and 99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, they didn't really sell them, right? Yes, that's right. But remember then there

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  was an issue because there weren't all those places you could charge them. I mean, Elon Musk  was quite really quite clever in his plan to make electric vehicles sustainable and sensible by,  first of all, he said, you got to have the charging stations. So he did the supercharging network  as part of the whole rollout. So yeah, I think that GM though is also widely considered  to be both the create the first electric vehicle and also be kind of the sort... They leased it  with the option to purchase disallowed by the contractual clause. You couldn't buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They were dragged out of people's dead hands. People didn't want to give them up.  They loved them so much. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In the first year, they only released 288 cars. So I think it was more a PR stunt than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  How long between that and the Volt? What did the Volt come out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because that's GM also isn't it? The Chevy Volt. Yes. We saw the Chevy Volt as  South by Southwest six years ago, seven years ago. How long ago was that? We went down there,  John. You remember? Yeah. 2011. So nine years ago. What's South by Southwest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who wants to tell them? I teased. I teased. Oh, okay.  I was like, what is happening? Well, son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Now we also mentioned... I was never interested in that event. I never was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You might also ask, what's the conference? I never went until Robert Scoble told me there really is  no point for South by. It's just a big party. And then I went, oh, I'll go. Yeah.  That sounds... Now I want to go. Crowd surfed and everything.  Crowd surfed. I was at the party. So... I remember that. I saw that.  Reddit had the most oddball ad. There were the usual weird ads, but Reddit's ad was the strangest  because it was a five second still followed by a Reddit test pattern. And their theory was you  would pause and read the still because it went by so fast. And if you did, you would see this, wow,  this actually worked. If you're reading this, it means our bet paid off. Big game spots are  expensive. They were very expensive this year. I think $5 million for a 30 second. Still expensive  if you only buy five seconds. It's still almost a million bucks. One thing we learned from our  communities last week, hint, hint, nudge, nudge, is that underdogs can accomplish just about anything  when they come together around a common idea like shorting GameStop. So I don't know. Do you  think that worked? It was certainly clever. I doubt they saved much money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You got talked about, which is the whole point.  We're talking about it. If you did that on the VCR, you'd have to adjust... What was it called?  You had to adjust to get the lines out of the VCR? I'm forgetting that.  The vertical hold. Vertical hold.  No, no, it was another thing you had to do. Tracking. Oh, the VCR was tracking.  Tracking. Yeah, you had to adjust the tracking. Otherwise, there'd be a line through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Reddit is doing okay. They just raised another round of funding.  $250 million. Yeah, a lot of money. What's their current valuation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  $6 billion. $6 billion?  Steve Newhouse bought that for... Oh, what did he buy it for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A song. Less than they paid for their Super Bowl commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm gonna guess. But that's something they can write off too, so it's no worries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  $20 million. Oh, he paid $20 million. Okay.  So you could have bought three, four Super Bowl commercials for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Just as I was leaving the company, he bought it. We talked about this on the show before. He  wanted Digg, but it was a consolation prize. Kevin, Kevin, Kevin. What am I saying? Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Rose is doing just fine. What's he doing?  He's a VC. He actually... I think we mentioned this on the show. Maybe you weren't here that week.  He tweeted that he would buy Digg back from its owners because he didn't like what they were  doing with it. He said, I'll pay you the same. You paid for it. You could get your money back.  I don't know if anybody took him up on that. But I think he's probably looking at how successful  Reddit is. Because Reddit was... Even Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman, the creators,  admitted a copy of Digg. Oh, it also ran at that. Yeah.  Yeah. Digg was the big guy. Reddit was like this... And then look how the worm has turned.  Digg had its celebrity as well. Who was the celebrity of Digg?  Oh, just Digg itself. Kevin and Alex.  Yeah, Kevin and Alex. Oh, no, the two guys.  Digg Nation. Like you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was about to say Digg Nation. They had a TV show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Podcast, we call it. All Brecht.  Alex Allbrecht. Yeah, Alex was on G4 TV along with Kevin and the attack of the show. And then they  created a podcast. So you're right. It was sort of like a TV show.  Mostly involved heavy consumption. Say again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, it used to be owned by an organization downtown here in New York, but it's now owned  by Buy Sell Ads. Yeah. There you go.  There you go.  Yucky. I'm wondering what's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think they're doing. I think it's... Yeah. But that was probably the problem.  Here's Kevin's tweet from January 8th.  It's a shame what happened to Digg. The site is counting clicks as votes.  Very odd. I'd like to buy it and return it to the old version 2 before the redesign.  I'll offer you $1 million, which is four times the purchase price.  So apparently Kevin's doing okay.  Okay. I think he was an early investor in Twitter as I remember.  You think?  Hey, speaking of Twitter, what the hell? What's going on with the Twitter?  So Jack Dorsey...  What's the exciting stuff?  I think it's interesting. I don't know if it's sensible or if he will even do it.  This was part of Twitter's quarterly results analyst call, right? Or something like that?  Yep.  Okay. So Dorsey...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Second billion dollar quarter.  They had a good quarter.  It's going well.  Though they warned that they've had a plateau, so growth won't be as high as it was given Trump  and COVID and everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. This is the first earnings call after the Trump ban and they did all right.  They didn't meet the growth expectations Wall Street had, but I doubt they ever do.  It's always been a problem.  The stock went up anyway.  Yep. They are going to add headcount more than 20% this year overall. Expenses increasing 25%.  MDOWs is the new number. We used to call DOWs, D-A-U's daily active users and there was  MOWs, monthly active users, but MDOWs are monetizable daily active users.  What does that mean? They're not bots?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  Because didn't after they bought review, aren't people thinking they're going to try to charge  people for access to certain people's needs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes. But this number, which this is for current earnings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So would that be like Jeff is monetizable or is that people who pay for Jeff that's monetizable?  I know. MDOWs, 192 million daily active users. That's below expectations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the most important thing I think about this analyst call was what Jack Dorsey was talking  about for the future of Twitter, including some interesting subscription revenue options.  He's talked about paying for the algorithm. Jeff, you better explain that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And an algorithm app store as well.  Yeah.  This is blue sky. This is blue sky. So that the posting layer becomes more of a  posting layer becomes the commodity. You make money by adding value, by having the algorithm  that finds the things you want by recommendation. I don't know, maybe fact checking. I'm not sure  what all, but there's a layer on top of that.  But there'd be more than one, right? Because it's a store. So you could say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  exactly.  I'll have that, that, and that. It's a menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'll have the Fox News view of the world or I'll have the MSNBC view of the world. And I'll have  it against not just Twitter, but one presumes some federated mishmash of various social platforms.  See, that's the thing that really.  That becomes commodity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. So this is the problem Twitter has. If they're going to make money with their memdows,  they have to be the sole one and only source for all the tweets, a silo. But he's understood  that that's really part of the problem with social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And it doesn't scale. I mean, it scales. He scaled, but it doesn't scale to the level  that Wall Street expects or that he thinks is possibly there's more conversation to be had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Dorsey says decentralization could be the solution also to any section 230 issues that  might come from new laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that the point of Mastodon though?  Yeah, that's it. Well, I think, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  In fact, now you'd be a platform over both, I think, Ant.  No, here's.  You say, I'll find you the best of Twitter and Mastodon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, here's how I interpret it. In fact, by the way, the creator of Mastodon,  Eugene, is on the board of advisors talking to Dorsey about options.  So clearly Dorsey understands Mastodon as we call a Fetaverse.  No, not Feta cheese, Stacey, as delicious as that is.  Although I like that so much. I've actually made it a part of our Fetaverse at Twitter.Social.  But the idea is I run a server, you run a server, you, you, you.  There's hundreds of servers out there.  You join a server of your choice, maybe one that fits your worldview or your interests,  or just people you like. That's your local server.  You can follow anybody because it's federated. That's what federated means.  You can follow anybody on any of the other servers.  And what Twitter is saying is we'll set this up.  There'll be a variety. And by the way, there's other things.  There's things like Pixel Feed or Pixel Fed, which is an Instagram, PixelFed.Social,  based on the Fetaverse. So it is identical to Instagram, but it's on the Fetaverse,  which is actually really kind of neat. Interesting.  Yeah, I can log into my PixelFed. I don't do Instagram anymore, as you know,  but I do PixelFed.Social. And that means I have two accounts, one on Twitter.Social  and one on PixelFed.Social. I'm going to log in here somewhere. Oh, here it is.  Looking. And you can follow me on both.  Oh, I got a two factor on this. Wow. I really must have taken this seriously when I signed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow. Geez, I was afraid somebody...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Such a good man. Two factors.  So I think what Dorsey is imagining is that Twitter would be one among equals,  but that's not even the value that Twitter adds to the game. What Twitter really adds to the game is  this algorithm, this curation. So they want to be the view into the Fetaverse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What's interesting to me, too, Leo, is they're even the curator of the curators,  that there is an algo store. Because of the store, right.  And that maybe Twitter runs that. Right.  Twitter has entries into the algo store, is my presumption, that it would have certain views  from the social world that Twitter offers you, but others could do. It's just like WordPress.  WordPress is a commoditized and open source at the software layer. It's at the value add

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  layer where money is made. Yeah, but honestly, the beauty of the  Fetaverse is you can do that. I could do that with Twitter social or whatever, but you don't  control anything. And I think that that would be critical to the whole enterprise. And I worry that  Jack is going to have a different vision of what Twitter's role is in this. If it really supports  the Fetaverse, I think this is great. So this is another... So I should show

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  tweet.social too, actually. He's got a bet that he can win at adding value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, as a curator. Rather than at controlling, yes.  So this is tweet.social. So it looks a lot like tweet deck. By the way, that was another thing  Dorsey floated. Maybe people will pay for tweet deck. So this looks a lot like tweet deck. This  is the home, which is the people I'm following and my notifications. This is the local timeline,  which is everything on our server. And then this is a federated timeline, which is... This is a  little complicated. Everything that everybody on our server is following on all the other servers

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  right now. Bloomberg's bot is spamming it with... So it's like a graph, like a social graph kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  thing? Yeah. That's a good way to put it. Yeah. Friends of friends, that kind of thing. And there  is a fire hose you could watch of all the stuff on all the federated servers, but it's quite a fire  hose. So this is... A pretty picture of a flower. Isn't that pretty? So people do this. But see,  but then let me show you Pixel Fed, which looks just like Instagram. We'll talk about that. It's  not that flower, but another flower. This is what... This is the purple flower. This is just like  Instagram, right? But it's also part of the Fediverse. So my handle on this can be followed  on Mastodon as well as anywhere else. So I think that this is... And then people see your... They see

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  these pictures, but they see it in the format that looks more like Twitter. They could. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's format independent, which is the beauty of it. But if you look at this, this looks just like  an Instagram feed, doesn't it? Sure does. Yeah. Yes. Like why has an Instagram suit it looks that  much like? Like a suit, exactly. Okay, fine. Don't sue them. No, I don't think... Can you wait? Can

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  you... I don't think you can sue for a design. You can sue for a brand. You can sue for content,  treatment of content. A design, I don't think you can sue for. I love it that this is... That's how

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  H&M operates, right? This is an open source, federated Instagram. It doesn't have any of  the issues that Instagram has because it's federated. Now I'm using the Pixel Fed server,  but I could use twit.social as well. So yeah, this is one view. This is one view and this is another  view, but it's all... And the conversation is very Twitter-like. Actually, you have 500 characters,  which makes it a little better than Twitter, I think. So you can really be worried. Jeff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you can sue for design under, I think, copyright and maybe some other things, but it's really...  Courts hate it and they tend to block them. So you can sue. It's just difficult to get it. Oh yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you can Samsung, Apple sued Samsung over the look and feel. It's a big deal in the fashion industry.  Yeah. Look and feel is a little nebulous, though. That's why courts don't like it.  But a jury can rule. They can say, no, that's clearly a copy of the look and feel.  Sorry. So I think it's... I hope that he's not just blowing smoke on this. I think this would be a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, I think he does that too, but... No, I think he's invested in this. He's coming back to it.  I think he has a vision in his head of what this world could look like. And I think it's a way to...  I was thinking about today, Leo, with the rundown. I wonder whether...  Is there a world where Jack could suddenly leap over Mark?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's interesting. So by the way, I'm just going to like this would be...  How would you... How would you propel his...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because what he's saying...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, because what he sees is that he wants to connect to much more conversation,  but find the good in that conversation. So Facebook is this closed universe. And what  Jack, I think, sees is back to internet roots, the value of being open, and you can scale much  bigger, much faster. And he needs the formula to do that and thinks this might be a formula.  And then I think that Facebook gets left in the dust because it won't be federated,  it won't be curated, it won't be seen. But your stuff on Instagram and fake-o-gram and Twitter  and Mastodon and everywhere else will be seen through Uncle Jack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't it be interesting...  Devil's advocate with all of that openness and just big expansion of everything coming out of  the silos, does that equate to even more misinformation out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Ah, glad you asked. No, this is the beginning. Yes, yes. And it's raw level, sure. The phone  book has a lot of people in it you don't want to call. But I go back, I'm sorry, I'm about to do  this to you, I'm sorry, but get your glasses ready, folks. If we go back to Gutenberg,  what happened was that, yeah, anybody could print anything. We had no institutions  built around finding quality. It took about a century to come up with the institutions  of the editor and the publisher and the critic and these ways that we found quality in this  tremendous abundance that had not existed before. The library, the librarian, these were all  institutions of quality that were needed to be created. Well, so now those institutions aren't  up to the task of a conversational world. So we need to create new institutions, new features,  new companies, new functions, new stuff to help us with that task. So yes, Ant, there'll be a lot  more crap, but you'll have easier ways of ignoring it and people who will take you to the stuff that  you want. Now, if you're smart, you won't just want the echo chamber, you'll want some view of  the world, you want to see what's going on. You'll have brands that will emerge like newspapers did  that will help you find the good stuff among all of the stuff, some of which is bad, but which is  ignore the bad stuff. There's bad books on every bookshelf. So what? We don't care because I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  read them. I don't need them. You could almost say that the silos are part of the, and I think this  is what Jack is saying, the silos are part of the problem right now. So there's a pool of stuff on  Twitter, there's a pool of stuff on Facebook, there's a pool of stuff on YouTube. You go to  those places to see that pool of stuff, but what if you took away the walls and you had a much larger  pool of stuff and then the value that was added was not added by creating the silo, but was added  on the top by filtering and finding the stuff that was best quality or most interesting. The quality  layer on top. So that's just a different place to add the value to the equation. And I think Dorsey's  smart, and by the way, the answer to your question, Jeff, is Facebook becomes, instead of leapfrogging  over Facebook, Facebook is another, if they're smart, becomes another part of this. Or they close

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  themselves off from it. Well they could. Facebook says, no, no, Jack, we're not doing that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then Facebook diminishes. I think they would do that at their detriment, right? So I think that.  But they may well do that. Yeah, they may. And I think what Jack's plan is, if we do this and we  invite everybody to participate, that is of its own going to snowball. The network effect is all  in our favor. It's a new generation. It's a new generation. Ant, you were saying but, Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I was going to say, but can't one argue that there's still a bit of openness because a lot of  these posts are shared across multiple platforms because of just being on the internet. You can  post something on Instagram and send that URL to Facebook and it can be viewed there and commented  on and people can talk trash about it and say all kinds of things and stir things up. And then they  can take that same URL and put it on Twitter and do the same thing. And they do it for TikTok. And  so it's not. Yes, you're right. Or another way is Facebook can say, we're going to give you the

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Facebook algo across Twitter and Instagram and Facebook and Mastodon and so on. So that stuff can  be wherever it is originated, but we can create something that goes across all of those. It doesn't  matter where it originates. So it commodifies the origination and values the curation. So Ant,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you're stepping into the middle of a conversation that's been going on in this show for a decade or  more. And Jeff will remember when Kevin Marks, in fact, we should get him back on at some point,  used to make regular visits and promote the IndieWeb. This is the IndieWeb is the same idea  from the other, from a more open standard, which in fact, this is the IndieWeb homepage.  The IndieWeb is a people focused alternative to the corporate web. The idea is your blog is part  of the IndieWeb. That's where you put your content. But there are mechanisms provided by  IndieWeb developers, things like web hooks and PubSub that allow your blog to be part of a larger  conglomerate and allows people to say, use Twitter and say, oh, and by the way, include Ant's content  because I like what Ant's doing. And Twitter find me five. And by the way, this is be one of  the valuable things Twitter could do. Oh, you like Ant, find me five more things like that.  And if Twitter did a good job of content curation, they could say, oh, I see you like that. What about

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  this? I think the Ant himself could say, here is my record. Here's what I like every day. You can

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  see what I see. So this is IndieWeb has been promoting this for a long time. And Kevin Marks  used to come on all the time and talk about the Homebrew website club and the various meetings.  And if you're interested in IndieWeb.org, I hope these guys get pulled into the conversation  because they've been working on these technologies, like microblog, for instance, for a long time.  And they've thought about these. And I think that they have some really good ideas about where this  is going. Unfortunately, it's become a little bit of a backwater compared to Facebook and Twitter  and YouTube. It would be really, I hope Jack is not just blowing smoke. The problem is, he's a  public company. And some stakeholders might see this as reducing the value of their stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, knowing Jack, he'll just start a third company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's what Ev did, right? So Ev Williams moved on from Twitter and created Medium.  By the way, Blue Sky is the name, as you said. It is Blue Sky Research, but it's actually the name  of this thing that they've been working on for the last few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Do you know the people who are on his Blue Sky team? Do you guys know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I know the Mastodon guy for sure. So there's two different groups. There's the actual Blue Sky  developers. And I think, let me see here in this story if they said the number. I think there are  10 people working on it. And then there's 50 more people on an advisory board who are helping them  understand. Because the thing is, there's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I can give you Gutenberg stuff for the advisory board. I'll do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are a lot of people who have been thinking long and hard about this, including Kevin Marx.  We'll see.  Maybe the irony of this may be that the attacks on Section 230 actually force this along.  That's one of the things Jack's trying to address here, is a situation where suddenly you're liable  for your content. He doesn't want to be in that position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, so in this case, you're not the host. You're just the recommender.  Yeah. Facilitator.  But you'll be found liable for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In the call on Thursday, Dorsey said this could be a way to, quote,  address some of the problems that is facing Section 230.  It could collapse how we communicate on the internet.  Actually, he said stripping back 230 could collapse how we communicate on the internet  and leave only a small number of giant and well-funded tech firms at regulatory capture.  You talk about, Jeff, but this would be the reverse. It would let a million flowers bloom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's also, Jonathan Zittrain from the Brookman Center has been arguing this to Facebook.  I've sat in meetings in Davos where he tried to tell them that they should offer a slider  and they should say, pick your algorithm. He's been saying this to them for years.  App Store is a really interesting way to approach this.  Or give me the far right one. If I pick a far right one and I get crap, that's my choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's your choice. You can do that now in the Fediverse. For instance, Gab  moved to Mastodon some time ago. The Gab server is on the Fediverse. I choose on my instance to  block it. Maybe I shouldn't. It doesn't—  Ah, you probably should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So once you start letting crazy into your house, they look less crazy. Familiarity for the  breeds. Not just contempt, but also just familiarity. You're like, that's not so weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Tolerance, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's an interesting conundrum. If you want to follow Gab, you still could do it. You just can't  do it on my server, my instance. You could join some other instance that Gab allows. You could

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  even join the Gab instance. Then what would you see if I joined this other server?  You'd still only see stuff you follow. Right, but I could follow you still even though you're not  on your server. Sorry, I'm not on your server. I could still follow you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's not commutative. If you're on the Gab server, unless they're blocking me,  Twitch social, you could follow me. But if you're on my server, you can't follow Gab because I have  unilaterally blocked it. But you could follow everybody. That's the only server I block.  You could follow everybody else. There are sex worker servers. There are, I'm sure, other Nazi  servers. There are all kinds of servers. If you're interested, JoinMastodon, I think it's .org,  has a directory of servers. JoiningMastodon.org so you could see what are out there.  They have a little thing, I think. Is it on JoinMastodon? Maybe not. But there is somewhere  a site where you could say, I like this, I like this, I don't want to see that, I don't want to  see that. And you check those boxes and it makes some suggestions. Yeah, this is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's kind of gets to where, but it's not really where ants going. Ants saying that there's more  value needed to avoid the crap. And you start down that route here, but it's a very rudimentary layer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right? Well, just like Twitter, you only see what you follow.  Right. Although you might be inclined once in a while to open up the sluices  and see what else is out there as a discovery. Yeah, that you might be missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Saying, and then, but if you then go, oh, that's awful, you can close them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of content that I don't subscribe to or follow, but yet it always ended up popping

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  into my feed. That's the algorithm, Ant. And that's the thing I'm always invading against,  is that Facebook intrudes into you, your feed by putting stuff. Not on my list, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and that's what people are doing.  That's what lists are great for me. I had to fix up lists and put in a bunch of mutes and things  like that to make my experience better. And I'm thinking that making this a much larger highway  is just going to make me work even harder to try to filter out things like that. Even though  I get, I should be able to have sources and access to all the views of the world,  just because I don't need to be closed minded. But at the same time, some crap I just don't want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  see. Yeah. And I don't blame you. I think you're better off in a Fediverse because  it's open. So you can choose a server that's, and one hopes that somebody would do this and says,  Ant, you have absolute control over what you see. And you will only see things you choose to see.  I think that's kind of how it is, but you could have somebody who's even more aggressive about  that. That's to me, what's exactly what's wrong with YouTube and Facebook, less so Twitter. But  Twitter, because of retweets, you do stuff gets into your feed that you didn't necessarily choose.  I always see stuff in retweets. So I turn off retweets in a tweet deck, which is nice. That  really cleans things up. But so algorithms get in the way, but you could be on it. There's nothing  to say that you couldn't have software that shows you only stuff you explicitly say I want to see.  That kind of thing. And I think that's what Jack's proposing in the app store. You would have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I could buy variations on different recommendations. Exactly. So like I could  buy now would I buy a recommend like an algorithm or would I buy like a list of people who've already  been he calls them algorithms. He says you're buying algorithms. So then I would find the  benefit there is that if someone's talking about something that's algorithmically interesting to  me, I would see their stuff, but maybe I wouldn't have to follow them. Yeah, that could be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The whole idea is, is there's a lot of ways you could do that. So what the first thing to do is  break down all those silos so that everything is in a giant pool. And then yeah, so but as a content

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  creator, like trying to participate in the algorithm, would I be tagging or doing anything?  Or would it just like look at the content? You can have that. You can have that. You could have all  sorts of techniques. Well, so that's that's what we would need to look at. Like, would it need,  you know, what is the burden on the content creator? It's also an opportunity. But then  someone like as a content creator could I could be like tagging stuff for the latest,  quote unquote hashtags, right? Even though it doesn't have a lot of relevance there,  just because I know they're hot or trending right now. So I'm thinking about how I could game the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  system depending on how it's set up. Yeah, there's that's always a possibility is gaming. And that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  what killed dig everything we gained. There's another layer here to Stacy, which is I talked  about before Samir Aurora, formerly of glam.com has sage for experts. And he started with 100  experts that he knew were truly experts. And then he went out to, you know, their selections, he got  to 1000. And then the system took over and picked the rest and it constantly checked against itself.  So Stacy, you could start something like that you can say here are my iot experts, if you really want  to follow iot, you don't need the algorithm, you need the incoming data, right? And you could say  here is Stacy's worldview. And Stacy can can can prime that pump. And Stacy can verify that it's  good and keep making sure that you know, you have a human check on it that it's keeping going,  and limit the size of it and have checks on it. But I can get Stacy's worldview of technology  through I could I could sell the algorithmic functionality, but you sell the input into it  that gives me Stacy's worldview should be pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the reason Jack mentions an app store, I'm going to put words in his mouth or ideas in his  head. But I think the reason he mentions an app store is because that's what made the Apple app  store so powerful and rich is you say here's a pile of content. And now anybody who wants to can  on the app store sell a filter, a mechanism, a curation mechanism. And you can by the way,  if somebody starts gaming one, you just choose another one. So you know, you've got this giant,  I mean, this giant universe of content. And then, and presumably, you could even roll your own. I  mean, that's what I'd like to see is some sort of simple API that lets people. Well, it would have  to be and then some people wouldn't have the skills to roll their own. So they'd go to the  app store, but I might want to write my own parser or something that chooses what I get to see.  I love this idea. I really love this idea. I hope he does it. I hope it's not just blue smoke.  We shall see though. I think he's smart because this there is still a chance to monetize,  maybe even a better chance to monetize with an app store. But it solves a lot of the problems  of the silos. I never liked the silos. That was always a problem. You remember, in fact, really,  I started getting involved with IndieWeb and Kevin Marks back with Bear Hug Camp. Remember that?  In the early days of Twitter, this is goes back probably 2008 or nine. They had a feature called  track, where you could say, I just want to know when somebody talks about this subject, I just  wanted to see it. I want to have a tracker. It was kind of like Google's alerts. And it was a really  nice system. And Twitter took it out. And so I think it was Steve Gilmore. I can't remember  who it was who created it. Somebody created it. My guess is because they had plans for monetization  and they, or maybe it was, it might have been, it was part of the scaling issues that they were  having at the time. This was in the days of the fail whale. They never put it back. It never came  back. It was a, it was a, but it was a feature a lot of us used. It was a really, and this is kind  of what I imagine with even a larger universe of data we would use. So as soon as, as if anybody  says anything about for Jeff impeachment, I want to see it. And you would get all of this stuff. It  was a great way to use Twitter. So we, we, they created this bear hug camp to kind of try to  persuade Twitter to bring it back. But what ended up coming out of it was the IndieWeb movement.  And this idea that we'll, we'll have to make our own tools.  So getting rid of silos and getting rid of centralized controls, I think is a really great  way to solve this problem. And then it kind of was, you know, honestly, we were, we were getting  there anyway with blogging and, and, you know, the attention, what was the, what was the,  yeah, RSS. And then what was the thing where if somebody would tweet a comm response, your blog

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  a trackback trackback. Yep. What was it? What was the company called? It was in moving type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dave Siffrey was there. Movable type. No, it was another one. Discuss was the, that was the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  that was the commenting one. There was one that just gave you your trackbacks and tracked them all.  I think it was a feature of movable type in the early days. Well, no, it was original company,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  David Siffrey. Oh yeah. David Siffrey. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was there. Anyway, that was the idea was  that everybody tech, neurotic, tech, neurotic, every, yes, this was brilliant. Oh,  it's just brilliant. So we had, in a way we'd solved all of this.  And what happened was the companies that wanted to monetize it built these silos, even when as  they were building them, we were using this word silos. This, this is not, it shouldn't be siloed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We want the open web movement online. 144. Sorry about that. Axios.  I think prematurely starts to smell this trend and says that it goes off with what, what Jack's  doing. It says also that Shopify has growth exploded as people move beyond Amazon plus  WordPress buying parsley. I'm not exactly sure how that fits into this. The Washington post doing  a Seuss advertising platform for the open web on ads. Well, on Twitter, buying Goose and Twitter,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  buying the newsletter company review. So I think that that's really newsletters are another way of

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  expressing this. And this is why I say, well, everybody gets crazy about, about antitrust,  the platforms. I think that they're going to grow too big and topple. I think that this kind of stuff,  the web will be the web, the net will be the net. And I think it will, it will, it can, it can rise  again. That's up to us to use these things and to show that there's a possibility here and to show

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that there's market demand for them. It's funny. This article on Axios is by Scott Rosenberg,  who has been around through all of this. So it's kind of nice to see that he's, he's reminding  people, Hey, this was, this was called the worldwide web when it first started. This was,  this is what we were trying to do. We've been here before. Well, and we kind of got sidetracked by

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  these companies like Facebook and Twitter. Well, so it got sidetracked, but it was also easier.  And that's something we have to think about, right? When you make things easy, you, by the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  nature of making it easy, establish defaults and I think you can make it easy. I don't think,  I don't think ease of use is going to be an issue here. The technology is to make it easy.  But what happened was more, you know, easy in the sense of, well, there's one, you go to Facebook,  uh, but it could be that easy. But I think trying to monetize it was the thing that went wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  To be honest, I think that's part of it. Stacy, I think Stacy's right to, if you go down that track,  you go to Ronald Coase, who was the theoretician about the beginnings of the firm. He talks about  transactional costs, the cost of transactions, right? Things became cheaper and easier to get  into a large firm and then they get cheaper and easier in networks. And the costs have changed.  The cost of doing what Ant was talking about earlier, getting rid of the crap has gotten very  high. It's gotten high in having to hire 30,000 people, but it's also gotten very high in the  regulatory danger and risk to the company and its profits and everything else. So the transactional  cost, the state he was Stacy was mentioning, I think is exactly a factor that it was easier.  It was cheaper to go into the big companies. Now it's expensive to be a big company and expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to try to do all this yourself. Yeah. It's no surprise. Technorati is now owned by Cinecor.  Well, who's Cinecor?  Big cloud company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I was like, huh, what? Why is that not a surprise? Where are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Big cloud company.  The Borg.  Yeah, they're the Borg. The Borg is a really, so the Borg is the good and the bad.  OpenWeb is Borg-like, one of us, but we don't give up control. There's no centralized control,  which I think is really where all of this starts, is centralized control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Technorati, so yeah, it exists. Yeah.  It's still around. Yeah.  Because Technorati was so great because what were the features included? So I could see  who all linked to me. Right.  Right. I could see who all linked to you.  Via trackbacks. Yeah.  So I got a sense of your graph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. It was kind of a distributed way of trying to do this. And I think the technology is advanced  enough that we could probably do a pretty good job of this. No, I hope this happens. Anyway,  I have to take a break because the show's almost over.  Because it was just too exciting.  No, I love it when we get in these great conversations because this really is important  stuff. It's kind of nebulous and hard to understand, but I think we've kind of clarified it. And I'm  very interested to see if this is what Jack honestly wants to do.  Gives you a little hope, perhaps.  It gives me a lot of hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Just launch a hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It gives me a lot of hope.  Our show today brought to you by Uber for Business. You all know Uber, I know, but wouldn't  it be nice if you're an employer, a boss, or you've got customers, wouldn't it be nice if you could  spiff people a little bit. Let's say you're having a meeting and you would like everybody  to attend and you just say, hey, I'd like to buy you a cup of coffee or let's have lunch together.  I'll buy. How would you do that in today's socially distanced world, Uber for Business?  It lets you create vouchers. Vouchers for rides, vouchers for free meals, vouchers for a cup of  coffee. 160,000 companies use, I didn't even know about it. And then once now I know there's 160,000  companies using it, Uber for Business to improve customer and employee satisfaction.  It's hard to find in these tough times, simple and effective waves to keep your employees engaged,  your customers happy. If you're trying to find a way to stand out to your customers and make your  employees feel extra valued, Uber for Business is exactly what you need. You can use vouchers  from Uber for Business, add $20 to their Uber account so they can order meals through Uber Eats  before the meeting or offer them a voucher for a free ride when they make their first purchase or  spend a certain amount. Really the sky's the limit. Any company can sign up to use Uber for Business  free and immediately start delivering extra value to the people who matter most to your business.  The vouchers are simple to send. They're easy to redeem. You get total control over who gets them.  You can set an expiration date. You can say how much of the ride or meal you want to cover. You  can have a hard dollar amount. Vouchers are shared via email or text, can be redeemed with a single  tap. And here's the best part, you don't even pay until they take that ride or order that meal.  So it costs you nothing. Send out those vouchers and when somebody cashes in, you can pay for it.  It's so cool. In fact, right now we've got a great deal for you. For a limited time, receive a $50  voucher when you create your first vouchers campaign and spend $200 or more. Go to uber.com  slash twig to learn more. UBER.com slash twig. I predict soon as you know when you do business  with a company or you were invited to a meeting, you're going to get a little voucher in the mail  or via text and you're going to say, oh, that's cool. They're buying me lunch. Uber.com slash twig.  It's a great way to spiff customers, colleagues, and clients. Affordable, easy to use. Uber.com  slash twig. Some terms and conditions apply for that $50 voucher, but start by creating your first  campaign. Uber.com slash twig. Thank you, Uber, for supporting this week in Google. And if you  decide to use it, make sure you use that URL. So you let them know you saw it here.  So Parsley, which is by the way, a great name,  is a content analytics company. WordPress VIP, which is the enterprise arm of WordPress.com,  is buying content analytics. Not number analytics. This is the first large enterprise software  acquisition for automatic. Do you know what Parsley does, anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Sure, sure, sure. You're familiar with them?  And yeah, yeah, no, it's used. It's one of the two large companies that are used by media companies  to analyze all their traffic. What story was big? What source is big?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the media companies that use WordPress VIP, Parsley, then they would be getting part of the  deal would be Parsley. That makes sense. Okay, yeah. In the long term, they're saying  automatic hopes to bring deeper commerce insights to Parsley to help WP VIP clients better optimize

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  for commerce. Content management. Oh man, everything is turning from content into sales. It's  bonkers. I mean, you look at what MailChimp has done.  What is MailChimp doing in that regard? Oh, they, I mean, the last year they've been  really focusing very hard on the CRM and the sales as opposed to like the content of a newsletter,  if that makes sense. And that's what you use, right? MailChimp?  Right. That's what, but I'm trying, I'm looking for a new platform that focuses  less on, cause I'm paying for so much stuff I don't need. But in, in this is, this is kind of this,  as a journalist, it is frustrating because your platforms, you want a platform that focuses on  content, but because we don't generate a lot of revenue, those companies need to find ways to  emphasize selling to people. Cause that way they can get a cut of the funds coming in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why not do Substack or Review or Medium or something like that for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Substack's business model doesn't work with mine. So that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cause you're giving yours away. You don't charge.  Cause I have paid sponsorships. Right. You make your money in ads, not in  selling the newsletter. Substack's about subscribing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Substack will let me give my stuff away, but it won't let me sell ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Cause you're supposed to make- Oh, is that it? Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does Medium allow that? I didn't think Medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No. I talked to Medium about starting a publication and it, it just didn't,  none of these make sense for me, but they might make sense for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it an independent B2B person? No. You know who we've been talking to and Ben  Thompson uses these, these guys. It's from, it's the Patreon people, Memberful. Have you looked  at Memberful? No.  But that's, that's actually, it works with MailChimp, but the idea is you,  but again, it's subscribers. You want to do ad support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. I, I want to do, I just need a newsletter that is, I mean, and MailChimp's gotten real dodgy.  You know, you know how you're not supposed to write in the CMS. Well, every week I discover why  with MailChimp. I don't write in the CMS anymore. It does weird things. I mean, like you're like,  I think I saved this. And then it's like, you think you saved it, but actually I logged you out  and I did not tell you that you're logged out and all of this stuff you're writing doesn't count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't write in the CMS. You should know that. That's painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I learned that, especially with MailChimp, but like even, I mean, it still takes time to like  drop stuff in and you know, you still end up tweaking stuff and then you're like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  See, I write in the medium CMS because it's such a beautiful CMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what mediums selling point was for a while was you'll love using medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They knew people wrote in the CMS. I signed up for MailChimp because I thought about doing a  newsletter because there's a lot of people that reach out to me that aren't on social media.  I figured it'd be a nice way to do it, but I don't know. Sometimes it seems like, dang,  that's a lot of work. It's a lot of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It is the commitment. It's hard. You're right. I used to blog every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I try to put something on my blog at least once a week. I try. I've been on it in December, but  I never thought I'd do it. I try to put at least something up once a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacey, you're a writer though. This is your medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I actually hate writing. I am a reporter.  Writing is just the thing I have to do because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to communicate what your research says somehow. That's why I talk.  It's a lot of use in writing. You like writing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like writing. A lot of people do.  It's right up there with sitting in the edit bay, editing photos or video. This is  therapeutic for me. It's your detail writing.  There's a chainsaw going on behind me. I don't hear it. It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not as bad as Mary Jo Foley on Windows Weekly this morning. She was getting her bricks

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  repointed. What is that a process doing? Bricks, repoint, help?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're remortaring the bricks, but they call it pointing the bricks.  She lives in a 100-year-old New York brickwork building. They have to renew the pointing. The  pointing is the mortar joints. The way they do it is they... Here's some German masons repointing  a wall in 1948. They scrape out the mortar. Actually, nowadays they do it with a drill.  And then they remortar it. Why did I say that? Because that was a lot noisier than what I'm...  I don't hear anything from you. You're okay. We put up with Mary Jo's.  I actually just put some bar sounds behind it. Glasses tinkling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Conversations. We pretended we were at a... Oh, I miss bar sounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. We pretended we were at a bar doing the show.  I'm thinking Jeff Jarvis wrote this. Stupidity is contagious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Key, my fingerprint was all over that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So apparently, it's gone so well for the Australian government to demand Google and  Facebook pay for news articles that now the EU wants to do it. And Canada.  What is the lesson they're not learning here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Who is they in this case? The governments or the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the government. EU. So the EU, and of course it's behind a paywall because  I try to read the Financial Times too often. Jeff's explained this to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah. It knocks you off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It knocks me off. I can never read anything on there. But apparently, this is according  to the Financial Times, the EU wants to do what Australia did to Google and ask

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  them to pay for news articles. So what's going to happen here is that  Europe's going to say, so maybe you can leave little tiny Australia.  You can't leave Europe. We're too big. Although it's the member of the European

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Parliament from Malta that's proposing it. They could leave Malta. They could pretty much leave  Malta and never notice. They could leave Malta with no sweat. But then I think what's happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  is Google is also opening up, I think as part of the bribery scheme the publishers have been doing,  it's Google Showcase. And Google would say, well, we leave you, we leave the showcase.  You don't want to be mean to us. So I think there's a game going on here. It's a ridiculous game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ridiculous. However, Google might have opened the door because a Google spokesperson told the  Financial Times, people trust Google to help them find relevant and reliable information from a  range of websites. And this helps publishers by sending them valuable traffic to their sites.  Okay, fine. And then we're willing to pay to further support journalism. And we're doing that  around the world. They kind of gave away the game there. We'll pay you. They're saying,  we'll give you money. So maybe Google isn't fighting this as hard as we thought they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There's a new term, by the way, for this idea of charging for links. They have to fight that. They  have to have to have to fight that. So they'll end up paying publishers blackmail money,  backsheesh. But they won't agree to a they cannot agree to a standard of paying for the  privilege of linking. That's just, that just kills the bet. And this is the new word for this Google

Transcript:  being Google leaving Australia, they're calling it gexit. Gexit. Gexit? No, I was gonna debate

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  is it gexit or jexit? But in this case, I think it's gexit. Google. Gexit. Oh, mercy. Gexit.  Google. On the rundown, the same spot, Leo, I think is important is now suddenly you have  businesses in Australia saying, what are we gonna do? Yeah, this could hurt us terribly. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Economic death for Aussie jobs if Google pulls search. This is from Yahoo Finance Australia.  News and a new analysis from IBISworld Australia, the small medium sized businesses that rely  heavily on Google's digital presence and the business's ability to be found through web search  means that Google's search withdrawal from Australia could be devastating.  Google's exit or gexit would disrupt numerous Australian industries which are already in a  weakened state due to the COVID-19 panic. Here's the industries that are most vulnerable to a gexit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Gexit. It is fun to say, isn't it? Like a gecko leaves you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exit. Caravan parks, holiday houses and other accommodation,  restaurants, cafes and coffee shops, hairdressing and beauty services. That makes sense. That's  true. You know, if I want to, I don't go to the yellow pages if I want to find a plumber,  I Google it. All that's dead now. Although maybe you go to Yelp instead. Is it good for Yelp?  No. No. You know why? Because you're doing it on your mobile phone and Yelp always makes you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to their freaking app. Yeah, I hate that. Because they don't believe in the web on the phone. Exactly,  Stacey. I hate that. Yeah. You tell them. Take that. It's just as cranky as Jeff is about  Yelp and their stupid app. Also Reddit. Everybody who makes you go to an app when you're on your  phone and not just let you live on the web. This is off Stacey. Apparently there's a way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and I learned this on Reddit, there's apparently a way to turn off that prompt to open the Reddit app.  I have to go through my Reddit and find it. That should be a tip of the week.  It should be. All right. I'll tell you what, if I can find it before the end of the show,  it'll be my tip of the week. How to get Reddit to stop bugging you.  Sweet. Drives me bonkers. Bonkers, man.

Transcript:  Before I forget, the other competitor to Parsley is Chartbeat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Chartbeat. I know Chartbeat. Oh, we used to use Chartbeat. We used Chartbeat at GigaOM and then  Parsley at somewhere else. I was like, I know both of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. All right. Okey dokey. I have no idea who CBS Interactive used to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No idea. I thought you were going to say, I have no idea about using these things. I was like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that you were not charged with page view demands. Good man. No, we don't care about page views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  See, that's how big media actually ruined the internet is the attention-based advertising  economy is what ruined everything. It wasn't just media. So it wasn't just media.  Right. I agree. It was not them itself, but they created the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because, I mean, Lord knows at GigaOM, we paid attention to page views, but we also did stories  that didn't require great page views. But. From Nina's Cake Cabin comes our  our picture of the week. That's my pick of the week because it's cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay. So what are we looking at? It looks like an Amazon Prime box, doesn't it? From Nina's Cake  Cabin might be something else. Let's wait a minute. Let's cut into that Amazon Prime box.  Oh, it's delicious chocolate cake with raspberry jam and lashings of buttercream. Oh my. Oh my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't that something? Now the question is, is that all fondant? Because if it is, that taste is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the cake is nasty. I don't like fondant, but I think it's just a fondant cardboard box fondant  that you can then peel off. Well, because if you could ice, if you'd ice everything and then just

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  use fondant for the barcodes. Yeah, yeah, fondant labels. Yeah. Maybe it just doesn't look as good,  I guess. I'm not a fondant fan. I mean, I'm being nitpicky. I was still. No, I'm with you. Every time

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I see something like this, I think the same thing. That's a lot of fondant. Ship and fondant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think it's the cake breaker's son. I think she was promoting her son and her cake. Yeah. My post

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  about my son's Amazon box cake. Nobody believed it. So she had to post it again with a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  slice taken out of it. She's clearly a professional. Yeah, if I made that cake, I would show it off to,  I would bring it on Twitter. Yeah. See it next week. I'd like to show you my Amazon box cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'd be like, look, y'all. I'll ask you this question. Have you eaten corn ribs?  Corn ribs? What are corn ribs? That's the newest tech talk sensation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh God. By the way, we'll show some corn ribs and then. As the experts.  Uh, we tried the Tik Tok food trends as USA Today. Uh, it's much more fun to eat corn in  the cob this way. So apparently you peel the corn off the cob. No, you cut it in quarters.  Oh, you cut the cob in quarters. Oh, so it's ribs. Here's the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That is just disgusting. Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does look kind of fun.  You got it. I found that if you stand it up straight and give it a firm.  You put it in an air fryer. Oh, you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm impressed that they can get these recipes in one minute. I know it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mix then brush it onto your corn ribs. You can also fry or bake these, but I air fried them at  400 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes and flipped one halfway through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like nicely seasoned corn on the cob. Yeah, that's a lot of effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like Mexican street corn. Almost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, I love that. Yeah, that's good. Yeah.  Corn ribs, ladies and gentlemen. Well, the good news is I bring that up to say  Tik Tok has been saved. Saved. Hallelujah. From the Wall Street Journal.  The original Tik Tok sale to Oracle Walmart is shelved as Biden reviews security.  Trump driven deal had languished as video sharing apps. Chinese owner mounted successful  legal challenges. We've been following this thing since last fall.  President Trump, of course, hated Tik Tok. Any parting gifts?  Oracle may. So what's what's actually happening now is a much more reasoned,  but still, I think, important process where the government takes a look at the risks  posed by Chinese tech companies collection of data.  And then according to National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horn, we plan to develop a  comprehensive approach to securing US data that addresses the full range of threats we face.  This includes the risk posed by Chinese apps and other software that operate in the US.  In the coming months, we expect to review specific cases in light of a comprehensive  understanding of the risks we face. So figure out what the risks are, which is a good question,  and then figure out ways to solve it. Like, and this is something Tik Tok's proposed,  having a trusted third party hold the data to make sure the Chinese government can't get access to it.  So I think this is a good way to solve it, not to ignore entirely the threat potential threat of  Tik Tok and other Chinese companies, but to come up with a solution that keeps everybody safe and  everybody happy because there's a lot of people doing a lot of great stuff on Tik Tok.  And also, there was the issue that Chinese government said you can't sell the algorithm.  So what was what were Oracle and Walmart going to do?  What was what were Oracle and Walmart going to get anyway?  So this just, you know, this just is something we saw coming for a while.  But it's a it's good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What a what a who what a ridiculous who was next week, another executive order signed by

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the former president is set to go into effect that would ban US transactions with eight  China related apps, including Alipay, the WeChat mobile payment app owned by Tencent.  Unknown whether the Biden administration will enforce the order or extend the deadline,  or simply rescind the order outright. But I suspect this is part of the overall investigation of what  are what are the threats and how to best deal with them. So a little more thoughtful approach.  And sorry that that means that $5 billion fund for education that was going to be extracted.  The president I didn't see this part. He apparently according to the journal,  he likened it to key money, which is the extra fee that tenants sometimes pay landlords for  securing a hard to get property. I you know, in New York City, you know, you pay a little key money  to get into that apartment. Back to back. It's called a graft. Yeah, it's called a bribe. Yeah.  It was a $5 billion bribe. And I think it was for the 1776 project, which by the way, when it  finally came out was kinda maybe you don't really want to teach kids slavery was okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I was gonna say Walmart's not gonna be one part of that. Neither is Oracle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mm hmm. They don't need to be now. I gotta remember that key fee next time I  you want to do this podcast? Give us a little money.  Little key fee to be on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's actually so journalists do. So some news organizations do that.  You can see it in conferences with pay to play. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  really? That's shameful. That is a thing that happens. Look at this. Tick tock debut of  Pink's daughter. She's nine years old. She's gonna sing a song on tick tock.  She's got a voice.

the change log I just thought this was fascinating this is this is from a blog called less wrong  lesswrong.com John Wentzworth he's making his own COVID-19 vaccine okay he says he says first of all  I have a little wet lab experience for my undergraduate days but the skills needed  are pretty minimal all the materials and equipment to make the vaccine cost about a thousand dollars  you do not need any special license or anything like that you don't need FDA approval as long as  you're not giving it to anybody but yourself and your family the largest majority that cost  850 was the peptides these you can buy these I had no idea you can buy them online they're the main  active ingredients of the vaccine short segments of protein from the COVID virus they're all  fewer than 25 amino acids so they're not they can't function as proteins they're not dangerous  for instance as an example COVID spike protein has 1273 amino acids so less than 25 the whole  point of it is it's not dangerous it can't do anything to you but your immune system looks at  it and goes whoo that sequence don't let that in that's what gives you the immunity the peptides  are custom synthesized I had no idea there are companies which will do this any short peptide  sequence you want there are dozens of them online you can use the cheapest ones you don't need to  purify them they don't need any special modifications you don't need much the minimum order size from the  company we used would have been sufficient for 250 doses we bought twice as much because it only  cost 50 extra to get double the peptides and extras are nice in the case of mistakes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but he doesn't need to give this stuff to anybody else he's not it's just him and his wife

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you need a stir plate beakers micro centrifuge tubes 10 and 50 milliliter vials a pipette  in the 0.1 to 1 milliliter range and pipe tip tips all available on amazon here's the other materials  they're sold as supplements keto sand and sodium tripolyphosphate  they're also maybe a little vinegar and dn iced ionized water you can get everything on amazon  simple to do you just this is hysterical you prepare the solutions of each component dissolve  it separately stick in the freezer till it's needed circularize two of the peptides which  means really just adding a few grains of activated charcoal to the tube and shaking it for three hours  so maybe you need a little shaking machine then back in the freezer when it's time for a batch  take everything out of the freezer mix it together pipe it in it to be a tick tock recipe this is  hysterical finally and this is the thing it goes up your nose it's not an injection it makes it  both less dangerous but also a little harder to prove that it's working because all of the current  tests are blood tests and for the antibodies because he's going to he is going to get anybody  test to see if it did anything and and he's you know he says and on the one hand putting in your  nose probably good idea because that's where you want the immunity because that's how the virus gets  in on the other hand unfortunately all the all the antibody tests are blood tests so they may not  be that you get an immune response or a strong immune response in the blood if you put it up your  nose anyway it's a great article he's gonna stay tuned he's he's gonna let us know how the tests work  uh  wow good on you for trying um he says you can't hurt yourself he because it's because of the way it is  it's just not you know worst case it doesn't work uh well let's hope he says it's a fun project in  its own right and it gets dramatically cheaper with more people remember a thousand dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bought enough supplies for 500 doses the largest benefit you've been wasting your time trying to

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  i'm gonna do yeah i might do this i mean if you do it just also make sure you get the vaccine later

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  what if i vaccinated or you see it's not a vaccine it's in what if i did this for the whole company  john would you all do would you all do it that would be no  i think this would be a great story podcast company  vaccinates its entire staff using homemade vaccine oh man that's what's the ball black guy  just watches that's what's so cool john is the loyal employee that's just what's so cool about  mrna vaccines as opposed see if this were you know a traditional vaccine this i wouldn't do  it because you're you know it's a little more dangerous but an mra a vaccine is harmless  now he doesn't unfortunately doesn't publish the recipe what peptides to get i might have to set

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  him a note so dr mom advice i said before the show that i i think i got a delayed reaction to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  shot like two weeks late yeah did she say with that that's possible wow she said go get a test

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  no she said you can still get it after the first shot get a test yeah you gotta get two

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  yes you gotta get two yeah i love this guy uh hu ma huge ma i can't be how he pronounces his name  huge ma he works at airbnb as a software engineer it was so he was trying to sign up his mom for a  vaccine in new york city was so complicated he decided to develop a site he did in two weeks  cost him 50 called turbo vax that went out and went to all the different sites because apparently  there are many many different sites to try to find an appointment in the city and state official  systems do it yourself it's what uh it's what all the kids are doing now you got the tech skills  make your own vaccine make your own website yeah we talked about it yesterday on security now that  hacker that tried to poison florida's city water supply oh i had a guest on my show talk about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  too yeah not a good so that a little too lately whoa oh we talked about some of that uh no harm

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  no foul there were lots of there were a lot of really good things in that story actually i don't  doubt so yes well what's the moral of the story would you say uh since you've interviewed them

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  what is the moral of the story stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  uh oh okay the moral would be configure your remote access software correctly  don't put redundant systems don't combine your it and your ot together don't put your freaking

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  water systems on the public internet nope would be a start that's the lesson i take  steve gibson said it's very simple you don't give people access to it if they need access  to it remotely for some reason you have to call the operator and say give me access to the reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the reason a lot of companies have done this though is because of the pandemic right and so  that's unclear if they did that here but what they did is they i mean a lot of company this is not  isolated to this one water treatment plant a lot of companies sent their employees home  in the manufacturing and in the the world of things yeah but require ot yeah but you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  put team viewer on the machine that controls the water supply and then it's not so no no no no so

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that's so the guy who has to deal with that and monitor those systems can do it remotely from  home yes and you see though that that's probably not a good idea so if you do something like that  you have to configure it differently and what happened is people were in a rush and you're like  but it's okay because they had backup systems in place and there was a guy sitting there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  watching the mouse move around and do it and he said uh and to their credit it doesn't take  effect for at least a month or so yeah it was in a holding tank change it was up that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  upping the amount of uh lye in the water by a hundred times which would make her okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  yeah what are your odds on who this hacker is because it feels like this is like  it feels both incredibly obvious like more like a could i really do it you know yeah it was one in

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the afternoon as anyone else if you were a real bad guy you might wait till three in the morning

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to do it no it's probably that kid levi in sanford florida who's that i don't know just some kid named  levi oh okay you know exactly it wasn't an adult this is some kid yeah uh but he knew enough to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  know where to go to change the levels um well he was he was there before so he was looking around  second time visiting yeah so again i was maybe he was like uh why yeah maybe this is just a  wake-up call for for people who run these systems maybe you want to lock that i feel like these

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  people know this stuff like they know this is a danger i didn't catch if there are any

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  legal ramifications for like did they were they able to chase back this person they haven't found

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  who it is yet or they haven't said that they found who it is it is a felony yeah so should be i hope  so i hope so yeah if you watch the pet if you watch the press conference they talked about it being  you know the charges that could go against it yeah or her they assumed it was a man it might be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  woman did i mention this last week generally good odds it's a man did i mention last week the  governor of nevada's plan to create innovation in the zones in nevada to jump start the no you  mentioned on twit yeah you were there to jump start the state's economy by attracting technology  firms seems like a good idea remember when larry page said we should have a google island where  there's no regulations and we could do what we want to yeah this is stupid now we could do it nevada  the zones

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
