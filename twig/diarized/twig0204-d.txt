Transcript:  The federally recognized Gina Tripani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great to be here. Very happy today.  I got my Angular shirt on today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I like that. What's that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Angular is Google's open source model view controller,  MVC JavaScript framework.  Well, there you go.  I know, that's a mouthful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it turns out that it's actually a really great framework.  So I'm now... I've got the company shirt on today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Weren't you using the Twitter one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bootstrap is kind of like a...  It's like a CSS layout framework.  Oh, okay.  Angular is like a...  It's JavaScript.  It's more for like AJAX-y kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're not incompatible.  No, they're not. They're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Angular is more like jQuery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Got it.  And that's Jeff Jarvis over there.  Speaking of jQuery's.  JJ...  JJ query.  Good to have you from buzzmachine.com  and points all over the world.  Glad to see you're back home.  I'm so glad to be back home.  I bet you are.  Bet you are indeed.  Well, first of all, congratulations, Gina,  on the Supreme Court ruling this morning,  overturning the Defense of Marriage Act by a five to four majority.  I know that makes you very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does. It does. Thank you very, very much.  And very legal.  And very legal.  More to the point.  Yes, my marriage is now... I can now file joint tax returns.  I never thought I'd be this excited about something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you ran out and celebrated by buying a...  HTC One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Edition.  Because we are one.  It was we are one. Exactly.  I was hoping Google would have like the rainbow edition.  But it's glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of people, everybody was tweeting,  oh, look, when you search for gay marriage on Google,  you get the rainbow.  But that's an old...  That's like their gay pride week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. That's the gay pride week thing.  Yeah, they do that every year.  Every year they've got rainbow.  It just was very well timed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very well timed this year.  And very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. If you search for Stonewall, you get it too.  Oh, you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if you search for marriage equality,  there's a few search terms that you get it.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's cool.  That's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes me happy, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff went down to the Stonewall.  It's in the village, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a bar down the village, in the West Village.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On Christopher Street.  And there are people out there celebrating.  It was in 1969 that probably the most important...  Well, certainly a first step in gay liberation happened there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The sign above says, where pride began.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where pride began.  So we had talked before, Gina,  about whether to get one of these Google Experience phones.  They're now on sale.  You won't get it for a couple of weeks, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it said mine's not going to ship until July 9th.  So I've got some time to go.  Some time to wait.  Yeah, we talked about it.  And you had said that you felt like the Google Edition didn't make sense  because you miss out on the HTC software  that makes some of the hardware run really well.  Like the Zoys, like the camera app.  Right.  It beats audio and that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Brian Klug did another one of his great posts on AnandTech,  where I guess he got both ahead of time.  Did a lot of testing.  And so you don't lose out on a lot of the HTC One camera features.  OIS, for instance, the optical image stabilization still works.  And so because it's an HTC One kernel, he said,  and the same thing with the Galaxy S4, it's a Samsung kernel,  a lot of the hardware is still supported.  It's just a UI thing.  And you don't get what you don't get as the Zoys that highlights the gallery.  Right.  But you also don't get sense, which is maybe a fair trade.  Which is nice.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the Verge did a nice side by side as well.  And it seems like the differences are there, but they're very subtle.  You still get beats audio, which is great.  Still get beats audio.  The camera is slightly better than the HTC.  The battery life is slightly better for the stock edition.  It seems like the differences are pretty subtle.  For me, I'm a developer.  Getting updates direct from Google is a high priority for me  because I always want to be on the current version of Android,  the current pure version of Android.  That's important to me because the Google experience  is Google's reference for where the software is going.  You know, their best practices for what the software should be.  So that's really important to me.  And I feel like with...  I know you made a really good case about the camera.  And I thought long and hard about Zoys and highlights.  But I think with the instant upload to Google Plus  and the stuff that Google is doing on the Google Plus side with photos,  I don't feel like I'll miss it that much.  Yeah.  Well, in fact, it doesn't work too well with the instant upload

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because it uploads way too many images to Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's kind of a drag.  Killing stuff off all the time.  Gina, why the HTC versus Samsung?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I'm just going to be honest.  50 bucks cheaper.  It's no, it's just pretty.  It's pretty.  It's a lot prettier.  If you're running AOSP stock Android,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  then it really is more the hardware is what you're going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But isn't there a battery problem with the HTC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's not removable.  That's the bad...  There's two things you lose.  You lose the SD card, which I think on Android is moot  because Android really doesn't support putting much on that SD card.  Right.  And two, you lose a removable battery.  I've had very good results with that Snapdragon battery monitor  that I told you about last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  GSAM?  Is that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's from...  GSAM you should put on there  just so you can see what's going on.  And then Qualcomm has a program called the Snapdragon Battery Guru.  Put that on there because the Snapdragon Battery Guru  watches your behavior for three days and then  it's turning off the thing that's a problem, which is background updates.  So you could put that on an AOSP.  No problem at all.  Neither one of these require root.  Although, do you have root out of the box or...  Oh, you don't know yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question.  Yeah, I don't know yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's easy. It's unlocked.  So you could, of course, easily do that.  Now, Google is selling the one for 50 bucks less.  It's 600 bucks.  And it's 32 gigs.  Whereas you have to buy the 16 gig GS4.  And I'll tell you, the GS4, even with an SD card, it's tough.  Fortunately, the stock, the AOSP ROM on the GS4 is a lot smaller than Samsung's.  So you have something like 12 gigabytes free.  But I think 32 gigs, I think you're going to be happy you did that.  In fact, I've filled up 32 gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a 64. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm excited.  I think you're going to like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a beautiful phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to be a big upgrade for me.  I'm upgrading from the Galaxy Nexus, which I've cracked the screen.  It's time.  Yeah, so it's really time.  I mean, I generally don't buy phones unless I need a new phone.  I don't buy every single new phone.  And I just I just I love the one since the since I saw and then they announced  Google Edition, I was like, must must have.  I feel like both the S the S4 and the one are great are good choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very I go back and forth.  I cannot. Yeah.  I think arguably the believe it or not, the Galaxy is for camera is better.  Even, you know, the 13 megapixels is nice.  It's a good camera. Yeah.  And four megapixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, does that more data per image and thus more of a problem  with the memory of the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question.  I guess it would be a bigger, bigger images.  Yeah. That's one thing you can't save on an SD card,  although you can't on the Google experience phone, apparently,  according to Brian Klug, the stock camera doesn't know about SD cards,  can't save SD cards. That's a drag.  Oh, I think you made the right choice, to be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm waiting to hear the odds.  So I have to hold.  I still have a note to that I've got to sell that I've never used.  I bought it on eBay and I'm not using it so I can sell it as unused.  And I messed up the auction once I've got to sell that. Yeah.  And then because I do get lost for these things,  though I love my Nexus four and it's still working dandy.  But I'm one of the odds we're going to see in Motorola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google, we are going to see a Motorola Google phone.  And I think we're going to see it in a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I had to really like kind of let go of that.  You know, you could sit around and say there's a great new phone  right on the horizon forever, you know. Right.  Yeah, that's going to hurt a little bit.  I'm sure. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I get, by the way, much better battery life on the HTC one  than I get on the Galaxy S4.  I don't worry about it on the Galaxy S4 because I have four batteries.  I'm going on a flight tonight to Denver.  I'm bringing all four batteries. I don't care.  I'll go throw my hotcakes.  I don't care because I got more.  Whereas this, you know, it's pretty good.  But if it suddenly dwindled, I would worry on the HTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I carry I carry the extra batteries in my bag.  Yes, which saved my bacon at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was I was using backup power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you couldn't you can't.  Oh, you see, I see what you're saying.  You get the ones that the charger. Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can always do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just backed a Kickstarter project, which is like  which is a charging brick, which is also a backup.  Thanks. Oh, like the brick.  You plug it in and it charges your phone, but it also charges itself  and then can do a couple of charges.  So I'm hoping that that'll be good.  Because, you know, as much on one hand, I really want that to kind of  I want the updates.  I want kind of the developer, pure developer experience.  On the other hand, I kind of want to act like a regular human,  and I don't want to have to root and deal with ROMs and, you know, constantly wipe.  And I just want the the updates to come direct from Google.  And I also just want to experience, you know, what's it like to just use the phone  like a regular person and see, you know, see how I do with the battery.  But I'm hoping with the it's flux mob.  I forget what it's called. It's the bolt charger.  That's a good idea.  Yeah. Yeah. I'm hoping that that's going to hopefully  hopefully I'll actually get it and it'll work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. So I thought it was a gamble.  I compromise. This is an AT&T HTC one.  I did unlock it through official channels at HTC dev dot com.  And then I rooted it, which wasn't so hard once you've unlocked the bootloader.  And then I put Trickdroid.  There are a number of their HTC sense ROMs.  They're not AOSP, but therefore it's 422.  They add some customization, which I kind of like.  But, you know, it has the, you know, the the four point  stuff as well, four point two stuff as well.  And HTC says they will offer the AOSP ROM  for people with unlock.  Now you have to have an unlocked, you know, factory unlocked  HTC one, which I don't because I have the AT&T version.  But a lot of people will have that choice.  And the HTC solution is dual boot.  So you can go back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm. Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not to not to make you unhappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Great. Leo, let me see if I can't find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no. I think you did the right thing.  You should stick with it, especially as a developer.  But I love the idea that I could put any ROM on here now  and I could put things like titanium back up and stuff.  Why do you think here's a question for you?  You know, Google has traditionally always had one Nexus phone.  The developer phone, the Nexus four was the last one.  Now they're going to have at least three.  They're going to have the Motorola X, the HTC one, the Galaxy S4.  Why what is the thinking here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's a difference between the Nexus and the Google Play edition.  You know, like if you notice even in the Play store, the Nexus is on top.  Right. So the next four, the next seven, the next ten.  And then there's a new section that's like, hey, Google Play edition.  Unlock the latest and greatest from Google, the best smartphone for you.  So so they're basically saying, hey, these smartphones.  Yeah, you want choice in phones.  Here they are. You get the latest and greatest from Google.  That's that's an interesting. It's a good market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I mean, aren't the people who buy Google edition phones  the same people who buy Nexus phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would say so.  They have three manufacturers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's partly political.  If everybody's shot at it.  Who all have official Google phones and nobody's and that's  Motorola is going to be the fourth soon enough.  Yeah. And that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good point.  And the Moto X is is not going to be in excess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I thought it always was that Google  wants to offer one Google experience phone  so that they could just say, here it is, the pure thing for developers like Gina.  That's why the Nexus four was three hundred dollars, I think.  But also so they could say to the manufacturers,  here's what it could look like if you didn't crap it up. Right.  Brian and in his review on a non-tech says, and I think he's probably right,  that the manufacturers say, well, no, we're making it more appealing for consumers.  Things like all those Samsung apps.  That's what they're selling.  That's what differentiates them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still say that what they should do is just give us choice.  They should take some of those apps and make them.  And you can download it.  Only download that phone. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or uninstall them. Yeah.  Right. Either way, if you want. Yeah. Yeah.  And, you know, the Nexus, remember, the Nexus experience, too,  is a hardware spec as well, like the HSC ones.  Buttons are not. Yeah, I don't like true Nexus.  I don't like that. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually love the Galaxy S4 with a physical home button,  a menu button that's always in the same spot, a back button  that's always in the same spot. I like that. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's not, you know, that's not Google's, you know, ideal vision. Right.  I think they're wrong, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm glad there's choice on that one. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other last thing I've been having is I love my Nexus seven.  And I keep going in and looking at the Note 8.  Same size as a small iPad.  And it's it's just too it's that that inch is too big for the hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're going to be a number of six inch phones.  There's the Xperia that Sony just announced, which I'm very intrigued by.  What's that six point four inches? Right. It's huge.  And then I the rumor is that there's going to be an HTC one  in a six inch form factor. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, right. One mini or something. That would be very attractive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's just a good looking phone.  I totally just got seduced by it's gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you'll love the front speakers.  That's how speakers should be.  I don't know why everybody doesn't do that immediately.  I wish it had a little higher resolution camera, to be honest, but it's OK.  It's pretty good. You'll be happy with it.  You got glass. You don't need that. Yeah.  Our issue number two, should Jeff buy glass you have till tonight to decide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got I got the invitation.  No, I got I just decided to wait for the show to make this decision  and share my neurosis.  Should we have a poll?  We could. We could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's here's the issue.  Do you agree to be bound by the poll?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because no, I'm bound by nothing. OK.  The issue is that, of course, it doesn't work with apps.  That means that on on one of the issues.  So that means that that only my only Gmail thing is my Google Plus,  because that's where it was grandfathered, of course. Right.  So everything else for me is apps, which means that I'll get no value out of Google.  Now I'll get no value out of my calendar.  I'll get no value out of my real email.  I'll get no value out of my contacts.  None of that will be accessible to me on glass.  And that becomes fairly killer.  Also, I have to wear glass on glass.  So I look dorky enough already.  And it's fifteen hundred bucks, which even though all you know,  I'll get the school, I'll get the school to buy it.  And it's good for people to play with and all that.  I'm just having third thoughts on this.  What do you think?  But then again, the other other hand, I'm I'm on this show.  I do what I do.  For God's sake, Jarvis, you should know what class does.  You should be playing with it.  You should be thinking what news can be with it.  You could do all kinds of things with it.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Straw poll dot me slash one three six six eight seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought we were just going to do like a well, we can do a poll.  I know, you know, we'll just see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's say the chat room straw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think that the glass on glass issue is is a bigger issue than the apps  problem because I'm like you.  I split I split up my stuff across two Google accounts.  One is an app account, one is a Gmail account.  And but I have to tell you, the things that I use glass for primarily,  which is taking pictures, taking video, uploading those things to Google Plus,  which is which is my general Gmail account.  Those things all work.  The Google Now stuff works.  You get you can get navigation.  You can get the weather.  You can get, you know, new now alerts, even just with your vanilla Gmail account.  The contacts thing is connected to your Google Plus.  So if you're maintaining your Google Plus circles, you're going to be you're going to be fine.  You can do hangouts from glass using your, you know, your Gmail and vanilla Gmail account  because because it's all via plus.  It's a bummer to not get your email.  I have to say, I don't I don't get my email.  But honestly, I don't know that I want to read my email on Google Now stuff that I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, don't you don't you want those kinds of updates?  Or of course, Google now doesn't work terribly well for me anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. I you know, yeah.  But you know, like directions and weather and all that stuff, that all that all works  even with your vanilla vanilla Gmail account.  You know, I use Google Voice.  The one thing I mean, text messages work right regardless, because you know, you're connected to your phones.  That's going to work. And that's what you're going to want.  You're going to want SMS more than you want email because it's one of those those notification things.  So I don't know that the apps thing, I don't feel like it's really degraded my experience that much.  I mean, for you, I think that the taking pictures and taking videos and sharing direct to Google Plus is going to be one of the kind of the key features beyond navigation.  Navigation is a big one.  And that stuff all works with, you know, with your regular with your vanilla Gmail account, and they're going to support apps eventually.  You know how it is. There's there's I don't know what the exact reason is, but there's some sort of terms of service privacy issues that that are there bound up by stricter guidelines with the apps accounts and they are with Gmail accounts.  But it'll work eventually.  The glass thing, that's that that's going to be you might want to go and just try them on.  I mean, the good news is you can buy them if you don't like them. You return them.  You get like 30 days. Oh, you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, then do it return period.  Oh, then do it. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's because, you know, in 30 days you'll send it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who you don't need it.  I mean, come on. Have you exceeded your 30 days yet, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think I have.  OK, yeah, I do believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you didn't consider I guess because you have a baby you didn't consider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I've been I'm still I I'm not wearing glass every single day, but it is kind of Jason.  I was talking about this last night and all about Android.  It is kind of a weekend thing like I'm going out and about and we take some pictures.  And yeah, with the baby, I've been getting great video of the baby feeding the baby  and just holding the baby that I wouldn't get otherwise.  So it's worth it for me to hold on to it.  And I'm also just kind of interested in the glassware sort of at market  and how that's going to evolve.  And so I enjoy trying new apps and things like that.  So, yeah, holding on to it for me is fine.  I mean, there is a return period. There is a return period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I understand, Jeff, you could get a brand new pixel for that price.  You'd have to then. Yeah. Yeah.  Now, I mean, people are saying, where are their nose coming from?  And by the way, it is it is about two to one.  Yes. On our straw poll.  But the nose come from the cost, I think. That's a lot of money.  It's a lot of money.  I mean, that's what I want to give me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was for the next edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. The not the beyond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A Western professor, Owen Youngman, went and got them and he wore them at graduation  and all kinds of stuff, and he was doing a course about Google.  So he's talked to me and so he kind of needed to have it.  And he rubbed it in and he got a week before I did.  So, you know, that's that's the main thing is as journal, Jeff, should I have it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think journal, Jeff, journal, Jeff should have them.  At least try them and then return.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, you you wrote a book, you know, about Google.  I think you should have them just because that's part of the ongoing  conversation about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I had to say the customer service is great.  I've had glass my glass person call and to ask, you know, how are things going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I raised this question on Twitter and somebody from Glass came on Twitter  and said, can we talk?  So that was that was impressive.  That's rare. The customer service is very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got the worst of both worlds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I spent the money and didn't get glass.  Because you're a nice guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason is getting some amazing photos of both worlds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of the pixel and speaking of apps, I'm just going to jump ahead to one story.  They released this new app  so that you can on pixel only so that you can just put a photo card in  and it will upload everything directly to plus.  Oh, that's nice.  Ah, sign into your browser, it says, OK, my machine is all set up  with, of course, my apps account, and it will not let me use  the account that is tied to plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Say really, you you you read it about this on Google Plus, and I agree with you.  This is this is ridiculous now.  At this point, it's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It really is. It really, truly is.  And I know that some somebody said, I'm going to unfollow you  because you ran about this. Fine. I'm going to rant anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I can't.  I don't understand it. It can't possibly be that difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they're treating the paying customers as second class citizens in apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's I have.  Has anybody given you a credible reason why they haven't emerged?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that at I.O., they said two things.  They always say it's more complicated than, you know, right?  Though I would love to sit down with the whiteboard and figure that out with them.  And because, hey, you're Google, you go to the frigging moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And right. We can figure out the privacy policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. They said, well, but it's a lot better than it used to be.  And when I was with a bunch of media people and bloggers with them,  we all said to them, no, it's not.  No, it's not better than it used to be. It's not.  It's still a problem.  We all beat them up about all the things we lose.  And I say to Google, you think I'm two people.  You want to know that I'm one person that'll give me better service as a customer.  But it also gives you a hell of a lot more value  because you can't target to me as one person.  You want to know I'm one person.  All you want to do is to say this person is the same as this person  and let me merge some things.  I understand in some cases something has to win.  You probably have to have one calendar.  You probably have to have  one male being the dominant male.  I'm OK with that.  But let me choose what works with what and let me merge those identities.  And it's good for you, Google. I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true.  Sorry, man. End of rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, I had a pixel moment that I thought you'd appreciate.  I hadn't really played with the pixel very much since Google I.O.  Not for any other reason.  I've just been busy in habit of using my MacBook Pro.  But my wife wanted to start using Evernote and can't install stuff on our computer.  So I was like, oh, why don't we'll just give you the pixel?  So I pull out the pixel and I'm like, hey, you're signing.  And so I was I was getting her set up and I was like, wow, this is this is a really nice machine.  So are you going to give me so I can have that computer?  And I was kind of like,  this is really nice.  It's not so bad, is it?  I can't believe it. You're not going to give it to me.  I was like, well, you know, we'll share it.  We'll share it. We'll just keep it here in the living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The keyboard is butter.  The screen is magnificent. I still love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's beautiful. It's beautiful.  It's a great machine. And I was like, oh, the Konami code.  And she's like, the what? And I made the light bar go.  And it was very impressive.  But yeah, I had I had this moment.  I was like, this is a really nice computer.  I have to figure out how to work this into my into my routine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it helps to that. Well, actually, two things.  One, Leo, I had something going on where some sites actually are sluggish scrolling.  Now, I thought, OK, all right, I'll admit it.  In the latest build.  But but then I had I had an issue where I was doing partial screen grabs.  And suddenly it was like 20 pixels off and I couldn't figure it out.  And I went on onto the Chromebook Pixel user group.  I said the same thing. I also see Rick Byers, who's a wonderful pixel guy out of Canada.  And bingo, you know, we get the answer from them that it was the I had redone  the screen size down and I confused the the placements.  And in build 29 is fixed.  But he explained what to do.  And so it's also because I can people will watch what I say because I'm on the show.  But I can get service on the machine in a way that, you know, beats Dell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many blog posts to take before Dell

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Delver's bond has gotten better, Del's gotten better.  So I don't want to say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was quite nice.  But it's just not a practical product for any normal human.  But it's a it's a lovely little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you're a freak like me, well, it's just it's I mean, so expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish they would make it kind of more moderate choice Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's some controversy because I think the five hundred fifty dollar one,  the Samsung one, I think is going off the market.  And so you only have high end and low end.  You don't have middle. Yeah, they need something.  They need it. They need a middle end. Yes. Yeah.  They also need I think what will happen next is they get the new power efficient ships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you do?  We talk about the L.A. school district buying iPads. Yeah, we do.  That's right. Yeah, because there was this whole back.  In fact, like Tweet Tweet storm went on all around.  That's right. All around us.  I won't bring it up again, then  I won't bring it up again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The funny thing is that out there, the kids get very upset when we get mad at each other.  I hear the kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could tell you the kids in the L.A.  public schools would rather have iPads than Chromebooks.  Oh, I know that the teachers might want them to have Chromebooks.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of great when I see on there, there's a Chromebook  education group on Google Plus and they all get they get they all get their shipments in  and you see a picture of a thousand  Samsung pixels stacked up.  I mean, Samsung Chromebook stacked up and it's really kind of cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  Well, here's another picture from the Stonewall.  Look at that.  Jeff, you put a cool.  Very nice.  Just think of how great these would be if they were through glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, think about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was thinking about that just now.  Yeah, I took I shot with both my phone and my camera.  I've had the weirdest thing.  If I take pictures with my camera, with my Nexus four.  On either sell or on, you know, Starbucks shared kind of Wi-Fi,  it will not send the tweets in.  Really?  It's just too big.  Well, I got home, I can send them out.  And then it uploads them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I think that's I think that's the they may even be blocking it.  I have to say that that is one of the things to me.  Google Plus has finally gone over the top with the camera uploads.  That's fabulous.  Communities post.  Yeah.  In fact, I'm this close to deleting Facebook.  I really want to delete Facebook.  I've taken it off my phones because it is also a battery drain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's one good thing.  You won't be stuck with Facebook if you don't want it on your HTC.  GE one.  And more than a hundred.  We thought it was going to be a big deal.  What a flopola that was.  Kids don't even like Facebook anymore.  You know that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a Snapchat, Snapchat, Instagram, Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I think they still like Vine better.  It's hard to know what to do those extra nine seconds.  You saw Jimmy Fallon, they had a great bit where  they would do a classic Vine video, but they do it on Instagram.  And then they then they have like nine seconds and they just kind of stare.  I don't know. I don't know what to do.  That's so hip.  So hip.  Fallon's hip.  Our show today brought to you by 99designs.com  It's too late for an old fart like me, but it's a hip show.  99designs.com  That's why I watch him on Hulu Plus.  A great place to get your designs done.  Somebody you know, there is and I understand this.  There's a movement among graphic designers.  Some people say you shouldn't do specs.  But I think if you're a big hot shot,  you don't need to.  But it's like telling an actor you shouldn't have to audition.  You know what?  Welcome to the real world.

We're researching developers.  OK.  Lisa, Gina probably can help us on that.  She writes software, you know.  Well, she could help us get a fight.  We need a iOS and Android developer, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll talk about that.  We need some gaming developers.  But we know we got the design from 99designs.  If you go to 99designs.com, you can get a special package.

And we're going to do a twig kind of thing.  Game kind of thing.  Not a twig player app.  There's great ones.  We don't need to do anything there.  We thought we'd do a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be a very Twitter thing to do,  to screw the developers and do your own.  You're not doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not doing it.  No, exactly.  We like our third party developers.  Craig and the gang, they do great stuff.  But we thought, you know, we were  so hooked on the Simpsons game.  We thought we should have a game for Twig.  And you could be in it.  And you, and you, and you, and you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Love it.  So that'd be fun.  Totally fun.  I'm very excited about this project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like it.  I love the idea.  Let's get the latest straw poll results.  Jeff, 60-40.  Buy the glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, people.  I figure how many votes is that?  That's about 100 bucks each.  And I got it.  Now we'll just shift this over to Indiegogo.  We're there.  We're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, we're going to, we, Lisa just  come over and made a suggestion.  Would it change your mind, Jeff, if we  offered to buy them for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no.  You don't need to do that.  Thank you very, very much.  But I can do that.  No, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we're glad to.  It's kind of part of, we didn't buy them for Gina, though.  We'd have to give her a check.  No, exactly.  We have the customers.  Merry Christmas.  She says, she says, Merry Christmas.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In June, of all things.  Happy Pride to me.  I think the thing that put me over is that you have 30 days  to change your mind.  That way you could play with it.  You could have a great time.  That's a very Leo way to look at things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's as long as you use anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  30 days is a lifetime.  If I could send every gadget back after 30 days,  I wouldn't buy anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, just verify that.  Verify that.  Here's a business I want.  I want the business that, and I think  we've talked about this a couple of years ago.  Try to suggest it to Best Buy, where it's the early adopters  club, where you can get something as soon as it comes  out and use it for like a month.  And you pay a portion of the value based on how much it loses  as it goes on.  Or you can decide, no, I don't want to be first.  I want to be third.  I want to just try it.  I have to note two.  I didn't care about being first.  But eventually, I want to play with one for a while.  And it's kind of a rental club based on when you get it  in the sequence.  I think people do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think there are companies that do that.  There are a lot of companies that will buy their stuff back  from you.  Who does that?  That sounds familiar.  I mean, that's a great idea.  Best Buy should do that.  They should.  Yeah, there has to be a brisk market and used devices.  There does.  But I think there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you look at it, eBay amazes me.  Yeah, no kidding.  And I sold.  Even if it's like Gazelle, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's how Gazelle works, by the way.  Gazelle has an eBay portal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Gazelle will only buy certain of the hottest things.  I had some old Nokia phones.  I thought, there's no market for this thing.  Sure enough, I'd sell them for $80 or something like that on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that is the argument against Glass, by the way,  is that it's non-transferable.  Yes.  So you can't, in three months, say, OK, I'm done with it.  I've reviewed it.  Who wants to buy this?  Well, let me ask you about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does it mean to be non-transferable in terms of me having students  or colleagues being able to use them at school?  Well, anybody can use it.  No, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be the problem.  So when you go pick up your Glass or when you purchase it,  your account gets whitelisted.  And from what I understand, that's it.  Your account is linked to Glass.  So a lot of the Glass administration that you do,  you do in the web browser on your desktop,  like log into your Google account.  There's a guest mode on Glass.  So you can set it in a guest mode if you want to let other people try it  without getting your text messages or seeing personal information.  But it's kind of a limited thing.  Someone else can't attach their Google account.  So this is another journal friend of mine was having this problem.  The publication wanted him to drop it off the office and let everybody try it.  And it was like, no, you get whitelisted.  Your account gets whitelisted.  And it's very heavily linked to your account, all your contacts  and your circles and things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can't you give Glass away?  Didn't they say you could give it away?  Is there a way to transfer it out of your account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question.  We talked about this at one point.  I thought there was a way to gift it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they said you could gift it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you never registered Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you could gift it, but only before.  But it has to be right away.  Couldn't be after.  Once you've hooked it to an account.  What? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that? Well, how did you do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It wasn't mine. It was Jason.  They weren't.  In fact, they wouldn't even let me pay for it with my credit card.  We had to reimburse them.  That's right. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel the need for trumpets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One more thing.  Somebody suggested, I think is a great idea,  that we do one show, we do it as a normal show,  but we post a hangout from Glass's point of view.  So when you get your Glass, Jeff,  you two wear yours, I'll borrow Jason's,  and we'll do a hangout with the three points of view.  Can we do that? Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we could totally do that.  You're just going to see the other side of the studio.  For me, you're going to be looking out my window  and out my screen.  Fine. We'll do the show as normal,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but it'll be an extra feed.  Yeah, right.  Let's see here.  I don't know if you can see it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a cicada being eaten by a spider out here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's drama. That's good. That's good TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's a funny,  someone I know is going to run for mayor  of a certain major city in America,  and it'll be coming out soon.  And so I was talking with him today, he's a tech guy,  and so I was saying, well, at some point,  I was pushing him to make videos, videos, videos,  people need to know who you are, they need to hear from you.  I also talked about maybe he ought to make some with class.  And at first, it's appealing, but then immediately,  a politician doesn't want to have a picture of himself  with a class.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Good point.  Oh, you're the robo candidate. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's actually a good point.  Yeah, I wouldn't vote for a guy wearing that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A cyborg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something wrong with him.  He's watching you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now I'm thinking about who this could be.  I think I know who it must be, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's interesting. We'll find out when.  I've been researching the glass question,  and under the terms of sales, you have reselling gifts.  You may not commercially resell your device,  but you may give the device as a gift,  unless otherwise set forth by the device specific addendum.  Receipts of gifts may need to open  and maintain a Google Wallet account  in order to receive support from Google.  These terms will also apply to any gift receipt,  and this is under the glass term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Has anybody ever done that? I wonder how hard that is to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I wonder if the Explorer edition has an addendum  because it's such an early prototype.  I should probably know that.  I should look through my glass materials.  But this is all stuff that you can ask.  I mean, you have to call to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, I'll sign up tonight then. I'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yay, we made the decision for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I probably won't be able to pick him up before my next trip,  I don't think, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's going to get it, but Lisa was sincere.  We'll pay for your guy's glass.  No, no, I appreciate that.  Because it is kind of part of your job.  I mean, it's part of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll have you get a Moto X for me.  It's a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can we just start requesting devices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll ask Guy when I see him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, when are you doing that?  July 10th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  July 10th, huh?  I haven't been enjoying it. I mean, Guy didn't say,  hey, keep this under your hat or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Guy Kawasaki, who as you know,  is now working at Motorola,  sent me an email, said,  we'd really like you to come down to the Google campus  for an event, small group of journalists,  50 people, and there's two groups,  July 10th and July 11th.  Can you do it?  And I said, well, I have to move stuff around.  He said, we'd really like you to do it.  I said, okay.  I'm thinking it's the phone, but I don't know.  Could just be, you know, a meet and greet.  I mean, it could be just some silly thing.  But Guy knows me.  Guy knows I do not do these things at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, the 10th is actually Twig Day.  That's a Wednesday.  Are you in the 10th or the 11th?  It's the evening of the 10th.  Oh, it's the evening of the 10th.  Oh, so it'll be right after the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, run out of here.  I think I'm skipping a triangulation that day  or something like that, yeah.  Huh?  It's a prerecorded show.  It's a prerecorded show, yeah.  So, I'll just run out the door.  I don't know, I could be completely wrong.  And I hope I'm not breaching a confidence,  but Guy didn't say, hey, keep this under your hat  or anything.  So, I don't think I am.  You'll find out.  All right, time to play some trumpets.  Chad, are you ready with the trumpeters?  Are they all in the line?  Ladies and gentlemen, it's time.  Well, I'll let your announcer tell you.  The Google change log.  Ah, what's new at Google?  Let's ask Gina Trippani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A new Google Groups interface revamp  is available to everyone.  They've been testing this for quite some time.  Google Groups, if you don't know, if you don't use it,  it is one of their kind of undersung products,  is kind of an email list product  that lets you put together groups of contacts  and have conversations.  And it's got new revamp management features,  moderation tools, a better mobile site.  I'm really, really happy about this.  I run several of my open source projects  using Google Groups,  and I've been testing the new interface  for quite some time, and it's quite good.  It's really good for support situations.  So, if you have users you have to support,  they have this new inbox feature  where you can say, you can assign an email  to another member of the group, like,  hey, can you please respond to this?  Which is really nice for customer service type things.  So, that's available to all now.  Let's see, what else?  Oh, new Street View images from the tallest  world's tallest man-made structure,  which is a skyscraper in Dubai.  Yes. The Burj Khalifa.  I hope I am pronouncing that correctly.  Yeah, Burj Khalifa, you are.  Yeah, first ever Street View collection  of images from the Arab world.  And this building is described as the vertical city,  world's tallest man-made structure  towering over the Dubai skyline at 2,717 feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not going in there.  I'm not even going, I'm not looking at that.  I'm not looking at that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm not looking at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It wasn't open when I was in Dubai.  I really wanted to go up there, but it wasn't open yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I want to see some of these images.  Yeah, very nice.  So they sent up some Googlers with the old camera backpack  and got some images.  Damn, that thing looks heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does.  While you're there, if you go up on the rundown,  just a little bit up there,  there's also same thing they're doing, Galapagos Islands.  Oh, neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a place that only a very few people can go.  It's highly protected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The blue-footed booby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There it is.  No, that's not the blue-footed booby.  That's not the blue-footed booby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, apparently they put Googlers  outside the building like...  Can you tell me what it's over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He really does, I scare you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, she doesn't look like it's that heavy.  She looks like she could carry that pretty well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, she looks pretty comfortable.  Oh, that I don't want to do, though.  So window cleaners usually only get this view,  but now everybody can in Street View.  That's pretty dang cool.  Yeah, wow.  Wow, look at that.  Dubai is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the anti-jab.  It is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a nutty place.  Would even just going into the images  on Google Maps would freak you out?  My palms are pouring right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, really?  Yeah.  You don't like heights.  I hate heights.  Oh, I thought it was bridges.  It's heights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's vertigo things.  Yeah.  It's the cliff effect.  Yeah.  Things you could fall off of.  Yeah.  Plane okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plane okay.  That's good.  What else do we got?  Oh, Google dropped a search operator,  which I'm sure you have never used, the tilde.  I don't know if you knew you could do this,  but you could use it tilde.  You could use it tilde to get synonyms, right?  So you could do like tilde, muffin,  and it would be like cupcake  and other related terms for synonyms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently no one used it.  That sounds very useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it actually sounds very useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now that I know it existed, I wanna use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it was really useful and I knew about it.  I just, I didn't use it very much because I just,  you know, when I have to look up a word,  I usually just go to the dictionary.  It's not often that I'm looking for synonyms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, is the reason because Google will do that for you?  It just automatically looks at synonyms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, kinda, I feel like if you do a Google search,  you will get pages that have similar terms, related terms.  And that just makes more sense.  You shouldn't really expect users  to remember to use the tilde.  But yeah, Google confirmed that this was dropped,  the feature was dropped due to lack of use.  That's a little spring cleaning.  And I really liked that they,  Google actually gave a statement to, let's see,  oh, this is search engine land, saying,  yeah, we've deprecated this.  Too few people were using it to make it worth it to maintain.  And I happen to agree with this one,  maintaining all these synonyms takes real time  and costs us real money.  And supporting operator increases the complexity of the code,  dropping support, free up a bunch of resources.  I loved that they were just so kind of forthright  and transparent about this.  I wish that they had given more of an explanation  about Google Reader, as clear and straightforward  an explanation about Google Reader  as they did about the tilde.  Of course, the tilde, a lot less controversial  than Google Reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did they say that the synonyms had to be done by hand,  by humans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They didn't, they just said that there's a lot of code  that made synonyms go.  They didn't say that humans did it,  but it does sound like it cost them money  and CPU cycles to maintain.  One of the more difficult computational tasks,  I would think, synonyms.  I guess so.  Google Now for Android got an update  with a couple of new features.  If your phone is on the same network as your smart TV,  you can get information on live TV that's on.  I haven't had a chance to try this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It knows what you're watching  because the TV reports to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  That's so weird.  It knows what you're watching,  so it'll give you information about what's on TV.  It's a nice second screen prompt.  There's third party music client support now.  So there's a Google Voice action  where you can say something like, play Michael Jackson.  And now with this new update,  you can choose what app plays the music back.  So I tried it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you could do that before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could you?  I thought that it just supported playing music.  But now you can just choose what client you want to play.  And my choice is,  I don't have a lot of music players on my phone installed,  but it gave me the choice to play music,  Google Play, YouTube, or Pandora.  Just kind of nice.  Nice to have the choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I said, play Michael Jackson.  If you could move it down.  And it's just-  And it said, are you sure?  Are you really?  Uh, no music found.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so did you, have you gotten the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I must've assigned it.  I should see if I have a default action on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you might've assigned it a default action.  I'm really taking the voice action.  I actually just, there's the note to self voice action,  which goes to Google Keep.  And-  Oh, here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a dropdown that you can choose.  Yeah, there's a dropdown.  Exactly.  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Choose what client you want to use.  So what choices do you have?  You have a big menu there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I had my built-in music player  and there is no Michael Jackson on the phone,  but now I can make it play music.  I could search SoundCloud, YouTube, Spotify,  or TuneIn Radio Pro.  And presumably install other capable apps  that would add those to the list.  That's one of the best things about Android, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I totally agree.  We just added, for the due text,  we just added note to self capability.  And it was like a few lines of code.  So if you say note to self, you know, pick up the milk,  you can now say, hey, use to do text to handle this  in addition to Google Keep or something else.  And it was incredible how easy,  someone sent me a pull request, one of my developers,  it was like five lines of code.  It was crazy.  Great, great thing about Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now the funny thing is it is playing something,  but it's fan letters to Michael Jackson  by a Canadian group called the Reostatics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's related.  It's close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess it's because I own that.  So it preferred that over something I don't own.  Why do you own that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, with all access and play music, right?  In the Play Store, you really can have it just play anything  if you're paying for that subscription.  Well, I used to do that with Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, maybe that was the Samsung voice app,  not the Google voice app.  But it would say, well, what do you want me to,  the first time you say play Michael Jackson,  say, well, what do you want me to play it with?  And it would remember that from then on.  But that must've been the Samsung voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And yeah, that's it.  Oh, and last thing in Google Now,  I have this Google Now update location  aware of Google offers.  So it begins.  Yeah.  So how's that gonna work?  Advertising begins.  You know, I haven't seen it yet.  I haven't been out and about with this updated version yet.  So I'm not exactly sure how it's gonna work.  Although I've been getting prompts in Google Maps.  Have you guys been getting this, you know,  show offers or don't show offers?  Yeah, I've been getting some prompts about Google offers.  So this phone knows where you are.  It seems like Google Now will pop up a card that says,  hey, you know, there's a sale going on down the block.  I kind of imagined it would work.  I'm looking for screenshots.  And I know you need pants.  You know you need pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's a better deal to your left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  Turn left.  So that's all I got, the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's the Google changelog.  But but but but but but but.  Very cool.  We mentioned the best, I mean, the chairman said,  what about the bell?  We mentioned the bell on Google  plus the notification bell before.  But I think now everybody's got it by now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep, yep, I did get it.  Yeah.  Oh, you know, when someone mentioned to me,  and I think it was a show that I missed.  I missed a show recently.  You can send money through Gmail now using wallets.  We mentioned that, yeah.  Oh, you did, okay, okay, cool.  Yeah, it was back in May.  But I was like, what?  Yeah.  There's a changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, somebody in the chat room said,  and this is really true,  Google doesn't do a good job of surfacing it,  all these cool things,  but that's because there's so damn many of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's so many of them, it's true.  I don't know how you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  I mean, how do you like the tilde?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, like the tilde, exactly.  Honestly, sometimes I drop stuff  because some things seem super minor  and some things aren't going to roll out for a while  and some things only work if you're, you know,  if you're, you know, like the Gmail,  you have to have a wallet account  and maybe the person you're sending to  has to have a wallet account.  But though that sending money was a big thing.  That's something I would definitely mention.  So I think that was a show that I missed.  But I'm glad you guys got my back.  I don't have it either.  I just checked my compose, I checked my compose window.  I hit that little plus button.  I can insert, use photos in drive, insert photos,  emoticons, insert invitation.  But no, I don't have the money, the dollar sign yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so I guess it's rolling out slowly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it must be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Leo, back to what you said earlier  about plus and photos.  I finally took a camera along this time to Europe  and, you know, I really use more than I've ever in life  been using photos because it's so easy on plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It finally put me over the top on plus.  Yeah.  I use that all the time now.  And it makes it so easy to share.  It's great to have a backup of all your photos.  That's exactly.  And for me, cause I use two different phones,  I have one place where all my pictures are.  So that's nice too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, do you use a camera with a card?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do, like an old school.  Yeah, so the thing is you can use that thing now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on the Pixel, another reason to use your Pixel.  It will just upload every single photo  and automatically no bust, no fuss, no bother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I've got an SLR where I take portraits of the baby  on her birthday and stuff.  And often the photos just sort of languish on the card  until my mom is like, what's the latest photos?  And I was like, oh, I gotta take out the card  and upload them.  And I'm gonna try those out, those new apps.  So I have to make sure that my card fits  into the slot in the Pixel, but it should totally work.  Which is really, really nice because transferring  into Picasa and then uploading, it's a whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a McGill-a as we say here in New York.  It's a McGill-a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had no idea Jesus H. Christ had a Google Plus account.  Really?  I'll just reshare this one.  Yeah, he's responding to Governor Mike Huckabee.  Isn't that a pseudonym?  Maybe it really is him though.  Is it verified?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  WWGD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is so a terms of use violation by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not gonna complain.  Yeah, you just busted Jesus, Leo.  I got Jesus in trouble, you think I did?  Yeah.  Maybe that's, it could be a guy's name.  I got a gardener named Jesus.  Could be a guy's name.  This is apparently a very pro-gay Jesus.  Yeah, it's a pro-gay Jesus.  Wouldn't he be?  We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the tagline is setting the record straight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That account will be gone by tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's a question for you.  It's on the rundown.  Google Mine.  Do you think that's a parody?  Do you think that's real?  Google what?  Mine.  It's the third thing on the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  M-I-N-E.  It's supposedly a new product that's in testing  that lets you, and Jeff, tell me if I get this wrong,  but that lets you inventory your stuff.  Like everything you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's my stuff, mine.  It's mine, all mine.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This does not make sense to me.  This is, I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Share your belongings with your friends.  Keep up to date with your friends or sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the share economy, Jeff, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So is this like neighbor goods?  So like I need a lawnmower who's got one I can borrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems like you could enable something like that.  This reminded me of course of the Big Bang Theory episode  where Sheldon was scanning, was putting RFID tags  on every single piece of clothing and scanning them  and then creating a database of his entire wardrobe  so that whenever he traveled,  he could very easily just print out a tag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you seen that there is a Sheldon t-shirt site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's nothing wrong with that.  I think it's a very good idea.  Kat, go ahead, go back a little bit.  Catalog your belongings, track what you have,  review your belongings for your friends to see.  Really, my friends do not wanna see what my belongings are.  No.  Control who sees what, track conversations,  send requests to borrow or try out friends' stuff.  They killed Google Groups for this.  Share stuff you wish for, get recommendations,  share stuff you're giving away, find takers,  follow, browse, search stuff.  There's also an Android app,  but you have to be a Google employee.  It's in Bazaar.  Oh, I see, okay, got it.  Wow.  This sounds like a 20% project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  20% project that they're maybe testing internally.  I don't know if this is ever gonna see the light of day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, I could not get it.  I don't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you had glass, you could take pictures of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you could use it as an insurance inventory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you don't have to share it  with your friends for that purpose.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Google would love to know what you own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that's valuable information for them.  All right, here's a question.  There's something compelling about,  you know, there are times when I'm like,  oh, do I know anybody that has this kind of gadget  or I don't know, I needed to, you know, a tool or something.  I mean, it doesn't happen very often,  but I guess there's some value in that.  Being like, you know, can I borrow, you know,  I don't know, a hot glue gun or somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's the problem for me.  Let's see, the nearest person I actually know  who I actually have an internet life with  is probably about 30 miles away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Unless they enable some sort of like, you know,  mailing stuff, sending stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Find metric wrenches near you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So either it's a preternaturally sunny day  in the United States today  or Google has deleted the clouds from its satellite imagery.  And in fact, it's the latter case, another 20% project.  Google is God.  You know, they buy the satellite imagery from Keyhole  and, you know, NASA and a lot of other people.  Problem with satellite imagery is it's just dog gone clouds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's something ironic about Google deleting the clouds.  From the clouds.  Exactly.  Ain't no clouds here.  But I'm ting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Same thing on Google Maps.  This is from a, I don't know, is this true?  Were there clouds before?  I guess it's from the Google blogs.  Cue the Joni Mitchell, please.  I've looked at life from both sides now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From win and lose.  And still somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's love's illusions I recall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, this is completely official.  There was a post on the Google blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a central Papua Indonesia before and after.  Saudi Arabia before, well, Saudi Arabia  really didn't really have a lot of clouds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's only clear skies in Googleville.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Satellite imagery is usually created like a quilt,  writes the Google blog.  We stitched together imagery of different parts of the world  using a process similar to how we produced  the global time lapse imagery of Earth.  We took hundreds of terabytes of data  from the US Geological Survey  and NASA's Landsat 7 satellite.  Sometimes dozens of photos of a single spot  analyze the photos to compute a clear view of every place,  even in tropical regions  that are always at least partly cloudy.  You are now looking at an 800,000 megapixel image  of the world.  Earth or maps when you're zoot out to the global world.  The image is global view.  The image is that's it.  It does kind of look naked.  Yeah, it's weird looking.  The image is so big, if you wanted to print it  at a standard resolution of 300 dots per inch,  you'd need the piece of paper the size of a city block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's cool.  Somebody's gotta do that.  Some artist has to do that.  By hand, you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or no, they say computationally.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The computer says, no, I still see clouds.  What else you got?  No, there's clouds there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What else you got?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Only Google could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, an artist should do the city block printout.  Oh, the city block printout, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Christo could wrap an actual city block.  It'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there'd be orange gates all around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come on, is this true?  Google buying Tesla?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's rank speculation.  Oh, it's from Bloomberg's people speculating.  Yeah, I stuck it on there  because I thought it was amusing.  Yeah, I don't think Tesla's for sale.  But it would cost them 12 billion.  That's a lot of money.  Yeah, even for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think Elon Musk is looking to sell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Steve Jobs might've bought Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That I could understand.  Well, Apple, yeah, Apple cars.  That's a...  That would've been...  Seems like he's right up his alley.  We feel that cars are just too hard to use,  so we're putting the accelerator on the left.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's only one button.  Brake, accelerator, it's all the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yesterday, you're now going to...  If you wanna go right, you wave your hand right.  If you wanna go left, you wave your hand left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, God, thank God Apple doesn't design cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only rounded corners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see what else before we go to our picks  of the week here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got a question for you on the NSA story.  Yes.  Because I wrote a piece that I haven't put up yet,  but arguing that the internet companies  should take the bull by the horns now  and have to do everything they can to protect our privacy.  And it's in their light and self-interest  because people are gonna lose faith in the cloud  and in the internet companies.  And so what do they do?  Well, we ought to have, as we've discussed before,  the right to private communication guaranteed by law.  But of course, only our first class physical mail  is guaranteed in that way.  It's not gonna come from Congress.  It's not gonna come from courts.  It's not gonna come from telcos.  So Google and Facebook and Twitter  and those folks have to protect us.  So here's the question.  What would it take to have end-to-end encryption  if the industry got together and got their act together?  A, does that help?  B, how hard is that?  And C, what are the unintended consequences of that?  Like does that break Google now  because it can't see my boarding passes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does, doesn't it?  And if it could see your boarding passes,  then we wouldn't trust it  because that would mean Google could see it,  which means they could probably give it to the government.  So I think it would break a lot of things, wouldn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, why would Google,  Google being able to see your boarding pass  is a function of their products,  being able to talk to one another because of their-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they can read your mail.  If my mail were encrypted.  But if I encrypted all my email,  they wouldn't have boarding passes for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see what you're saying.  So you're not saying encrypting the transmission.  You're saying, yeah, encrypting the data itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'd have to encrypt it in such a way  that only you had the key.  Cause if Google has the key, well-  That is not-  We've heard that story before.  Right.  Right.  I don't think it's gonna happen, Jeff.  But I, and of course, as we know,  if you use encryption, the NSA just says,  we don't care if you're in the US or not,  you, we're keeping an eye on you.  And if you use the Onion Router, the privacy tour,  privacy system, same thing.  We don't know if you're in the US,  so we're just gonna collect everything you do.  Right.  And I use both.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Watching you.  Vince Cerf was in London along with Tim Berners-Lee,  Bob Kahn and Louis Pouzat  to receive the $1 million inaugural  Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering  at Buckingham Palace.  There's Tim Berners-Lee getting his ugly award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it is kinda-  It is a little weird looking, huh?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the Queen Elizabeth Prize.  They asked Tim Berners-Lee about Edward Snowden and the NSA.  Tim said, the original design of the web 24 years ago  was for a universal space.  We didn't have a particular computer in mind  or browser or language.  When you make something universal,  it can be used for good things or nasty things.  We just have to make sure it's not undercut  by any large companies or governments trying to use it  and get total control.  Right on.  Right on.  Well said.  Check the internet.  Right on.  He's a guy who invented the World Wide Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android Nation Store, I want one of those.  What is that?  You can buy a nation in Android?  What?  In India, they're starting stores just to pump Android.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like physical stores?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Brick and mortar stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brick and mortar stores called Android Nation.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want that.  Apparently, Google's also subsidizing cell phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the other thing.  Well, Facebook does this too, right?  If they subsidize the usage of primary Google apps,  so you can get that for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of the opposite of net neutrality.  In fact, we got all mad at Comcast  and other internet service providers  who proposed not having bandwidth caps  on some of their own products.  Oh, well, that's an interesting question.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but, well, but.  Wasn't it, was it Verizon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think it was Verizon or somebody said,  oh yeah, we're not gonna, if you use, what was it?  I'm trying to remember now.  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you bump stuff through their V Store,  it wouldn't charge, it wouldn't go to your bandwidth.  Right.  And everybody got upset that that was anti-competitive,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that that was anti-net neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but it's, but, but Leo, it's no different from,  I can watch a show on Netflix and pay for it,  or I can watch it on Hulu and suffer a few ads  and I get it for free.  Right.  So it's subsidized in that sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know that that's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just bringing it up.  I don't know either.  It seems fine.  I mean, if they wanna give some free stuff away in India,  go for it.  Who am I to say no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wanna see what these stores are gonna look like.  I want an Android Nation store here.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm starting to think of Delhi later this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Best Buy, right?  Is the closest we have to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Best Buy is really turning into a marketing space.  Yeah, because you have a Samsung store,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you have a Windows store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huge Samsung, Apple, Microsoft and little Google Stand.  You know, and they're just turning their space  over to marketing space.  Until they go bankrupt.  Yeah, that's exactly what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's just one more idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, when I was in Paris last week for one day,  it really struck me.  I wandered around the Marais  and just the number of just great little shops to look at.  I put up a screen.  Oh, I know.  A gallery of just shop windows.  And it's just phenomenal.  And we don't have physical browsing in the US anymore.  We just don't.  Oh, I love it.  I'm in Manhattan and I used to be able to go out  and go to record stores and book stores.  Really, you can't do that in Manhattan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought that was, I used to love walking in New York  just because it was so fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't really have it.  I mean, you have some chain stores,  you have the Gap and you have Best Buy,  but I can't go to record stores anymore.  I can't go to book stores anymore.  It's true.  There's nothing to wander.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was just thinking the only time I go to Best Buy  is when there's something very specific that I need  and I always motor directly past all the marketing stuff.  I just buy everything on Amazon.  I think Fry's is the only electronic store  that I'll really kind of take my time and wander.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's unique to California.  Yeah.  Fry's is great.  There's nothing like that anywhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Amazon.  That's my fault.  I'm buying everything on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I am too, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Google Reader gonna die soon,  like at the end of the month, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, like in four days, five days.  What are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Feedly, are you using AOLs now  and ask that they're gonna do a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've tried them all.  I've tried AOLs.  I've tried-  Dig?  Digs.  Feedly. Feedly.  Net Newswire. Feedly has the advantage.  I've been using it for a month, so I'm used to it.  I kind of like it.  Which?  Feedly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I gotta be honest.  The only time I hit an RSS reader  is to prep for the show and for All About Android.  It's the only time that I kind of want this  like completist view of a set of sites.  Otherwise, I'm really okay with just sort of, you know,  finding links through my various social streams.  I just started trying potluck yesterday,  which I kind of like.  That's the new thing from the branch team.  I haven't settled on another reader yet.  I guess, I don't know.  I was kind of waiting for everybody else  who's a power RSS reader to come to a consensus  and then go to that thing.  Although, I'm interested in DigReader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The AOL one is actually not bad either.  I gotta give them points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a private beta, but you could sign up.  I signed up and I got into both of those.  Reader.aol.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a little upset that I think we're,  in one sense, we're moving away from the notion of feeds  and I like feeds.  The New York Times has been killing blogs like crazy.  Yeah.  And say, well, now our own media pages  act like the blogs.  Well, no, they're static collections  rather than feeds or as Dave Weiner would say, rivers.  And the unpackaged nature of an RSS feed  and find the stuff that interests you in it,  I still like.  It's not the whole world, but it's part of the world  and we're moving a lot of things away from that,  which bothers me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I guess.  Maybe I'm just an old fart.  And all of these, unfortunately, are in beta,  all these readers here.  They're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they might not quite be at where Google Reader was.  Ken from Chicago was saying,  was Shirley, you're subscribed to the Twitter feeds.  Of course with podcasts is a different thing.  I certainly use a podcatcher  and I certainly subscribe to the shows that I want.  So, but that, and I guess that's basically a feed reader,  right, but that's kind of a different thing.  I'm talking about just reading websites versus.  I think you're the one who got me on the podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  one I use now, Gina.  Which was the dog catcher.  Pocket cats.  Yeah, that's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I didn't realize this,  but Yahoo's acquisition of Tumblr has already gone through.  It's done deal.  Meanwhile, Google says the FTC  is gonna review the Waze deal.  This one might take a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want that one to go through,  because I want, I love Waze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lawyers, according to this article  at the Wall Street Journal say,  it's unlikely the FTC would tell Google  they can't get Waze.  You'd have to find evidence  that it would significantly crimp competition  in the mapping market.  And I know, I think you can make a pretty good case  that there's some other good competitors there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Though, you know, last week,  Gina showed us the carousel of local advertisers and things.  Somebody did a study and found that the clicks  on the carousel are 48% versus 15% on the map.  Google's invented another thing.  So Google Local, they really could,  they don't own that kind of local advertising now,  but that's probably the fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The carousel is the search result bar.  You get, if you say pizza parlors in New York City,  you get a list of nearby pizza parlors.  Great idea.  And the click through is really hot.  Is it really hot?  Well, because it's the right result.  Yeah. Yeah.  And it's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's visual, it makes sense.  It's local, it's right at the top there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Under the numbers, this number I'm not gonna use, Leo,  so it's okay, but under the numbers,  there's a heat map of clicks on the carousel, of course.  Yeah, because it's pretty and it's useful.  Yeah. Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Danny Sullivan running in search engine land  notes that DuckDuckGo has posted a 50% traffic increase  in the last eight days,  probably because of the NSA prism stuff.  He says, but it's not,  he says people don't care about search privacy.  Because the number is still tiny.  It's still teeny weeny, teensy weeny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I had a little Jarvis fit.  DuckDuckGo PR people a week and a half ago,  we didn't talk about this in the show,  but right after the NSA stuff breaks,  and there was still the mistaken belief  that the NSA had direct connections  into the servers of Google and Facebook and such,  which was wrong.  DuckDuckGo sends out a press release  and wants me to interview them because,  gee, now you can not have to use awful Google.  And I thought that was just awfully exploitive  of what is for everybody a bad situation.  It's bad for the internet.  And to exploit it in that way, I got pissed.  And I told him, that's flackery and leave me alone.  Wow.  I thought that was untoward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in a way, it doesn't prove anything.  If you look at this graph,  this is DuckDuckGo compared to Google.  Here's DuckDuckGo before the prism revelations.  Here's DuckDuckGo after.  Still kind of small compared to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a good analysis.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it is sort of exploitative  in that it's using people's fear to promote the product.  But we see this a lot.  What was that?  What was that scroogled?  Microsoft.  Ad.  Gmail man.  Yeah, and there's one where somebody's saying,  did you know the Google Play Store?  That developers have your name and address  and phone number and all your personal information  whenever you buy an app.  That doesn't happen on our platform.  Which I was like, I'm a developer.  I have a developer console.  I was like, I do.  I don't think I have any of that information.  I've never seen my users names and phone numbers  and addresses.  Like that's news to me.  Oh, yes, wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wonderful.  Wait, do we start using Google Mind?  Gina's gonna be in all of our underwear drawers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can send you snail mail now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ooh.  It'll be boxers or briefs, I know.  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I shall send you underpants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, you should guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no she shouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, she shouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't tell you I'm collecting everybody's to-do list  and running algorithms.  Oh yeah, you could do that, couldn't you?  To determine what your life is like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why aren't you doing that?  You're missing out on some great opportunities here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be some really interesting data though.  It would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People's to-do lists are very, very private.  I mean, that's one of the selling points of DoTags  is it goes straight to Dropbox.  I never, my app doesn't see any of it.  But yeah, it's indicative of, you know,  it tells you a lot about your life, your intentions.  It's intention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you should put out a press release  that you've seen a great increase  in the number of users of To-Do Text since Prism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, everybody's just jumping on that command line.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it.  Plain text is the new black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bash.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Bash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to use the bash shell.  Anything else?  I think that's good.  All right, let's get our picks of the week.  And I'll start with you, Jeff Jarvis.  What's your pick?  Oh.  No, wait a minute, what am I saying?  That's a different show.  In this show, we always start with Gina Trapani.  Ladies first.  And her tip of the week.  I apologize.  Didn't mean to throw you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My tip this week is more of a PSA than anything.  Like we just said, Google Reader shutting down,  I think in four days on July 1st.  If you're anything like me,  you've probably seen a little pop-up that said  this is going to go away on July 4th.  July 1st, make sure you back up your data.  I just dismiss it.  I'm like, oh yeah, I'll take care of that later.  But you really got to do that this week.  So make sure you take out your data.  Go into Google Reader, go to Settings, Import, Export.  Yeah, Settings, and then Reader Settings.  Thank you, Chad.  Import, Export tab, and then export your...  Can't read that word.  And it takes you directly to take out,  which will export all your subscriptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, it's an OPML file, okay.  Yeah, it's an OPML file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would have been cool if Google just had emailed us  all our OPML files.  Just give me my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would have been nice if they had done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now here's the question.  If you sign up for Feedly or one of these other alternatives  and they are pulling your Google Reader,  is that sufficient or will I not have access to that later?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That should be sufficient.  It's OPML, which is an open standard for subscriptions  for outlines and RSS subscriptions.  And any feed reader is going to be able to import OPML.  So yeah, that will be sufficient.  I haven't tried this,  but I'm pretty sure it won't preserve your red  and non-red items.  So you might want to do one last pass through on Reader  and make sure that you've seen everything you want to see.  And then export your feeds,  import them into your new Reader, mark all as red,  and then you'll be able to kind of start fresh.  But I got to do this and I got to move to something.  So I'll be prepared for the show.  The change log may not make it if I don't have a...  If I don't have a good feed reader going.  So yeah, you'll see when you click on export,  it takes a few seconds to build your feed.  If you've got tons and tons of subscriptions,  you can say, hey, email me and then when this is done.  And that's thanks to the data liberation folks  doing Google takeout.  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, so I'm on my feedly  and it has all my Google reader links in it.  But my only...  I presume then I don't have to do anything additionally.  I didn't import it, it just did it by itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It did it by itself.  So you connected to reader.  Right, right.  So you won't be able to do that after July 1st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if I'm hoping, maybe I still should export it  because I'm hoping that on July 1st,  all of a sudden feedly goes, well, Google reader's dead.  I don't know what you want to read  because that would be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, in case it's doing a live.  I'm not sure if it might be live.  It might be live, I don't know.  Yeah, if it's doing a live sync or not.  Yeah.  I think I better do the export.  RIP Google reader.  It's been a good few years.  It was indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The number of the week is 32.  The Internet Hall of Fame,  which I didn't know even existed from the Internet Society,  has installed 32 new members of its Hall of Fame,  including, I saw this because John Perry Barlow  did a humble brag about this as well he should on Twitter.  Did he win?  Aaron Schwartz, yes, Aaron Schwartz is there.  Austin is there, Jenny Wales.  Richard Stallman.  Mark Andreessen.  That's a good list.  A whole bunch of people I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are there any women on this list?  Please tell me there's at least one woman on this list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good question, Gina.  What is it?  Now I want to look at this.  So where is this Internet Hall of Fame?  Is there a place, a physical place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what, Gina?  Karen Banks, networking leader  who used information and communication technologies  and applications as tools for social change.  Okay, good.  Henriette Esterhuizen, that sounds kind of female.  Ida Holtz, sounds kind of female.  Ida Holtz, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a pretty good group.  Yeah, there are a lot of names here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Emily Eklund-Livinde,  innovator in implementation of DNS security extensions,  technology and usage procedures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jimmy Wales is on there, that's appropriate.  Jimmy Wales.  Friend of Women and Wikileakers.  Sorry, that's terrible.  So it's internethalloffame.org.  Is this the first year?  I don't, well, it didn't say.  This is the Internet Society they're doing.  And they're gonna have a,  It's the Internet Society, yeah.  Yeah, this is a legitimate,  they're gonna have a awards ceremony  August 3rd in Berlin.  You can watch it on the live stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was supposed to be announced in Istanbul,  but dot dot dot.  Istanbul is constant.  This internet thing messed it up, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Look at all these people.  I know some of these people.  Who else do you know in this group?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure that you've interviewed a lot of these people, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bob Metcalf.  John Perry Barlow's been on triangulation.  Good for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was gonna say, this could be your upcoming slate  for triangulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We should just, all these people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just knock through everyone.  Knock through them one by one.  What did you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mark Andreessen.  That's what you did.  Yeah, this is good.  Richard Stallman played the flute on our show  some moons ago and sang the free software foundation song.  The free software song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Sounds so great.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tried to get him to do a dramatic reading  of his great manifesto, but he won't do it.  Barlow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I tried too.  You asked me when we got him on triangulation.  That's what I asked you to do.  Yeah, and he said no.  Yeah.  He said, actually, I think he disowned it really.  It was the one that begins, people of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I asked him that because people said he disowned it  and he said, no, no, no, no.  I just, this is a little over the top.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is his charm.  But that's what's good about it.  And a dramatic reading would be so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want you to get Stallman to do a dramatic reading  of his writer.  That's what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The GNU Linux writer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the packet that he sends out in advance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You may not call it Linux.  You must call it GNU Linux.  GNU Linux.  That's the only one I know.  Does he have other things that he won't do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he apparently sent out this.  Sends out this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He doesn't want business class  because you'd rather you pay him more.  Oh, that's good.  I don't mind that.  He wants a ride from the airport, I think,  or something like that.  Well, this is reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, this is a little bit,  there's some really good parts where he's like,  sometimes if we go out to dinner  and I'm bored with the conversation,  I'm going to pull out my laptop and answer email  because I've got a lot of email answers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's not exactly, yeah, he's in his,  but at least he's upfront about it.  He did not do any of that when we had him on tech TV.  He merely said that for the day  that he was going to be on the show,  we should call Linux GNU Linux the whole time.  And I think we did.  I can't remember what we decided  because I don't normally do those kinds of things,  but for him maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's reasonable.  That's fine.  That seems okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't really have a tool.  I've been trying to think  but nothing happens.  No more sponsors hanging around?  No, that's it.  We're just going to go home.  There's things I want to recommend,  but I'm not sure I can.  I'm reviewing right now, for instance,  the new Logitech Smart Remote Control,  which will turn your Android phone or your iPhone,  but your Android phone into a Smart Remote Control.  Now we already have that capability.  Well, you don't Gina,  because you don't have the special software that does it.  But the Galaxy S4.  The IR Blaster?  The IR Blaster.  Galaxy S4 and HTC One have IR Blasters.  And I have to say, there's no reason to buy  the Logitech stuff because this works so well by itself.  You don't really need to spend any more.  You've got software.  If you have a Galaxy S4 and HTC One.  Now, if you don't, stay tuned for my review on Wednesday.  I'm having some issues with setup and so forth,  but it'll be on before you buy next week.  Next Tuesday, I should say.  My file's-  I know what I was going to talk about.  Thank you, chat room, for reminding me.  And I'm surprised Gina didn't mention  the Google Cloud Playground.  Ah, yes.  I meant to mention that.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the difference between a playground and a sandbox?  It's kind of like a sandbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was kind of a developer-y thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so the idea is,  let's say you want to learn Python or,  right now it's just Python.  I'll presumably go and other Google languages  will be included.  You can go to the Google Playground.  It's cloud-playground.appspot.com.  Log in if you wish, but if you do,  you should be aware that all of your code and coding  will be visible.  They say this is a shared public playground.  Anyone can read, modify, modify, or delete your projects.  But it is a great way to learn stuff.  So they come with a bunch of project templates.  A Hello World, of course, in Python,  but also more sophisticated stuff like a guest book.  And you can just take these projects.  App Engine last across the finish line.  Example application uses the Task Queue API.  So if you're trying to learn Python, this would be great.  So once you copy it over, then you can open your project.  Here's the Hello World project.  Now there's a lot of extra stuff  because there's some YAML that you have to do.  And Hello World in Python is really,  can be as simple as print Hello World,  but in this case you have to put a handler and so forth  because what happens when you run it  is look at the bottom of the page.  It runs right here in the bottom of the page.  There's the Hello World.  So interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is a little Code Academy-ish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's Code Academy, exactly.  Not quite as-  Without any instruction at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, without any instruction at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can do this yourself.  Python has a number of IDEs  that will allow you to run Python and so forth.  But I think this is kind of cool.  I think it's kind of cool.  Gina, did you see edit E?  Oh, that's another cool one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, what's edit E?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  EY.  This is a code editing environment  for-  For Drive.  Dropbox.  Or no.  For Drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, for Drive.  Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Create dynamic Google Docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you want to, yeah, you can create,  when you go to create, instead of a doc,  you can create, not that I could do it,  but I have it, I installed it anyway.  You can create-  You can actually put a website on Google Drive.  HTML, JavaScript, Pixlr, website, and other stuff.  And these just become new ways to create these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I need to, it's in the web store?  So if I go to the Chrome web store and search for,  it's edit E?  EDI.  EDI TEY.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TEY.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I forgot, I didn't have that second name.  It's a Chrome extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, HTML for editor for Google Drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Simple code editor for Google Drive

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  allows you to create new HTML, JavaScript, CSS files  right from the create menu.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very nice.  Very nice.  It looks cool.  Cool cloud tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm digging it.  I like that the cloud, that the Chrome based cloud  code editors are getting better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that was one of the first things I looked at  when I got the Pixel was, what can I do with this?  Cause I, you know, but I,  yeah, it was pretty limited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pretty limited.  Good.  I think this was a fabulous episode.  Tonight, Jeff Jarvis is going to get glass.  Yeah.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yay, I'm interested to hear what you think Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When will you have it?  Well, I probably can't pick it up until I'm back  from Europe the next trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh no, you gotta get it before you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would hope so.  I'll see if I can get it Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Say, tell them you need it for the show next Wednesday.  Are you gonna be here next Wednesday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm gonna stop at the border with it.  And I'll be in Belgium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if it's Wednesday, this must be Belgium.  So you will not be on the show next Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm planning to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You will from Belgium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to fly Thursday morning.  This is a sin.  I have never been to Rome.  And I'm going back and forth to Rome one day  to go to a Google big tent event.  Oh, that's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to eat pasta.  At least eat pasta.  You have to eat pasta in Rome.  That's sick, isn't it?  That is, that's tragic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's frustrating.  Well, good, we'll talk to you next week in Belgium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tell them you go into this thing.  They're gonna get you the glass.  You say, look, I'm going to a Google event in Rome.  You need to have the glass for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, I'll try.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true, that would be good for them.  Come on.  And then maybe next week we can all wear glass.  You know, it's the 3rd of July.  Yes.  Is that okay with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fine with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do your people celebrate in any way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The celebrations will happen the following day.  Yeah, no, I'm good.  I'm home with the baby.  I got nothing, I'm good.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, well, we'll be here next Wednesday then.  And maybe we'll all be wearing glass.  That'd be kind of cool.  Yeah, that'd be fun.  And Jeff will be in Belgium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It will likely be a light, a news day.  Yeah.  We'll have some fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you for joining us.  We do this week in Google Wednesdays at 1 p.m. Pacific,  4 p.m. Eastern Time, 2100 UTC on twit.tv.  If you can, watch live.  We'd love it if you do.  But if you can't, of course, on-demand audio and video,  always available after the fact.  At twit.tv slash twig.  You can find Gina Trapani's writings  and more at her blog, smarterwear.org.  You blog, still blog there?  You get time?  It's kind of hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Try to start blogging again.  It's kind of hard.  Yeah, I'm gonna start writing again though there.  Twitter spoils and stuff.  I've been writing more code than pros lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Put some glass pictures or something up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I gotta get back to it.  My last post is like, hey, I just had a baby.  I'll be back as soon as, you know,  we're sleeping through the night.  And that was like nine months ago.  That's it.  Goodbye.  Yeah.  See you later.  Yeah, I have to like update WordPress.  I gotta, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you bet.  Oh, shh.  Next thing on the update,  you gotta update it before you mention it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, sorry.  I just don't know if I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got 18 versions behind  if you haven't done anything since January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's rock solid, people.  Don't even think.  Don't even try.  Don't even try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is a, I just saw a plugin for,  oh no, what was it for security on WordPress?  Was it SSH logins?  I think it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  We won't get into it.  But they don't get updated.  Anyway, what I have been working on  is to do text for Android.  There's actually some good,  I'm using the new Play Store beta testing.  So you can opt into the beta test  if you're interested in trying that out.  Blog.todotext.com.  The instructions are there.  And I've been doing a lot of work on ThinkUp too.  So I'm gonna get back to writing soon.  So don't give up on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Coding is so much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so much more fun than writing.  It is, you know if it works or not.  With writing, you don't know if it works  until it's published.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, right.  To do text.com, T-X-T, not T-E-X-T.  If you go to buzzmachine.com,  Jeff Jarvis rants there regularly.  Gnashes his teeth.  He's also a professor of journalism  at the City University of New York,  has been seen at the Stonewall lately.  And...  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not especially now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nothing but good things.  And of course his book, latest book,  is Public Parts, available at all finer bookstores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gutenberg the Geek is soon to come out as an audiobook.  Oh.  Oh, good for you.  And in German, Chinese, and Italian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what it was.  It was Google Authenticator for WordPress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, nice.  I like that a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Two-factor authentication, that's what it was.  Thank you, Jera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two-factor secure.  Wouldn't that be good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I keep meaning to turn that on.  I downloaded and installed the plugin,  but now I don't know what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm gonna set that up.  That's a must install.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, two-factor authentication.  Thanks for joining us, everybody.  We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
