Hello, Jeff.  Hello.  We're sending you a new camera.  Well, you asked us about this Lumina camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I asked about a new camera and I thought you guys because you know everything.  I thought you'd know and the next thing I know you're sending one my way,  which was not my intent.  I swear.  But thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I knew about it because it was a Kickstarter or an Indiegogo or something.  And I looked at it and then apparently they you're going to get a  complimentary.  I can't wait.  I want to be the fly on the wall for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should.  Yeah, I should record it like no, no, no, you're still pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I compliment broken our camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, let's see if they can get Jeff looking right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They get this white belt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He looks good today.  Hey, wait a minute.  Holy cow.  It's Stacy Higginbotham.  There she is.  I live and breathe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so does she.  Hello y'all.  She lives and breathes.  Welcome back.  We miss you so darn much.  Stacy on iot.com is the website.  We were thinking of you.  She was stuck at the Hotel Frisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the Omni Hotel in Frisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the Hotel Frisco sounds so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It does sound so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For two weeks quarantining, but now you're you're safe to be out and about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I am.  I well, I hope so.  I've tested negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yay.  I've just so we're so we were worried.  You really actually got it.  You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't mind.  I mean, I was tweeting throughout a huge portion of it because I'm like, I'm so alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not revealing you're lonely in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, how many times can you watch the office from beginning to end?  You got it pretty bad though.  You had a serious fever lost your sense of smell and taste and and this is and you're  and you're vaccinated, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I am triple vaxxed.  I actually wore a mask and so just be aware.  Just beware.  I still have a sinus infection.  So y'all I sound so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You too could be stuck for two weeks in the hotel Frisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eagles song.  It's good.  You'll like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thankfully, I made it out and we also welcome back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been a little bit of a dry spell here.  Aunt Pruitt's back from Hands On Photography.  Hey, aunt.  How you be sir?  Good to see you.  And has actually outsourced and found soundproofing materials in the Clemson colors.  So that's pretty cool.  I don't know how you did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Soundassured.com.  Oh, nice.  There you go.  Nice value sound acoustic phone.  You know, it sounds really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like you said, it sounds sounds like you're just in this like chamber.  The soundproof chamber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It sounds really good.  Plus there's no dogs in here snoring next to me.  So that helps.  That helps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is aunt Pruitt coming from the void.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he actually sounds better there than he does when he's in studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's kind of depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, big story broke at one o'clock this afternoon.  Just an hour ago.  Sheryl Sandberg posted on Facebook.  She is leaving Metta after 14 years.  Today I'm sharing the news that after 14 years, I'll be leaving Metta.  She says she didn't plan to stay this long.  When I joined Facebook, I had a two-year-old son and a six-month-old daughter.  I didn't know if this was the right time for a new and demanding role,  but I wanted to give it a try.  She said, I didn't expect to stay more than five years,  but she's ended up there.  Chief operating officer at Metta, Mark Zuckerberg's right-hand woman.  For 14 years, she went through, of course, the passing of her husband, Dave.  Some real ups and downs and of course, the challenge of running a company  that's under constant scrutiny from the feds and from the public,  the whistleblower and all of that survived all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If she had left after five, six years, she could have got on lots of other things,  but now she has kind of Facebook cooties.  She wrote a book called Lean In.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like she has to work again?  No, in fact, just in case you're wondering,  if you're interested, that's not what she...  She said, when I took this job in 2008, I hoped I would be in this role for five years.  Fourteen years later, it's time for me to write the next chapter of my life.  I'm not entirely sure what the future will bring,  except giant bags of money.  I have learned no one ever is...  No, I'm kidding.  She didn't say that.  I've learned no one ever is,  but I do know it will include focusing more on my foundation and philanthropic work,  which is more important to me now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have giant bags of money to give away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now than ever, given how critical this moment is for women,  I think that the timing may have something to do with Roe v. Wade.  I don't know.  Also, she's getting married in the summer.  She says, as Tom and I get married this summer,  parenting our expanded family of five children,  our next few months, Mark and I will transition my direct reports.  I'll leave the company this fall.  She will stay on the board of directors.  Oh, she's going to run for office, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I was wondering.  Do you think she can?  Do you think she has too many Facebook cooties?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, she'll go someplace.  Do you think cooties are a thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She missed the California primary,  so she won't be on the ballot for Senator.  It just takes time.  It would have to be a national office.  It would have to be 2020.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She could replace Diane.  Senate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, that might be the path because Diane Feinstein is getting on,  and it might be that she retires early,  and Gavin Newsom, who I'm sure Sheryl Sandberg has very good ties with,  would appoint her, and that would eliminate an election,  and then she'd have a couple of years to serve in the Senate before she had  a run for office.  That would be very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Huh.  Do you think she might?  I don't think there would be a such thing as Facebook cooties as Mr.  You don't think so?  You were mentioning.  No, I mean, considering how the rest of the governing bodies have been  put into office here, regardless of their history and past or whatever,  none of that stuff matters.  It's just, you know, can you scratch the back of the right lobbyists  at the right time kind of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And also name recognition is probably more important than anything,  especially with women.  Lean In was a very popular, best-selling book about how women should  move forward in business and the world.  So yeah, I do think politics is in her future.  So, what...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, one form or another.  She should also get be appointed to some federal position, you know,  ambassador to somewhere or something.  I think she wants something more than that.  I think she wants something with some clout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we could look up, because it's public record, Sheryl Sandberg's  political contribution record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Survey says?  Well, well, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, we could...  Facebook's...  Most of Facebook's lobbying efforts are very right-wing.  So, it would kind of be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She contributed quite a bit to Nancy Pelosi, to Women Making History,  2016, Zoe Loughgren, Act Blue, Amy Klobuchar, Hillary Victory Fund,  very Democrat, Bennett Colorado Victory Fund, Leahy for Senator Committee.  This is just in 2016.  I think the total is more than half a million.  I'm sorry.  Is that right?  $729,000 in...  Wait a minute, I can't...  The dollar sign is in a strange position on this.  I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it's so far away from the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have you seen that mini zero sign?  I donated $72.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You broke it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get it.  171 donations in 2020 totaling $729,000.  2018, 425 the year before...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, 2020, I'm curious to see.  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should we look at 2020s?  All right.  I have to move ahead.  In January 1st, 1900, she gave money to Finkenauer.  There appears to be an error in this database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was not adapted for Y2K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.  I clicked the link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I clicked the link.  Anna Eshoo, who's Democrat, ActBlue with Democrat.  Yeah, Eshoo's that district.  Tina Smith from Minnesota.  Trying to go after tech.  Yeah.  These are all, you know, the maximum by the way, $2,800.  She gave the Facebook PAC some money.  Nancy Pelosi.  So yeah, very much liberal.  Women vote.  Chris Koontz in Delaware.  So yeah, I don't see though, interestingly, Gavin Newsom.  But maybe I'm looking at the wrong year.  Is that just federal or?  It's everything.  This is, you know, it's all public record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, but is it just, is there a separate listing for local, for state?  A separate reporting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This all is state.  So I don't, but no, this is all over the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me see.  No, but I'm saying these are federal offices as opposed to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Those are federal offices as opposed to state offices.  I see what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there may be separate reporting for a state office.  State office.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  Jackie Spear.  People for Ben.  Anyway.  And who?  Ben and Jerry.  Come on, get with it.  We only need first names here.  She talks about Mark throughout her post and Tom, her fiance, who at first I  thought was MySpace Tom, but it turns out...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, who was it she was dating who got in trouble recently, but she was trying to  tell stories?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the CEO of Activision.  Activision, yeah.  Yeah, Kotkin.  That was not meant to be.  She is engaged and will marry Tom Bernthal, who is a Bernthal, who's the founder of a  marketing company, Kelton Global.  She met through her brother-in-law, Rob.  They'll have a blended family of seven.  Brother-in-law being...  Dave's brother.  Dave's brother.  Wow.  Her exes, not ex, her late husband's brother.  Late husband's.  So that's kind of nice.  That's kind of nice.  Did you read Mark's post yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, let's see.  What does Mark say?  I put it up there.  It looks like a consolidation of power.  He's not going to replace Cheryl.  There'll be a COO, but not a Cheryl COO, a pure revenue COO.  More stuff reports to Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember when Nick Clegg took over Global Affairs, we kind of thought, oh, this is a  triumvirate.  Mark runs the technical side.  Cheryl runs the operations and then Nick runs the outward-facing governmental relations.  So that's interesting.  Without Cheryl, he says, would Cheryl join me?  Solidation of power with Mark.  I was only 23 years old and I knew barely anything about running a company.  Cheryl, architect at our ads business, hired great people, forged our management culture,  taught me how to run a company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seymour of Mark Zuckerberg, try logging in or creating a new account, Leo.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look how big that is, by the way.  That takes over half the page.  This is for those just listening.  I am reading a Facebook post, but I do not have an account.  So Facebook is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a lower third, literally a lower third of the screen.  Really?  Sign in, sign up, come on, shmuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the greatest legacies, the incredible team Cheryl's built.  Nick Clegg is president of Global Affairs, Jennifer Neustad, chief legal officer.  Javi, which is Javier Olivan, he runs...  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He does this for Instagram and Facebook.  Okay, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's the revenue guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Actually, he's been in the news lately with Instagram.  He'll become the next COO where he'll lead the integrated ads and business  products in addition to leading infrastructure integrity, just a little job,  analytics, marketing, corporate development and growth teams.  Javi, I hope you're getting a big raise.  But he's not Cheryl.  Yeah.  But this role will be different from what Cheryl has done.  It'll be more traditional COO role where he'll be focused internally and operationally.  I think Mark really has already moved his attention to VR, to the Metaverse.  And so I really think that who's running the old legacy business is no  longer that important to me, I would guess.  As part of this, Molly Cutler, our VP strategic responsible, join Javi's team  and report to Naomi Gleit.  Justin Ossofsky will report to Chris Cox, who you remember came back.  He's one of the founders of Facebook.  So it is a bit of a reorg.  This will happen this fall.  But I really wonder how much Mark worries about Facebook anymore.  You know, how important is that?  He's really...  Because it has cooties.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He should worry about it because it's going to generate all of his revenue.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like AOL was, which surprisingly, I don't care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think, I think maybe Cheryl, and he kind of planned this saying, Cheryl  saying, you know, we're going to wind down Facebook.  Metaverse is the next big thing.  I don't want to really kind of start up in that project.  Why don't you give Javi the day-to-day operations?  You can focus your, what did they say?  18,000 engineers and $10 billion a year building this new Metaverse.  Focus on that.  And Javi will, you know, keep things, keep the engine running so we  can have funds.  Nick will send off government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Stacey, I think, you know, do they recognize, just to what you just  said a minute ago, do they recognize that maybe it is AOL?  And the smart thing to do is to...  That's what I think.  Is to just let it kind of just, like AOL, keep bringing in some money,  lots of money, but it's going to feed their next ambition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, yeah.  And AOL still had to manage the dial-up business as it were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they still do, I think, technically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My father still pays $4.95 a month to them.  I'm scared of canceling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah, this is a, yeah, it's a big change.  I have to think this is not a surprise to Mark and that this is probably  something they planned and maybe even as a beginning of...  Well, she stayed on the board.  That's very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's still on the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you're doing something like this, she probably told him like a year ago,  hey, I'm getting itchy feet.  Let's figure that.  I mean, when you're the CEO, when you're part of the triumvirate, you have a plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've always thought that Mark wanted, had political ambitions, but Cheryl  makes much more sense, really.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  She's much more palatable than Mark.  Yeah.  She feels like she likes people, for instance.  I'm sorry, Anne.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She identifies as a person?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  She identifies as a person.  Human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Human.  Anne?  Would the operations officer deal a little bit more tightly with the general  council because you know, there's more stuff probably just out in someone's  hidden newsfeed that says, hey, we caught so-and-so doing this on that platform.  We caught this executive leaking...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nick Clegg does the runs interference with government.  That's really his job.  Policy and comms.  Yeah.  Clegg is.  And, but you're right.  Javier would have to, you know, keep an eye on that.  Yeah.  He'd have, he'd have his eyes on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But probably would policy would probably wouldn't come from him in this structure.  It would call you, you're right.  I have to focus on, on chief counsel.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe Elon Musk should buy Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It would be more than 40.  Elon Musk should not do anything else.  He needs to take a nap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take a nap.  My Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like a toddler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You need to take a nap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacy, you missed two key Elon weeks, boy.  Oh man.  Good.  I was so glad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was just like, oh, I'm going to wake up.  This is all going to be over, but it's still happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  It never ends.  It's still happening.  Yeah.  But you saw the memo that he sent out to executives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I haven't been online for the last 10 to 12 days.  What have you been doing?  I can't tell you anything.  How?  I've been...  Have you been in a coma?  I've been watching reruns of Archer and Parks and Rec.  I'm so jealous.  I did my very best to disconnect because I was supposed to be working a gig and no gig got cancelled.  So I said I'm going to disconnect.  I didn't even watch the show last week, even though I normally would.  But I was like, I got to step away from work.  And I couldn't tell you the first thing that's been really going on other than all of the violence and stuff that's been happening recently.  But I don't need the tech news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we've been trying to avoid talking about it because it's so horrific and it's so depressing.  I notice I wake up every morning depressed.  It's just...  So I understand.  I really understand.  I'm jealous that you got to unplug.  Unfortunately, you don't really get to unplug, do you?  That stuff follows you around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I worked really hard to try to disconnect these last couple days and I felt bad as thinking,  Oh man, my first day back to work is the day of Twig where I'm supposed to be reading all of this wonderful information that Mr. Howell has put into our rundown that you never even get to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do not need to read it.  I just want your deep heartfelt reaction to anything we say.  And if it's bless his heart, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is evil episode, you know.  This is the evil episode.  I can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I put that there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh my God.  I'm glad I came back for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank God it's not Friday the 13th, then we'd really be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Zorgan is going to take over Leo's chair any minute.  I'm Gozar, the Q-Master.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Elon has a message for you, Ant.  Oh boy.  Remote work is no longer acceptable.  This is an email sent to the entire staff electric.  Got it.  Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum.  And I mean minimum of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla.  This is less than we ask of factory workers.  If there are particularly exceptional contributors for whom this is impossible,  I will review and approve those exceptions directly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, wait, you're supposed to work 37 and a half hours.  He's asking for more time than people should put in as a minimum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Moreover, the office must be a main Tesla office, not remote branch offices  unrelated to your job duties.  For example, being responsible for Fremont factory human relations,  but having your office be in another state.  Thanks, Elon.  Second email subject to be super clear.  By the way, he said, you know, I only spend 5% of my time on Twitter.  So clearly he's got, you know, he's got the bandwidth to be right in this.  Everyone at Tesla is required to spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week.  Well, this is kind of reiterating the more senior you are,  the more visible must be your presence.  That's why I lived in the factory so much so that those on the line  could see me working alongside them and saying, is he still here?  Get rid of him.  If I had not done that, Tesla long ago would have gone bankrupt.  There are of course companies that don't require this.  But when was the last time they shipped a great new product?  It's been a while.  Who's he talking about?  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it has been a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody has shipped a great new product in ever.  Tesla has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting  and meaningful products of any company on earth.  This will not happen by phoning it in.  He is scared.  Scared or angry?  I think he needs a nap.  I think Stacey's right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's just, he looks like someone who is going a little unhinged.  And I don't mean this lightly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, that's serious.  And I worry about him because you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know if I'm worried, but I do think one of his close friends should be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I give him credit for putting it out there and saying, look, this is what we require.  We want our folks here.  We're not doing hybrid.  We're not doing remote.  This is it, bottom line.  So it's not all wishy washy and anything, especially when people are looking for work.  They know what the expectations are.  And for some people, it's a very small percentage of people.  They're fine with going to the office.  Says aunt who's remote today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's at home?  Oh, by the way.  Yeah, just for those who are listening, that's where aunt is, just so you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I didn't say I wasn't listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we're very easy going here.  You're never going to get a memo like that from me.  And we have a four-day work week and we're still pretty much, you know, hybrid.  It's up to you and...  Binance had a job listing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because you want to work for Binance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it says it all here.  Let me see if I can find it.  No, I don't.  In fact, after reading this job listing, I'm afraid.  I'm very afraid.  I'm not going to be able to find it.  But it basically said, you know, kind of what Elon just said, really.  Don't think you can work here, work a 40-hour week.  You know, that's not how we...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the old Disney joke.  What was that?  If you don't come in on Saturday, don't bother coming in on Sunday.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think that's necessary?  Do you think that that really makes a difference?  I mean, Apple does it.  Technology companies do it historically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cheryl told the story in her post.  Go ahead, Dan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It depends on leadership.  There's some folks that feel like you have to have these, you know, scrums.  Is the leader right?  No.  If they have the proof and the pudding that says, hey, being here has been productive  and allowed us to produce X product with X amount of return on investment, yada, yada, yada, then sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you're very generous.  Well, that's too near.  You can't lie to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's a fantasy.  I think there's a lot of evidence that in fact, working that hard does not promote better work.  I don't think Americans can really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go ahead.  I'm sorry, Miss Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, you go ahead.  You go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I'm saying I agree with Mr. LaPorte that it's a bit of a fantasy.  But at the same time, I also respect the fact that someone could say, hey, these are my values for the workplace.  And, you know, if you want to work here, we're happy to have you.  But, you know, but if you don't want these, then...  I completely agree.  It's their right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's their right to say that.  I just don't know if they are right to say that.  Yeah.  Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was going to say, I think it's kind of a function of how productive you want to be as a company.  Obviously, if you are working...  I mean, yes, there's a point where it stops.  But like, I don't work 40 hours a week anymore because I don't have to to make what I feel is a decent living.  And I would say the compromise there is if you're a company that's like, yeah, I want my company to be okay.  It's going to grow at this rate.  I'm cool with that versus a more hard driving culture.  And honestly, I don't think Americans are really the right people to talk to about this because we have been  indoctrinated our whole life into like...  We are really crazy.  Like when I talk to my friends, almost anywhere else, with the exception of like my friends in China,  and some of them in Japan, they're just like, what is wrong with y'all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here's the Binance from the recruitment site about the company.  At Binance, we don't work.  We live it.  No one ever asks you to work overtime or checks if you show up late in the morning.  Those concepts don't apply at Binance.  We do whatever it takes to get whatever needs getting done.  It ends up being a lot of overtime.  We are always working.  There's no off switch if you have your sleeves rolled up and ready to sweat it for the long haul and be part of a team  that will help to define finance for the world tomorrow.  Then read on.  If not, you can save your lazy bum some reading.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Crypto is kind of like a weird cult mentality anyway.  So that kind of ties into that, you know, world view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess if you're going to get stock options and get rich, you might be willing to sacrifice your family life,  your humanity, your sleep for something.  I mean, you get rich, I guess.  That's a startup mentality, right?  And then for some people, it's like creating the next, you know, creating the Mac or some great thing.  But for most people, all they're doing is giving up their family life, their real life, their world.  So somebody else can get rich.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's that weird American, like they have a calling to do this.  And, you know, very few people, very few jobs are a job that you could say have a calling, right?  But we tend to want people to work like that.  I think actually at a certain point in time, it might work for a lot of people.  Like when you're young and hungry and coming out and if you're like really interested in learning a lot really fast,  I think that fits.  But I don't think that that's how everyone would like it to be.  And I think if that's the way the world were for everywhere and everyone, that would be horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  From Isabel Asher Hamilton writing today in Business Insider,  Elon Musk said working from home during the pandemic tricked people into thinking they don't need to work hard.  He's dead wrong, economists say.  Working from home does not make workers less productive, according to three economists, the insider interviewed.  The only constraint on productivity was when workers had children at home, they needed to look after.  There's a lot of evidence, in fact, that working at home.  Here's Natasha Postolvenay, an economic and financial historian at the London School of Economics.  Most of the evidence shows that productivity has increased while people stayed at home.  People spent less time commuting so they could use some of that time to work.  They got to spend more time with their family and sleeping, which meant they were happier and ended up being more productive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I'm reminded, Leo, of when I last had a salaried job and it was a really good salary, I will say.  I would sit there some days and this is really why I chose to quit.  I would sit there some days and I would say I haven't done much of anything of value to this company.  They paid me this much money today and I didn't actually do anything because I had to sit here on my rump.  Because that's what we do.  And that was so disturbing, right?  As opposed to thinking I can get something done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who working in an office hasn't had that experience where, you know, first some guy comes over, asks you how your weekend was,  and then you got to go to a meeting in which you have nothing to add, and then it's lunchtime and you got a couple of martinis because the boss was drinking.  Back of the day.  Yeah.  Boy.  By the end of the day you go, what happened?  Lunch meetings were great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You missed that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You did miss it.  We had Korean for lunch.  You could have had Korean, Andy.  Come on in.  That's our way of bribing people to get them into the.  Lisa likes to have people around.  She's very social and for her, in the work she's doing with the people she's working with, our sales team, our marketing team, our continuity team,  so that there's some back and forth and she could say, what's this?  It's more efficient for her.  And I understand that.  I don't think our hosts work better here than they would work at home.  Our producers don't work better here than they work at home.  Our editors need the equipment here, but they've been working at home a lot and it's been working fine.  So from my point of view it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm way more productive here in my studio.  Yeah.  I would think so.  Way more productive.  Yeah.  So we miss talking to you.  Most of my adult life, you know, is just sort of built into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you worked in IT, you kind of have to be there, right?  Unless all the servers are in your house.  I was going to say, that cable right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was at home most of the time in my IT world because everything was remote connected if I needed to.  There you go.  You didn't need to be.  Again, I got more done because I didn't have people walking up asking me if I watched the game when they know I already watched the game.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You told that story about convincing your boss to let you go home and work and it worked better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I did.  I did.  And the boss was like, well, okay, well, since you're sending me this email at 2 in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess that's proof.  To stay home.  I always send my boss emails in the middle of the night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you learn how to put the time in the email.  That could be it.  I'm such a good programmer that I learned to send the email out while I was snoring.  But yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I work for I Heart doing the radio shows by Premier and my boss is the president of Premier.  I'm baffled.  I will send her an email.  I sent her an email Memorial Day at 1148 p.m.  Before midnight, she'd responded.  I mean, within minutes, she responds instantly.  And I'm almost now it's almost a game.  And I think it's partly because the CEO of I Heart, Bob Pittman, is kind of that kind of guy.  Yeah.  Where he is.  Yeah.  If you didn't use to work with him.  Yeah.  Right.  I sent you an email where you didn't respond.  Are you work?  What are you doing?  Mogul sleeping.  He's a mogul.  There you go.  It's mogul moments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's one of those people who only need four hours of sleep and don't understand everyone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I love Julie.  You would love Julie because she's a country that they're out of Nashville and she's very relaxed and friendly and country.  And she's just the sweetest person.  And I kind of feel bad for her because I'm sure she'd like to have a mint julep about 530 p.m.  and just relax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's Kentucky, sir.  Yeah.  That's Kentucky.  Oh, that's right.  What are they drinking Tennessee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, good old Jack Daniels.  I'd like a little, yeah, a little Lynchburg liquor and just relax.  Put my feet up on the barrel and watch the hound dog sleep.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unbutton the top button on the brick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know if you've ever been to Nashville, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not like that at all.  I know.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nashville Vegas is more like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Yeah, everybody's making it.  Everybody's doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They go, all right, let's take a little break.  Then we will talk about another huge story.  This, you know, it's funny.  This is normally a dead season like because of summer breaks and stuff.  But some of the biggest stories of the week have come out in the last couple of days.  Supreme Court rules on the Texas social media law.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  And then of course, we're going to spend an hour and a half talking about Johnny Depp and Amber Heard.  But next.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Just teasing.  It's Elon Musk.  But actually, Elon Musk is the Depp-Herd trial of the tech industry, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the thing that you can't look away from.  I did.  I'm proud.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not one minute.  Not one minute did I watch it.  Well, you were in prison, Stacey.  You had nothing else to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, no, but I avoided it like the plague.  It was hard, but I did.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't wait.  We're going on a cruise.  It's going to be fun to Alaska with the Twit fans.  100 strong.  It's a little more than a month, about six weeks off.  And I don't know about you, but when I'm going on a cruise, I start to think about my wardrobe.  And that's why I went to our sponsor in Doshino.  And I got myself some cruise wear.  I have, I almost don't want to say it.  For those of you who are going on the cruise, and I know a few of you are in our chat room and our club Twit.  I have some of the things I got from Doshino.  I can't wait to, I have a purple velvet dinner jacket with satin,  lapels.  It's so beautiful.  I can't wait.  I'm going to wear a tuxedo.  That'll be my tuxedo.  Now, it's not the only thing you can get in Doshino.  Doshino is actually a great place to shop for any kind of event,  whether you're going to be a groom in a wedding party, a lucky guest.  Weddings are coming up, wedding season this month.  You want to look your best for a wedding?  Look at these.  I mean, they are so sharp.  I wore, actually I wore a couple of weeks ago, I wore my purple silk jacket,  which I found out it looks, it's just like silk, but it's actually wool, but it's just beautiful.  It's silky, smooth.  And here's the thing.  It's like it is, in fact, having a custom tailor, because your suits come from Doshino.  You get measured, you can either go to Doshino and get measured or go to a tailor,  get measured or measure yourself, but they fit perfectly like a glove.  They're tailored.  It's not XL, XXL, not that.  They're tailored perfectly for your proportions.  So you look great, you feel confident.  You don't have to, you know, sometimes when you get dressed up, you feel like you don't,  it's uncomfortable, like you don't belong in these clothes.  You belong when you put on your Doshino suits or jackets or shirts or pants, you feel like they belong.  Every detail is perfect, customized to your desires.  Suit, shirt, dinner jacket.  And the prices, given that these are completely 100% custom tailored, are really good.  Every suit made to your measurements, you can customize every detail.  Monograms, fabrics, you can get great statement linings.  And yes, they're not all purple velvet jackets.  They have a whole variety of subtle looks as well, but it's nice to have a choice.  In Doshino suits, custom tailored, start at $4.29, shirts from $79.  Custom fitted shirts, casual wear.  You'll get a wardrobe personalized to your taste without spending a fortune.  You know, I was going to save this dinner jacket for the cruise, but maybe I'll break it out over the next few days  because it's so beautiful.  I love it so much.  And they're always adding new pieces and options.  So I always go back to the site.  Look at that white suit.  I might have to order that.  And once they have your measurements, you know, you can, of course, they guarantee it.  The fit's guaranteed.  So you can, if you get it and it doesn't fit, you can send it back or have it adjusted.  That's not a problem.  But once they get it right, which they have, they have my exact measurements now.  You just want to go on the site and go, yeah, I want a white suit.  Sure.  They're always adding new stuff.  You can always stay in trend.  It's very, it's definitely stylish.  You won't, you won't feel frumpy.  They have a relaxed yet refined approach to spring suits.  Their new spring pastels are coming out.  Spring, summer too.  And I think the fall collection is just about, just about to come out.  If you've got a big day coming up, getting the perfect look is no big deal with Indochino.  I-N-D-O-C-H-I-N-O.  Get $50 off any purchase of $399 or more.  Just use the promo code TWIT at Indochino.com.  I love my Indochino suits.  $50 off any purchase of $399 or more.  I-N-D-O-C-H-I-N-O.com promo code TWIT.  You will see me wearing these in the cruise.  I think I look very sharp.  I'm not wearing it now.  I should have worn it for today, but I wanted to surprise everybody.  Indochino.com.  Don't forget the offer code.  T-W-I-T.  I was really surprised when the news across the wire yesterday  that the U.S. Supreme Court halted that horrific Texas social media law.  Instead of just one justice, it would have been shadow-docketed.  And I think it would have been Justice Alito that would have, could have said,  no, we're not going to review this.  So just to refresh your memory, Texas legislature.  Yes.  Oh, it's a horrible bill.  Texas legislature approved this.  A court blocked it.  Then the then of course, the Texas appeal, the Attorney General appealed  and a the Fifth District Court unblocked the block.  Now, if you want to know more about why this sexual social media law is so bad,  you got it.  Just read Mike Masnick on Tech Dirt.  Let me pull up some of his articles on this.  It was always so brilliant.  Yeah.  Stuff.  It's one of those laws that essentially, well, here's his headline.  Just how incredibly effed up is Texas social media content moderation law?  He points out.  Let me tell you.  Let me tell you.  He points out for instance, remember in Buffalo a couple of shootings ago.  It's hard to keep track.  I know.  But the guy who did this was streaming it on Twitch.  Masnick says Twitch could have been sued for taking the stream down.  It opens a social network with more than 50 million average US users to lawsuits  by anybody for any kind of moderation.  Litigator Ken White did a great thread on Twitter, which we commented on a week ago,  I think, or two weeks ago.  And I think we've probably gone through this.  It was in fact in effect until yesterday when the US Supreme Court actually reversed the  decision of the Fifth Circuit.  Jeff, were you surprised?  I was surprised.  I did not expect that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought it was going to be Alito just saying,  we'll let it be.  But the decision itself and who voted which way, I still can't figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't understand.  Just to be clear, there is a trial going on.  This was a preliminary injunction by a lower court saying no, no, no, no.  Until this is resolved, this law is not enforceable.  The Fifth District said, oh, yes, it is.  It's enforceable.  The Supreme Court has merely said no, no, no.  No enforcement of this law until the case works its way through the courts.  So the law is not gone.  Right now what's happening is there will be a court case and that will be decided.  And you know what?  At that point, it may go back to the Supreme Court.  So it's kind of unclear exactly.  Google said the measure would unconstitutionally bar platforms from removing neo-Nazi and Ku  Klox Klan crap or Russian propaganda about Ukraine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was this measure brought up just because they felt the tech companies are screwing with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  freedom of speech?  Yeah.  And you remember the Florida law that initially exempted Disney?  Oh, right.  Okay.  And then after Governor DeSantis decided Disney was a woke corporation, yeah, we're going  to include Disney on this one, which just shows this is pure politics.  Both of them really were Republican legislators saying to, in effect to Twitter, you should  never have banned Donald Trump.  Now see what happens.  So it was really about conservative legislators saying big tech, particularly Facebook and  Twitter are, and actually Facebook, I think, I don't know, I think Facebook may or may  not be, it's not liable in Florida now because its net worth has gone down, but I think it's  still liable in Texas.  These guys are left leaning and they have to be held accountable for their moderation  decisions, but what it really does is opens up all moderation decisions to suit.  So the US Supreme Court, it was close, it was 5-4, said, no, no, we're going to block  this law until it works its way through the courts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Ari Cohn, I put it in a thread, Ari Cohn says that there's also thinking that the status  of the Florida law does also have impact here.  So it's both together.  And this also means the court is going to take this up.  Ultimately, they will have to treat it seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, ultimately, I think this is in a way saying, yeah, just hold on, we're going to  rule on this, but in the meanwhile, because it's clearly, at least in my opinion, and  I'm not a lawyer, but Kathy Gellis, who has felt this way too, it's unconstitutional.  It's a government telling a private business.  But who knows what the Constitution is?  Well, I know.  So the dissent, the people who said, no, no, this law should stand, were Neil Gorsuch,  Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, the very reliable.  So far, not surprising.  Right-wing judges, and Elena Kagan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Elena Kagan.  This was procedural in a way that I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't seen this before.  We don't know because there was no written dissent, so we don't know their thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someone was trying to speculate why it would be based on her prior, and I still don't understand  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, the government does order private businesses to serve citizens under like ADA and things  like that.  Maybe there's something like that.  I'm really stretching.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just unknown.  Let me look at Ari's thread here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they did a spaces.  Decision comes on the heel of the 11th Circuit's ruling.  Florida's law also violates the First Amendment.  Yeah, I don't know.  Do they consider?  And by the way, that has not been appealed to the Supreme Court yet, and that's Clarence  Thomas who will decide that one.  The votes to grant the applications to vacate the Fifth Circuit's decision allowing enforcement  of the law in favor were Justice Roberts.  Okay.  Breyer, you'd expect that.  Sotomayor, you'd expect that.  Roberts is kind of a swing, so there's two liberals, the Chief Justice and Kavanaugh  and Barrett, the two newest Supreme Court justices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The trumpiest of them all, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was an Alito dissent.  I should say there was a dissent by Alito, but Kagan did not join that dissent, so she  never talked about her reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the dissent, it says here at number four, was ostensibly procedural.  And they argue that the plaintiff says Ari haven't demonstrated a substantial likelihood  of success on the merits because it's quite unclear whether existing law supports their  challenge.  So it's a hall of mirrors here.  The double, triple, quadruple negatives.  It's hard to figure out.  Okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so I think you're right.  I think, I mean, I'm not really equipped.  If Kathy were here, maybe she would be to go through this thread.  But I think the issue is, and I'm going to end up in the Supreme Court again.  It's just got to work its way there once the courts in Florida and Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's scary about the courts is the fact that this didn't get shot down once and for  all at the first level of court to say this is patently ridiculously unconstitutional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the fact that it got through the Fifth Circuit.  See, they were just ruling on the injunction.  So we haven't yet heard a court rule on the law itself, actually, just the injunction.  No, we have not.  We'll see.  Anyway, kind of a surprise from the Supreme Court.  You just never know what those nine folks in their black robes are going to do.  Just never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love this moment when Leo's looking down the list thinking, what's going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, let me ask y'all.  So we've had court decisions around like, is it fair for the president to block people?  So a politician, is he okay for that person to block people on Twitter or other social  media sites?  He's official.  With something like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well remember, they ruled that President Trump could not block people on Twitter because  he was on his feet as POTUS.  Yeah, as Donald Trump he could.  But as POTUS he couldn't because you're supposed to listen to the people.  You're using a governmental instrument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Crazy thought.  But you're supposed to listen to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that is small detail.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be like blocking your phone number from calling the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, that's a better way to do that.  Yes.  We don't want to hear from that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  For a long time though, and I know that we now have separate accounts for certain elected  officials, but, you know, well, I guess we're just figuring out.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Big, I think very interesting letter from some of the most renowned and respected technologists  in the world, including Bruce Schneier, who we've had on this show, he's a very top level  security guy.  Miguel de Ecaza, who was at Microsoft, he's a very well known programmer.  Principal engineer at Google Cloud, Kelsey Hightower, saying, watch your wallet.  Blockchain in the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry should be regulated.  Should be regulated.  Danger, danger, they say.  Danger, danger.  Schneier says the claims that the blockchain advocates make are not true.  It's not secure.  It's not decentralized.  Any system where you forget your password and you lose your life savings is not a safe  system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's decentralization, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The crypto industry is not decentralized.  So what they're essentially writing is a counter to the lobby, crypto industry lobby, which  spends millions of dollars getting Congress to support the crypto industry.  They're saying, well, we want to provide a counter argument.  We're counter lobbying.  You said that decentralization and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I'm saying if you lose your password because there's nobody else keeping track  of your passwords, they allow you to manage the forgotten password.  That's part of it being decentralized, right?  Isn't that what you sign up for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Schneier says it's not decentralized.  And I think that might be referring more to NFTs, which are in theory decentralized, but  in fact, open-seat controls them.  In fact, we already saw that because when open-seat decided to block an NFT to take  it off the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But open-seat just last week said that they were going to shift to a protocol like Blue  Sky shifts social to protocol.  So there is that movement to go the other way.  But you're right, Ant.  If it's totally decentralized, there's kind of no appeal to control it as a result.  So yeah, this is kind of both sides of the coin here.  It is decentralized.  Ergo, it's hard to protect people.  It's not decentralized in the sense that open-seat can still be a single point of failure for  at least NFTs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  The letter goes on to say, crypto assets have been the vehicle for unsound and highly volatile  speculative investment schemes that are being actively promoted to retail investors who  may be unable to understand their nature and risk.  I've been saying this for a long time.  And further, they go on to say crypto and blockchain tech serve no real purpose.  I have, and I think Stacey, you have been in a number...  I know Ant, you have.  We've been saying, well, maybe the underlying technology like blockchain has some value.  They don't even acknowledge that.  Miguel de Acasa said the computational power equivalent to what you would do in a centralized  way through a bank with a $100 computer, we're essentially wasting millions of dollars worth  of equipment because we've decided we don't trust the banking system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, well, that's again, that's only for financial stuff.  So I would take it out with a grain of salt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Good point.  Although these guys, Schneier for sure.  By the way, Tim Bray, who is also one of the signers, the letter is at concerned.tech  and it's to Schumer, McConnell, Pelosi, McCarthy, all the leadership in Congress, was also signed  by Tim Bray who will be on Tech News Weekly tomorrow.  Good get, Micah Sargent.  Good guy to get.  Nice.  Tim's a great guy.  Cory Doctorow signed it.  I would have signed it.  I kind of agree.  I think there's a...  He's cautioned in financial areas.  Yeah.  Molly White, the now famous creator of Web3 is going great, that website.  Jamie Zawinski, who was a developer at Netscape, very well known in the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Molly White signed the letter too?  Oh, I didn't see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Molly White.  Yeah.  And you can sign it too if you want at concerned.tech.  I think they really just want to counter a lot of lobbying from companies that stand  to gain a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As Stacey would say, if I may Stacey, this is something we have to discuss.  We can't just rush into it.  And I'm all for let's try out the internet and see what it is.  But when it comes to people's life savings, you've got to be a little more deliberate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and part of it is, I mean, we're a nation of people, I mean, especially in the US of  get rich quick schemers.  I mean, good Lord.  So I feel like some of this feels so uniquely American and weird because of that.  But yeah, you're right.  Anyone saying I'm going to put my money in crypto, that's just psychotic.  But it's not psychotic if six months ago you said it and you were walking away with an  extra 40,000 on $40.  So I sort of get it.  But I'm also like, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says blockchain solutions are often, I'm talking about Bruce Schneier here.  This is a wired opinion piece he wrote in 2019.  There's no good reason to trust blockchain technology.  He said blockchain solutions are often much worse than what they replace.  He says if the interesting kinds of blockchains include currency, a digital token, he says  there are private blockchains, but they're completely uninteresting.  They're just, he said, they're not anything new.  They're distributed depend only data structures with a list of individuals authorized to add  to it.  Consensus protocols have been studied in distributed systems for more than 60 years.  He says the only reason to operate one is to ride on the blockchain hype.  But the public blockchain, he says, is it actually good for anything?  Well, it's all a matter of trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There have been efforts to say that journalism should be there because it can't be erased  then.  But that's the other issue.  That's part of Anne's point about being distributed.  It's distributed in a way that there's stuff you might want to take down and you can't  then because it's too distributed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you remember...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Again, I think that's just knowing the trade-offs.  I mean, I feel like as human beings who talk about this, we do a terrible job in politics,  in media of explaining these things.  Like this is good for this thing, but it's not good for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  He says what blockchain does is shift trust in people, in institutions, in banks to technology.  You need to trust the crypto, the protocols, the software, the computers, the network,  and you need to trust them absolutely because they're often single points of failure.  We've seen this lately in a lot of ways.  When that trust turns out to be misplaced, there is no recourse.  If your Bitcoin exchange gets hacked, you lose all your money.  If your Bitcoin wallet gets hacked, you lose all your money.  If you forget your login credentials, you lose all your money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But if I also fall into Verizon and say that I am Leo Laporte, can you please send me a  text and verify that I am...  Well, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he does point out, and I think this is true, that these systems, these other non-blockchain  systems, there's been a lot of work to make them secure.  There's laws and regulations.  There's backstops that limit risks in the case of fraud.  There's anti-counterfeiting technologies.  There's internet security technologies.  And the institutions have a reputation to maintain.  So I think he makes...  There is no reputation to be maintained if the protection of the blockchain fails, which  it keeps doing time and time again.  You got to acknowledge that.  There's no recourse.  Look at Seth Green.  Bye bye, board ape stuff.  Bye bye.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But centralization too has problems.  Centralization means you're in the control of one Elon Musk or one Mark Zuckerberg.  Centralization means you can be controlled by the Chinese government.  There's no ideal here.  Jack Dorsey tweeted a few weeks ago, right before the announcement of the Musk efforts,  that centralized identity was a mistake and he felt responsible for it.  And that's the Doss Leithig-Blues guy.  And so we got to find middle grounds.  And I think Stacey's exactly right.  It depends on the use.  One is good for one, one is good for the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I still stand by NFTs being cool for artists to be able to get paid by people that enjoy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  their art.  I just think if you want to get paid, sell something.  Ask somebody to donate you money.  I don't know that you need the NFT.  I don't know what the NFT has to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't need the NFT.  But what I'm saying is it's nice knowing that there is another option out there beyond the  world of PayPal, beyond the world of hey, buy prints from antproit.com slash prints.  But unfortunately, there are scammers out there that sort of screwed all of that up.  And there's people out there that's making these 8-bit pieces of art and selling them  for a gazillion dollars for whatever reason that I've never really agreed with.  But then there's the other end of the spectrum of someone like Elise Swoaps, who's made some  just beautiful art using her phone.  And she's made a nice chunk of change off of it.  And she continues to just do it and get paid and not really be all scammy about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I would submit that if somebody donates to you through an NFT, that their  chief interest is not your art.  Their chief interest is speculation on your art.  And if they really loved your art, they would buy your art or they would donate to you with  a Patreon or something like that.  And you could do fine.  If the only way you're selling your artists through an NFT, then that's because people  think it's going to be valuable.  I mean, it's true of fine art as well.  You know, that's how.  Yeah, I mean, that's how the art market got famous and rich and died.  But anyway, I think that.  I think it's important discussion.  I honestly, these are people I respect to the nth degree, confirming my bias, which I've  you know, has changed.  My views on this have changed as I've watched this kind of fall apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But let's even say Bitcoin, though.  I mean, if you're if you're if you're in the United States and you got family back in  Colombia, if you had to go through Western Union, you lost a huge amount of money to  that. You could now transfer money from dollars to Bitcoin to pesos for next to  nothing. Not at all.  There are other uses.  All states, there are other uses.  Not at all. It costs you far more than Western Union.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does. The gas.  That's right. It does.  Now, I didn't in the beginning.  And and it's much slower.  It's unpredictably slow unless you pay a lot of money for the gas fees.  And finally, the risk of getting ripped off is very.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the risk of it of it being volatile while you're doing that even is bad.  All I'm saying is, well, and you also look at going just just all of the  alternative. It is worth exploring alternatives to the present fiat currency system.  I'm not against that.  I'm just not saying that a watching gravy makes all the meatloaf taste good.  Sorry, Stacey. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I would say that there any time you explore alternatives to the current status  quo, be it blockchain, be it some magical sticker based economy that, you know, a  bunch of seven year olds come up with.  If it catches on, the power the powers that be will seek to capitalize on it for  their own benefit. And because they have attention, they have money, they have  lobbying power, they will be able to do it.  And I mean, I I've never bought into this, like decentralization equals automatic  good and automatic to the power to the people.  And I think a lot of people did and they looked at it uncritically for things.  And that's why I appreciate this this letter.  I don't know. The only thing I think is good for us.  Automated contracts for like machine to machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's just. Yeah, there's uses of it.  It's a clever technology, but it doesn't it doesn't bring a determinism either way,  unless you're Madison Cawthorn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I don't want to do that story.  So somebody in the chat room is pointing out that lightning is a free way to do  Bitcoin. And that's true.  There is a lightning network and cash app is using it.  But that's called re centralizing.  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. And that's the problem.  You've got to make it easy for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that's not now.  That's one of the tradeoffs.  Right. Yeah.  Suddenly you are reliant on a third party.  So I think when Cory Doctorow was on, we were talking about  the idea of putting your car repair information on a block chain so that when  you bought a car, you would know exactly what had been through.  And he said, how is that any better than the system we have?  It requires whoever does the repairs to do it.  If they don't, it's still not there.  It's not an improvement.  It's it's just this fairy dust that we're waving on stuff to get people to go,  oh, that's new and cool and neat.  That must be better. It's not.  It's just not.  And it's and it's causing a lot of people to lose a lot of money.  So and by the way, this has nothing to do with my Bitcoin wallet.  I'm completely happy with my Bitcoin wallet. It's fine.  We know you don't care about that.  I know. And honestly, it would if I had unlocked it, it would be  had been sold long ago.  I just going to hold on to it.  Maybe if Bitcoin ever goes back to even more, I'll because I know I can unlock it.  It's just a matter of sitting down and doing it.  I'm not. It's not has to do with that.  I have not been. Are you sure?  Yes, absolutely.  I'm not. I've not been ripped off in any way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, do you do you object? Fine.  So cyber currency danger, danger.  Will Robinson, do you think that to Stacey's point that blockchain has  good uses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that remains to be seen.  Bruce Schneier doesn't.  And I think he's a lot smarter than I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but he has blinders just like everybody else.  I mean, there are things I think are a great idea or things I think are terrible  that still come to pass.  And I'm like, oh, well, that did work out as badly as I thought it might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you don't have the security risk that currency has.  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, currency has a security risk, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. If somebody if you go to the ATM and pull out a thousand dollars  and give it to somebody, it's gone.  There's no recourse. The bank will give it back to you.  There's no recourse. It's gone. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or you just drop it on the ground and someone finds it. Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Yeah, I don't want to do the.  That's fine. Well, just the fact that he's.  Of course he is. So is everybody.  They're all scammers. Right.  They're all scammers.  Let's talk about because you did actually a tweet about this this morning,  which I thought was good.  Let's talk about Star Wars. Yeah.  Obi Wan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, oh, that was yesterday.  Your Twitter's out of whack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I choose not to follow the latest tweets, but the best tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see. I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You are the cream rising to the top there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have risen to the top.  Thank you.  So what is the controversy?  It's this casting this.  What do they call it?  Racially blind casting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Moses Ingram, she's a key,  key actor in this new series, Kenobi.  She's a what do they call it?  A Jedi hunter, essentially.  And she's a black woman and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, she played Joe Lee in the Queen's Gambit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, she was in Queen's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She was she was the best friend from the orphanage who everybody loved.  Oh, I loved her in that.  I totally forgot about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I loved her, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. I was looking at her face and I'm like, that woman is familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So she's been getting a lot of backlash.  People sliding into her DMs.  Star Wars fans, quote Star Wars fans and just attacking her  and basically telling her how horrible she's been for that role.  And she shouldn't have been there.  No talent, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And racist this and racist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was more about her being a black person in a role that they thought should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  White should have been somebody else, a white person, you know.  So one of my friends, you know, she brought it up.  She says, you know, it's a typical equation of she's a woman  and she's a black woman and she's already got those chips stacked up against her.  Yep. But it's unfortunate, but she's killing this role.  I mean, she's absolutely crushing this role.  But I feel like Star Wars is then come back and said, you know what?  We are we are behind her.  And if you want to be a racist, you know, don't be a racist.  We got 20 million different species out there.  Something along those lines in those tweets.  And I appreciate the fact that they stood up for her  and publicly made a statement about, hey, we back her up.  And you and McGregor, he went online and did a video as well and said, hey,  I got her back, too.  So screw the rest of you racists, folks.  Star Wars tweeted, there are more than 20 million sentient

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  species in the Star Wars galaxy.  Don't choose to be a racist.  I think that's that's fair. That's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's unique because after what was the movie with  it's the only Star Wars movie I really thought was awesome.  Well, the one with Kelly Tran and John Boyega.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that was it. It was real.  You're going to get in trouble here, Stacey.  I know. I know.  I can't. But but Stacey, go to Stacey.  Not us, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They did not. Disney did not.  I mean, John, John Boyega, is that how to say his name?  I don't know.  And he actually said that he felt like Disney didn't stand up for him  against all this. So apparently Disney is like, oh, well, we can't do this  a third time. I mean, right. Right. Yeah.  And you know what?  That other Star Wars was amazing.  And then they like did the third episode of it.  They were like, yeah, we're going to take all that goodness  we threw out away because everybody complained so much.  Those old Star Wars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Where is Kelly?  Kelly Tran's gone.  They haven't done any more with her.  Or him. I can't remember his name.  Yeah, maybe she dies.  I don't know. I don't watch Star Wars that intently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Anyway, well, good for  good for them for standing up for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was part of my I need to step away from online.  I kind of got that feeling when I saw you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you like this hashtag Sweden gate  trending on Twitter right now.  It turns out Swedish people as a rule don't serve food to guests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I asked a friend of this and she told me that was totally true.  And I just was like,  I just like I'm trying to imagine the situation.  Well, it apparently some households in Sweden, when you would  I think it's mostly kids, I guess they'd be playing over at their friend's house  and the family would eat dinner, but they wouldn't invite the friend.  The friend would stay up in the playroom or somebody's room.  Oh, that's just rude.  They would eat and send it back.  Well, I asked my friend about this and she's like she grew up in Sweden.  And she's like, yeah, if you spend the night at someone's house,  like even in the morning for breakfast, like your friend would go down  and have like eggs or cereal or something.  And you would just be up in their room.  And I'm like, did you pack your own snack?  I mean, like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They as this is this is an article in the Independent  by Linda Johansson, she says, as a child growing up in Gothenburg,  I remember not really caring at all that I wasn't being fed.  I just kept playing and had a nice quiet time while the other family had their dinner.  Is because they didn't want to mess up my family's plans.  They figured, well, your family probably going to feed you dinner, so  you don't have to eat dinner with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just cultural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just cultural. I got to tell you.  You get the map. That's just weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that how they do it in the South Kakelaki?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've been in similar situations in my little black communities in  South Kakelaki, and the parents would literally come to the door.  Hey, y'all come eat.  Well, I don't know what your mom or your grandma is doing.  And so you just they don't want my mom.  My grandmother would fuss about being wasted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's fair, because we know your parents are going to feed you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, you know, go home or call your mother or call your grandmother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Right. And see, oh, there you go.  I like that. Well, yeah, we had that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. But you'd invite you.  You'd be like, you know, you come down and you'd be like, hey, mom,  can so and so stay for dinner?  And she'd be like, sure.  Or no, we don't have enough.  I mean, that was totally a legit thing to do.  But then you go up and you're like, all right, you got to go home for dinner.  Yeah. I didn't leave him sitting upstairs.  That's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I put the map.  They left me sitting outside a time or two with the baseball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually remember that. Yeah.  I didn't even grow up in Sweden.  All right. Where's the map? What line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The bottom of the bottom of other in the rundown  is somebody did a map about this as to what usually happens.  Oh, so all of Scandinavia, including Denmark and Iceland is no food for you.  Get your old lutefisk.  What somebody said on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So whereas so the red ones are very unlikely to give you food.  Sweden's in there.  The pink ones are unlikely to give you food.  The blue ones are usually.  Yes. But notice, it's the southern Europe where they're almost always, you know,  in Italy and Spain, they're going to make you eat.  They're going to make you.  I don't care if you've got dinner waiting for you.  You're eating now.  So I really have more to do with climate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't.  That's culture. It's culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I guess I just I can't imagine eating in front of someone and not offering them food.  That is just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Shoot. I just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I'm selfish, so I'm telling you, the warmer the climate,  the more likely you'll be fed.  So in Texas, you're going to be fed.  Yeah. In Canada, I'm not so sure.  What is it? Canadians.  We have a lot of Canadians, Canadians in the chat room, Canadians in club to it.  What happens when you when you were a kid and you went over and  you visited, would you would you get food?  Would you get fed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's probably a kindly worded debate.  Never happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so sorry, but we can't feed you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Wally Sirich explains on on Twitter.  And it's a link at the bottom of that story that in Norse culture,  hospitality, providing food, drink, lodging was a duty of higher status  individuals toward people of lower status.  So the act of receiving hospitality created an obligation or debt  on the part of the recipient who couldn't afford it.  My parenthetical.  So hospitality not only brought honor to the giver,  it had the potential to bring shame to the recipient.  Norse culture has progressed through the Middle Ages,  was incredibly personally violent.  There's that, too.  You took my loot fisc and didn't give me any.  Off with your head.  So people fought duels, violently extracted debts and squeezed renters.  All this from Wally Sirich on Twitter.  One of the challenges of the Protestant church in Scandinavia post 30 years war  was to create a culture that tamped down on personal violence,  because as somebody said to me some time ago, I read something that said,  you know, Sweden will ransacked all of Europe.  And today they're Sweden.  So people change.  So they tried to change the culture.  But the root of a lot of impersonal violence was a competition for status  and extraction of payment.  That's really interesting, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in a way, it would be implying that I am higher status than you  to invite you to eat.  I give you I give you food.  That's true, because I have. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  When I was growing up, I would have friends who like my parents tracked  who I ate, you know, because like as a kid, you don't necessarily know.  But they had a definite reciprocity thing that we owe somebody.  Other friends of mine. Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But like my friends who like I had a friend who was Filipino.  And God help us.  We could not go to that house without like  there was food all time.  It's climate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is another great tweet here from him.  The church, with the framing of early Protestant humanists,  began to promote the ideal of the free member of society,  owing no one and owed nothing.  If the culture could get rid of the interactions that caused friction,  comma, people could live more peaceful lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're proud and you owe you.  We're going to just you go have your dinner at your place, because  I you know, it's just it's cultural.  That's fine. It is cultural.  Now, meanwhile, Tim Hortons.  Tim Hortons, Canada was cool.  Well, they did get caught by Canadian watchdogs.  Tim Hortons app tracked people illegally, according to Canadian watchdogs.  The app would show where users lived, where they worked.  And the probe showed no legitimate  reason for the tracking.  The company was told today to shut off that capability after an investigation  by federal and provincial authorities.  Found that the two Timmy and two on the Tim Hortons app misled  many users to believe information would only be accessed when the app was in use.  Nope. As long as the device was on, the app was continually collecting  location data.  It the app used location data.  It generated an event every time users entered  or left a Tim Hortons competitor.  Whoa. A major  a major sports event or their home or workplace.  Timmy Timmy Timmy Timmy Timmy.  This was first came to light two years ago when a story by the Financial Post.  It took a while for the government, you know, the wheels to turn.  But Tim Hortons continued to collect, quote,  continue to collect vast amounts of location data for a year  after shelving plans to use it for targeted advertising.  So they weren't even going to use it for targeted advertising.  Tim Hortons, did they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, go on.  I was like, how did what did they say as to why they were doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say, oh, sorry, sorry.  We'll implement the recommendations in the report right away.  They included deleting any remaining location data, directing third  party providers to do the same, establishing and maintaining a privacy  management program or reporting back to the authorities with details on the measures  it has taken to comply with the recommendations.  We're so sorry.  Doughnuts for everybody.  We're sorry. Tim Bits for all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I was really disappointed when I went into Tim Hortons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was I thought it was going to be this like awesome experience.  It's like a Duncan.  It's a bad doughnut. Oh, yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just so.  Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you are you implying that Duncan is not great?  I don't get it's horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're bad. Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I still love Dunkin Donuts.  You do. And I love my regular.  I still I still love Dunkin Donuts, but I definitely hit up the local  homemade doughnut.  Yeah, we have some pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Please are way better.  Krispy Kreme way better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dunkin, Krispy Kreme, Krispy Kreme, Nama Southerner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no. You know what?  Only when it's a Trojan horse because Krispy Kreme looks great.  It's light. It's fluffy.  Smells great. You taste it. You eat it.  Your mouth goes, oh, my God, that's great.  And then it lands and explodes in your stomach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is it is a selfie bomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just one of them. 12 of them.  It's just so light.  You just shoveling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Do you agree with me?  You feel terrible almost instantly, right?  Almost instantly. I feel

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  if you only eat one or two, it's OK.  Now, I used to eat like six and then suddenly I'd be like, oh, man, sugar high.  What the hell?  But then then I'd be better.  And I'd like, oh, I shouldn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll always remember you, Stacey, as the woman who taught me what meat sweats meant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Please put that in my obituary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was I watched that. That was a great moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Well, if I if I get the honor of doing your eulogy,  I will in fact tell that story. I promise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, there's no there's no brisket in heaven.  There's none. All right.  Let me take a break.  I think I think timing wise is a good time to pause.  And then Jeff is going to tell me all the tick tock stories.  Sure. Including

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I put together a little lobster man.  Wow. I also put together a little  trio of stories about celebrating identity on the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I liked that. Sounds good.  That's still to come.  And we can't call it Fang anymore.  It's MANG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've mangled, mangled, mangled,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fang on us.  Well, it used to be Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google Fang.  But Facebook is changing its stock ticker to Metta.  All right. So now it's MANG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Surprise.  I don't know. Yeah.  What are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now that Cheryl's gone, it's all gone to hell.  Our show today brought to you by IT Pro TV.  If you are going to get an IT, you're going to quickly.  I mean, you I mean, you're watching our shows.  We know you're a techno, techno enthusiast.  You know your stuff.  You're probably the person and everybody around you asks for tech advice.  But if you want to get that job in IT, none of that's going to matter.  You're going to have to get those certs, the certifications  that tell your future employer you got the right stuff.  So almost invariably, when somebody wants to get into IT,  they find a school to learn this stuff or they buy books or whatever.  I'm just going to tell you the best IT training platform is IT Pro TV.  It really is.  It costs less than all those expensive books.  The training is so much better.  It's up to date.  Instead of sitting in a classroom, listening to somebody who hasn't,  you know, booted a hard drive in years, you're actually going to get  really, really good trainers who are experts in the business,  who are really good at explaining it, whose passion communicates.  They call them edutainers for a reason.  They make it fun.  The best possible IT training.  Plus, it's always up to date.  IT Pro TV has seven studios running all day, Monday through Friday,  recording new content so that you got to do that.  The tests change, the software changes.  There's always new material.  That's why you get the most up to date, best possible IT  training and certs with IT Pro TV.  And best of all, you could do it on your own schedule.  You could do it in little chunks if you want.  All the episodes are in 20 to 30 minute segments.  They have practice exams you can take before you take the test.  That's very helpful.  Virtual labs.  You don't even have to have a Windows server.  You just use your browser and set up a Windows server  and clients and all that in the browser.  And 5,800 of hours of on demand IT training.  It's always up to date.  Always up to date.  One reviewer said the most engaging hosts I've ever watched.  I highly recommend IT Pro TV, not only to IT professionals,  but to people who have an interest in IT, but don't know where to start.  Very educational and entertaining.  People like Ronnie Wong.  So great.  So fun.  Tim and Don, they're just great.  Don Pezet is a fantastic, enthusiastic, knowledgeable guy.  I love Adam.  They're all, they're also good.  Check out some of the newest courses.  CompTIA's A plus core one and two series.  A plus is often the first series, you know, the first cert you get.  And they have the best CompTIA training.  Their A plus core one and core two series are designed for professionals  who do the core technology, security, networking, virtualization.  And as you probably know, if you've tried to get a job or you have a job in IT,  that A plus cert is an industry standard for launching IT careers  in today's digital world.  There is no better way.  More entertaining, more accurate, more up to date, faster than doing it at IT Pro TV.  You learn about hardware, operating systems, networking, security, troubleshooting.  And you can take the test before you take the test.  So you'll know I got what it takes or I better study some more.  Coming up June 11th and 12th, their free project management weekend.  Head to the website to get free courses and more information on a different side of IT.  If you're already in IT, this is a great skill to have.  June 11th and 12th, free project management weekend.

No.  So Val Kilmer, as you know, who was in the original Top Gun,  is also in the middle.  He didn't even ask me. He knew the answer.  Yeah. Did you go see Top Gun?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, I had COVID the whole time it was out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it just came out.  But it was huge.  It broke huge.  Val Kilmer and an Iceman, of course, is in the new Top Gun.  And it turns out in the way they handle this,  because Kilmer had, I think, throat cancer, so he can't speak.  But he did have a line of dialogue in the sequel.  How did they do it?  AI.  AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But AI is bad, Mr. Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not this AI. This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a deep fake.  It's a deep... We don't know what's real now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Nantik is the company.  Movies used to be real.  They used a voice engine to teach the AI voice model  how to do an accurate impression of Val Kilmer.  The engine, unfortunately,  did about 10 times less data  than would have been given in a typical project.  That wasn't enough.  So they had to come up with better algorithms  that could produce a higher quality voice model  because there wasn't a lot of Val Kilmer  telling her to train it, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wasn't there going to be tons? He was in showbiz.  I was about to say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, he did.  I guess, like, think about when he was Jim Morrison for The Doors,  did he sound just like he sounded when he was Iceman?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plus, you know, he was only Iceman, you know, in the one movie.  You want to hear it?  You want to hear the synthesized voice?  That'd be weird for him.  I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ...we all have the capacity to be creative.  You missed it because you were talking.  We're all driven to share our deepest dreams and ideas with the world.  Well, that's pretty good.  That is really good.  When we think of the most talented, creative people,  they speak to us in a unique way.  A phrase we often hear is...  having a creative voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, if you didn't...  You know, if you saw that in the movie and you...  I don't think you'd know it was synthesized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  Well, you wouldn't expect it to be.  I mean, aren't you creeped out by the fact that after you're dead,  they could, like, recreate you?  I hope they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I creeped out.  Where do the royalty checks go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll buy the NFT of Leo's voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And, Mr. Laporte, I'm going to hate to tell you,  but you're coming back as Dev Nol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, there's a lot of video of me as a virtual character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll be better looking.  Better looking this time.  You may remember the NFT insider trading issue with OpenSea.  Department of Justice has charged an ex-OpenSea executive with insider trading.  That's the first time they've pursued insider trading with crypto.  Nate Chastain, the OpenSea staffer who quit after an insider trading scandal  in September, is now on the crosshairs of US authorities.  He was charged today with wire fraud and money laundering.  This, we had the story a couple of weeks ago.  Before the NFTs were offered to the public, he was buying them up  and then flipping them, dozens of NFTs, deciding which,  he got to decide which ones were featured on the website.  So he would make 200 to 500 percent.  Boom, just like that.  And of course, he hid his purchases using anonymous digital currency wallets  and anonymous OpenSea accounts.  Not anonymous enough, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Air-quote anonymous.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's your old saying though, right, sir?  Make sure you're not the last person holding the bag.  Just be the next to the last person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So OpenSea said it investigated once it found out about his actions,  asked him to resign.  His behaviour was a violation of employee policies.  He's actually currently working on a new NFT project called Oval.  He was arrested this morning in New York, so maybe that's going to be on hold.  If you are in France, do not call it le streaming.  If you're a streamer, you're not a streamer, le streamer.  And you are a streamer, you are en jouer en direct.  And e-sports is jeu vidéo de compétition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's not les sports?  Not les sports, le e-sport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you know, a computer is not a computer, it is l'ordinatier.  L'ordinatier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the changes were made in consultation with France's Ministry of Culture.  Do they still have...  Those people, they're high.  There was a name for the people who were responsible for keeping the French language pure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like the language.  Oh, it's an organization.  Yeah, it's like their literature college, but it's basically their language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if they were involved in this, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They had to be involved.  That's the only way it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they have a reasonable thing.  It's concerned that English terms could become a barrier to understanding for non-gamers.  Oh, l'académie française, that's what it's called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  France's language keepers, l'académie française, has also expressed concern  about English jargon in gaming.  So they were the ones who proposed the alternate French terms back in 2017.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is the language that gave us faire du jargon, faire du shopping.  Yeah, le weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Le T-shirt.  Yeah.  Le weekend.  I don't blame them.  They want to preserve it.  So for a while, they tried to stop Wi-Fi.  They tried to stop the word Wi-Fi, which by the way, the French pronounce Wi-Fi, which is not Wi-Fi.  I heard that a lot.  I heard that a lot.  Wi-Fi, yeah.  L'académie française...  It's Vifi.  They tried to get the French people to say,  l'accès sans fil à Internet.  L'accès sans fil à Internet.  Or Internet.  I don't know.  It didn't work.  So it doesn't always work.  But in this case, you are a joueur, joueur, animateur en direct

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and a jeu vidéo en noige for cloud gaming.  Noige in the cloud.  Video game in the cloud.  Jeu vidéo en noige.  Très bien.  Pépé le pieux.  We really enjoyed that.  Fromage au mollet de fromage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did we do this story?  No, I guess we did on Sunday.  You know Halsey.  Do you like Halsey?  I like Halsey.  I like her work.  Did we do this story last week, Jeff?  Sure.  No idea.  So she has a new record.  Does Jeff know who Halsey is?  Do you know who Halsey is?  You would like her music.  Kind of.  I'll play a little.  Listen.  Here's a little bit of her music.  So this is a TikTok that she posted.  I'm not going to play the whole thing because I don't want Halsey to get mad at me.  But she posted a TikTok.  Now, maybe this was a publicity stunt.  I don't know.  So she's playing the song.  And then you know how they on TikTok put the text over it.  Basically, she wrote, I have a song I love.  I want to release ASAP, but my record label won't let me.  I've been in this industry for eight years.  I've sold over 165 million records.  And my record company is saying I can't release it until they can fake a viral moment on TikTok.  Everything is marketing.  And they're doing this to basically every artist these days.  I just want to release music, man.  And I deserve better, TBH.  I'm tired.  In fact, after this, a lot of others, artists said, yeah, that's right.  Our labels say go viral on TikTok.  That's not a single.  Gavin DeGraw shared a parody version of his 2003 hit singing,  I don't want to be on TikTok, but my label told me I have to.  English songwriter FKA twigs said her label is not only making her create and post TikTok  videos, but they wanted her to post videos multiple times a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what the heck is Lizzo doing on TikTok?  A, because she's got like the song You Can't Escape, but B, Lizzo's always on TikTok.  Well, she responds to everything.  She likes it.  She just like, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She likes it.  And she's even got a TikTok dance.  So this article in TNW says Lizzo regularly shares memes, vlogs and recipe videos on TikTok  and heavily promoted her most recent release.  It's about damn time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Please don't do your head.  I can't do the head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can you do it?  Just let Lizzo do it.  No, no, I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I cannot.  And I'm not going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to be able to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can't.  Let's get it.  Actually, here's here's what you do for that.  You do.  It's about damn time.  It's about time.  That's actually the move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here we go. Ready?  Turn it up. Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's about damn time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.  Jeez. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody do it.  That damn.  It's about damn time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You go in a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In a one minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In one minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm Anita.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm Anita.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sinner.  Man, a woman.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Not man, a woman.  Man, a woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Man, a woman.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So pump me up.  So pump me up.  OK, tell me I'll be going.  Oh, gosh.  Pump me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pump me up.  Pump me up.  OK.  OK.  This is Bussy walking in my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is how you do the dance.  I love Lizzo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And by the way, I was waiting for you to do your God bless her

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because she's not wearing any makeup or anything.  She looks great. I just love her.  She's real.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, she's playing her.  I think her internet persona is close to who she is.  And she is created an authentic person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, what gets me with this story is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is that?  What?  I love her.  You're not going to do that?  You've got to end it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You kept going.  That was not right.  I love her.  I love her.  23 points.  She can play the flute, which I knew, but she's a very good flutist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see her at the Met Gala?  She has her flute.  She throws off her cape.  Play something.  She says, that's all you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Smart.  Smart.  You got to pay for this.  You got to pay for this.  You know, what I get about this story is there are artists that are in that position of saying  where the labels tell them they need to go viral on TikTok, but there's just as many  artists out there that sort of live in the whole democratization of creative arts where  they're going to TikTok first.  That's a good point.  And then the labels are coming to them after.  You know, it's like they have the leverage then.  I don't get why they want to just, why they won't just do this themselves and say, you  know what, I'm just going to build a bigger audience because maybe another label is going  to come to me because of my following, not saying I have to have a certain type of following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like this guy, the Maine Lobster Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is quite possibly the biggest lobster that we have ever caught.  The only reason we were able to catch it is because he has small claws.  At some point in his life, he lost his claws.  He grew back some new ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I thought he was going to sing or something, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, Jeff put this in.  He's a hundred year old lobster.  Don't eat it.  Throw it back in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That can't be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My father has very likely caught this lobster at one point in his life.  So has my grandfather.  What?  And possibly my great grandfather.  What?  If you want to get crazy, it's possible that my great, great grandfather caught that lobster  when he was a baby.  They've all fished the same area for years.  Well, that's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But your great, great grandfather, when he caught it, would have had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He could have been good eating then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, that's the explanation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could have been too small or too big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh my God, lobsters look so much like spiders and I cannot even look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway.  At the end, he gives it a fish and sends it on there.  He gives it a fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, he feeds it.  He says, here you go lobster.  I'm sorry I scared you and go have a fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's say someone rocks into your house, pulls you out at like, one point.  I know.  And totally traumatizes you.  And then gives you a fish.  Have fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, who cares?  It wouldn't happen in Sweden.  They wouldn't give you a fish.  They just throw you back.  Lobster, you're on your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just throw you back.  Don't move fish for you.  I thought someone else was cooking you food lobster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Go on.  Fish for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is nasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The joy of watching...  Oh, this is fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is fun.  This is another Jeff.  I'm warning you.  Yeah, it is.  The joy of watching a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  All right, I love this.  Through a Snapchat filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what he does is he's watching There Will Be Blood.  Great movie.  Is it Daniel Day-Lewis?  Who's in it?  Who's in it?  It is.  Yes, it's Daniel Day-Lewis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Barry, you know, you drink my milkshake.  I drink your milkshake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he decides to filter him through the googly eyes Snapchat filter.  It's not quite the same...  Let's turn on the sound here.  Get the full effect.  Say it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am a sinner.  I'm a sinner.  Say it louder.  I am a sinner.  I'm a sinner.  Louder, Daniel!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am a sinner.  I am a sinner.  I am sorry, Lord.  I'm sorry, Lord.  Oh, that's just creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is creepy.  There's other stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Go up or down.  This is the second one of the thread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What movie is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how do you do that?  There's some dirty words there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not going to play this sound.  I don't want to take it.  How do you do this?  You point your camera...  So it's a new filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The article below says this is a certain filter.  It's like a googly eye filter.  I don't know how he then watched the movie through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would have watched everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what's going to sell?  I've been wondering what the killer app for years, what's going to be the killer app for  virtual reality or augmented reality glasses.  Imagine your augmented reality glasses could make everybody you meet look like that.  As you're walking down the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Life will be either way more fun or way more creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  So what's the name of that filter?  It's the next line below.  It's called the...  I should have remembered that.  It looks like it.  Here's the good, here's the bad, the ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Eli Wallach and Clint Eastwood.  Maybe the best.  I don't know how to describe this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Beauty ecstasy of gold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, audio people.  We've got to put up a...  How do I do this filter?  Hold on.  What does it say there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me see here.  What's the name of the filter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's called the Shook.  Shook.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me see if I can cast this.  Oh, I found it.  Hey!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you TikTok and thank you Snapchat.  Thank you internet.  See, the bad guys want to shut this all down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis, I've been sharing to TikTok more often.  Have you noticed that?  Have you?  What do you put on there?  Just random...  The same stuff that I would sort of put on Instagram or YouTube.  I just put it on TikTok.  Once again, it means nothing to follow you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You and Salt Hank, I don't see...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all imaginary following.  You just have to search for them basically.  Oh, you're putting a lot of stuff up there.  A lot of stuff up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Were you singing a dancing ant?  That would be no.  Ant Bruett the musical.  Well, I've just been noticing some weird activity with Instagram.  So I said I'm going to start checking out TikTok to see if I get the same type of performance  because I'm looking at analytics, not that I'm a Salt Hank or anything.  But you know, I only have like a hundred or so followers on TikTok and I'll get 300, 400  different views on TikTok.  Oh, this is the miners one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you know, versus Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My stuff is barely getting seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody loves a dog.  I got 1200 views on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's your handle again?  It's...  Ant underscore.  Ant underscore.  Right.  Yes, sir.  There you are.  There you are.  Oh, I thought I already followed.  I didn't follow you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I follow you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.  But I've been playing with it just to see how it's going to pan out from an analytics  standpoint because it seems like Instagram, they're doing changes with how they're trying  to prioritize things.  So they want you to do more reels.  And then I saw that...  What's his name?  Masori?  Adam Masori.  Is that how you pronounce his last name?  Adam Masori.  Oh, Instagram guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The potential of having more vertical photographs show up on the regular feed versus it just  being inside of these stories.  So I've even changed how I put my images on there because I used to do them in a one to  one aspect ratio.  Now I do them in a four to five aspect ratio because they're a little bit longer just to  see how it performs there.  It's still weird because it seems like my reach is going down in Instagram, but my reach  is going up in TikTok.  Even though I have like 3,500 followers in Instagram versus a hundred followers in TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the fascinating thing about TikTok and it's the thing my son is always trying  to figure out and study.  He does A-B experiments.  He does all sorts of stuff to see what generates more traffic.  He tells me it's the likes, not the views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now I'm getting likes in TikTok.  My phone is always saying so-and-so like me.  Not that I'm getting more followers, but there's always a like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the likes are important.  I think he says that's a signal to TikTok.  And of course the ultimate goal is to get TikTok to promote it.  Then it shows up in the For You page.  Which is, see, who you follow doesn't seem to do anything, but For You page is critical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So state of tartars, 7.1 million views for Heng Jee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's 2.1 million followers now.  He's not posting a lot lately.  I don't know, maybe he got busy.  I don't know.  He went to New York.  He's probably talking to the agents and all that stuff.  I don't know.  He's got a book deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's too big for you now.  I don't even talk to him.  Good for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's like, who are you?  Good for him.  I have to get his agent on the line and say, can I speak to him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're the John Voight of TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon.  Little boy blue and the man the moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google Docs.  No, this is the change log.  Should I do a change log this week?  What do you think?  You didn't do a lot.  Always.  I didn't do it last week because it was so lame.  It was lame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No offense.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is lame a bad word?  Is lame a bad word?  Lame is a bad word.  Lame is technically.  It was so pathetic.  Can I say pathetic?  Amber Ruffin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, you can say that.  Amber Ruffin did a really good thing on words that she's like retiring.  This was like two years ago and it's a really good little bit.  I'm never going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If somebody calls themselves that, you shouldn't use it in a deprecating fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lame means that you have a limp.  You're halting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's derogatory.  I mean, when we use lame, we use it.  Not like you can say this horse is lame.  Because it really is.  Right.  Because you're describing someone who.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can say a person is lame because they're limping.  But if you use it as an insult, it's a problem.  Or use it as a negative.  It's a derogatory term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I understand that because you don't want to put down somebody who has a limp.  But honestly, this is lame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I mean, it's the change log is limping along.  It's limping along.  I mean, I think it's now right now you're insulting Jason Howell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the problem.  I think it's inappropriate.  You are not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a metaphor.  It's a metaphor.  It's not trying to put somebody down.  It's just a metaphor.  I understand.  I won't use it.  But I do.  I worry that at some point we're going to not have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I really think you're reaching here because.  OK, so this one is limping along.  You could just say it's limping along.  But when you say lame like that, you are saying something derogatory about a change  log. You're not saying that the change log can't work.  Once you move to the metaphorical space, you're really on thin ice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can we see that facial expression again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I see that on the filter, please?  That's where I really want to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm sorry. It's true.  No, it's good.  I'm trying to figure that out.  This is a trash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's OK to say this is a trash change log.  Is it OK to say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you could say it's a trash change log.  But you can't say it's trailer trash change log.  No, don't say that, sir.  That would then be insulting to trailer trash.  Yes.  If there's a person associated with the insult, then you can't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's pretty much it.  That makes sense.  OK. That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK.  I am glad I'm an old man because I can get away with this.  They just say, OK, boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This change log is compost.  It's compost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just say this is a terrible change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But does he even know yet what terrible means?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does terrible mean?  Literally, terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is a dull change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dull is so boring.  Dull is a dull adjective.  Dull.  So but I'm going to work harder to be a better writer.  And I'm going to come up with a good word.  This change log is lambent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're talking about last week's change log.  Do you know that this week's is bad?  No, I haven't even looked at it.  That's the thing.  You're being triply unfair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I was I was saying something nice about it.  It's lambent. I now can't see your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a refulgent.  It's going to pop out and a weird mouth.  It's ruined it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason says, as long as there is a change like section in the document,  I will continue to fill it with terrible news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Jason.  Thank you, Jason.  We can make fun of them about me.  No, we can't do anything to it.  Are we going to play the trumpets or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead. Play the trumpets. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Number one oh nine.  No, this is a big story, actually.  Yeah, actually.  So again, with the messaging, Google is changing things up.  And the brandy.  Wrong one, John. This one.  What the hell's going on?  When did I lose control?  This one in front of me.  Google is combining Meet and Duo into a single app.  They're going to call it Deet or is it Moo-O?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's even dumber than that.  They're going to call it Meet, but it's actually built on Duo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is Duo.  So basically, they're changing the name.  Yeah, exactly.  By the way, I love your nails.  The nails are great.  Yeah, those are cool.  Is that something you did while you were in isolation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this is actually the day before I tested positive.  It's so old and you can tell if you see how much my nails have grown out.  But I just kind of got lazy.  I didn't have nail polish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I like that color.  It's kind of a light blue.  It's beautiful. Yeah, it's a cool blue.  Google is.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty soon there will only be Google Meet.  But it will be Duo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Does this mean I have to invite everybody onto Duo again?  Because, you know, it's hard to convince people in the first place.  And they just go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Duo, which is like FaceTime, right?  It's like it's for video calls.  I use it with my daughter because she's an Android user.  It's great. In fact, it has that nice feature where you knock.  So when you call somebody, if you want, it will show your video.  So the person can see without answering, I can see that you're calling.  So you can kind of, you know, talk to me, please.  I beg of you, that kind of thing.  It's so me, which is their zoom. Right.  I don't know if they're going to add zoom like or meet like features into Duo.  It's not clear.  It's just it's very it's as usual.  So Google, it is so so Google.  Google is going to.  This is from The Verge.  As the two services become one, Google is leaning on Duo's mobile app  as the default.  Pretty soon, the Duo app will get an update  that brings an onslaught of meat features into the platform.  Later this year, the Duo app will be renamed Google Meat.  The current meat app will be called Meat Original.  And then there's Google Talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is this a nice way of saying they're killing Duo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they're killing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Killing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just like the only thing I use on a regular basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We use it. But but you can continue to use meat and it and it'll have some.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Makes no sense. The Duo mobile app.  According to Dave Citron, the director of product for Google's video products,  the Duo mobile app had a lot of sophistication, especially.  Yeah, he's going to explain this,  especially under the hood, especially in emerging markets  where network connectivity was sparse or highly available variable on the web.  It's different meat is much more developed web.  So it forms the base of the new combined system.  But in both cases, the idea is 100 percent of the functionality  combined forces and no users left behind.  That's the the the line today anyway.  What is wrong with these guys?  OK.  It feels like every time there's a new manager, they they they put their mark on it  and they change it. And then then a year later, it's another thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's canine editing.  You lift your leg and this is one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I smell you're like that canine editing.  I know what you're saying.  This is one to try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Are we insulting dogs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the Google change log leg lift edition.  What did you what did you ask?  You said something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I'm saying shouldn't Pachai step in?  I mean, this is the type of stuff that a CEO should sort of reign in.  And you're like, look, we need to get our crap together.  Yeah. Leadership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Clearly, there is none. Yeah.  And this is Mike Elgin's contention is that Pachai is not a very good leader.  And I have to say, I think so. Right.  Google Docs is getting now you can do this one.  A big upgrade in formatting.  You could change multiple blocks of text at once.  Oh, this is pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you have a big upgrade, Leo, it's not just an upgrade.  It's a big upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see. Here's Project Blackbriar.  So you have these two blocks, Project Overview and Market Trends.  And you want to change the bold on both.  So you can select both and change, change them both to bold.  And they both get changed, even though they're discontinuous,  discontinuous blocks of text.  So you hold the command or control key.  Holding it down, select the other bits.  You kind of understand how to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's that's always been a way to get in all of those word power users hyped up.  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe I could use that. So yeah, I could too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you have the paintbrush, you know,  what you could do is get one of those exactly as you want it.  Here he is changing all the fonts and everything.  And then really ugly, making it so ugly and then selecting all the other ones  and making them the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just it's just a formatting.  Isn't that the format payment in Word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Right. Very similar.  Google says the feature will gradually roll out to everybody's accounts  over the next 15 days.  So look for it in a Google doc near you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, can I can I can I just interrupt for one second here?  Because it's what I do.  So I just had to send out invitations to an event.  I hope to have COVID willing at the end of the month.  And it's set up 40 emails because of my dear beloved Chromebook.  And I could save up to five things, separate things,  and then insert them, whichever one I wanted.  Right. That Chromebook feature that came out a couple of years ago. Yeah.  It was it was heavenly.  I saved the to do I saved the names.  I saved the subject line.  I saved the body of the email.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  It's wonderful.  It's possible because you have Chromebook.  I just want to say that I just haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good. Very. That's a power user.  What's a Chromebook? What is that?  YouTube for Android and iOS  and can now connect to your TV  for easy commenting and sharing.  I have no idea what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Great. This is exactly what we need in the world.  Easier commenting and sharing on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, fine. I don't know what from my television and from your TV.  I guess that's the idea, right?  That's it. Yes.  By the way, Google has launched a new app in the app store at iOS.  Google TV has is a is a new app, the Google TV app.  Google iPhone users can get recommendations from across streaming apps.  A watchlist for the discoveries, a for you tab with watch lists  from their favorite stars on the go content library,  the ability to rate movies and shows all the latest info, their favorite content,  as well as the option to use their phone as their remote for Google TVs and other.  Android TV devices.  The only thing you can't do is actually watch any of these shows.  I don't know. Can you?  They don't mention that.  This kind of replaces Google Play movies and TV, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really built on duo.  I don't know. Yes.  And Google Play movies, which is dead because it's now YouTube movies.  We're going to build it on the Google Play with some Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you had the Google Play movies and TV app on iOS  and you didn't delete it when they, you know, deprecated it,  it will turn into the new Google TV app.  I was remiss.  I should have downloaded this on iOS before  the show, and I forgot I meant to.  I wanted to bring an Apple product to the show.  I do as well as a Pixel 6. I got both.  OK. OK. Don't worry.  All right. Just relax.  It's funny because it's things I've already downloaded this.  You know how you get the like you already downloaded.  It's not a new one.  So I don't maybe that's because I had play movies and TVs before.  That's interesting.  Search across streaming.  But I want to check this because my question is, can I play something?  But maybe I don't know.  Welcome to Google TV.  You can tell them what you're subscribed to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Huh? Do we care? No.  It's change lock. I care. I care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems like it's kind of silly if all you can do is search for stuff.  I see Stacey's head going down.  So let me let me let me watch something.  Let me move along.  Yeah. Oh, but when you say watch now, it then opens up the other app or the web.  So it is just really kind of a search thing.  All right. This is for you, Jeff.  You better enjoy it.  Chrome OS 102 is rolling out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you bought the wrong cable, you idiot.  Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's actually what it does.  That's fantastic.  It'll alert you when USB-C cables don't support a display or, quote,  isn't performing ideally for your laptop.  Or if it doesn't support USB for Thunderbolt 3 standards,  if that your Chromebook does, etc, etc.  So this is great.  This is thank you, Benson Leung, who is the guy who remember this was reviewing the USB  cables. He was the USB cup on Amazon.  He was saying this one doesn't work. This one does.  He is a viewer.  He is in our Twitter social Mastodon instance.  And I thank you very much.  This is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Glenn Fleischmann is an expert in USB as well.  Our new friend. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Benson says all USB-C cables, even those without logos.  And that's the big problem.  They're supposed to put logos on there, but they never do identify themselves to the computer  precisely using PD.  My team reads that in from now.  We eliminate a silent failure when the user uses a USB 2.0 cable with a DP Docker monitor.  We give you a warning.  Thank you, Benson.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was surprised somebody didn't come up with a hardware device so you could test your USB  cable. Well, you have one now.  It's called a Chromebook.  Or. Yeah.  I don't see another reason.  Another reason to get a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will this OK.  So will Chrome OS 102 probably won't be on.  Will it be on all Chromebooks?  Have you updated yet?  It's updating right now.  Good.  It's very exciting. That's nice.  Double tapping on a zip will.  Now add a track extract all option in the menu.  That's kind of what happens on a desktop.  You know, normal computer.  Good. Good.  This is good.  Chrome OS 102.  Thank you.  See what's new.  And that's the Google change.  See, that wasn't anything.  That was refulgent.  It was a refulgent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good Lord.  It was a refulgent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Webster's is taking it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got this.  The source is open and I'm not afraid to use it.  Dot dash Meredith targeting print investments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is interesting, as you know,  Dot Dash Meredith, also much of Time Inc. is there,  killed my baby, entertainment weekly in print,  along with Eating Well and other magazines in print.  And now and there was a report two weeks ago,  I don't think we mentioned on the show,  that People magazine might actually go out of print.  We did mention that on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was a big story.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They lowered the circulation from three and a half,  three point two million to two point eight million,  which is amazing.  So now what they're saying is,  yeah, you know, this mass stuff, these big print stuff,  yeah, we're not so interested in that,  but little tiny niche stuff in print works.  So to me, it marks once again,  the end of the era of mass media.  Is the print, it doesn't support, you know,  you gotta bribe people with premiums  and all kinds of stuff.  You gotta subscribe to a magazine  just so you get advertising you can't get anymore.  That market is gone.  But, witness this company,  enthusiast stuff, they're saying,  slow works in print.  So Leo, I think you should come up with the Twit magazine,  is what this says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's interesting.  You can do it on a flip board.  I think they mean putting Harry Styles  on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens is what they mean.  That's what they're really saying.  This is an Axios story by Sarah Fisher.  Thank you, Sarah.  There is a typo, Sarah,  because it says the company has several core print titles,  which it does not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're immature, we giggle at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're actually, well,  and your spell checker would not actually say  tittle is bad is not a word,  because it is, it's a jot and a tittle.  People, Better Homes and Gardens,  real simple food and wine.  It's a Bible thing, you just wouldn't understand.  Travel and leisure, all recipes,  magnolia and southern living are core print titles for.  Is the name of the company Dot-Dash, Mary?  Yes, it is, yes.  What's with the Dot-Dash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the successor to all the stuff  that Barry Diller put together.  And he rebrand stuff like Google does.  And he named, it's all content factories,  and he named it Dot-Dash.  It includes college humor, I think, still.  I forget what else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So one of the things Dot-Dash put out of business  was Brides in 2019,  but now they're thinking of bringing it back,  because that is, I guess.  Which I used to work on.  Really?  Oh yeah, you should have seen me in my gowns.  What did you write?  Yes.  Five pieces, every trousseau absolutely must have.  So they're gonna add small pieces of print  not economically relevant  to some of our other print brands, according to somebody.  This is interesting.  They're just basically trying to save the magazine business.  But when they put Harry Styles  on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens,  which does not compute, really.  What is normally on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens?  A home or a garden.  Fruit.  Cakes.  Cakes.  Houses.  Houses, yeah, not-  I was gonna say it's normally houses.  Not rock stars.  Or ranches.  Or something.  Porches.  The company took a big gamble last month  by putting Harry Styles on the cover  of Better Homes and Gardens, but it paid off.  The first day of the Harry Styles issue,  we did not put a link of how to buy the magazine  online anywhere, and we sold 15,000 copies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, we've always known that famous people  sell magazine covers.  I mean, that's not new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  B, H, and G, which is how I called the title,  used to have seven million subscribers.  It's now four million.  Used to back when they bought it.  Well, part of this, too,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is you're getting rid of junk circulation.  Some circulation's very expensive,  and it was worth it when you had the ads,  but when the ads go down, it's not worth it  to support the junk circulation anymore.  So they've got all kinds of brands.  They have Eatin' Well, Food and Wine,  All Recipes.  The more niche, it's funny,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because that's exactly what Ziff Davis did  when they got into the computer magazines.  They went more, left some of the mainstream titles behind  and went more narrow.  Speaking of Harry Styles, the Jonas Brothers  are backing a new subscription media biz for celebs.  Text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Why does that have to do with Harry Styles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  He's kind of-  Celebrity.  Famous person.  Who, oh, okay, so I'm like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  they're not related.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was Harry Styles in?  Something boring right now.  The Eternals?  He was interviewed by Howard Stern.  He was in a band.  Yeah.  I don't understand.  The Harry Styles thing is kind of beyond me,  but it's definitely-  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Was he in a band?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think he's his own.  No, he went on the X Factor.  Oh.  So he's just his own.  He's just his own thing.  No, he was in One Direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I thought.  One Direction.  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One Direction.  Ooh.  One Direction, I remember them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, Harry has nothing to do with this story.  The Jonas Brothers, which I don't,  you know what it is?  In my mind, the Jonas Brothers and One Direction  and BTS and-  Things You're 204.  All these boy bands are kind of similar,  basically, in my mind.  Same thing to you, right?  Yeah, they're all the same to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wasn't the Jonas Brothers,  weren't they much earlier than One Direction, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, maybe, I don't know.  I don't know the chronology.  Do we care?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I care, yes.  They sell magazines, Jeff.  You should give a damn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the Jonas Brothers are launching  a new subscription media company called Scriber  that allows celebrities to charge their biggest fans  for exclusive contents via text messages.  Would you subscribe?  Who's your heart's love?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh my God, it's like cameo with words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With text messages.  And because it's text messages, they don't need an app.  They don't have to go in the app store.  They don't have to pay 30% to Google or Apple.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My old employer, Advance, did a company like this,  and they used, for example, in Cleveland,  where you could get exclusive text to you  from the sports columnist inside stuff  as the game is going on, things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They estimate that the super fans represent  about one to five percent of the total celebrities fan base.  So it's the top one percent of your fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll find every way we possibly can  to get money out of them.  But the Jonas Brothers, as an example,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have 50 million Instagram followers.  If just one percent subscribed,  that'd be $30 million a year for the Jonas Brothers, right?  So interesting, users can subscribe by texting  go to a phone number provided by the celebrity  on social media, unsubscribe by texting stop or cancel.  You could set up recurring payments  via Apple Pay or credit card.  You'll get exclusive material, behind the scenes videos.  I think this is gonna be very successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's kind of like a newsletter.  So Leo, you're gonna start a text subscription service  and a magazine. I should do this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I should do this.  I think Ed could seriously super serve his fans that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and it follows in a trend  because Twitter's got the super follows, right?  And TikTok has subscription support.  Instagram's doing subscriptions.  So kind of, this is kind of the trend.  You know, we were a little ahead of that with Club Twitter.  We said, you know, we think our super fans,  and it is about 1% maybe, I don't know,  would pay seven bucks.  And we thought initially that was the big,  come on with no ads, but really it is about the community  and about getting the children to talk to the people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and have a side conversation, things like that.  So I guess that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A story I want to hear Stacey's take on  is the Roomba operating system.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You killed Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You killed her.  Oh no, I feel so bad.  I think she inhaled a bee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why'd you have to bring that up?  I'm sorry, Stacey.  I won't say it again.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm very excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm so excited.  I can't breathe.  Oh my God.  I'm not making fun of you.  I'm actually worried.  Are you okay?  But that's why I just might caution that your go-to reaction,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which is maybe dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is true.  Do not wear beads.  Make sure your earrings are well attached.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can't breathe in very deeply still.  Oh, I see.  So whenever I try to breathe in deeply, I end up not being able to.  And then my body's like, crap, we can't breathe.  Anyway, roombo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Stacey.  That's good.  And we don't even laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have something.  Now is this different?  I mean, of course it was always running software and an operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is their new robot operating system.  By the way, we're going to have, oh, it's not robot operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  iRobotOS they call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  iRobot.  Yeah, because there's actually a robot operating system that's an open source robotics, like  industrial robotics OS.  That's pretty cool.  And then Apple's going to launch their reality OS.  We're going to have a lot of our OS's, not our OUS's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's going to be confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But roombo and there iRobot operating system is awesome because I think it is going to  do what I actually wrote about it just a couple of weeks ago.  I was so pissed off because our smart home is just these like disparate pieces.  And we get like Amazon coming in here with Astro.  They're a little robot thing.  But I'm like, are you, do you have an Astro?  No, I don't have an Astro.  If I had an Astro, I would totally show you guys.  Oh man.  Yeah.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you going to get an Astro?  Are you interested?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I mean, it doesn't, it doesn't have hands.  It doesn't work.  It doesn't do nothing.  It doesn't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unlike the iRobot, which you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I argue that your smart home is the robot.  And this actually, the software is what Roomba is trying to do is picture its little vacuum  cleaner as part of this like property of other items in the home.  And it's got, they mentioned it's air purifier could be part of this.  But once you have matter and Roomba is participating in it, you could actually pull in data about  all the other devices plus their camera.  And then if you actually have an OS that makes those work together and it would probably  be very privacy preserving because Roomba has been focused on that in ways that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they got in trouble because they were mapping people's houses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay.  So they didn't, they got in trouble because people thought they were mapping people's  houses and giving that data to Google.  But that's not actually what they were doing.  They kept it on the Roomba.  They kept it locally.  Okay.  Yes.  So people, they mapped your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have to.  That's part of the deal.  Was that a moral panic per chance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh my God.  It was inaccurate.  I didn't have it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It happens.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Anyway, so I'm really excited about this, as you can tell by me, like not being able  to breathe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can talk to it through Echo or Google assistant or Siri.  You could say clean the living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you could do that today.  So what this, this is the next level of that is kind of this next layer of context and  integration is what they're working on today.  They have like the beginnings of that as part of, I think they call it their genius  OS is what it is.  And it does things already.  Like my Roomba will tell me it'll be like, Hey, yo, I see that your kitchen counter area  has lots of crumbs.  Do you want to write over here by the kitchen counter?  Do you want me to create a special cleaning spot for that?  And I'm like, Holy cow.  Yes, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you.  Oh, and you could clean up every morning after breakfast or something like that.  It would be smart enough to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, I have a dog, so it's not an issue, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they also say that you can during pet shedding season, which is right about now,  you can have the Roomba do extra cleaning where the pet hangs out.  So my only complaint, we've had many Roombas.  They don't do a very good job.  Are they doing a better job now?  Do you use Roomba?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, we, I mean, okay.  You still have to.  I actually talk a lot about this on my show.  Here's my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You still have to vacuum, right?  It doesn't eliminate the need to vacuum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't have to vacuum my hard floors.  I do have to, I do vacuum my carpeted floors once a week.  Actually, I don't, my husband does.  Okay.  Actually, and he may not vacuum all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that because the Roomba does not do get them?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, you just want a deeper clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  But if you.  It's not strong enough.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  That was my question.  Yeah.  I mean, it picks up lots of stuff.  It picks up a lot of pet hair and the pet hair, it doesn't pick up.  It kind of creates into these little balls that like hang out and then you're just like,  oh, there's a pet hairball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and the beauty of this is the Roomba will actually drive around animals like in  this video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, my dog and the Roomba get along just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The dog is apparently getting a back scratch from the Roomba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going right around, that went around the nose.  That's going down the legs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the dog's enjoying it.  Is it going to do a tummy rub?  Tubby rub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's trying to go in there.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He must have trained his dog so well.  I appreciate it.  Oh, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you.  That was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was good for me.  Was it good for you?  That's good.  So maybe we'll get a Roomba.  I don't know.  And she used as evidence that the Roomba worked, she would say, well, look, look at all this  stuff it picked up.  I mean, it's working.  But I noticed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it does pick up a lot of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But we still have the vacuum.  We have a lot of carpets and area rugs and stuff.  And then I told the story before the Roomba would get stuck every night.  Do you do your Roomba at night or do you do it?  Because you're not supposed to do it when people are around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The hardest part about all of us working from home basically is when do you run the Roomba?  So we usually the way we don't schedule, we just, my Roomba's name is Terrence.  So I'll just say, hey, Google, tell Terrence to vacuum the master bedroom.  Oh, Terrence is about to do it.  Terrence.  Sorry.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Terrence is running.  All right.  There you go, boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, no.  Now my phone.  Hold on.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  Sorry.  This is life with Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and another famous problem with the Roomba is that it would forgive me, but that  I'm trying not to do that.  It doesn't do that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It has now since learned.  Oh, good.  Okay.  I mean, that's the beauty of these learning systems, the software update.  I love my Roomba.  So I mean, we use it every day and all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $850 for the new one, the J7 Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh yeah, but it comes with the thing.  It comes with the sucker upper.  The thing, you know?  It has the thing.  How could you not have the thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What sucker upper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See that big thing that's attached to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you don't need to empty it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh.  It sounds like a jet engine going off.  Yeah, but you only empty that once every two months.  So basically we just have this vacuum and our dog sleeps under our bed and you can't  vacuum under the bed really.  So all that hair gets picked up.  We vacuum once or twice a day.  Even the Pacific Northwest, our laundry room is just this constant source of like, imagine  your house the day after Christmas or the day after you take your Christmas tree out.  There's just pine needles and mud everywhere.  It takes care of all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that was a big problem.  In fact, that killed our Dyson because the piney needles got all glued together in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had to go, yeah, really clean it out.  So should we get a new Roomba?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I'm the one who kicked the Roomba out.  I feel bad.  Maybe we should get a Roomba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, if you have, I mean, what kind of carpet?  We have Berber carpets.  So if you have really long hair, Shaggy carpet, maybe it wouldn't work.  Yeah, the bedroom's really good.  Yeah, it works really well in the Berbers.  You need new carpet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought Shag carpet went out about 1978, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got it.  When it went out, I got it.  Not in the La Porte house.  Yeah, I got it.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently, The Verge has a review that it doesn't do a great job avoiding poop.  And I'll tell you why that's a big deal.  If it doesn't avoid it.  Do you really want to share it out?  It's problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just a mess.  It is quite problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that is a problem.  Yeah.  That was also part of my vacation time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't have a huge issue with that.  I mean, we have cats, but they don't go in the house.  So I guess it's okay.  Are there other better robots than the iRobot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There are plenty of robot vacuum cleaners.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, like Evax has a cheap one.  Wyze even came out with one.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I saw the one for Wyze and when it was sent to the email, the first thing I thought was,  well, anybody trust me because of all of the...  Oh, Lisa just came in and said, never again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I drove it over in the garage when I left one day.  I don't want a robot.  I put it under your wheel, but you didn't drive over it.  You smart enough to catch it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You tried to get her to murder your Roomba?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Roomba, I've told this story.  Haven't I told this story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Roomba, we ran it at night and it would get caught every night.  There's one side board that was just high enough for the Roomba to kind of get under  it but not and then it would go boom, boom, boom, boom.  Every night I'd hear, because it makes music when it starts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It gets caught in an endless loop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd pick it up and I'd put it back on its little charger and the next night at 3 a.m.,  same thing.  Eventually, instead of putting it on its charger, I'd pick it up and put it under Lisa's  tire.  But she...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sir, that's just flat out evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She didn't actually drive over it, I don't think.  She thinks she did, maybe she did.  I don't know.  It disappeared after that.  That's evil.  Those are expensive, too.  That was like 900 bucks.  Spoken like a Corleone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I took that Roomba and I put it under the tires.  That Roomba now sleeps with the fishes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right.  Is there any of these other...  I like the idea of that tech.  I just want one of those things to actually have legit suction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  Well, don't tell Queen Pruitt about this.  This is the 10-minute robot manicure.  You put your fingers in.  Oh, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry, honey.  You've been replaced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the sore subject right there, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to go to a Target in Minnesota, so it's not yet a threat.  Ten minutes for $10.  You pick one of the 25 colors offered.  You put your fingers in the machine one by one.  The machine scans the nail, paints it, starting around the edges, working to the center, applies  two coats at once, and it works.  Oh, no.  It's got two nozzles or something.  I don't know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the world's first...  You know, the benefit of having a Queen Pruitt manicure is you get to see her smiling face  and you get to...  I know, and you could talk.  And massage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was about to say you get to talk to Queen Pruitt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about that Harry Styles and all that stuff.  So yeah, this is from a company called Clockwork, and it paints your nails right in there.  I don't know.  Wow.  It seems like I could do...  That's just a nail painting.  Nail polish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like your finger is trapped and you can't get it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eesh, I know.  Pandemic friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is not an episode of Saw, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I've done the changelog.  I think we almost killed Stacey.  I think it's time to do the final ad.  Get your picks a little bit.  I don't think there's much more we can do here today.  Our show today brought to you by New Relic.  If you're a software engineer, you've been there 9 p.m., midnight maybe, you're unwinding,  you're relaxing, maybe you're even fast asleep then your phone goes off.  There's an alert, something's broken, and you're going, oh no, was it that commit I  pushed right before bed?  Is the server down?  Is the cloud down?  Your mind's already racing.  What could go wrong?  Back end, front end, global server, network, cloud provider, slow running queries.  You've got the whole team scrambling from tool to tool, messaging person after person  to find and fix the issue.  You've been through this.  You know.  And according to New Relic, only about half of all organizations in the world are actually  trying to do something about this.  They're implementing observability is what you call it for the networks and systems,  which give you a view, single pane of glass, and you can see the whole thing.  Single pane of glass view into your whole operation.  So know where the problem is so you can fix it fast.  The report showed maintaining network observability is a big issue for companies  around the world.  And if you're Epic or GitHub or Atlassian or Cloudflare, you are turning to New Relic.  New Relic, 16 different monitoring products you probably get separately,  but they're all in one, which makes it great because you can just use one stack  and get all the information you need.  Things like application monitoring, APM, unified monitoring for your apps and your microservices.  Or if you use Kubernetes, you'll love Pixi, instant Kubernetes observability.  You get not just tracing, but distributed tracing.  You can see all your traces without management headaches.  You could find and fix issues fast.  You get network performance monitoring that goes right through the silos and all the way around.  A system wide correlated view.  So you'll know exactly where performance issues start.  This is exactly the tool you need to find the problem, fix it fast and get back in bed  before the boss even hears about it.  More importantly, you can pinpoint issues down to the line of code.  So you know exactly why the problem happened.  You can even fix the code and resolve it for good.  That's why dev and ops teams at DoorDash and GitHub and Epic Games  and more than 14,000 other companies use New Relic to debug and improve their software.  Whether you run a cloud native startup or a Fortune 500 company,  it'll take you just five minutes to set up New Relic in your environment.  And here's the best part.  You get access to the entire platform, all 16 monitoring tools  and 100 gigabytes of data every month, free.  Forever!  You don't even have to give them a credit card.  Look, that next middle of the night call is just waiting to happen.  Get New Relic before it does.  New Relic dot com slash twig.  Get the whole New Relic platform.  100 gigabytes of data free per month forever.  No credit card required.  Only buy what you need when you need it.  Otherwise free forever.  N-E-W-R-E-L-I-C dot com slash twig.  New Relic dot com slash twig.  You just have to have it.  You need it.  You gotta have it.  New Relic.  And since you don't have to give them a credit card, just install it.  Don't even tell the boss.  Just install it.  Just do it.  Do it.  You know you want to do it.  Stacey, it's been so long since we've had your thing of the week.  What do you got for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  COVID-19.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I got COVID-19.  No, no.  I was like, oh, I have many gadgets sitting here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to give us a thing.  But what are some of the things you're looking at, you're working on, you're preparing for  the future?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can tell you, the Stacey, the thing that I have been recently watching is...  Oh, that's good.  ...Bo Burnham's Inside.  He just put out the outtakes just a couple days ago, and I really enjoyed those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who is Bo Burnham?  He is a comedian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey's side eye there.  Really?  No, I'm like, oh, are you really asking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He plays the piano.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He does Netflix comedy specials and like that.  But this video is behind the scenes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it's the out...  There's a couple of outtakes that are funny.  They're all outtakes, so they're not...  Only a few of them are very polished.  But a lot of it is just a creative process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Had you seen Inside before?  Oh my God, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So as a person who makes content for people on the internet in somewhat of a void, because  I'm my own person, right?  And as someone who is also definitely depressed, when I watched Inside, I was like, oh my God,  this guy is speaking to me.  Well, normally you hide this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My mother always said, if somebody's a really good baker, it's because they put so many  cakes in the trash.  They only show you their best stuff.  So normally, and I know exactly what you're talking about, Stacey, you'll watch a talented  performer and you think, I can't ever do that.  They're perfect.  But you see that, especially in the way...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I feel like a lot of us probably could identify with this.  And you think about like Anthony Bourdain, you think about Kate Spade.  There's a huge number of highly successful on the outside people who I think experience  a lot of self-doubt as part of their creative process.  And it wears on them.  So I liked the parts where he's kind of, you see him trying to struggle to make something.  It felt real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, and he did start on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He was one of the first viral YouTubers.  He's been with a lot of people in like 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you probably would say watch the Netflix special first inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  If you haven't watched it, I mean, I feel like if you haven't watched the Netflix special,  it's excellent for anybody who spends a lot of time on the internet.  So, and then it's, it's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got to watch this.  I tried to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Have you never seen it?  No.  I tried.  I mean, the lighting and the camera work is awesome.  Like really creative.  And he did it all himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's not, it's not a standup special inside.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I didn't realize you hadn't seen it yet.  Never heard of it even.  No, I hadn't seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I say Netflix recommended it to me.  No, go watch inside.  I love Ricky Gervais.  I love The Office, but I'm sorry.  I don't love him anymore.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What a jerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  So good.  So I need something to watch something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's comedy though, right?  I mean, I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here, if you do Google welcome to the internet.  This musical is funny Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just have the whole, this is the Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  This is it.  This is Bo Burnham's.  I'll just jump to just so we can see the lighting.  Oh, so he's in his house.  He's playing songs.  He's doing what a YouTuber does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is it funny or is it music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is it?  It is both.  It is all of the above.  Yeah.  Okay.  So he goes through the same struggles we all do, except he has an air conditioner.  So he does have an air conditioner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's maybe one little difference.  Wow.  So this is interesting.  Sounds like he's very creative, very talented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are tons of creative people on the internet.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At last we can see them.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I just jumped it all over you and my enthusiasm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jump all over me baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you call her baby?  No, I didn't mean that.  I just meant okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My friend.  No, I just meant it's okay.  I would have said that to anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's okay if you got to have a baby.  I believe it and that's exactly how I would react.  I don't mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This week's Leo lessons.  It's not lame and she's not a baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Friend, jump all over me friend.  That's no better.  I don't mind if you jump in.  Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  There you go.  All right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Someone else goes so we can get out in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is awkward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff baby, you got a number for me?  Well honey.  Sweetie cookie.  I'm going to do this one.  One of my contentions in defending the internet and trying to explain where it fits in the  world is that each new medium since print, yes I'm in a Gutenberg moment, take your gulp,  when it brings more people into the public conversation, those who controlled it before  resent it and resist.  The reformation meets the counter reformation.  And what's happening on the internet these days is that people who were not at the table  to set norms and decisions and power are now there and it peeves the people who were there.  But we've got to not lose sight of this magnificent diversity of creators and talent  that we see coming on.  So there were three stories that just came out of absolutely out of everywhere else,  but I put them together in one place because I thought they were, they spoke to this.  One is about the people at the center of black Twitter.  One is about TikTok honoring the class of 22 LGBTQ trailblazers.  Another one is the LA Times talking about the old guys TikTok and how they've become incredibly popular.  And it just reminds us that this is the value of the net of social media of creation there,  is the voices who were not heard in mainstream mass media run by old white men look like me,  but they're less pink.  And we get that value out of them now.  So if you look at the people on black Twitter.  I'm completely lost here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So every time you do this, you always have a bunch of links  and I'm listening and trying to figure out which of the links is he going to.  I was about to do that.  Wait a minute. I'm seeing Pitney Bowes Amazon stats.  Scientists discover biggest planet on earth and how much companies pay.  This has nothing to do with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I tried to, I did a teaser earlier.  I wanted to do celebrating identity on the net.  It's there in green at line 40.  Line 40?  Way up there.  I went back because you let me do my story that I wanted to do because it's not a democracy after all.  So I just decided to be an insurgent.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Let's do it now.  That's what I'm doing.  We'll save Pitney Bowes for another day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Plus, yeah, the Pitney Bowes story was boring as cold as...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which one should I...  So you want to do...  Who are the people at the center of black Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Black Twitter, right?  It's a great list.  They want to do what they want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I subscribe to a lot of these people.  I actually asked Lovie, I said, who should I follow years ago on Twitter?  And she gave me a whole bunch of a lot of these people, although it's always growing, which is fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is. It's great.  I follow a lot too, but I added a few more today.  This is a good list.  Some I'm not welcome to join in on.  Well, you don't have to say anything.  Can you listen?  This is the moment when I always praise the book Distributed Blackness by Andre Brock Jr., which I highly recommend,  and Black Software by Charlton McElwain about creating a space for a community online, which you can do.  You don't have to be mass.  You don't have to talk to everybody.  And a lot of these people don't have a huge number of followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Raven only has 4,000 followers.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Before the steam-powered printing press, the average circulation of a daily newspaper in the United States was 4,000.  It was big enough to be a newspaper then.  It's big enough now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then next we have Teen Vogue with the LGBTQ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who has become very much a political force in this world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  So the LGBTQ Trailblazers on TikTok.  We don't have to go through these particularly, but it's just making the point again.  But then I would go to the next story of the LA Times about the old guys, and there's one video in there because it's really charming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's always pride on old gays TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So these four guys are on TikTok all the time.  They come across my feed regularly.  And there's one video sample of them in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're great.  This one with the music from Rihanna?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the Rihanna one.  Really?  Oh, you're getting it.  Oh my god.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's the queen.  She's such a beautiful, talented woman.  You got Rihanna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got good taste, my sister.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  Why would such a beautiful, talented woman of Rihanna be watching us?  She's painting, aren't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or maybe it's because she thinks it's beautiful.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And do y'all know her nickname?  No.  Riri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Riri?  Riri?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they obviously have somebody egging them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That is everybody's parent.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Riri?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Riri?  So there's obviously somebody egging them on.  And so what I get from this really is there's a kind of younger guy behind this.  Well, that happens a lot.  I got to put you on TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, there's not.  They do their own thing.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to see 19 million views on TikTok?  Here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, jeez.  Maybe I'll stop now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about that?  They're dressed in bunny suits.  It's not playing for some reason.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Here we go.  Let's try it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they're dancing to Michael Jackson.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a lot of views for four guys in bunny ears and sequin, blue sequin shorts.  So the other point here is God bless the internet.  Just out of curiosity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not sure if they're my age.  Is that a curiosity?  Does this say any time story held there?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like they're older than that.  I hope they are.  Praise the Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope they are.  Oh, wait a minute.  A canny director slash stylist slash social media manager.  A 35 year old named Ryan's push for TikTok was driven by desire to give people a behind  the scenes look at the old gays.  So, yes, I was right.  There is a 35 year old media guy who said, oh, I got a handler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see the the Holocaust survivor who just came out with a book?  Her grandson or great grandson interviewed her regularly on TikTok.  And they just came out with a book and it made the New York Times bestseller list.  This is what's happening on TikTok.  So she's 90 like two of the guys are older than me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's two 78 year olds.  One guy's my age and the other one's a couple of years older.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You're heading there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the buddy suit.  Try to get attention before you thank you, honey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Let's move on to it.  And his picture the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, my pics are because I didn't do too much research, but I did know about Canon's new  R7 and R10 cameras.  The R10 is an APS-C mirrorless camera where they're basically just just saying, you know  what?  All of those DSLRs are dead.  So we're trying to bring people into the mirrorless world.  But with a smaller budget, a smaller sensor and a smaller price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thousand bucks.  So this was a thousand bucks.  Then they have the R7, which replaces the one Henry wants.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  This is this is replacing the old 7D, which was another APS-C DSLR.  OK, good.  So it's about fifteen hundred because you're going to get four K 60 frames a second oversample  thirty two mega megapixel sensor.  So it's got a little bit more beefier specs, but it's still a smaller sensor.  It's not a full frame sensor where there's nothing wrong with an APS-C sensor.  It just depends on what you're trying to what you want to look to look like.  But yeah, they announced those last week and you can preorder them whenever you want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're probably too young to remember a film camera, the Olympus OM1.  Do you remember that?  I've seen the lore.  It was a classic. Actually, you could still buy them on eBay and Amazon.  Classic. I loved them.  This was my I think one of my first 35 millimeter cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I had that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, it was a back in the 70s, I think.  Yeah. Yeah.  The Nikon my grandmother had that I broke looked like that.  Yeah. It was an old film camera.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is that how you say it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. Nikon. Most people say Nikon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I had no idea. I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you. Sorry.  No, no judgment. It's it's all right.  But I've been around them enough and they always say Nikon, Nikon, Nikon.  Yeah, that makes sense.  That's the one that really got me into tinkering with stuff because I broke it  and didn't want her to know I broke it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's it's the I think the 50th anniversary of the original OM1 film camera.  And I think this is kind of a nice tribute.  The folks, you know, Olympus.  Yeah. Olympus sold the OM series, their Micro Four Thirds series to a company called OM System.  And they've released their first one on the anniversary of the Olympus OM1.  And they're calling it the OM1.  The last one with Olympus.  I Lisa loved her old Olympus MFT cameras.  We have a lot of those lenses.  So as did Mr. Scott Bourne.  Yes. He was a big fan.  I think he still is because he said my arm.  He still likes them.  These are really amazing cameras.  So they just released this.  I thought I'd get it for Lisa before the cruise.  So don't tell her.  But it just came out and I think it's quite a beautiful camera.  But we'll do a review that way I can write it off.  There you go.  You know who else? Andy Iannacco loves it.  Did Scott Bourne stop shooting Olympus?  To an extent because he's doing more video now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So he had to pick up the Sony FS FX6.  He was doing video with that.  But he's also a big proponent of iPhone video.  So he and Mr. Jefferson Graham are doing more with iPhones and videography.  Interesting.  And started a new show on that.  He's done a lot of good stuff with it.  So this does pretty good video too actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He might be interested in it.  They've improved the video a lot.  They stack the same stuff.  They've improved the camera sensor.  Ant's pictures are as we mentioned earlier on Instagram.  Ant underscore Pruitt and Tiktok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Give me a follow there.  Give me a follow there folks.  Ant underscore Pruitt.  And if you check out that last reel I did we talked about lighting in that last reel.  I just did a little bit of behind the scenes on how I created a shot.  Because I was struggling creatively.  Went out to my garage slash lab and threw some lights up.  And figured out a way to put a little shot together.  There's a key light right there over the top.  And then I put another light in the back corner to give it a little bit of a sun ray.  And then just grabbed my cinema camera and shot some random footage.  Because I have no life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh man, the last shot, the last image was so gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess that's, oh well you just have to follow.  It's in the photos.  Is it in the photos?  Okay good.  I'll go back to the post.  Such a gorgeous shot.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course Ant every week regales us with his photography tips and interviews on hands-on photography.  Twit.tv slash HOP.  He's also our community manager.  You're going to be doing the book club in about 10 days, 2 weeks.  How far have you gotten?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just started it.  I love it.  I'm struggling with this book right now because I've been in such a foul mood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it doesn't help your mood does it?  It's about climate change.  I'm only about a third of the way through.  Termination Shock by Neal Stephenson.  He's one of my favorite authors.  It sounds like you don't like it either Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm sorry it's your book club.  Okay fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Neal Stephenson needs an editor.  Yeah.  You know what I like about him and I really enjoy about this book is his research, his  erudition.  So you always learn a lot about the most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know what the better climate change novel is?  Ministry of the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson.  But both of these books have a plot problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're just boring ass plots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Neal's famous also for poor endings and John tells me that the book doesn't have  any of that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah that's terrible.  Oh this will be a great book club coming up.  They don't have to all be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well it's fun to listen to, I've been a critic, it's fun to listen to complaints.  I'm coming in to defend it.  I'll come in to defend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know I really loved the whole thing about the Singh or the Sikh religion.  Sorry not the Singh.  Yeah that was fascinating.  I had two friends who were Sikh growing up and I was just like, hot damn there they are.  Look at them looking like badasses.  I was really excited for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well we'll talk about it.  That's Stacey's Book Club, that's June 16th.  We also have Alex Lindsay, you're going to ask me anything next month and I imagine a  few more events coming up, lots of great shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm actually working on an event with some of our members.  So I'm going to figure out a time to get all of them together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh I'd like to meet some of these people that we've been talking with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to do a bit of a fireside chat with them.  Again I'm working on it.  I was off last week and I refused to do work so just give me some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was the event in Dallas.  Right, you were in Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, did you regret going to the event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh no, it was actually a really good event up until getting COVID.  I enjoyed, it was a smart home event held by Parks Associates.  So it was good for a bunch of reasons.  The number one reason was I got to see all the people from the smart home industry and pass them COVID.  And I got to have this event with Parks and I had a weird history because they kicked me out of one of their shows a couple years back.  So it was my first time back.  Kicked you out?  They kicked me out because I kept noting that every panel was really a mantle and I found that upsetting and frustrating.  Oh, I remember this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember this.  You were tweeting about it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I was miffed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Respect.  They had women this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it wasn't just me.  So I was like, I got to give them credit.  They brought me back and they were like, all right, we got women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I totally remember that.  That was a big furor and I was proud of you.  It wasn't a furor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was a Twitter furor.  It was surprising.  No one's ever kicked me out of an event.  I felt like truly an awesome journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was like, yeah, I've made it now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Truth to power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unlike me, they invited you back after they kicked you out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, ladies and gentlemen, he is the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School.  At the City University of New York, BuzzMachine.com.  What's the story with your book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't really announced it anywhere yet, but the Gutenberg Parenthesis will be published by Bloomsbury as an academic and trade book coming out by the start of the next year, I hope.  That's really good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Congratulations.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a little bit puzzled.  I'll be the one to say congratulations, baby.  Well done, honey.  Don't ever let them tell you.  Just because you're a pretty face, you can't write.  No, actually, that's a very prestigious publisher.  I know you were looking.  You got a good one.  That's a big deal.  Thank you, everybody.  It's good to have you all back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm in Wisconsin talking about IoT security.  You desert us again.  I'm going to tour Lambeau Fields.  I'm so jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh my gosh.  I'm a Green Bay fan.  You know who's a huge Green Bay fan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our son Michael.  He is an owner.  He has a share in Green Bay Packers.  Because it's the only NFL team that the fans own.  They own the stadium, too.  It's a wonderful...  I'm so jealous. How fun.  There's cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm very excited about the cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish I could go.  I know we were going to drag Michael to the Niners Green Bay  game in December.  Take off your shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But cooler heads prevailed.  Or warmer heads, in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cheeseheads prevailed.  Well, have fun, Stacey.  We'll see you in two weeks, I hope.  Yes.  You're going to be around for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm going to Virginia next week.  Oh, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you.  And you'll be here next week.  Yes, sir.  It is. We have to work really hard.  We are working on somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is it because y'all are trying to not make it a mantle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  No mantles here.  Yeah, but I think we may have a fella on next week if we can't get the gal that we're trying to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because how can you replace Stacey?  You can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm glad you didn't die.  Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Frisco, Texas Omni Hotel.  How was the takeout?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You couldn't taste it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They had tacos, but they couldn't taste the tacos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They had some of my favorite taco restaurants and I could actually taste queso.  That was nice.  Because it's basically creamy and then I'd add a lot of spice to it.  And then I was like, oh, this is spicy creamy.  Delicious.  See if they have queso in Wisconsin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They have cheese curds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's fried cheese curds, my man.  Fried cheese curds.  Squeakers.  It's the best.
