Hi great to be back all about Android host  She's also an Android developer and a smart ass person  We missed you last week

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're having a baby and a startup and a spouse on a job hunt just all collapsed on me  Right at the moment where we're supposed to start the episode so I apologize for missing but I'm thrilled to be back

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We had a big episode because we were talking about somebody said Leo you're doing native content now on on  Software and now it's not native content  But we did we did talk a lot about the former it no now known and I love it  And I'll show you a little more about that  Jeff is also here Jeff Jarvis professor of journalism at CUNY the City University of New York  He's also an author of books like what would Google do and his latest oh  My god when I said what would Google do  Chrome woke up and said what what I'll do anything. What do you want? Huh? Huh? What? What you said something?  Did you were talking to me you talking to me?  That's weird and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Private parts and a blogger at buzz machine.com and I have I have a new book for for walks only coming out November 6th called  Geeks burying gifts. Oh, I'm seeing new futures of news can't wait  I'll believe you can wait. It's it's a metastasized white paper. It just grew and grew and grew until it was a book

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Geeks bearing gifts. It's inspired by a former News Corp executive who was actually attacking me and said the we're  Bearing gifts. So I said no. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it. You turned it around beware of geeks bearing gifts. Yeah, that's the old

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Saying Greeks bearing give the Trojan horse and all of it, right?  so I  We were talking about known which is a posse solution. We had Kevin Marks on last week  This is part of the Indie web the notion that you should own your own content  That stuff should emerge from your site to the social networks  That's what posse stands for post once syndicate everywhere. I think is the idea so I set up my posse  first I did it on with known but I  Actually downloaded the software and I've got I've got it running at leoville net  Because at leoville.com I have my blog. So this is known running it allows you to post in things like  MP3 files check-ins  Text, you know blog style articles links pictures  So this is this is pretty cool. Yeah, I mean it's kind of like a tumbler. I haven't got it all all set up yet  I haven't got the Federation to the social media working at where I mean, you know, just it's technicals  They told not anything wrong with known but I like it. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Want presentation matter BC when presented here in New York yesterday and six six neat companies very well done presentations  And matter and known was there it's a bit odd  They like pivoted the night in one night to present entirely as a tool for education. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think they're bigger than that. I think that they well they're looking you know, they're looking for a niche they can fill  Effectively and then expand beyond that I  Think it's known is not the key story here. The idea is that you should  We said I feel like it's very old-fashioned now instead of posting on  Twitter or Google Plus or on Facebook you should post like well  I pictures are a good example put your pictures on your site and then federate and known to let you do this to flicker and  Facebook and Twitter and if you want  Unfortunately, cuz there's no right API for Google Plus that's not one of that group and that's a good reason for Google Plus to add that  Do you think they ever will Gina we were we got a little heated offline debate with Alan Tepper who said well  I use a program on WordPress that lets me post to Google Plus. Well, it does that illegally

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, yeah, he said that jetpack which is which I used to on WordPress  Yeah, yeah WordPress is kind of WordPress comm or automatics kind of you know  Proprietary layer on top of WordPress post to Google Plus  Alan explained that it uses an app to do so. I'm not I'm not really sure you know  I thought well, they're just hacking the the the rest API right there figuring out what endpoint, you know  Google itself posts to you know, they're sort of using a hack. He said that they're using an app  I'm not really sure if that I don't think that qualifies as a right API the developers page still very clearly says there is no  Right API for Google Plus, but there's clearly some sort of solution for a jetpack kind of situation  Yeah, so I'd like to see Google Plus, you know support a right API  But I don't know all signs are indicating that Google may be sort of not pulling back  But not maybe pushing more aggressively Google Plus upon the folks who aren't using it  It seems like they're adding features and supporting it for the folks who are using it and plenty of people are  But I don't think we're gonna see a right API not after all this time. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is disappointing. Yeah, it's a little bit disappointing  And I would think now that they're kind of it's not a central part of their strategy. Maybe they could do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean maybe you know one could implement something similar to how jetpack is doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm always reluctant to do that because those things are not guaranteed to work going forward. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You use a back door, you know, you can't be sure that back door won't be locked

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  least Google could could bless some  Pads in yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apparently you can post to Google Plus with HootSuite. So maybe there is a  Maybe there's a legitimate way. I don't know. I mean, they're very clear. There is no right API  You cannot in some third-party program post to Google Plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you create a Google app app and then post to that, I'm not sure I'm not exactly sure how it works  It doesn't seem exactly straightforward  Anyway to get back to known this looks really really nice and you like it Leo  So you're gonna be posting to your your main instance  So how so how so this is like your tumblr except that syndicate everywhere? Yeah, and when you post

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When you get it set up, which I haven't yet because we're you know, I'm you know, I'm self-hosting and I'm doing weird things  And it's you know, it's just some little thing. I'll fix it  But when you post as you post there's buttons depending on the content to post to a  Federated social sites Twitter Facebook if it's an image flicker if it's audio SoundCloud  You you can highlight all or some of those and then that post goes on your blog  The image is stored on your blog, but it sends it also out to these other places  It's not the first time this has ever happened in the world. It's nothing brand new, but I love I've always said you should  Your content should exist on your a site you control and you don't control Twitter or Facebook or Google Plus  They control

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now when you post a known can you also syndicate to your blog because you're you're differentiating between your known site and your blog

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I haven't set it up, but I think there's a way to do it to WordPress as well  Mm-hmm. You know, I played with tumblr. I said this to Ben and Aaron when they were here  Yeah, I played with tumblr logs before tumblr. I used tumblr. I love the idea of a quick  posting mechanism  Yep, I just think it's you know what? It's not gonna change the world  It's a one more  Way to encourage people to have their own personal website where their content is stored in their control and  Just having had experience of not having that control  Encourages me to do that. I want to I want to own my my some my content

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely. Yeah, cool. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of silly  Um  Did the David Johansson has been David Johnson's doing it on an nginx server  I want to talk to you David's let's email me or something Leo Leo calm because that's the problem  I'm having nginx is in between me and Apache and I think it's causing problems with mod rewrite. Okay, just a little program  Moving on Google's changing its tune on net neutrality  Remember we were kind of up in arms when Google sided with Verizon in a briefing  I think it was to Congress saying, you know net neutrality is all well and good for home internet service providers  But you shouldn't have net neutrality when it comes to mobile  four years later  They say maybe you should  What has changed I?  Think they finally just wised up that we were mad. I remember when this happened. We were mad that Google raged

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a devil's deal  I you know  I suppose if Google fanboy was having fits with them that this was this was evil and awful a lot of Google employees were quietly grumbling  But you know, we knew then what was gonna be the case which is that the mobile web is the web

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's also odd because Google is a member of something called the American Legislative Exchange Council and they oppose net neutrality rules

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People said you got to get out of that group and Google isn't saying so  I feel like Google is like any big company nowadays that that contributes to every political party just in case  It's too bad  Steve gives it to go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I was gonna say I mean their agreement with Verizon to me always felt like this compromise unwilling compromise  But something that they did because they felt like they had to at the time. So maybe enough time has passed  Now I'm being really optimistic but enough time has passed. They're saying yeah, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not anymore. I think it made sense  Maybe because the bandwidth issues with wireless were very different than the bandwidth issues with home internet  And so maybe in that case, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this ranges around Google's corporate relationship with Verizon full stop and  This was about them having to suck up to Verizon for other deals to get the phones in Google's less  You know now Android is spread everywhere  The guy who handled the phone relationships  Is gone. So maybe they just changed. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  here's one that  Peeves me a bit and Steve Gibson tuna. This is a little technical. So bear with me or watch yesterday's security now  When you go to a secure website a website using SSL  Its identity is verified using something called a certificate  That is generated for them by a certificate authority  certificate authority goes to some lengths to prove that  They are who they say they are and then issues a certificate, you know, they'll call them. There's all sorts of stuff  so when you have an HTTPS to Amazon or Google or someone else that is  Secured by a certificate saying they are who they say they are these certificates  Almost all of them nine out of ten certificates use an encryption algorithm  called assets sh a one  SHA one is not broken. It has not been hacked  but it's  Not it's not using I think a long enough  Boy I might not be right on this but for some reason it is computationally  As computers get faster faster each year more likely to be crackable. It isn't yet  But but in some time in the next few years next ten years  Computers become fast enough that SHA one is not going to be a secure way to encrypt  Microsoft says we're gonna deprecate it in our browser and an Explorer by 2017  So certificate authorities start using the more secure SHA to  For your certificates, it's stronger and it's used and it's supported everywhere  Google has decided in its infinite wisdom to hurry this process and  Starting just before Christmas when you go to a website and again 93% of secure websites use SHA one certificates  You will start to get a  successively  Severe warning in the Chrome browser  At first you'll get a little orange triangle then you'll get no lock at all  Then you'll get a big X and a line drawn through HTTPS  To Google says we're declaring a slow-motion emergency. Here's the here the three different logos before things get worse  Nobody's taking this seriously  Now what Steve pointed out is this is kind of heavy-handed nanny work from Google  First of all Google uses SHA one in all of its certificates  It is a certificate authority and continues to use SHA one  They're exempt from this because their certificates last only for three months and they've decided that they will only do this for sites  That certificates expire  In 2017 so they've kind of cleverly loophole their own  Equally insecure if you say it's secure certificates out of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, they only show the the insecure icon for certificates that expire in 2017  Yeah, so eventually it'll be 2016. It'll get more and more

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Severe and Microsoft has said we're gonna only do it in 2017  That's in other words the thought is well  We're gonna give time to certificate authorities to upgrade their because okay  So in order to implement this I as an HTTPS website would have to go to my certifying authority get a new certificate using  a SHA to and install it right and  Google saying you all have to do that in the next three months or we're gonna start  Penalizing you by showing that your sites insecure. It's not by the way. It has not been cracked  it's just presumed that as computers get faster, it'll become easier to crack and  It's very aggressive  Global Global sign which is a good cert authority that we use and others use  Say this is insanely aggressive. We've got to reissue our all of our certificates in the next three months  We're not prepared to do that  Google says too bad. We're gonna do it  Now it's such a technical issue that I doubt you'll see much coverage of it anywhere and I do encourage you to  Listen to Steve talk about it because I think he does a good job of better than I have explaining it  Eventually what you'll get is that warning that says there is mixed content on this page  Some of its secure some of its not you've seen that and the thing is anybody using Chrome will get this  so prepare in three months to hear from your mom and your grandma and your sister and your brother and  Other non technique technically literate people in your family and friends who will say what's going on?  Amazon, you know my sites not secure anymore the sites I'm visiting aren't secure anymore. Why is that? Why am I getting why is the lock gone?  It's not because it's not secure. It's because Google has decided in Chrome  not to show the lock I  Feel like this is more of the nanny state stuff from Google like  Saying hey if you have HTTPS, you'll see you'll rank higher in our search

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know SEO Google's you know the things that the Googlebot responds to better  You know in so many ways people structure their markup and their sites  You know based you know be just because you know they want to rank higher in Google search  It's kind of it's kind of amazing  I think how much Google really does affect how websites are built and this is another way and there we feel to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're wielding their muscle and maybe this is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know after heart bleed I mean, you know, we're at a weird time right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's different than heart bleed this is Steve's point because heart bleed is an actual flaw

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, right, right heart bleed is an actual vulnerability and this is not right  but but I think because  Google saying that the clock is ticking and someone's gonna crack this and we know that so why don't we just speed up the time and  Beat them right and like that's what's with the three month timeline. Yeah, I mean this is this is good for Google  You know, it makes them look good. It makes them look like they're being proactive  It makes them look like they care about the way, you know, whatever all these things  But I mean it really does put the onus on website administrators myself included  You know to get this sorted a lot more quickly than maybe we would otherwise  And it does seem aggressive, but you know, it's a kind of in the name of security. What why else why else would they do this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that was one of the things that chat yesterday is maybe they know it's been cracked  Maybe they're post posted a estimate by Jesse Walker  On how much it would cost to forge one of these certificates using Amazon web service pricing and Moore's law  Two million dollars in 2012 seven hundred thousand in 2015  hundred seventy three thousand in 2018 forty three thousand dollars in 2021 based on these numbers Schneier suggested an  organized crime certificate would be able to forge a certificate in 2018 a  University could do it in 2021. So in other words, it's not imminent. It's not knocking at the door  Microsoft  Says 2017 we're gonna start doing this on an Internet Explorer and the and the all the certificate authority said that's fine  That gives us time. We're gonna do that by 2017 now Google says no no three months

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  2015 if it is it  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know I I am just parroting  This is a little bit up above my pay grade and I'm parroting what Steve says  But I if Steve says this is a this is he feels it's fairly arrogant of Google to do  Yeah  Huh?  Jeff Steve is cautious Steve is Steve is not a pro  Lack security guy by any means the name of the show is security now  But I don't know all right, I brought it up probably shouldn't have no I'm glad I'm glad you did that since it's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just think and you know  So the the lock doesn't go away in three months right that the lock you get the mixed content warning  Which you'll see on HTTPS pages that load say non HTTPS images, right?  So it's a lock with it and then you know  And so maybe I don't know three months later did they give a timeline on when the when the icons actually change?  I mean the one they have to really be worried about where things seem to look really broken and  Maybe get blocked is when the lock is like the you know the red X. You know, this is this is an attack  And they're not saying they're gonna do that in January

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, soon. I can't remember what the timeline is but pretty soon. Here's so here's a site created by somebody called Shah  Dot-com check your site for weak sha certificates. It's by con clone dang google.com is using Shah one

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Plans to migrate to shot two in 2015 even Google's still using this  So, excuse me, and if you if you put in amazon.com  Dang amazon.com is using Shah one Bank of America  Everybody's still using this. It's not like it's been  broken  So Google is just simply by itself saying too bad. You guys are gonna have to fix this now if anybody should be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Working fast to change it this place is like Bank of America

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But so start so Steve is in the chat room he says yes in January you'll start seeing the big red X  This is not secure on Bank of America and Amazon and others if there's if they don't update their certs by then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I  Agree, that's a little premature  crazy  I'm with you. Thanks Steve now maybe maybe in three months

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everybody will have moved a shot to it will have only cost a little bit of money  These things these things, you know, maybe maybe I never really go. Oh, thank you Google for getting this done  Even though it wasn't an urgent thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's almost aggressive as Apple deleting your iPhone well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't get me started  You're you're you're poking the bear Gina  Cue the YouTube album cue the YouTube album, which we all have thanks to  Now you are trolling  Let's take a break. Those are three stupid stories. I'm sorry  I brought any of them up would you guys look at the rundown and find something good for us to talk about?  While I do an ad I'm putting you in charge and we'll do the changelog Gina's back. We really need a changelog  I also I think we talked we didn't do a very good job talking about hangouts  And the and the move of voices the merging of voice and hangouts last week  So maybe we can get you to explain that a little bit as a host of all that Android  I know you're talking about it a lot. Yeah. Yeah, well, I like it by the way, I  like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rat that's a radical stance

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And and I'm using it now for my SMS messaging and everything I'm making calls with it  I like it, but we'll talk about it in a second our show today brought to you by full sail University  I love this name set your sails set your sails for adventure set your sails for a bright future  Full sail offers both online and campus degree programs  Centered on real-world experience in the areas. We know a lot of you are very interested in entertainment  Media technology and in particular marketing, you know marketers nowadays  In fact, I'm really I think I want more people to take these programs because I feel like a lot of marketers don't understand  What's going on?  You need to kind of get what's going on with the internet need to reach audiences and consumers in the new digital environment  Using web-based channels and understanding search technology analytics  Full Sail University has an online internet marketing masters degree program designed for pros who want to keep pace with these  Really fast-moving marketing technologies things like search engine optimization social media marketing web metrics analytics  Online consumer behavior you'll be working on real projects with real clients to gain experience and generate results  And of course your instructors are not you know, not just teachers.

We invite you to go to Full Sail  dot edu slash twig  fulsail dot edu slash twig set your sail  for your future  Full Sail University  Let's get the trumpets into the changelog. I think this is a good time unless you want to talk about voice  You know somebody  Somebody messaged me that his OB high is working again

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is what now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll only tell you about the OB high I've been this is another one where I felt guilty because I've been telling everybody to get  One it's this little device the OB 100 that I have was like 80 90 bucks  That essentially lets you use  Google voice  To you connect your regular home to the OB device, which then you connect to the internet and then you can use Google voice  For your phone number and your phone calls  Gotcha, so cool and it's like a hundred bucks  That's great. Yeah, so I had one and then we were all very afraid  That it would stop working  Because Google had told everybody don't know we're gonna we're not gonna use X. What is it?  XMPP anymore and don't don't you can't and they were they were and the good news is with the move towards  To hangouts it works again  So very good news  I'm gonna come I had mine in a drawer  So if you want to like a home line that uses your internet has a regular phone number you may calls in and out  It's using Google voice so it's free load into the US and Canada and it's very inexpensive globally  This is a good way to do it. So now ladies and gentlemen play the trumpets  Sing the song  Change your panties back with all the new stuff from Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I have to apologize. I know you started talking about this last week  But I just got it yesterday and we just started talking about it Google voice  Integration rolling out in in hangouts. This is pretty cool. So you use Google voice and you're on Android  You know the Google voice Android app has been kind of long neglected  And that's because everything's migrating into hangouts a recent update you get a little prompt at the top of the top of the app  Like like Chad is showing on screen there. Thank you, Chad saying hey  Do you want to migrate Google voice to hangouts?  That means that you'll receive your voicemail and you have to send text messages in hangout. So you have the option  No, don't do it. Not now and turn it on I turned it on  Because I have this mono 360 on my wrist here and I want to be able to respond to text messages through voice  And you can't do that through Google voice, but you can do that through hangouts  So turn it on. So so turn what on my 360?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, so you're advising

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it yes, I like it I like it too I'll be I'll be honest  I went to go send my wife a text message yesterday and I got this prompt and now suddenly I'm like going through the settings  Of hangouts and I'm annoyed because all I want to do is send a text message timing  It took me a moment to set hangouts to send SMS from my Google voice number and not from my phone's native number  That is in settings. It took me a moment to find it  It is in hangout settings  You can set it to do that by default because I said I use my Google voice number for everything and once I did that  I was really happy with it. I also had the  Jeff I had your problem where I was like, wait a second now, which one of these conversations are SMS conversations and which one of them?  Are hangout chat conversations?  I managed to sort of unmerge those and so once I sort of just got used to that the hangouts interface  I was really happy with it  Now the thing the thing that you should know though one thing that I do a lot in my browser  I use Google voice in my web browser a lot. I have the tab open  I send us just from it once I made this switch  I went to my Google voice inbox on the web and I couldn't send text messages from it anymore  You have to use the hangouts app on your desktop. So that was also a little disconcerting with all change  There's a little bit of like wait what you know, my old way doesn't work

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But now you can send texts from your desktop using hangouts  You can make call that hangouts thing if you've got Chrome running. It's just like an app standalone app. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I really I really dig it. I really dig it  Google also rolled out a new app the hangouts dialer. Did you get this?  Yes, this is what iOS has had for a while  Let's you turn your Google voice account to true true voice over IP solution  You can you can you know make wipe calls from your phone  Which is really nice and I was kind of annoyed that iOS had this first

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You kind of need to get this if you're gonna use the the hangouts fully as you're kind of all-in-one messaging center  So you can make calls you can do text you can do now MMS because you can say you before we couldn't use Google voice  To send anything but text you can now because you're using hangouts so you can send images and movies and audio. I mean I  Like this. It's really I took them a while to get this worked out, but it seems to work  Excuse me really well. I get my voicemail, you know audio in my hangouts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All of them now so now when you about the MMS so you can say I haven't actually tried this yet  You can send an image from your Google voice number to another phone number and it till and it works

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I I tried and it didn't work  Oh, well, it's supposed to I think you can send because it will make it an attachment on the internet  But I don't think you can receive MMS

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that was what I noticed. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I'll have to play around with this a little more  I'm interested to know does reroute it to just a hangouts message. Does it does it make an attachment?  Does it send it via email because sometimes like that happens?  But that would be that would be tremendous because that was always my sort of big complaint. So my understanding

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't I'm gonna try to send a picture right now and I'll see what happens via SMS  So when you when you're sent messaging somebody you have a little drop-down that says you can choose the various ways you could send it  And I'm gonna try to send it via SMS photo ready to send and I'm gonna send it it says it's an SMS  Oh, you know what? I think it's gonna use my T-mobile SMS  We could also do it with hangouts  Anyway, it seems like you can now. I mean it's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have the option in the interface to send a photo right which you didn't have before  With Google it may not get through but it's in  I mean, you know you you have another way that you can send it having the two different apps was always you know  I always just sort of lived in the Google voice app  And of course you just get all the benefits of hangouts being very actively developed modern  Updated app which the Google voice is gonna die finally and rotting  I don't think it's good. I think the back end is gonna stick around now that they did give you the option  Don't enable this so folks can stay on Google voice if they want  I think that that's you know Google sort of stepping gently into the new the new thing  We'll see. I don't know. I'll be interested to see if at some point they actually just straight-up deprecate

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google voice and I just got an attachment for that's so weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was on a call like a Skype call with a friend and I asked him to send me a photo from his iPhone  To my Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's a very attractive picture of Chad. Thank you via Google voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's since it says send from my so I sent well. I just was not able to receive one. Maybe that was a glitch  Yesterday he using Google voice  He was using his normal

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I might be there might be an issue there  I don't know interesting and when you go to your Google voice app now that you've made the shift  It will say in the Google voice app. No, no, no, no use me hangouts  I got nothing. Yep, doesn't go away at your old messages are still in there, but it says nothing news coming here

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. It also displays voicemails really nicely. I agree  You get the transcription get the transcription you can you have a big play button  It gives you a progress bar. It's very it's very nice  And it comes out in almost as a card instead of just where on the voice app. It was a full page

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I feel like this is what Apple's trying to do with message message messages  And it but it works and it's cross platform, which is nice  So I've always been able to see phone calls to my Google voice number on my iPad my iPad starts ringing when people call  My Google voice number and I could pick up and I could talk and all of that and that's really cool  So this is full unlike Apple's solution. This is fully cross-platform Android iOS and desktop if you're using that's really nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, really nice. So now Android central lest you abandon don't have it in the Google voice app entirely. They pointed out  very smartly don't remove don't don't uninstall the Google voice app because that means any calls you make from your stock dialer won't look  As if they're coming from your voice your Google voice number, so keep it installed for now and hopefully that'll be built  It's this is all a transition. It's not it's gradually being done. Yeah. Yeah, I'm pretty happy about it though  I have to say I embrace the hangouts

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't like it at first because I didn't want to use such a heavyweight tool for my text messaging  But now that it does now that everything it's a unified inbox. That's really great. That's worth it  Yeah, and as you say for Android wear now we can reply to for sex messages for our watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it. Yeah, and I want to talk about this watch by the way with you all  But I'll get through the I'll get through the change log first. We're gonna do a whole moto thing after the change  Let's do a moto thing. I want to hear about I want to hear about your moto motos. Yes  Ever ever stylish Leo  So  Remember that demo we saw at Google I oh where they were running Android apps in Chrome OS  That is happening for everybody. So we got four  Android apps now available to run on Chrome OS do a lingo. It's great app  Evernote site words and vine are all available in the Chrome web store for Chrome OS users. Okay, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I  Installed the Evernote. Yeah, and it's great. I mean it works now that was because I complained before I stopped using Evernote because it wasn't native on  Chrome and so when like computer died, which is very rare  On my Chrome book, but when it did I lost the material because it wasn't saved to the cloud now  It does save locally which is very important and that means that other applications will do the same thing and that's a that's a big deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's the it's the tablet optimized layout, right?  Because it's on your pixel your pixels touch screen  So when you launch Evernote, it looks as if it's on a tablet, right?  And you can and you can touch it to interact or that you use your keyboard obviously to type into it  Let me call it here and it just acts like it's on your Nexus 7

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's weird. I can't find it because I have the Evernote. I would ever know web  That's what I've been using. So I do use Evernote on it. Yeah, I just know I can't save stuff. You can't in the web you can  Right, but but I you know, so but so that's still in my applications. No, I can't find the Evernote  But eyes the apps on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

I don't have time to drag stuff  Beautiful that's what the alphabets for to put stuff in order in some random order based on the first letter of their name, please  That's why we created the alphabet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't want to get Jeff too agitated I don't really know what Google's doing here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My heartbeat is going when you do so. Yes, there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there you go Android apps on chroma West ladies and gentlemen  It's I think we really want to talk about the motor 360 dipped in chocolate. It's just chocolate. Yeah  One more this is a pretty big launch. So Google released an updated my maps app  This is renamed the form used to be named the Google Maps engine light very long forgettable name  Now it's called my maps and they opened up the map gallery to the public and that's a google.com slash maps slash views  My maps is a way for you to create your own customized maps  If you're going to a conference or planning vacation or you're just mapping your town for visitors  So on if you go to just regular Google Maps on the web now in the search drop down  There's a my map section  We can create a custom map as you like and share it and and there's a new Android app as well  It's called my maps and it's in the Play Store and it's for free where you can create your own maps there and view them  As well, so really nice map stuff. I'll tell you the truth  I am NOT a geography geek and I don't I'm not like burning to make my own map  But when you think about it, you know  we're planning to San Diego and I want to hit all my old haunts and that's a really good way to do it or  You go into a conference or you want to show a friend driving directions to your place, you know the back way  So you should be able to yeah, they're my maps. Here's the example Mashable gives is a London food map

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, this would be nice. So you could just install. I don't know how you would I guess it's a bookmark, right?  And then you'd go to this map in Google Maps. Is that how it work?  And then you could look at the different restaurants in London

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean on your if you're using Android you can install the my maps app and you can and you can separate  I think you can so you need the my maps for reading as well as writing. I think so  I think so, although I don't see why you shouldn't be able to just make a URL it could become a URL

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I'm my maps on the web. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and  Finally another bit of Chromebook news  Anyone using the latest developer version the Chrome OS can now stream videos stored in Google Drive  Directly to their Chromecast device, of course, you know televisions. So Jeff

It's a fairly affordable. That's for the  Cheap yeah, yeah, that's with the the  $25 surcharge for leather  They have the wood as well  The moto 360 let's see if it's still available because it went back on sale yep still available  So obviously they got a big shipment or something in you guys both got moto 360s from Google I oh  yes, and  The moat well, but let me just say one more thing which is the moto hint  Which for all you can order which is the scarlet Johansson earpiece?  that you put in your ear just like  What's your help out by saying that Joaquin Phoenix?  Her just like the movie her and by the way yes, you can get it in leather  So I got a brown leather  matching brown leather  earpiece  Now we know that's gonna have terrible battery life because it comes with this special extra battery. That's its case

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also predict I'm gonna lose it out of my weird ear within about eight hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it's small it's the smallest it's basically a Bluetooth headset, but it does have some additional  Moto X features you can talk to it. I  Know I looks a little dorky. He looks like River walking Phoenix  so the idea is it looks like a little pretty little earring or a gauge in your ear and  And you just talk to it you say you know and I think I'm gonna say okay Jarvis  Maybe I'll say okay, Jeff Jarvis  Yeah, because you can wake it up now the new moto X you can wake up with any any phrase you wish if it's sufficiently  complex and long  You get up to ten hours of talk time with the case the case contains two extra charges  I'm thinking that means is about three and a third hours per charge  Talk time so it's not a really long thing, but I like it  So I call this if you've ever played a World of Warcraft  You know you get these armor equipment sets  I call it my legendary equipment set the moto 360 the moto hint the moto X I will be invincible  It is a blues whose headset, but does some additional stuff with a moto X so it'll work with an iPhone or anything else  It's just a Bluetooth heads. It's like you're you know your  Your when do you get it?  The phone comes on for a week from Friday  The  Watch comes  October 4th hint comes both of them come like after I get back from London

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So but I will have the main selling point to the moto X according to in your view is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you had the old moto X right? Well briefly. It's just like well. It's just like the one you didn't like  except  It's faster. It's bigger. It's five point two inches instead of four point seven yes  It's faster, and it has better battery life supposedly. Oh, I forgot and a much better camera 13 megapixel camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm finding the one plus is is what you said last week. It's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Vanilla, but as so is the Nexus 5. This is vanilla I  want a stash show with a swirl of caramel and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cluster on your D man lefying the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it will be a it will it's gonna be very interesting because I don't know what I'm gonna use day to day and I guess  I should be like Brian Williams and not say what my preference is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you know you cuz you'll use both you'll try it'll say I will have the iPhone 6 plus the big one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will have the moto X and I will have I think the one plus is gonna be in contention  One of them because I don't want to carry three phones. That's just stupid

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of them all carry, but I shouldn't say you're not to mention who you voted for  But phones I mean it's right that's right out in front of you, you know should mention before the show started

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff drivers posed this question. It's an interesting question should tech journalists not state their preference  If they're gonna cover so, you know, should I should people not know what phone I use as a daily driver

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If someone lives in the iOS  Ecosystem and they cover Android they've made that choice as a consumer, right? I think that's worthy of transparency

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there's two different kinds of reporters though. There's a there's a you know, traditional  reporter who's  Just the facts ma'am. No opinion, right and then there's people like me. I'm a reviewer a pundit  So I make a choice based on my best judgment having tried every phone and I want to communicate that choice  Saying for me I chose this because I like this you might when people ask me what phone again  I don't universally say oh you should get the one plus one. That's it  I asked them questions and then depending on what they're what's the reasonable thing for them?  I will tell them and sometimes it's an iPhone. Sometimes it's a moto X. Sometimes it's a Windows phone even  Well hardly ever but sometimes it's what does phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean you're I mean the question I always want to know from you Leo is what phone are you currently using like given this?  Lady why now? What are you right? Because it's like the ultimate statement. It's the ultimate review to me  So well, it's important though

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Jeff made the point that it's important to know because of for your bias for reasons of bias  Sure, and it's important to you because it gives you a data point on what phone you should get

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely, I mean, you know, I see I see friends of mine who've been I've always been iOS a friend of mine  I was just talking to before I started the show said I you know  I sent a I upgrade to IOS a and I sent this message to my wife and I can't wait for to write me back because I  See what it's like to reply to a message, you know right from the home screen  You should be able to do that and I was like, oh you can do that now like that's great  And he was like, yeah, like is it and I was like  But like good for you  Has like like three versions ago, but it's okay enjoy it, you know, but it's this it's this sense of like revelation  You know about that that like when folks gush who have been IOS only kind of gush about iOS features  I'm not trying to take away from Apple in a lot of ways  They do these things really more thoughtfully or maybe more designed  I will totally admit to that but it is you know, when people are cutting out paper sizes and I6 plus  It's like these phones exist. You don't have to cut cardboard out like

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cardboard dummies

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've had three colleagues the office  Where I've said, you know, this is the size of the iPhone. Yeah. Oh really can I touch it? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, our one plus one is almost exactly the same size. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I you know, I went to a conference this week and I went to the XO XO conference a festival and I you know  when I would go to iOS people be like, you know meet the size of your new phone like  Horrified and interested suddenly everybody wanted to hold my phone and stick in their pocket and see how it worked  So that was like my favorite way to troll to troll iPhone users  But but so it's interesting to me to know  You've never actually really lived with Android because if you did this wouldn't be such a huge revelation  But you know, and I now I'm being I guess now  but  By the way, FYI

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You but you made the shift  We all have made the shift some sooner than later from iPhone  Everybody who last anybody who had sense bought an iPhone in 2007. There was nothing like it  Yep, and and we stayed with it. I got the first Android phone tried it for a while thought this is ready  Wasn't ready. Oh, the g1 was a  I was excited about but disappointed and then at some point  Differing points for each of us  But some point there was a crossover point where the Android phone actually started to beat the iPhone  In some in ruin in summers in respects that we cared about for me it was screen size and keyboard  You know, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a different perspective is living on the edge of  You know for me, it feels like I'm closer to the future with Android, right?  And and you know an Apple address this in their keynote  They did their whole thing about how they don't want to be first. They want to be best  That's fine. Even if that takes a long time. It's kind of BS. That's cool  I watched the Charlie Rose interview with Tim Cook yesterday and it was very self-serving

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, they're patient they're not behind they're patient

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is what this listen, this is his job, right?  I mean, this is his job is to position them is doing it the right way  And I gotta tell you the Apple watch is it's cute. There's something compelling about it really something interestingly and compelling about it  Yeah, I would say so I would say so just from aesthetics wise. I was like, oh, that's that looks hip to me  I like the Melanie's bracelet

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's got the best bands of any watch on the market today  And I say that wearing in the ugliest white rubber band you've ever seen on my Android so you both got moto 360s  Did you like it? Do you like you know you first wait a minute stop? We'll do an ad don't say anything  Okay, their reviews of the moto 360 coming up the first round smartwatch and in fact, it's surprise Apple did not make one round  We thought oh well Apple's gonna make it round rounds better. It really surprised me. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Looks like a little square gold pillow on your wrist

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Looks like a little square gold pillow on your wrist like a little Barbie pillow  Our show today brought to you by personal capital love these guys. In fact, I interviewed the CEO the founder of personal capital on  on  triangulation a couple of years ago Bill Harris, he was former CEO of PayPal and  Intuit knew a lot about finance and the financial markets and he told me at the time he was starting this thing up  I joined it and I'm so glad I did because it's fantastic  The idea is we all need to plan for our future  You know our investments are gonna what's it believe me ain't gonna be Social Security our investments keep us alive  When we retire it's so important to plan for that  But some but you know depending on your age and interest there are ways and ways to do this and a lot of us for instance  Might hire a personal financial planner a broker  Who really often is just making himself rich not you  Because I've got his commissions  Maybe we have that person we don't trust them or we trust them too much or maybe if you're a geek  I think I suspect this is the case. This is my case. Oh, I'm not gonna take advice from a human  I'm gonna do all the you know website research and all of that stuff and I never get around to it  Personal capital is a very good solution for us  It will automatically you put in all your stuff. It'll tell you where you stand  It'll tell you if your assets are allocated properly it'll give you calculators that let you know how you're doing  It helps you make smarter financial decisions  You see everything in one place if you want advice they have a team of objective advisors who are not paid on commission  They're certified financial planners who will help you  But they also have all sorts of automated stuff so that you can see exactly what you're doing one of the most important things  I found out is something called rebalancing your portfolio as you make investments  You know you're supposed to depending on your age make investments in equities bonds  International national in various proportions the problem is if one sector does really well  Then you're suddenly unbalanced and you're supposed to every quarter go in and make sure that your investments are properly apportioned  And if one sector is growing a lot reinvest that it's it's a simple concept something very few people do this will help you do it  Automatically little things like that there are now half a million people using personal capital. They're managing more than what was it?  Was a huge number a billion dollars in  In in revenue this is a great solution a hundred billion dollars wow  They have it on Apple. They have it on Android. They have it at Amazon Amazon tablets  They all of course there's a web interface as well, and it's free  so there's no reason not to do it go to personal capital comm slash twig and  And and at the very least get your stuff in there and get an idea  You know they also have which is really nice an Android where app their Android app talks to Android where and we'll give you alerts  You can set alerts and say I want to know how the markets doing if it does this much or whatever  Just a neat idea. I love it personal capital comm  You know we spend so much time talking about health you know health things from our watches and health  What about your financial health?  That that deserves a little attention to if you do the right thing with your personal health you might live long enough you need  Something if for your old age personal capital comm slash twig  And we thank them so much for their support of this week in Google, so I borrowed Jason's moto 360 for a few days  So I have an experience of it, but I'd love to know you guys have had it for a week now  Mm-hmm you like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well I mean speaking of disclosing biases  So the only other smartwatch I've ever had is the LG G watch yeah everybody got this at Google IO  Right I mean I've never had a pebble  I haven't had the gear live or anything so and I like the G watch I felt like the start of something  But this watch I like a lot. It's a watch that I want to wear doesn't feel like a nerd watch  It's much better looking aesthetically. I think it's it's way better. It feels a lot more like a watch  It doesn't draw as many weird looks  I the charger is much much better and easier  It's it's it's a it's much more attractive and shows the time it's wireless

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not pogo plugs you just rest the watch sideways in it and it becomes if you wish a nightside claw a bedside clock

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's actually and it's quite nice. Yeah. Yeah, I thought that the flat tire design was good really gonna bug me  I don't even see it. I don't even see it. Maybe that means that I'm a terrible person  I don't have any aesthetic taste it really doesn't bother me. I love the round. I love the round face  This one's got a heart monitor which the g-watch didn't have and I was saying to Jason last night at all about Android  I think I don't know that it's working quite the way that it should like I had I had a speaking gauge when I spoke at  A conference this weekend, and I was really really nervous and by 11 a.m. I got the like being like you've reached your activity goal for the day  Or because this thing is defective like am I defective was the watch defective not sure yet  But I downloaded the Motorola connect app and and I'm now using the moto heart rate monitor  I guess this is better than the built-in one. Yeah. Yeah  But yeah, I really really like it  I mean I especially this weekend like I said  I was traveling and Google now really in my opinion is that it's best when you're traveling because you get like time at home and  Places of interest and you know where your photo spots nearby and time to check in you better leave the airport now  And I loved all of that and I used it and I got text messages  I wasn't looking at my phone. I was talking to people I got text messages from you know from home  Hey, you know the baby's going to bed in an hour  You want to talk to her and you know it buzzed on my wrist and like that's the whole point, right?  Like that's that's what these things are supposed to do. That was to help you live your life  More easily and and it definitely did that so and I'm wearing it  I'm putting it on every day and I'm charging it every night  Which means that I really like it because normally before this I wasn't wearing a watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff what do you think you agree?  Oh, you're muted muted you're muted  You can move your lips all you want it's still not gonna help you got on me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you tap on in Skype? There we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello, you hear me? Yeah, there you go. Yep  So I agree with what much what Gina said but I have a few but I knew you wouldn't like it I knew it  I like it I like it I like it, but it's a very first-generation. I think that I'd agree with you on that  Here are my complaints the primary one is that I don't like the fact that it's dark all the time  So I turned on the ambient so I could just see till the time all the time and it went out of power within  I think 10 or 12 hours. No sooner than that eight hours. Yeah, I was gone. So that's a ridiculous  I'll watch the day doesn't know what time it is. It's just it's just worthless  Obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So well when you raise it to when you raise it to look at it, it turns on no  No, I've got to go like this. I know it doesn't always do it. That's why they price them on it  You know, I agree. That's the flaw. That's the flaw  It doesn't have enough battery life to keep on all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It conspires with the light switch in my office because it thinks I'm dead all the time  More Jeff and then and then I try to use the heartbeat thing and it shows what many have suspected  It can't find one. You ain't got one, huh? Oh  Oh  Man, I just go  Oh, you must be moving too much. Well, no, it's the contrary I'm moving not at all. That's my problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The processor is slow. It's slow. There's a lot of spinning. I think I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think that the the the flat tire is a compromise that Steve Jobs would have never made  Never yeah, the LG round version uses the bezel around it as we discussed last week to solve that problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Flat tires here it just is they hide it behind a metal ring

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right exactly. So so do something to hide it do something to do something. This is this is a design  Scar what did I think?  That's pretty much it I think I think you just right it looks better I love having a you know, I  Go by windows and look at watch watches now when I stop myself. I think well why I'm probably gonna be wearing these for the  Life in some form or another I do love getting updates and alerts that I don't have to pull out my phone  I don't worry when I get a text. I know I'm gonna see it when I get a priority box in by email  I know I'm gonna see it  So I love all of that  The power is to be a big issue. I looked up the LG watch and the the this the LG watch as  I think  30 percent larger battery than the moto and the LG round one has a similar battery bigger battery  So they made a couple really bad compromises on this thing  I think the battery is one and the flat tire is another one, but it's a first-generation product  I still like wearing it. I'm still gonna wear it. I'm still happy with it all in all but I can't wait for generation 2  That's my take I agree with both of you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're both right  And I was trying to decide because I already I bought two for 200  I don't get any of this for free because I didn't go to Google I know so I bought the LG  Android wear  For 200 bucks, so I have an Android wear watch and I was really debating when the 360 went back on sale on Tuesday  Whether I should buy it for 250 bucks and I decided to because it looks much better  Functionality is free. This is much the same it I agree  It's annoying that you cannot have the ambient light on that is the watch face has to go off when it's not being used  I think that's dumb and  It really is a design choice that Motorola made that was dumb. They use an old  TIO map chip that is very poor battery life  I'm not sure why they did it. Maybe it was cheaper. Maybe I don't know why they did it, you know  The thing that's very obvious is this this is the as you said this first generation and in six months  There will be a better watch there absolutely will be so my calculus was which is the best Android wear watch right now  Am I willing to pay 250 bucks knowing that in six months? I'll have another one because it'll be better  Is it worth it for those next six or so months and I decided it was but it was not it was nip and tuck  Yeah, and I did decide to buy it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is that I haven't found the perfect watch face yet, I think I think the black one is the prettiest

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is from the chair. Oh, that's just a fix of like what it would be like if you hid

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well no wouldn't be like that because you see how short the bar is on the bottom on the right  It would have to be that short on the left as well  So I do think that the LG G watch are their round one will be interesting and something to watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw it in the flesh and liked it a lot. Did you okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think round is right what which is why I was stunned that Apple decided to go with square pillow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's there's a rumor and I never I don't really don't put rumors on on the rundown because there's there's so many of them  But uh, but for this discussion, there's one that that the Nexus six and then it's an implausible rumor  So I don't believe it for a second  But just for the sake of discussion that the Nexus six is going to come bundled with the Google Gem watch  Now I don't really believe that because I think it would kind of cost him I would they do marketing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Unless unless Google really wanted to foster the watch market because somebody's got a well started and if Google because because the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  patent for the gem watch has things like a trackpad on the on the on the  What do you call band?  don't get old folks and  You know, maybe other interesting features and so it'd be interesting if they one-upped Apple's watch  I don't know. We'll see I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like round I think one of the things round does the square doesn't do is it fits under the sleeve easier  So it's more like a regular watch. It just slides under your sleeve  That's  not insignificant  One thing that I read somewhere some watch blog pointed out is where the band joins the watch is important  So this is LG much like the Apple the band joins the watch somewhere in the middle  Which means there's a fairly big protuberance underneath the band  But look at yours guys that the watch band joins it at the very bottom of the watch  So that means all of those thickness of the watch is above your wrist  Above the band and that is subtle, but I think that's a huge difference  You know, I think it's aesthetically gorgeous

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the black thing is the does the what does the band on the on the motor go all the way through?  Is here on the LG it's just it just connects the edges

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, the moto is the same I think they're both 22 millimeters standard pin watch bands they can be replaced  I can't find a pin on the moto. Well, it's it's hidden in there. Well that  Then how would you get the pin? I do have somebody's pointing out, you know, there are square watch faces  I do have a Cartier Tank watch that has a rectangular face, but it's much thinner and smaller and elegant  It's not the shape square I don't like it's this it's the bulk of the square I don't like  I agree with you. I both I think you're both right. It's not the perfect watch by any means, but it's the best one out there right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah agreed agreed and I  Saying that like my only experience was the watch because I my expectations were sort of set there. Well, I've tried them all Gina  I have had everyone. Yeah, right and you weren't I remember when before these watches came out you were like, yeah  You know, I don't know if I'm gonna I'm sorry correctly. You said you were skeptical. He's still gonna want to live with this every day  But for right now you're living with it every day and you're you you like it. I am still skeptical

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I I don't think even Apple has solved the conundrum of how do you make the user interface on this something functional?  In fact, I think Google's right to make it simpler Apple's made it more complex  Yeah, which is an interesting turnaround, huh and they've got yeah not one but two buttons

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To let me ask you this  Again, I'm an Android guy  But I can't see wanting to manipulate  Apps on my watch the watch is there as it as an add-on to my phone. I think what's going on  I think the Google Now card is the perfect is the perfect metaphor

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is this is the thing right?  I mean when we when we covered we were talking about ties in on all of an Android and it was just this like  Grid of apps and then we I laughed because I was like I don't want app icons on my on my watch. That's insane  So I agree  Listen, I'm not gonna pass judgments. I haven't seen the Apple watch yet. I think that the scroll wheel is interesting  It feels sort of akin to the first iPod click wheel  You know, I was talking about talking my co-worker and he was saying well  You know if you want to zoom in on images on your watch, you know, how else you're gonna do it  You can't pinch and zoom on a watch face. It's too small and I was like, oh, that's an interesting point  You know, you don't you can't look at images really on on Android wear  What I think that and this is of course a Google fangirl and an Android, you know user and enthusiasts talking  But I think that the key advantage that Google has right now with with wearables is Google now, right?  Like this software is amazing. It's been around forever  They've developed it and this is the card interface that extends to the glasses and to the watch and everybody makes fun of Google Glass  But the reality is is that Google's had a wearable out, you know on real humans for a long time and Android wear  You know and and glass like this this card interface like it just makes sense for this kind of device. So  you know  Apple I just I don't know what the what the Apple experience is gonna be like Apple is still a grid of icons, right?  Like they're like they're well, yeah honeycomb of icons, I guess. Yeah. Yeah honeycomb of icons  How's that gonna work? I don't know  I don't I still I still don't think that like apps should be the entry points into activities, right?  Like I just we have apps apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just that you put the app on the phone and then there is an Android wear extension

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But going to the app is a I hardly ever do it. I don't either. Yeah, it's cute that I can show a compass

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I use the cards. That's what I use

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we should send Apple so the software called hyper card to remind them I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Start the baby time app a lot because my daughter just wants to play with this thing  so I lock it with this app called baby time so she can swipe and whatever do whatever without without ordering food or  Calling China or whatever?  But this is really the only app I take the time to really to really launch  Otherwise, I just use you know that put my regular push notifications  From my phone which I which I which which is great and then  Yeah, I guess just voice search. I guess sometimes I say show me my steps or show me my fix it teardown of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Others way where there was a pin you're right there the pin. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You need a little tool  Yeah, see I'm a watch guy. I I have many watches some very expensive watches  I love watches and  And and so I don't even mind buying these watches I think this is an interesting  Expression of what a watch is  I don't think we're anywhere near where they could be and it may not even be the right form factor for whatever it is  We're looking for  But of everything I've seen and used the the one that I would actually wear all the time is the moto 360

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm-hmm, because it's attractive

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it you know and I think Android wear is pretty close  And and in six months it will be better and and and there's a lot of evolution this we're talking to the g1 of  watches

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true when you think of it that way it's it's yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Android one phones are out and we're gonna get one hundred bucks. These are in India only right now  This is the cheap cheap cheap version  I'm eager to play with one to the phone for the next five billion Google says

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Americans

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not cheap if yeah, I mean that so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Therein lies the rub. Yeah  This is a fantastic initiative and I'm excited about it  But I have to keep reminding myself that a hundred bucks in India is is a small fortune updates from Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you will be able to run the latest version of Android  There's enough power there and they're subsidizing those those those download costs aren't they up to 200 megs of new apps every month  That's a smart. This is this is a probably a loss leader for Google to get into these markets. I think it's great  Seven local languages offline YouTube playback, I think that's kind of interesting  This is what Microsoft was going to do with its its Lumia X series  Also Android base the idea being look you make something really cheap that people can  Make put dip a toe into your services water so they get used to your services and start using them and eventually become full-time customers  So we're gonna get one I think Jason asked if we could get one on your show last night and  Responded somebody from India's gonna send us one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was from the call out on a excellent yeah, he said somebody respond responded right on yeah  With magic

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's how we got a one plus ones. That's how we got  The Firefox phone. It's got amazing audience great audience and we really appreciate it because I think it's when what for a long time  I just really fled the notion of being the gadget guy. I didn't want to be the gadget guy  I want to cover computing but that's where computing is happening. This is the cutting edge of computing that was in your pocket easy  That's not it's also laptops aren't even interesting anymore. This same old same old right but legitimate to the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's happening because there is the cloud. Yes. The cloud is huge. That's where the computing is happening  Absolutely, it's a connection to that. That's it's everything's in the cloud  That's where it is with all the good and bad that comes with that the cloud was inevitable

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought I've been thinking about it and the cloud is inevitable as soon as you have more than one device you need the cloud  Exactly. The cloud has to exist  If there were not a cloud we would have had to invent one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Black leather hint out of stock. Are you getting one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've been excited about the moto X. I am really I  You know you can now you can wave your hand over it because it has infrared sensors and it can I just  Love that little moto X. I thought that was great  And I think they've solved the the two issues I had with it which are screen size and resolution and camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I can't wait. That's great. That's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So for moving on I have a we are something that's actually kind of recent news the last  Let me look at my moto X what comes back on

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Said I sent you an email the document itself words on slide share on Twitter  Robert Thompson who is the president chief executive of News Corp, which is a Murdoch's company just sent a or just released a  scathingly cynical letter to the EU  Against Google and if I can give you a few of the excerpts here  The company has evolved from a wonderfully feisty creative Silicon Valley startup to a vast powerful and often  unaccountable bureaucracy which is sometimes  Contemptuous of intellectual property and routinely configures its search results in a matter that is far from objective  This is News Corp talking. I was corp. Hey, let's just keep that lunch New York friggin post  Oh, where there are  Where was the next one there are damn it I look for all the quotes so I could read them out  Well, there are many honorable many many honorable and thoroughly professional individuals working at Google  We have learned not to be naive about the company  The shining vision of Google's founders has been replaced by a cynical management  Which offers advertisers impressively precise data about users and content usage. Yeah, you're jealous  But has been a platform for piracy  But has been a platform for piracy  What and the spread of malicious networks what all the while driving more traffic and online?  advertising dollars to Google this is insane

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely and platform for piracy. What are they talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because this is more I've watched Murdoch Murdoch and his minions all scream that you can get his movies  Is it so this is Rupert talking kind of well, of course it is. Of course it is. It's through the mouthpiece of Robert Thompson  a  Google has been remarkably successful in its ability to monetize users  But has not shown the willingness even though it clearly has the ability to respect fundamental property  Meanwhile in recent months Google has developed a quote certification process for Android related products  Which allows it to delay or deny content companies and other business to access to the mobile operating system  Huh, I don't think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apples far worse. I think it's pretty straightforward if you want to make an app for Android  How long does that approval process take?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right virtually every newspaper in Europe is in the midst of upheaval and some will surely not exist five years from now in part  Because of their own flawed strategy and lack of leadership  Well, that's good also because value of serious content has been commodified by Google by Google by the internet sites  Has been undermined by aggregation of content which transfers the front page to the Google homepage. Oh, please  Readers have been socialized into accepting this egregious aggregation as the norm. No, it's what readers wanted

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. We didn't want to read your stupid front page. We want to go right to the article we cared about  Exactly. Google didn't make us do that. It just made it possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The net made it possible the web. It's called the internet  There will be no shortage of opinions in fact opinions will proliferate  But they will be based on ever flimsier foundations  The quality of discourse mind you this is the New York Post these are the people who started Fox News  The quality of discourse will inevitably deteriorate and the intemperate trends. We are already seen in much of Europe  Yes, will proliferate  proliferation of intemperate trends

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  film an 11 of  evil  Times is on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this comes from Robert Thompson an otherwise smart guy, I know is he an editor what does he what does he do there?  He was the he was the editor of the Wall Street Journal  He's now chief executive of News Corp  which remember had to be split off from what is now 20th Century Fox because  This is the company that hacked dead girls phones, right?  These are the schmucks right do this crap and they dare come out and of course the BBC turns around and does a story immediately  Saying oh news Corp goes after Google. Do we remember people who these people are? This is deadly cynical  Also, just like actual Springer in Germany  These are companies that pride themselves on being conservative  Free market anti big government. What do they do when they get in trouble in their own business and have their own bad benefits?  Yeah, I'm getting lots of heartbeats on my watch right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  read activity goal  That's a pretty great rant though Jeff I enjoyed that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got this from a birdie and  The the BBC story is out so it's been out for the last 20 minutes, but I hadn't seen the full text anywhere else  This is the full text. I don't think you can get it  I have a link on my Twitter to slide share and we can put it up as well  But I just find this is just  horribly horribly cynical the FT did a story this week about  Europe going mad against tech companies mainly Google  This trend is getting worse and worse when I was at IFA last week. I gave a talk about techno euro panic and  It's getting worse and worse and worse  And I think the Europe's gonna get left behind because government is gonna play with these big old legacy companies and who the hell is gonna  Want to invest in Europe when this is what happens?  End of ramp  Thank you by the way  While I'm at it while I'm at it one more I lied. It's not the end of it  The FT reports that the German justice minister just said that Google should reveal its algorithms  Yeah, I coach give out its formula yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's interesting. And what would what would you learn by reading Google's algorithms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you know why don't you recite what an algorithm looks like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really it's just a couple of tweet links explanation. I'm sure that Google's just holding it back  No trouble at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Reveal your ideas. They should be they think that Google should be  All inclusive and objective even though they're not and so so they're the letter that I mentioned last week from  German publishers about the same topic about the EU's and they're trying to stop the EU's  Anti-trust agreement with Google and the EU is already this written derailed it and now they're trying to stick more  pins in the voodoo doll  But it said that well Google dares to send readers if you look for shoes to their advertisers  Yes, they sent it all kinds of other shoe places  So I go to built which is owned by Axel Springer and there's a little thing right at the top of the pages his shoes  Sure, I go there and what do they do they send to their own shoe advertisers. They don't send anybody else you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's so funny  So well, sorry about that. No good. Thank you. Great. Thank you. Thank you  What do you think just as completely tangent  What do you think Google's algorithm looks like Gina? Is it a page two pages a hundred pages?  Is it could it is it okay? I guess it's got to be encapsulated as code. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean  Honestly at the scale they're at right now  I mean I can't even imagine  What it is. I mean, I mean, I think that it's a collection of signals and you know tweaks here and there  But I think it's you know more than just weights of measures, right? It's got there's got to be I mean  It's got to be monstrous at this point in time, right? I mean, this is how many years are we into this now at this point?  I mean you're asking like how technically is it represented? I mean, I think it's more than a config file

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I remember talking in the early days of Google when they were still young  I've mentioned this before and they were still reaching out to journalists and they had a little luncheon with Larry and Sergey and a  Few of us journalists to talk about it and Larry said well, you know every day  I go to the end of the search results the bottom. I'm not sure I really understood what he was saying  So I'm probably translating this poorly. It was in English, but I  and I look at the  Remainders and I can tell from there where we're going wrong  So I tweak it sounded like he literally went in there and changed page rank daily. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do I would bet that they have  Made it in such a way that tweaking it is very easily and I think that they probably tweak it daily  Right. So it is it is  Encapsulated in some sort of way in some sort of data  I mean, I  Probably has  I just saw him this weekend. I bet he would be able to tell us  I don't know that he would tell us but is it in Python? It is it in C  Seriously, I mean it seems like it would be some sort of document that the software reads right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, so let's think about the raw material is the spider crawls, right?  the the the index of everything which is just somehow they're  They're churning on every web page that they see millions and millions of second and they're making some  Representation of it a hash or something, right?  Right and then and it's probably fairly abstract it includes keywords that I don't know what it includes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Knowledge graph objects keywords. It's really abstract. Yes. Yeah, and it's probably a database, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's represented as some sort of database database a big I mean, it's hard to imagine the scale at which just operates  Right, but it's so there's a database and then something must be run over that database. I don't know  No, I don't know how it works. There's no way I can even imagine this because you do a query  You type in as something on Google  Mm-hmm, and then what there then a machine goes and does this to that database?  Yeah, I mean right and it does it in an eighth of a second for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Billion people a minute and it's personalized to you now. So it also is looking at your  context  The signals that uses are not just the signals about content  Can we do a special with Mac cuts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean that'd be amazing and didn't they just publish something recently that said that the amount of energy it takes to do one  Google search is like the amount of time it takes your body to do like ten heartbeats  I don't know if I'm paraphrasing this incorrectly, but it's  But it's less than you would have thought right like this wasn't there that whole scare at some point like all the CPU and energy  That Google uses to run one search is equal to you know, like they're killing the world and actually they're not I mean  This stuff is super mature and very very fast and super cached and and just so responsive at this point  That's why you know, this is at a scale that no one who you know one else  This is doing no one other than the people who work on this at Google truly get how this is I doubt any individual

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google truly gets it. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably right and then you know, it's even bigger than that. It's not that it waits for your query  It's giving you back good results while you type it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's right. It's running a search on every keystroke. I'm having a this is a dream. This isn't real. This is impossible  I'm in a vat somewhere connected to a bunch of tubes and I made this whole thing up because  And we never even question it  It's impossible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's just let's just be sure rest assured that there's a lot of there are a few people at Google at least  Laughing their rear ends off right now listening to us trying to figure it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to do a special how Google works. You don't have to reveal any proprietary information  I don't need to know, you know those secret sauce  It's like a high-level strokes, you know, you could say how altavista worked. I guess it's kind of like that only bigger  It's a scaling problem, but it's a scaling problem it's hard to even imagine  Yeah, it is it is there is a page somebody sent me how search works  From algorithms to answers  Inside Google search, are you ready?  Let's see how search works when I was looking at this this morning. They take a giant pile of spaghetti  60 trillion individual pages  And we saw it them. Okay, so far. This is kind of what we said  Sort the pages by their content and other factors. Yeah. Yeah, then we keep track of it in an index  The index is 100 million gigabytes large

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  100 million gigabytes that is unbelievable. It's just the index. That's unbelievable and it's increasing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  every moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now because it has to be that fast, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We write this is this is like this is where the this is where the spaghetti is hidden  We write programs and formulas to deliver the best results possible. They're all in box  as you search  Boop boop algorithm, it's all about algorithms get to work looking for clues to better understand what you mean spelling autocomplete query  understanding Google instance search methods synonyms  Based on the clues we pull relevant documents from the index, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the algo is exactly is how you pull things from the index. Yeah, right?  That's what we're talking and they do talk a little bit about these modules that it might be right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's search methods. There's autocomplete. They're spelling  It even fix it even spells better than I do  then it  Processes site we rank the results based on site and page quality using over 200 factors

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Freshness right so this choosing and then there's ranking context

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean that we knew this this is in very broad strokes. It's this algorithm and part that I'm very interested in  You know, I understand clues it had to make a big database and then it has to very rapidly search that database  But how does it know?  Wow  Fascinating. This is a nice page though. I have to say yeah, this is a nice question. Yeah  Yeah  Algorithms, it's all about algorithms. You want the answer not trillions of web pages

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no the web should be objective  Everything should be equal  There should be no preference given to anything. That's how the web is supposed to work  That's what they say in Europe

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sup. I suppose you could take a college class in this stuff  There mean, you know, you learn how to write a compiler. You probably should learn how to write a search engine  All right, maybe it's just my ignorance, but I find it fascinating  Let's take a break get our picks of the week or number of the week.

Transcript:  And we're gonna have a lot more of Jason on this show. I gotta tell you  a lot of the people who were there have found homes already in other spots and  They'll be will be hearing from them a lot because I just this is part of his incomparable

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They know their stuff. They've been out there. They're the best people  but I've argued that that media companies were stupid when  Journalism companies when they did start laying off people what they should have done is said, you know what instead of severance?  here's an investment in you starting your new company and  We will send you traffic and we will sell ads for you and we will have a right to use your content and we'll you know  You're not on staff anymore  But you can build your own equity or your own value and we can help you do that  I think that's actually by the way, we're gonna reduce our cost and give our readers the same value  We always gave them and probably be able to increase the coverage we have that's brilliant. No, that's not the way we think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think that's what we're gonna end up having to do at some point, right?  Interesting really? Well, yeah because we're in a we live in a world where the idea of Fedder  so it's kind of okay, so it's a little bit like the web where  It's kind of the old media notion that you have a company that  Has a bunch of people who work at that company creating  editorial  What everybody wants their own thing now? That's what I did. I created my own thing. And so  While what I'm building looks feels like an old-school media empire  It's not gonna in the long run makes sense. Chad doesn't want to stay here forever. He wants to ideally anybody  Anybody who works here wants to have his own thing  Anybody who works here wants to have his own thing I'm not putting words in your mouth Chad but  employee XYZ  Ultimately have his own thing. So somehow we're gonna have to figure that out because I don't I don't want to be a Mac world  Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where starting on thing is so sort of hero a size, you know, I mean, I actually I think it's great for people start their own companies  I just don't I don't think it's totally for everyone. But there is a sort of in our industry  There is a sort of there is a push for that, you know what I mean?  There's an expectation and I think that's I don't think it's a bad thing. Well in a way that's what I do with you and Gina

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean you and Jeff where you guys are have your own thing  We're not we're just a part one thing that you do in your own thing. Yep. So that's how we've solved that with contributors  Mm-hmm. One of the ways we've solved that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're you're a platform and I think that the what I argue is that vertical  Corporations and industries get replaced by ecosystems and ecosystems are made up of three layers  Platforms entrepreneurial effort and then networks to bring them to critical mass. Well, we're a platform then I'll choose platform  Once once  you know if I make my own, you know my own show and Chad makes his own show and Gina makes five shows because she's got  so much more energy than the rest of us and  They appear on the network. And so what do you do as a network? You can bring traffic to them  You can sell ads for them right you see you're you're you're both  on the platform layer and on the network layer, I think I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Need to consult with you Jeff because that's what we're trying to figure out right now. I would love to talk about I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's I think that is the model and and it my work in New Jersey and what we now call the New Jersey model  Is we have 50 sites large gigantic and tiny  Profit not-for-profit all kinds of different focuses and they now share content and  With embeddable content and they work together and I'm about to try to get some ad networks together and that's that's where I think media go  I think that the ecosystem model I'll be writing about that in my new incredibly boring, but I had to do it for my work  metastasized white paper called  out November 6 publish your Paris  On the web because when I attack paywall people say I'm not gonna sell it not put it free on the web to get on  Medium and people say oh you've had a medium.
