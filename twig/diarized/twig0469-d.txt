Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I used to actually happen  It wasn't quite as dramatic as that  But the first time it happened at like one in the morning  After I was getting home from the airport and didn't think about it. That is the last time it ever happened  Have a little welcome home Stacy on all my solos is a flight switch

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's funny though that you set that up that's great, you know, I wouldn't you I I've talked about this before I think on the show  there was a guy who had a  Raspberry Pi  Monitoring the Wi-Fi and when employees came in the door and their devices attached to the company Wi-Fi  He played their theme song

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cloudflare was that a cloud flare? I believe it was yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I always thought it'd be kind of nice to have a theme song play when you came home  What would your theme song be Leo?  Believe it or not. I'm walking on air the greatest American hero  Wow, that's just the first thing that came to mind  Yeah, cloud flare did it isn't that funny?  That's amazingly you even knew that story Stacey Wow  All right, is it I is it I is it IOT is it IOT is it IOT yet?  So the news is in Twitter has put Alex Jones on a timeout  With a dunce cap in the corner to you  He so this is the story that's been ongoing since last Friday  In fact, the New York Times  in a rare  moment of accessibility Twitter invited two Times reporters to watch their deliberations about  whether to ban InfoWars from Twitter as as  had already happened on Facebook and Instagram and  Spotify and Apple and iTunes  The InfoWars app is still on the App Store both Google and iOS  And in fact the two reporters came I get I wonder if Jack Dorsey thought that they would this would be the outcome  They decided not to ban InfoWars  Even though CNN was able to come up with at least seven tweets that clearly violated  Twitter's rules and Twitter said well if he violates the rules will ban him  Well now they have except. Oh, no, they gave him a timeout. He's off for a week  He's in read-only mode for seven days  Alex Jones can still browse Twitter posts, but can't interact with other users by tweeting retweeting or liking

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they're gonna scream that he's shadow banned

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, hold on a second. He can tweet but none of us can see it. Oh  Only his followers see it. How does I don't quite know that's interesting. I don't know exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  how this works, but  You're right the way CNET describes his Twitter confirmed Tuesday meaning he can browse Twitter posts  But can't interact with other users by tweeting retweeting or liking posts  He also had to delete the offending tweet which included a snippet of video

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So he can't tweet. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not clear, but I'm guessing he can't tweet. I've never ever been banned. So I don't know  Apparently the the video that finally broke the straw that finally broke the Dorsey's back  It's still on periscope  Oh actually, no after CNET mentioned that the Twitter suspended Infowars periscope and Twitter accounts in the video Jones encouraged  Viewers to have your battle rifles ready  Mainstream media is the enemy and now it's time to act on the enemy. That sounds like a clear call

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and I'd say that once someone's done that I'd say that's kind of out with you forever  Like he's gonna learn a lesson from his timeout one week seems

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Less than adequate

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and so then we have to wait for the next then we'll fight over there. They don't get all this attention for every tweet  He does  So that we can fight over whether that crosses the line or not until somebody inside Twitter decides that crosses the line

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then he goes again. And that brings us to Zaynep to Fiki's piece, which I'm sure I  Probably read it on your blog read about it on your blog actually Jeff  How social let's see, let me let me see if I can find this  This is how social media took us  This is not the piece I was gonna talk about but we will talk about that if the other one was  Yeah, it's it's a history of social media. Basically, it's I don't know if it's  It adds anything to the conversation. She does have a piece and by the way to Vicky's great, but the lessons of the era  Which are maybe necessarily is as insightful as some of the conversations I think we've had here  What the article I was thinking of which wasn't I guess from her was was described how  Here it is this is Joan Donovan's study with that she did with Dana Boyd, right?  in which basically the conclusion is this it the conclusion is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This isn't it. No. No, it was it's not on the rundown

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The conclusion essentially is that  You that by that it doesn't do any that basically our  longtime premise that  Sunlight is a disinfectant that free speech  There's only good solution to to bad speech is more free speech isn't right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That because the manipulators took advantage of that, right?  Right. So that's why they argue for strategic silence  They argue for strategic silence

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the problem is that somebody says something outrageous like as Alex Jones just did and what happens is it gets amplified

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By media picking it up by the debunking because they think the media are the enemy so they're happy about the debunking, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It only supports it. Yes, and the evidence is that in fact  Well, I'm sorry. I'm ill-prepared here because I thought the I thought I had pin I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Had sent to that after NPR interviewed the bozo who ran the  Washington right-wing thing I said I said I tweeted NPR  Invite Dana Boyd and Joan Donovan to Washington and then Joan  tweeted the  Link to the advice. Yeah  But I can't find

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where did I put it  you know, I  Read a lot of stuff during the week and I always know when I say something case

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's in the Guardian the case for quarantining the case dreamest ideas quarantining. I'll send it to you right now  To Google it. Oh, but I thought I was gonna be faster than you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I already said it to you there. So this is we've had Joan on the show before many times and Joan Donovan  Yes, we are do very good work  on which they talk about  All of these issues that we talk about a lot data and Society Institute. They have a media manipulation research initiative  That's what Joan is part of and the conclusion from theirs and this is based on their work their studies, right?  This isn't right. This isn't just a opinion  Newsrooms must understand that even with the best of intentions they can find themselves being used by extremists  If telling stories didn't change lies journalists would never have started in their careers  But we know that words matter and that coverage makes a difference in this era of increasing violence and extremism  We and that's Joan and Dana appeal to the editors to choose strategic silence over publishing stories that fuel the  radicalization of their leaders

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'm told that a  Well full disclosure is the news integrity initiative for which I raised money with money from Facebook Craig Newmark and others  Funded data in society  so I'm plugging in something that I quite like so so  This idea of strategic silence was brought up recently to a bunch of editors and they as they tend to just belched  No, no, no, no, no, it's our job and more information. No, no, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but that comes from that ground of being that I always came from which is sunlight disinfects

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So another reporter another journalist in the room said, okay. Okay, don't call it strategic silence. Call it responsible reporting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And she's true. I mean I there are so many things actually the most recent was a I saw it in the tech world  Everybody tweeting about T-Mobile or writing about T-Mobile's silly  customer service stuff it's based on a  Game board that they sent out and so there's tweets about that  But the verge did a full story on T-Mobile's change and customer service  I just there are so many stupid things that we just knee-jerk respond to because other people are talking about it  And that's that actually was the standard at a couple places that I've been including fortune  Yeah, are people talking about it? We need to write and it's me not need to yeah  Yeah, we may not have to have you know, the take that believes it but we have to cover it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also fueled at Jay Rosen's brought this a lot up a lot to false equivalents the the bring  You know both sides of the story, you know, I say the sky's blue Jeff says the sky's green  Let's talk between the two of them instead of saying no Jeff's wrong. The sky's blue  It manifestly is blue  It also comes from frankly the world we live in where link bait  It becomes the the mode because traffic becomes the way you make money. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is this is a great example of crazy stuff, right  Back in I think was last year that humans didn't actually see the sky as blue  Because they didn't have a word for the color blue  So this is if you google people don't see our color no color blue. You'll see the articles about it. It was  I'm sure they saw it they color sky  Well, that's the question  so they taught it's like they didn't see the sky because they didn't have a word for the color and they didn't pay attention and  They they pulled examples from like Homer's red wine. See so wine dark see but he never used

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  blue a  philologist Lazarus Geiger  Analyzed ancient Icelandic Hindu Chinese Arabic and Hebrew to see if they ever said blue  They didn't in fact the first society to have a word for the color blue was the Egyptians and in fact  They weren't the only culture that could produce blue dye

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that fascinating you guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but that's according to  science alert  Just because there was no word for blue does that mean our ancestors couldn't see it now  This is that this is that famous story where?  the was it the Aztecs  Didn't when Cortez sailed up  Didn't see the ships because they'd never seen a ship and they couldn't see it. They didn't have any way. I don't know. I wonder

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they saw it. They just didn't have a meaning attached to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean that but that man wasn't registered there in the brain see the thing the what the thing  No, I don't see a thing because I don't have a way to  So in 2006 a psychologist from Goldsmiths University of London Jules Davidoff worked with the Himba tribe from Namibia  In their language, there's no word for blue and no distinction between green and blue  So he showed members of the tribe a circle with 11 green squares and one obviously blue square. In fact, there's a picture  The Himba tribe could not  Tell Davidoff which of the squares was a different color  Those who did hazard a guess at which square was different said took a long time to get the right answer and there were a  lot of mistakes  Interestingly the Himba have lots more words for green than we do so he showed English speakers the same  experiment 11 squares of one shade of green and then one odd square of a different shade  Okay, look, can you see let's let me show you this can for those of you watching the video and you at home  Which one's a different shade I hate this stuff I can tell I  See if I can tell do you see it? I see it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's this one is like that two-color dress thing you think it's that one. Yeah, I wouldn't yeah, I guess I can't see it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You well, maybe because you're watching the stream or something. Let's see if I'm right. Yes, Stacey. I don't see it was that one. Oh  Go Leo, you can kind of tell me only I could tell here because I could see the difference but it's it's a subtle difference  Huh  Another study by MIT showed that native Russian speakers who have many words for blue, but only  What don't have one single word for blue but instead of a word for light blue?  Globally dark blue senior can discriminate between light and dark shades of blue much faster than English speakers  So the suggestion is that if you have a word for it, you're gonna be able to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See it more quickly. Hmm. Anyway, that was a total digression, but I love when like whenever people say the sky is blue  I'm like actually what would you call it? See me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's seen me  So George Lincoln Rockwell, there's a name. We don't like to repeat. Oh man. Yeah  head of the American Nazi Party in the 60s  In his autobiography, he wrote only by forcing the Jews to spread our message with their facilities  Could we have had any hope of success in?  counteracting their left-wing race mixing propaganda  So in other words, this is Jones this is Joan and Dana's quote right in the beginning of their article in other words  This is well known to the extremes  Nobody's gonna listen to you by yourself. So you need some amplification  Campus by campus from Harvard to Brown to Columbia  Rockwell would use the violence of his ideas and brawn of his followers to become headline news  Rockwell to compel media coverage said he needed one a smashing dramatic approach  Which could not be ignored without exposing the most blatant press censorship and to a super tough hardcore of young fighting men  To enable such a dramatic presentation to the public. I remember those pictures too. Don't you Jeff? Yeah. Yes, I do  Contemporary Jewish and those were the days of pure  I'm sorry contemporary can Jewish community groups challenged journalists to consider not covering the white supremacists March their ideas  They called this strategy quarantine

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep  We do the same thing with suicides  Yes, then the data are there that that if you don't report the method  Right. It's the opposite here. I say don't report the message report the method

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've often thought if you didn't put pictures and the names up of mass killers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's another comment thing that we're like and glorify them. They become yes. Yes, we do  I feel like them. What are the recent shootings? Actually, I think it was the Times said they weren't going to  do a profile on the shooter and  That was the argument it was it was actually kind of really interesting that they drew that line

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is we did for them in this world of a 24 news cycle where there's incredible demand to fill that clock of  link Beatty  You know sites that that all all to all websites that make money based on the amount of traffic and  Now she woke up  and  You know  Frankly a certain amount of sensationalism that's embraced even by mainstream outlets like the New York Times  It's hopeless quarantine is hopeless. There's too much  pressure  To do it to cover it  Yeah, a lot of us the business model it is the business model and then what will happen is people will look for  Justifications as as your editors at fortune did well, but the people are interested. We're just giving them what they want  Yeah, they click on it that's what so of course we're gonna give them what they click on why wouldn't we  Now there's here's a good argument for why you might not want to so yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See if you've heard of the startup called civil no, yes, I've met the  What are the founders car go ahead? No, okay, Matthew Matthew  aisles or

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's a woman. This is a block chain

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so watch out watching and you know the gravy that makes any meatloaf taste good. Yeah  And I couldn't understand it all I so I went over there purposely yesterday saying brainwash me because I don't get it and I don't  100% get it or you know, I'm not gonna fully bet on where it goes  but the interesting thing to me was that by using blockchain one thing it enables is to  You have a currency you can give people for certain behaviors  And so imagine where you have a site we have that it's called a dollar

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they're doing they did a token sale to give you well, they're about to they have nothing or they're about sorry  To give you credibility so you can vote up and down things now what I know you could vote with your dollar

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know Leo, here's another way to look at it. So so let's say we have a community site  Let's say you have your let me guess. Do you buy these tokens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, you do. But give me a minute Leo. Give me a calm down Leo. Give me a fun journalism. I was there  I've been brainwashed now, but I was there too. Okay, plus it was leaving their offices that I fell so maybe that  Scrambled my whole brain  But but but imagine you had a community site where you you said you can join by giving me dollars or you can join by giving  Me labor or you can be rewarded with membership because you're the best peacemaker in the group or you you brought in the best photos  Or you did something wonderful, right?  You have a way to get other behaviors with other currencies than just money or access to content  That's all we do in the media now is give me money. I'll let you see my content. Oh, but there's there's lots of content out there  I don't really need your content and  or  Give me your attention and I'll go get advertisers and I'm gonna do everything I can to beat you over the head to get more  Attention out of you, right?  So it's the beginning of trying to rethink business models a little bit a little bit we bet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean we have there are ways we have dollars we have votes  We have attention. I  would submit that because  votes especially  Seem to be something people are very hard reluctant to part with that instead of creating new tokens  We just sort of emphasize the tokens. We've got dollars votes attention. Let's that's really let's really  Focus on that why why dilute it with other tokens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, because then you'd be in a case where well what I'm saying is you're not necessarily giving tokens you could give other other

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rewards like membership discounts other things. What's the point of the tokens though? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're gonna you you you've pushed me to my limit already and I hit my head on the ground  So it funds so I think the token sale helps fund

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Operations for a little bit but also allows you to the way they explained it to me and this was in April  so things may have changed is  That gives you credibility on the site so you can your vote counts more  You buy votes you're buying votes literally

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have a mechanism in place to stop that but I can't remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The people they pay it out to journalists  They use it to pay for stories  And talk about it, it's a really interesting  Soon be rubles, that's why

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure it's fine. You guys are smart. I you wouldn't fall for anything silly. I'm  We're interested in how it turns out it is a new model that's exactly well said stacy well said

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But see this is why I think that I really wanted to highlight Dana and Jones article because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's fix the existing model  But and if and then if you say well, we can't fix it then okay  I'll be I'm willing to look at it. I don't know if we can fix it. Maybe not. I'm really  Intention-based ad model

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Will in a scale of 10 to 10, but I think it's a really good model  Will in a in an abundance based market  Will get you in trouble because as you go up in abundance you go down a price and you go up in desperation  So you go up in counts and Kardashians, right? That's the formula, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And crazy youtube stunts. That's the same thing that's happening with people who's exactly yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah somebody somebody I know actually got his show's logo tattooed on his back  This show

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This show or his show actually it was his butt  Oh me. This is you guys you  Yeah, crazy youtube. Yeah, I did that for dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Charity dollars. Yeah united network united nations children's fund unicef

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So please tell me that was not for your own revenue because no, I wouldn't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's crazy. I sold bricks for my own revenue  so uh our uh  I have a question for you. I want you to debunk this ap exclusive  Google wants to know where you go so badly  Says the ap  That they record your movements even when you explicitly tell them not to  So, uh google i'm sorry ap hired  People they identified as computer science researchers at princeton. I'm guessing that's ed felton and crew

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's it's I think it was a ravie hold on. Oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  um  to verify this  saleh sultan saleh sultan, okay  because uh  so as you all know, uh when you  Say open google maps. It says we would like permission to access your location  And in general on the iphone there are three settings for that. No  Only when the app is open or anytime  And you choose and I believe the iphone enforces that  If you agree to let it record your location over time google maps will display that history for you in a timeline  I like that. I leave that turned on but some people don't want that  Here's however

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What google says you can turn off location history at any time  With the location history off the places you go are no longer stored  The ap says that isn't true even with location history paused  Some google apps automatically store time stamped location data without  asking  They do point out it's possible although laborious to delete it  I'm, not sure how laborious it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  um, it's not that laborious, but it is so  Do you want to let jeff talk about how it's okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You go to myactivity.google.com we've already shown how to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How to do that, so I think this is a failure of communication and transparency. It may not be evil  But this is a perfect example of engineering people or people who are building a system  Not thinking ahead as to how they're communicating with users and how people are going to interpret that  so  it is  I mean you could almost call it a cultural divide in some sense because like  People who are technically savvy may be like  Well, yeah, that's there. We left that option there, you know, of course, it's going to do this  but most people do not interpret it that way and I I think  this is a real problem because  Google and others are asking for such deeply personal information  That they have to err on the side of telling people everything because most people are going to click  Yes, most people are going to be like, oh, yeah  I totally want to leave my location tracking on so you can tell me how long it's going to take me to get to my  next appointment

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so or the weather wherever I am and maybe uh, it would be a bit of a hooved ap  to check other map apps because  What they say is well, even if you have location history turned off the minute you open the maps app it records your location  But I betcha  That's exactly what every map app does. Otherwise, it can't tell you. Yeah, and how else can it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google is  Yeah, well people don't know that again. They don't know that it's being stored  You could say hey give me the location now, but don't keep it don't send it to google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that has to be sent to google though. So the maps can do its job

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, even for some they also say oh my god when you search for chocolate cookies  It knows your location. Yeah, because maybe you're looking for a store that sells them near you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not what the user expects

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. I agree. How do you know and this is what jonathan meyer the princeton computer scientist who did the  Work, he's a former technologist for the fcc's enforcement bureau  He says quote if you're going to allow users to turn off something called location history  Then all the places where you maintain location history  Should be turned off. That seems like a pretty straightforward position to have google is here's google's response  This is an a statement to the ap there are a number of different ways that google may use location to improve people's experience including  location history  Web and app activity and through device level location services  We provide clear descriptions of these tools and robust controls so people can turn them off  And on and delete their histories at any time  So they didn't really address this issue of look I turned off location history  Why are you saying then you asked for a function that required the location you're implicitly turning it back on is that the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The deal that's kind of yeah. No, but search should not require my I I can see why no I disagree strongly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just I use this example all the time. Sorry my lights off. All right  Um, I I I I sorry I didn't interrupt those tc. I'm sorry. I I believe you did though chub

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say that most people  most people when they search for something they like  They just want to know the information and not just so chocolate chips  They don't necessarily want to know the chocolate chips cookies near me  They usually add near me if they want to start adding location, but people are not necessarily aware of how this works

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We are very tech savvy people. We understand you. Let me I give you my example. Yes, please  So if I if I if I right if I right now search for pizza  There's a good chance I want pizza near me. I'm not going to say near me because i'm going to presume google knows  That's what I do is I go eat pizza and I probably don't want a pizza recipe  I probably don't want the history of pizza  I probably don't want blog posts extolling the virtues of pizza  I probably want to eat it now and so I didn't say near me and so the presumption of locality  I bet is far more frequent than we know  And it's presumption and so if I if I and and and I can you know go to um,  What you call it? What's the what's the don't know you?  browser  No, no, no, no in google I can go to a incognito. Thank you incognito window and thank you would be my brain  um  uh  and i'm gonna get a worse experience in search and until you kind of really do that and see what's happening so that  Google's trying to give people what they want is presume that and a lot of times it is local  I know I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get what they're trying to do. That's why I think this is not nefarious  I think it's a miscommunication between the engineering staff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so I think it's nefarious

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do think that they should be more transparent about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where I think it's nefarious because they they aren't really obviously doing this  I mean they don't so here's what scooter x in our chat room says there is a setting  on android and iphone devices  uh  if if if you  disable then re-enable the setting  It will tell you this  Places you go with your devices it will by the way the settings on by default  So you have to turn it off and then on again  Then you will see a pop-up that says places you go with your devices will stop being added to your location and history map  however  uh  if if  But we will from time to time save location information  from  Applications like web searches and maps  As you use them it it informs you of this, but it's not it's hidden  So by the way google could easily fix this by bringing that forward a little bit more, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no objection to that. I think stacy and I would agree that's where I think it's maybe not nefarious

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but it could be an oversight or it could be they'd prefer not to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shake anybody up. Yeah, so I would I would kind of look at this, you know how  Food companies they they love using the word natural which can hide any number of weird sugars or dyes or other  beetle parts  um  This is that kind of  Issue where they're like i'm communicating this are they being nefarious or kind of occlusive like the food companies inclusive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe that's a better word. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the problem is again such personal data  They're asking of us they need to be super transparent because otherwise they're going to lose our trust  And if they lose our trust they're going to lose access to our data and they're gonna we're going to end up with crappier experiences  I mean I have turned off various personalization experiences and my god, nothing works. It's terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the washington post just put up a story saying that i haven't read it yet  Jack dorsey is reconsidering how twitter operates  And you mean he hasn't already  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I saw like a lifelong going in. All right. Well, we'll we'll finish this and we'll go check that out  Oh, sorry, so the ap to demonstrate how powerful these other markers can be  uh asked a  postdoc at princeton gunas akar that's the one you were talking about stacy to carry an android phone with  Location history off  Uh, but and then he shared the record of his google account with the ap  Now even though the phone had location history off didn't have location off. I should point out  Maybe that's an important distinction. It had location history off  The map included his train commutes on two trips to new york visits to the highline chelsea market hell's kitchen central park in harlem  Where somebody licked his neck to protect his privacy?  The ap didn't plot the most telling and frequent marker his home address, but all that stuff was stored  Maybe the distinction is location history  versus location information

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Same was okay. No explain that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he turned off location history, but also a setting on all on all phones iphone and android is location information period  Location services now most people don't turn that off  Because then a lot of what you expect your phone to do stops working maps don't work a lot of things don't work  But in that case you are definitely turning off the location information. I would presume at that point google's not saving it  So I would too we we understand you and I I think understand the distinction between location services and location history  If location services are turned on the location history is turned off, but in the course of events you use  Apps like maps that must of necessity record your location  Some stuff is going to be recorded  Maybe not. I don't know  I think that's your point stacy, which is that a geek could be expected to understand this but normal people could not right?  All right something to be aware of I think google's  Best choice at this point would be and I think they probably will do this to respond by being clearer about what they're doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's that's what everybody should be doing right now. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, I think maybe we've learned this lesson  I hope we have  Uh be clear

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and if they're not clear  Then you have to explain. I mean if you're not clear then the assumption is going to be oh you are selling my phone  You are selling my data to the highest bidder or something. Yeah, you're intentionally obfuscating. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So or google could tell everyone to just chill and take its breathing exercise

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought I thought so everyone's reporting this but I feel like i've seen that before or maybe it was just somewhere else  Maybe it was another app i've had

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yes, this is a very responsible. It is responsive. It is the case that iphones do that  So it's just playing catch up  Actually apple watches not iPhones. Well, maybe iPhones do it too apple watches do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I used to have a desire or a desire a device called the spire  And that would do that whenever it felt that I was getting stressed. I had that yeah it digs it digs into your waist  Oh, I wore it between my my bra. So  but  Apparently I breathe so slowly that they never I never needed it  He was like dude, your respiration is off the charts low and I was like good. Congratulations  Yeah, I don't know if that's a good thing or not. You're not hyperventilating

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, uh jack dorsey says he's rethinking the core actually  Maybe this is a big deal of how twitter works. This is the yeah, there's a little bit of it  This is the breaking story that jeff just

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mentioned. I'm sorry. I thought you were done with the other story. I am now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's rinking thinking the core parts of the social media platform. So it doesn't enable the spread of hate speech harassment false news  including conspiracy theories  Shared by prominent users like alex jones and info wars. This is an interview he did today with the washington post  He said twitter is experimenting with features that would promote alternative viewpoints in twitter's timeline to address misinformation reduce echo chambers  He also expressed openness to labeling bots  And redesigning key elements of the social network including the like button in the way twitter displays users follower accounts  If this if he really is seriously doing this  Uh, this is kind of a change for twitter. They've resisted these things for a long time. They have

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, so so one solution twitter's exploring is to surround false tweets with factual content  So that means they've got to decide what false is right? Yeah  Yeah, facebook is it does similar things with the fact checkers, but that means they got to have a system to identify and determine  Falsity so we they keep on saying and I agree with them. We don't want them to be the arbiters of truth  Um, but they're all being pushed in that position because people are purposefully  In a manipulative way putting up falsity falsehoods  And so then they're going to try to put context by giving you something that disagrees with it now  We need research to say does that do any good or not?  Maybe the opposite

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's an attempt to address it. Wait, isn't that what we're against in terms of journalists?  Which is like silly other side stuff like oh good point. I'm just good point. Yep sky is green

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh, the sky has no color  The sky is the sky

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We can't see the sky. Um, I it's interesting because remember this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's talking to the washington post because he's in washington dc to meet with lawmakers  So this may be that his feet are to the fire  maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  then they label

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead surely he's having moments of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Reflection even I think even he can't be that that obtuse. Yeah, that's why they hired people they hired academics to work on  Uh the health of public conversation their impact on it. It's kind of it's this is another one here  Which is twitter could someday someday could label automated accounts. I think that's a basic and there are good automated accounts  I have an automated account effectively. Yeah, there's good ones. There's nothing wrong with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My account mostly is just a notice that it shows about to begin  Yeah, but that's automated

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Make it transparent  Make it a feature. Yeah, I made a nice bot for you. Remember that we used to be talking about that. Hey, I make bots

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I made you a nice bot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a bot that tweets out some stuff  But the rest of it's me and the bot just tweets out like hey, I just posted this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Especially are you a bot or is your so now what is he gonna label yours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know that's why i'm kind of curious i'm like, oh dear  I guess I should have to I guess I could do another twitter account. Yeah, I have a leo bot account

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe I should move that the thing is nothing would ever appear on my real account  Because oh because I don't know and wait. Yeah, I rarely tweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So to your point about washington leo, uh, the story says that state legislators in california  And federal lawmakers such as mark warner have proposed making this a requirement of law  Which i'm not going to be crazy about  What would the requirement be that you have to label bots?  Oh, but just that  I mean it goes to the thing we've talked about when it comes to for example google's  bot  customer service  You know should you know that it's a bot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On customer service. Yes  I mean, well if it's calling to ask you questions

So let's do the google change log  This is these are things new things you can do with google this week and we'll start with the breathing exercise  So you first you have to search for breathing exercise, right?  Is this a google search  Let's try it. Oh look there. It is if you search for breathing exercise you get a one-minute breathing exercise  This is in the google search bring awareness to your breath  Breathe in is there any uh voice in this no breathe out

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's from 1934 I think we could probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This should be our theme  What do you think i'm gonna i'm gonna vote

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The question is on the floor  Will we make louis armstrong's tiger rag the new theme of this week in google all in favor say aye  Anything is better than what we have in the world  New theme of this week in google all in favor say aye  Anything is better than what we have. I  I'll take that as a yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is our current theme song you haven't heard it? I'm sure I have I just totally

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, let's change it yeah leo picked it in a moment of weakness

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google's public I don't care. This show isn't gonna last plenty of females fine. Geez exactly. We'll do 10 episodes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll be over exactly. What did I know by the way you like our new galaxy home device the  They call it the galldor and it's got bixby built in  No, that's a weber jr. That's not it does kind of look like it though. It totally looks like it eight

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eight eight what go ahead I was gonna say kevin calls it the fondue pot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It kind of looks like a fun. It's well, let me show you the galaxy. This is a part of the big note nine announcement  Uh, I don't think a lot of people really paid much attention to the new watch or the galaxy home  This is partly because the galaxy home runs bixby  Which I don't think anybody  Really wants because bixby doesn't really do anything  In fact, it's an odd choice because at least up to now bixby really has only given you commands that work on a phone like  open photos

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, but they built smart. So they actually that is also a smart things hub  So so it is a it is a so they could be moving into the smart home here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That makes sense. So uh, because that's the idea behind apple's home pod as well as it's a hub

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but their hub is kind of pointless because it only has bluetooth and wi-fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't have zigbee or z-wave. Does this have zigbee and z-wave? It's it's like a same thing smart things. Okay  Uh, and I and they've said that we are going to put uh more intelligence in bixby  I guess I would expect that viv is going to get in there viv is the  The follow-up to siri when siri was sold to apple the siri guys left and started viv.ai then later sold it to samsung  So it would be my guess  that bixby 2.0

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is going to well viv viv is kind of like a way to approach programming to let you pull apis together  It's not exactly the same thing. It's not it's not an ai  um  It is a way to use ai  It's it's an ai that recognizes  That ties things to apps so it's going to recognize your voice command  And it does it  Intelligently so an individual doesn't have to program that so you don't have to say when a person when you recognize a statement

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what you need to open. It's basically adding a conversational interface to everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, it's a pretty ambitious project. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I wrote about it way back in the day. Yeah, they're now part of samsung. So I was wrong. I guess it's not viv  But bixby 2.0 is supposedly  Going to be uh, you make able to make restaurant reservations book rides with uber find nearby concerts all stuff bixby doesn't do now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, viv lets them scale that so in a way it's gonna see we'll see if actually viv is useful or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Viv makes sense with a smart home, right?  Because it would give you a voice interface to all the devices in your smart home  But that would require that those devices enable it include viv

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so, but what's viv actually is useful anywhere because it basically  It it automates the adding of apis to things. I mean making api calls and bringing those things together

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  cool  kill  8.8.8 is 8  It's google's public dns 8.8.8.8. It is eight years old  and I probably should have made this part of the changelog because uh, google says  Uh, the anniversary was august 12th at 12 30 a.m. UTC  which is  Eight years eight months eight days and eight hours since the original announcement. Oh boy  Uh google chose the occasion to  talk about  8.8.8.8 10 of all internet users use it. It's the largest public dns resolver. Wow  That's pretty amazing  It's used by google station and indian railway locations isps in africa and southeast asia use it  Instead of their own dns servers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And everybody in the us uses it so they don't get dns hijacked by their isp right yay

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this I switched to 1.1.1.1 which is another one. That's from cloudflare cloudflare. Yes. Yeah quad one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So quad eights, uh, this is a this picture kind of says it all this is uh in turkey  When the turkish government was shutting down  internet services right and left  Protesters actually this is something you don't expect to see a painted on the side of a building dns colon 8.8.8.8  One way to get through the turkish, uh firewall isn't that that's kind of cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or terribly sad depending on how we look at it sad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or sad  Yeah, turkey's going through now financial crisis thanks to the authoritarian rule of racip

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Erdogan erdogan erdogan i can is that how you say erdogan erdogan. Yes. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got it google wants to help your boss spy on you according to  the outline  I'm not going to give this much. It's just a pen. It's this is length bait, right? Exactly. It is although

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, I don't want my boss to do this, but I would actually like to know  What helps make me more productive and maybe it's because I work for myself and I exactly like that  I'm like, yeah now I am kind of freaked out in  Not freaked out. I I would be excited because they're talking about using signals from personal devices and things around not just your computer  If they can actually pull all that kind of data together that would mean that presumably we've got like a data schema that we can use  And all kinds of universal things that we don't currently have today. So well and frankly, uh, this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's a bit of a leap for the outline to say it's for your boss  It's anybody who wants to make work more efficient to study work patterns workflows

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not necessarily bad. I mean how the heck else am I going to hack my work week? Yeah, man. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, let's see fortnight's android beta now available for non-samsung phones boy. That was a brief exclusive  Yeah, uh  But unfortunately, this is the one that you have to sideload  Uh epic says we're not going to offer it on the google play store

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that and and slowly we never talked about that part of it. Is it just because epic is cheap? Is it? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they they don't want to give google their 30 percent  They have to give it to apple they have to there's no choice there's no sideloading on iphones

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh  So they're okay because again this whole story confused me and I didn't want to think about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that yeah, I agree the  I don't even think this is an uncharitable way to interpret it. I think the only interpretation is epic doesn't want to give google  It's 30 as you know every app on the play store does  Android does allow you to you know, there's that switch in your security settings  It turns off the requirement that you download from the play store. It lets you to download from third parties  in recent versions of  Android it switches back on you switch it off for one download and it switches back on which is a good thing because  basically epic is  epic's greed is in the face of the security of users because while sideloading from epics is not a bad thing, what if  Some what if some malicious website puts up a fortnight apk?  It says get it here  And you download it, but it's not fortnight. It's malware

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is a bunch of I mean this is a kids play this game and kids I mean good lord if you've ever  Seen like a teenager middle school kids computer. It is it is not pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How often is it is it?  malware

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's usually not malware. It's usually adware  Right and spyware and stuff like that it's installs, you know things like ask toolbar and stuff stuff that you really don't want to  Down but it's not technically malware

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And yeah, my my daughter I have trained her like back in the minecraft days was a wonderful intro to hey  Let's talk to me before you download those mods

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's isn't that the argument for a parent being involved in this and unless a kid is like really important  Unless it gets really unruly then there's other ways around it. It's a great thing to do  You have the conversation and a good any any normal kid will say well, I want to keep my computer usable  So they'll ask  Yeah  Minecraft mods was a big source of problems for michael. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it worked right  It did. I mean yes  And although now whenever any weird box comes up even if it's just like a normal like do you want to load the windows update?  She doesn't have windows updates, but  It's good for to check. I don't mind. She's like, uh, I don't mind either

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just think it's kind of cute. Well, and it helps that you have that rack behind you that you can torture her on  That is not a torture rack. I know what it is. It's a pilates machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If this were a different show, I would tell you all about the crazy class I took but i'm not going to I have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cadillac reformer at home and you know what I love do you have the spring boards that you can jump on it the jump board?  Yeah, I love the jump board. It's fun so much. I think we talked about that before it's really fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff is like what is happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm taking my leave because the pain is coming up. Oh, i'm so sorry god. So you still have a headache from it  No, it's just the pain of the thing. It's been 12 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this I hear that I hear the native sounds of time. Oh, sorry new york  Google according to a serperez at tech crunch will lose about 50 million dollars in fees  with epics move  in one year

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let us just note we may for one moment  That as you did a moment ago apple does not allow this google does google is a more open system. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right  And google's doing I think a good thing  Which is when you search for fortnight?  I guess this is good. What do you think? It's the first time google's ever done it according to tech crunch  You will get a search result that says fortnight battle royale by epic games is not available on google play

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So don't download what you see yeah, this is this is great smart. Yeah, and then I wonder

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If  Boy, you know the right thing to do would be to have there have a link to the official download  I don't know if they'll do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I would yeah, I mean I would I don't know if I would do that either i'd be like screw you  No, no, no, I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the right thing to do would be have that link so that people at least will get it from the official site

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See see they do the right thing and you say well, it's not enough right you got to be more right  They're a company. You've got to turn the other cheek and be the better person

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing to put that link there and it makes their users more secure cost them 50 million dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They already lost the money. It's already done because it enables the next guy to do the same trick

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I might encourage people I guess yeah if other people would do that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still think you should think about the users

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Consider the users they are thinking about the users. That's why they put the link in there to explain what's happening  Okay, I mean you can turn the other cheek. You don't have to bake a cake and serve it to them. You know what i'm saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well said too long for a show title, but very nice there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So  I I know jeff is very interested in this story. So i'm not going to frustrate him any longer  Campbell brown  speaking, uh to the australian a rupert murdoch owned paper in oddly enough australia  uh  Said  According to the australian mark doesn't care about publishers but is giving mark doesn't care about publishers  But is giving me a lot of leeway and concessions to make these changes  We will help you revitalize journalism in a few years  The reverse looks like i'll be holding your hands with your dying business like in a hospice  We are no longer interested in talking to you about your traffic or referrals. That is the old world. There's no going back

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So may I yes i've i've  i've been in the room with campbell when she's basically had similar talks  and  They were I think they were off the record, but fine. I'll violate that for the sake of this  where uh, and and let's let's first do a little bit of a caveat here the australian is owned by murdoch murdoch goes after  the platforms in every possible way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And when campbell says conceivably be one of those ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and so when campbell says these things she she does tough love and she tells the publishers  All you want to care about is getting clicks and links those days are over. Sorry. That's just over for everything. We're going for  um  what's it called, uh  meaningful engagements between people  And we're not going to care about those metrics anymore and you're going to keep trying to to manipulate and that's over  That's tough love and she'll say  Because she does I care about journalism. I I I want you to succeed  Uh, and what I fear is that i'm going to end up sitting there. I presume this is when she said it  Uh, you know holding your hand in the hospice  Because if you don't wise up  Just like richard jingras from google can be very tough on publishers and say get your damn acts together and I  As a journalism professor i'm tough on publishers saying get your damn acts together  She sometimes says get your damn acts together. I also want to find myself  nursing you in the hospice  This uh, even my friend jay rosen who can be critical of facebook  He also understands the australian media market and on twitter. He was saying he ain't buying this story. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the other shoe from new york magazine their select all page  Seo is back. Thank god  And I thought this was quite well said by brian feldman  Referring to this meeting with the australian  His response is great that old world absolutely sucked and it made the internet ecosystem a discernibly  Worse place sometime around 2012 the ecology of digital publishing underwent an epochal shift  Facebook overtook google as the top traffic source on the web  And so as a result you got link bait you got  garbage that was designed to drive traffic from facebook instead of  What we had before which was search engine optimization  Formatting web content so it would rank highly within search engines. He submits  That that's a better way of doing it that this whole link baity thing  21 pictures that will restore your faith in humanity  Was really all about getting facebook clicks  And really wasn't about providing what people want now. He points out, you know, the problem with seo is you know  You're gonna have you're gonna title your article. What time is the super bowl?  Because that's what people are going to search  But that's not so bad because in fact, that's the answer to a question a lot of people are searching for  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah  I think that the  Clickbait the attention-based advertising model corrupted us all. Yeah, we started at media and and on a scaled market as I said earlier  abundance  Volume goes up price goes down desperation goes up  And that's where we are. We've got to come up with new models based on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Value, yeah, and seo is closer to that  He says the mechanics of seo are clean are clear far more than the mechanics of human emotions  Far better or worse seo forced publishers to focus on providing their readers with relevant information  Social optimization for platforms like facebook forced publishers to make their content evocative  incendiary and interactive

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there another way because like  Why do you why are you a journalist one service, right?  You do want to give people information but two you want to tell stories that matter and that affect either  Maybe it's local. Maybe you want to draw attention to something like civil forfeiture  so  I would argue  That we don't have a way the evocative stories those kinds of headlines can drive you to things like  Babies dying in the hospital because  Poor hair, so i'm not i'm not saying that I love listicles. Believe me, but I think it's a little bit  It's more subtle and I used to hate doing cheesy headlines. That's why I was like, oh, I don't want to do another cheesy headline  But I was like, you know what if I stand behind my story and I really want to people to read it  I'm gonna have to go with the dead baby  And there's more reasons to do link bait than just generating revenue and traffic and traffic

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Than just generating revenue and traffic and traffic. It's also yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, so I wrote a piece with the Atlantic arguing that the platforms are not publishers and they have put on a rather flowery  Headline about the internet is wonderful for democracy. It comes I said why can't we be blunter?  Can't we just be similar? I'm actually saying and so now it's platforms are not publishers  Right. It's more provocative and it's also more accurate to what i'm saying. Yeah, but you might have more hits the other way  No, the other one was too flowery. It was boring

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there's also a simple yeah  There's also the issue that a lot of journalists don't  Write their headlines very well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So or or don't write the headlines at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well a lot of bloggers have to write their yeah blog more and more they do. Yeah, and some people are really terrible at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What the lead is dead?  Right now with with with ultimate space with ultimate space people are going on  And on and on and on before they get to the damn point what happened to the nut graph

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, let me read the first sentence of your article platforms are not publishers  Google facebook twitter and the internet are not media. There's something new. We do not yet fully understand well said you ought to teach journalism

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Notice I got this cover plug in here. That's the nut right right there. That's the lead in the nut  Believe the nut  And all the rest

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I would I mean, yeah when I was editing our new writers, I was constantly like let me explain this concept to you  But yeah, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually  I think there's an answer to both which is consider the reader  period  Yes  You want to give the reader something they're looking for you want to engage the reader  With with something, you know that engages them consider their time  Don't compel them read 1500 words to figure out what the hell you're talking about  Consider the reader serve the reader  That's you know, it's funny because that was always  What I told people in in broadcasting and in podcasting  Serve your audience  Think about your audience give them what they want what they need and inevitably success will follow  I don't mean chasing. I don't mean chasing. Uh hits that's different

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, my audience might want naked pictures of jennifer lawrence, but i'm not going to give it to them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but what would serve them?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't mean to their I don't mean pander to their  lower  Urges

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean what's going to really serve them fill them give you know, that's why I started a whole degree in social journalism  So we listen to the community first  We understand their needs we reflect their needs and then we can figure out what journalism is not that complicated actually  No, but we're very bad at listening

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well  Humans are because humans listen to themselves first, you know, we're the we're the first customer. What did you say? Huh?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What did you say? You talking to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nothing is it that's why you don't you put in things that otherwise wouldn't be in there  So, you know, they're wrong like tk for to come

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I knew that oh, so, you know, they're wrong  So, you know, they're wrong. I never knew what tk I knew what to do  I knew to do tk, but I never knew what it meant. It means to come but you won't like to come because you spell checker  When you're programming and you are creating a list of things that you need to work on you put three power three bangs bang bang bang  And then it's easy to search for because it's not programming tk might be  In fact, but bang bang bang's not so lead is miss intentionally misspelled so that but it's specific to what it is. Yeah, it is  Well, it's also it's not led because the print the press was made out of lead

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's there's some hold on now. I got no don't look at that, please

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh defcon and black hat were this past weekend  An 11 year old changed the results of florida's presidential vote  With the florida secretary of state's website  Apparently not too hard to hack. My favorite though is rachel tobak's video. Let me see if I can find this  Of hacking a voter machine  That is still to used in 18 states  Uh, here's a here's her tweet  A defcon hacking conference just learned how easy it is to physically gain admin access on a voting machine used in 18 states

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, this just takes a couple of minutes. So watch i'm very concerned for our upcoming election because this voting machine is used in 18 different states  And it's extremely easy to get admin access on this machine  So let me show you how quick it is about a little under two minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should point out this is the machine in the booth so she's in a voting booth  Right now and so anybody in a voting booth, which of course is invisible, you know to people because you're privately voting could do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To do this bad actor would be to open up this machine by pressing this button right here when it's off  Removing the card reader remove the card reader removing this you don't need any tools to do this  Unplugging this again, you don't need any tools to unplug that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Turning it on all you have to do is pick this lock here with a ballpoint pen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a lock but apparently not too hard to unlock the red button. So she's now rebooted the voting machine. Let it boot up here  This is what takes the longest by the way  This is a premier election systems voting machine  And you know, unfortunately a lot of these machines I don't know about this particular one don't have it's loading with what they call a  signature voting terminal right now paper trails  And when she says bad actor she doesn't mean nicklaus kate she means somebody probably russia

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And here we're going to see a couple of error messages and all you have to do to bypass those error messages is just click

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cancel this is the best part and okay cancel and okay and now she's in in the admin settings  Under two minutes change votes add votes subtract votes  Oh, geez, geez louise  That was voting village at defcon. They had a bunch of voting machines

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they let the hackers have at it. What fun there was a cyber attack in california against

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The secretary of state or the the voting oh the um a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  uh documents reveal successful cyber attack in california congressional race the um  What's his name dan roerbacher? You know, okay. This is political. I apologize, but roerbacher

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is a caveman I don't understand how he keeps getting elected and the guy basically is a fan of putin  I mean, he's a russian. He's a he's a russian agent. It's like obvious  Now I understand how he got elected  I'm glad I bought my e-bike  Last week, and if you haven't bought your e-bike yet august 23rd  25 tariff tariffs will take effect  On the motors from china the the bafang motors are very widely used, but there's others I presume  25 more after august 23rd. Yeah, there you go. That'll stick it to them  Yeah, there you go that'll stick it to them  Tell us about the uh 5g  home internet launch from verizon stacy  Is this really 5g?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, it is it's fixed mobile broadband or yeah fixed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fixed mobile. Yes fixed wireless. Sorry fixed wireless broadband. That means it's not for mobile phones. It's for your house

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, it also means that it's not for something that roves around right anything that it's designed to hit something  And provide broadband over a wireless connection to something that is stays in one location

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So stacy, can I ask a question first?  Yeah, so i'm presuming this is like a first phase so they can test it out  But eventually 5g will of course be for all mobile things. Yes, this is just a way to yeah, there are two variations of 5g

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So 5g can mean a lot of different things  There is a 3 gpp standard that is for mobile phones verizon is going to launch that too  And there is also this  There is also a standard for fixed  So there are actually two you there are two different technologies applied. They're related. They're just two different technologies  And then the fc fcc when they talk about 5g, they're actually talking about  Specific swaths of spectrum. So they're usually talking about I think it's the 24 28 30  Something gigahertz any bands  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes with fixed and mobile. So this is uh, this is what's interesting is this is  The first commercial rollout of the fixed version of this houston sacramento los angeles and indianapolis. Those are the four launch markets  It'll be later this year  Customers who sign up could choose to receive a free subscription to youtube tv. There's your locals  or an apple  tv 4k device not both

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So so what's interesting there is that is like a net neutrality violation  I know I know we don't have net neutrality, but it's zero rating, right? It's zero rating  And  Again, it's it's not wire line  So maybe the rules wouldn't have applied because we don't care about wireless as much from a net neutrality perspective

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Verizon picking a winner if you were sony's playstation view or hulu or sling dv, you might be a little a miffed  Or you know comcast their rival. Oh, yeah. Oh that'd be interesting if net neutrality  If non net neutrality is used against comcast then how now how do you feel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so  Did they show pricing because I was very curious how they were going to price this. No, I don't see it here. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'll also get content from the nfl nba and oh, so here's a real net neutrality violation  News from verizon's own media network oath  oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you can tech crunch for free free tech crunch

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that is why this will be the first telecom to launch 5g in the u.s  And i've often thought that what t-mobile and verizon and at&t are talking about when they say 5g  At least in the mobile space, maybe not in the fixed space isn't really 5g. It's just very fast lte  But is it is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Verizon is actually talking about 5g tmo. I don't know if they are I need to talk to tmo about it. I  That's my brain going. Uh, I think they're doing lte advanced. We saw this, you know, they did this before with h hspa

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Plus, you know, we've seen all the companies. It's not just t-mobile, but they're you know, they always you know  They kind of but partly that's not their fault. I mean, what is the definition of 5g? What is the definition of lte?  What is the definition of 3g? All of these are kind of fuzzy and I think intentionally

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lte  Was not fuzzy lte is actually a 3gpp standard. So that's the people in the cello  There is there is  Leo, I have read the standards, but that's why oh, that's right. That's why they called it 4g not lte  Yes, so they used to call in you know broad broad comp yes broad comp used to call  Wi-fi they they were talking about wi-fi ac being 5g. So there's  there's an  Somebody tweeted actually one of my analyst friends tweeted  He's like, you know a lot of people talk about their what they label their wi-fi networks like, you know  Blah blah network 5g and 2.4g and people are going to look at that and they're going to be like  I'm already using 5g, but that's really  Talking about what band you're on but normal people are not going to think that way and why should they jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How of all about andre got the new motorola z3 later this year verizon if you get it from verizon promises  A moto mod. Those are the clip-on backs that supports 5g on this phone  Right, so that's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That'll support

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mobile 5g mobile and again, I don't know what you got to go stand in one place  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  uh verizon  I don't know what their plans are  You know, they said 5g would roll out in those four cities, but  It turns out that's fixed right? So I don't that if it's for home. It's presumably fixed, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because with fixed what happens is it's it's kind of like satellite except it's not coming from a satellite. It's coming from a  a tower somewhere within line of sight of a  Device on the roof of your house  And that'll come in and yeah  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we have said everything that needs to be said. I think we've done it  There's one other story. I maybe could have put this in the changelog except it's not an official announcement of google  So maybe it will be a changelog item later  but according to  Xda developers  Uh, there is a google project campfire  to get windows 10  running on chromebooks  A sacrilege. Yeah, and and we were talking about on windows weekly paul throatt said well, why would you want to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kevin is excited about it. You guys I swear he wrote a post

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He likes the idea of linux on a chromebook  But why would you want windows on a chromebook the whole point of buying a chromebook is so you don't have to use windows  I I didn't read his post. I'm sorry. I'll uh, i'll ask kevin why it kevin of course is  Kevin tofu stacey's co-host on the iot podcast, but he also has a very good chromebook site  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  oh  Here it comes why windows on chromebook is a great idea. Oh, there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is it chromebook central? What's the name of his I can't remember about chromebooks.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. Let's see

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A month of mental block. Yeah, there's something about about chromebooks that I just can't remember for some reason but I will  Couldn't be simpler. I know but he had the story google one cloud storage is available for all today  So I will have to have to read that as well nothing but upside he says  We already knew that this was coming when we now have confirmation from xda developers about project campfire  In xda developers, they say it's a terrible idea  Uh, but uh, I couldn't disagree more right off the bat  It will boost the number of available chromebooks with improved hardware  Well, that's true, right because you do need a certain amount of performance and hard drive and memory to run windows  He uh, he also says and I think this is the only use case I can think of it will bring a broader  Range of software to choose from I think that if google is doing this the one excuse would be perhaps  They want to get people to buy chromebooks  But maybe there's just that one application a school has to use for instance  Or a realtor or something that's just only available on windows if you could run that one application  On yeah, then the chromebook would be maybe for you skype. How about how about skype? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, then maybe that was how much is windows gonna cost me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's 80 or 90 bucks. It's not super expensive. Okay, all right  Okay, well we'll see we'll see we'll watch with interest
