Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Favorite show of the week. Well, maybe I can't say that anymore. No, you better not equally favorite show

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also here Jeff Jarvis who's home after his travels around the world home in New York, yes home in New York  He is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York. He's also the author of public parts and other books a  Joins us every week his blog is buzz machine.com. Hello everybody  So I I said the pixel back I canceled my pixel order and Jeff says I'm wrong wrong wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I have a video showing. Oh, yeah, I should show that verge pops up on my pixel and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And scrolls quite responsively scrolls just dandy  I'm just gonna enjoy this going back and forth if there were more pixels

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could go see if there's a you know, get a tiebreaker, but I don't the next time I see somebody with a pixel  Look at that there it goes moving I might say you moved very gently into that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the ass on a playground argument my only point is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it I don't care how the verge scrolls. My only point was that it for that price weak  No, no for that. Well, I was using as an example for that price  It should be a much faster more responsive computer. It is not I find it very fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  very fast and  It works just dandy for me. I'm using it for a couple of days

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I felt like god, this is frustrating because it's just kind of not responsive  It's it feels a little jerky a little like Eddie, but you got the wrong machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I'm telling you last week  Your entire complaint was the verge went up slowly and it did on the video and so I was you have your pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you can't do it because you're in Skype. I can't do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I did it as soon as I got home. I said I'll record this for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can sit down I go to the bird bomb, but you didn't have it full screen. So you weren't really testing  She well  No, that's that's germane because what you want to do is fill the screen fill the pixels  The point is that my point was that the graphics card in that is insufficient for the number of pixels on the screen, which is true  But if you're not gonna see that if you have a window

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to go full screen on the verge. I don't want to be your roommate the old folks home

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pixel throwdown at Google I'll we'll get those those wrestler bouncy suits, you know  You guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stand by I stand my review it was not a broken pixel. It's a lot of pixels to push  It's not at all surprising with Intel motherboard HD 4000 graphics that that is too many pixels to push  You won't know and see till you put a very  demanding full screen  Web page on there, but you will see it in day-to-day operations because it's a very high-res screen. That's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been using it three weeks now and I'm telling you I don't you're perfect person to own the pixel then because you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  notice the difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Vance Vance McAllister wrote a wonderful post on Google Plus  He wrote actually has a comment on my post under that video right and I read that he had a Leo video  Yeah, and I asked him to make it a whole post so we can put up there  It's very very good and and he you know, he explores why this is so polarizing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you why you guys have Stockholm syndrome you wasted your money on that and now you have to justify why it's a good  Perch I haven't received it yet. I'm still using the loaner machine. It's not too late to cancel women actually  I was thrilled when I canceled that I was able to do so  it  Look, there are some real there are some real advantages. I won't deny it to Chrome OS. It's secure  If you're content to just run a browser and to like do your email in the browser and everything in the browser it's fine  That's what I do  but  It's an awful lot of money to pay for such a constrained machine when you I could pay less for a full machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't fully see that's that's the thing  That's what Vance was saying that that there's this belief that the machine is the way they were is the machines the way they should  Be and that there's this belief that it's somehow limited. I will I'm on the web the web works fine  You know and I was thinking today well Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to point out that you did install Linux on that and you had to to run

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right now for you only because of Microsoft  that's the only reason and if you guys would get your act together and get WebRTC or  Google Hangout would be fine  Which everybody says why the heck is in this show on Google Hangout because it looks terrible just say it because it looks terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We could use Google Hangout, but it looks terrible and it sounds like  So some people don't so my point is some people it's like it's like you telling me  I love chef boyardee. That's fine each chef boyardee. I'm not saying you shouldn't but it isn't necessarily great food

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I like Armani suits, but I can tell you don't know I don't based on what you're wearing today

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact Lisa's gonna kill me cuz it's a net. It's a Tennessee Titans

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the other thing Leo I was thinking today I cannot remember the last time that I thought hmm  I've got to go buy myself some software. I

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't buy software right the only reason to own a full OS is to install software on it. I don't do that  I haven't done that in years. That's that's not true for instance

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use the command line all the time on OS 10 that doesn't mean I have to buy or install software  But I like to have the command line available to it there  I mean there's things that come on OS 10 for instance that I didn't buy but that I use  Go ahead and try to edit a movie on your pixel. I've got a movie on my  My Macintosh it was free. It does a very credible job  Go ahead and try to do decent photo editing anything more than red eye removal on your pixel. You can't so  Things on there  Video audio and and serious photo editing Lightroom style photo reading are not possible, but that's something a lot of people do  It's not a weird thing that people do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm not trying to say that everybody should buy the pixel  I also was trying to say that you're wrong in trying to say that this isn't a machine  This is the show about the cloud people can live the point of my  Doing this for the sake of the show I might add was to to live in the cloud to really do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Love you to Google. Yeah, but you admit it's an experiment. It's not no it's not now. I'm saying this is something  You're gonna you're gonna keep doing I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Invested 1,500 bucks in it. I better

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's good point  See I don't I I can understand buying a Chromebook for a school  $250 Chromebook for school Chrome OS  I guess if it's cheap makes some sense, but you but you spent enough money on that laptop that you could have bought a  really sophisticated tool  I think if Google sells a $500 better  I mean admittedly then the Samsung is a is a net book. I mean, it's it's kind of crappy, too  Yeah, so I would love to see better hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but I think this keyboard is magnificent and the screen is magnificent  I'm I'm happy with it and  I'm never gonna buy Windows machine. It ain't gonna happen  Not I can't get my head around it  So the only good thing to buy is why buy another Mac and and I go back to what Gina said when we first had the  Discussion my Macs have you know scruff on them. They slow down  They inevitably slow down this thing doesn't this thing is just worry-free. I live in the cloud  It's a high-end machine for that a wash if I want to live in Chrome, why should I be relegated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, absolutely not machine right? No, you're right. If it does everything you want it to do  It's an awful lot of money to pay for such a limited thing, but I don't I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not complaining about that, but I also think that's the best keyboard I've ever had

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the best screen never was not crazy about the keyboard there. That is not is not a great keyboard. It's an okay keyboard  It's not a great track. It's an okay track pad  I like the aluminum the screen is nice the aspect ratio of 3 to is a very strange choice and while Google and everybody says  Oh, yes, because images are 3d what they're really doing is we couldn't push more than that many pixels  So we had to make it a smaller display  Speakers rattle the keyboard. I don't know if that's a good thing  And just as rattle the ice board. Yeah, play it loud. I I stand by my  My recommendation, but obviously there are some people who should get this machine  It's hard for me to think of a lot of them, but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure maybe one it's no but the reason Google did this I  I for it and when I say something or when Vance said something the Googlers who come in the ones Google wanted a proof of concept of a  The chrome as an operating system you can really just use yeah, and that's what this machine is there to do is there a proof-of-point  Not like not unlike glass glass is gonna be there to prove a point  You know I  Didn't put on the rundown, but this video of cops of the verge which I wish I went to everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're so you're so wrong on that post to but go ahead say it and I'll explain why you're completely wrong  Which the cops yeah, you say oh the great thing about Google class is now cops will be having taking pictures everywhere  Which means they can no longer complain about you taking pictures

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm saying  Not so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, of course they will you can't speed either a cop can speed just because a cop could do something gives them no thought  In their mind at all that now others should be able to do it in fact  It means the police and government will have cameras, and they'll make damn sure that we don't I don't think they can get away with that  And who gonna stop them?  judges  Let me interesting  That will be interesting have the judges have judges said anything yet about the police who've you know?  Illegally take cameras from people and and prevent them from yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, huge case in Baltimore huge case in Maryland good and and the good guys won good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd like to say that's good because they really I mean that does give us a weapon against police

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, which is why I just I was I was at an event last night about publicness and privacy and the chief  attorney at Hearst  You know big deal attorney has been working a lot of newspaper cases a lot of years. I didn't know this  I didn't know about you heard this erasure statutes no  I make fun of the EU for talking about a right to be forgotten and these are state statutes  I don't know how many states there in six or seven and  Where if you were arrested for something and you're and the case is thrown out or you're acquitted  You know if it's gone for any reason you can then demand that it be erased expunged right not only that  But in some cases they're coming back to the newspapers that have in the archives and telling them they have to erase it there really  That's  Incredibly dangerous that that goes to the notion that you can try to erase knowledge  You're not allowed to know that anymore and that's well especially

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The newspapers if they did their job properly did not in any way say anything untrue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right precisely it's a fact this person was arrested now the newspaper ideally should go back in and say oh and later on  Update this and acquitted. Yeah, fine. I would I would endorse that as an ethical way to behave so now go to these videos  right the way that it's  Taser is selling these videos that it was it was a video  I think it's still on the verge which by the way ran really fast on my pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I noticed that also is a flash issue so lady  I noticed that too, and I don't know what that was I had the same problem  It's a flash issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So no I was joking  These back people have no sense of humor you know we know I had that problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Video played back wrong  Video played back wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  About cop videos it's a product from taser and  And the cop wears the camera and it always records it always has him buffer the last 30 seconds  Cop hits record and then it starts recording on and then at the end of the day they put it in the recharging station the  Entire video goes up to taser headquarters where they say that  That  You can't the cop can't erase any part of it. I don't fully  Getting those ways around this but but they're saying that the video as a whole is there now they can then pull out parts  And it's in their control, but then it's discoverable by defense  Which I think is really interesting, but I didn't mean to get off in this side thing poor gene has been sitting there mute  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go by there well there are several people in the chat room calling for me to sort of break the tie  Here's the thing I haven't tried a pixel  Yeah, I gotta have one in order to review it  I mean I have to tell you like Leo reviews tons of computers every day  So it's hard for me not to trust his his evaluation and Jeff you know has is coming from a low powered

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know that the low power definitely better than the Samsung. I'll give you that  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, right right you had a max but be you sort of committed to living you know Chrome OS  So I think I think the pixel was it was a huge upgrade  I mean it looks like it looks like a nice computer, but I'm sort of you know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wouldn't spend I could tell you right now. You wouldn't spend $1,600 on that computer. Well. I'm cheap too. I mean  Yeah, well that's my job is to tell people whether or not to spend $1,600 on that computer and my answer is no  Also to talk about theory you know yeah, but you have a different job than I do so when I'm reviewing a piece of hardware  Fundamentally what I'm saying is is this worth the buying or not and fundamentally it's not right, but fundamentally in this show

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We talked about whether yeah, that's a different matter  It's coming of age and whether it's it's it's you know is this just a  Bitcoin like trend and fad or is this something real that people can really live in and that's and that's what I think the point  Is and and before the point of Vance's piece before if you wanted to live in the cloud you were relegated to a  Tinny cheap machine right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're gonna have the philosophical discussion about the cloud there are other issues that I think are more important such as what happens  When you're offline what happens if the cloud is down?  You you it goes back to the old days the bad old days in my opinion of thin clients  When your computer wasn't a computer it was a terminal to somebody else's computer  And I think the mainframe is down everyone's dead the real advantage of the personal computing revolution was one CPU per user  And I think that that is something that I hate to see us backsliding on but I think I think we  Companies like it because they can make more money that way yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they control more, but I have my docs and I have my gmail on the plane that works fine, and that's limited  But I will admit, but if you write more native apps for  Chrome that's the problem with  Ever notice it's not native so it didn't save locally, but it could be so more native apps written for Chrome will work fine offline

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So baby you have to so I was I flew home from New York  And I was I was in JFK kind of you know everything plugged in and like quickly downloading  I had offline gmail so you have to kind of launch offline gmail for example and say okay sync all my stuff  And I and I had Google Play music up on my Android phone  And I was like oh let me pull down the music that I want to listen to while I was on the plane  And they were they were boarding and I was like oh you know hurry up  So you do have to kind of do that sink right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all very fixable and the truth is that I keep offline gmail open all the time because I have two gmail accounts in the  Damn, chrome gets confused between them  When you're online or by second account for my  Your account  So it's up anyway. It's downloading anyway. I have  Drive open anyway, so pretty much. I've screwed up once

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the drive app works the same way right so as you use the offline drive app and it sinks similar to email singing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's thinking on its own cost and it's no accident. They give you 12

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Complimentary log-ons to gogo internet doesn't do me any good  United you gotta fly virgin  Yeah, yeah  Some others do yeah mm-hmm, but that but there's a reason why they give you that right?  Because really it works better when it's online

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so well that's the part of the point to they're trying to make it so does the world yeah, right?  Why are they doing? Why are they doing gigabit internet in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In Kansas City in Austin damn them well. It's yeah, we're gonna talk about that point  It's it's an interesting point it actually is relevant to the other big announcement this week, which is Facebook home  I mean, it's pretty clear that Google and Facebook kind of have the same  Goal which is to get you to give them as much of your data as possible  Living in the cloud is great for Google because it means everything you do transfers through Google servers  Yep, yeah, and so I would submit they have a very strong vested interest  and I don't I think that that kind of  Brings into question their motivation, you know they may say oh, no, it's just better  When in fact it's better for our business is it really better for users

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so Eric Schmidt has said straight out the business model for Google is extremely simple the more we use the internet  The more they make period right so it's not just about being in the cloud is using the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and the more data we give them the better it is for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's also good for me. I'm sure well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's my question is it good for you, and I I think that it's good for you until the cloud goes down  Or you have some problem  Now there are some real advantages it's more secure you can change computers and everything's still there  I love it on Android because if I get a new Android phone, I don't have to worry about it  I just log in and boom. It's all there the collaboration is a thing for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean you can collaborate with other people you can I mean not I have hard drives full of old pictures and documents and things  That I back up on my own but but honestly if I you know if my business partner  I have to get something done. We fire up Google Drive, right? I mean, that's it's just that you know  It's it's the it's the convenience versus

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you say it's nice of the choice though, right that's the point and what and what Google's thing is no you don't need a choice  Just use our stuff. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tons of choice I got all kinds of stuff. You know, I do may a matter of mind you sir  You you who denigrate the cloud shall we remember the days of the blue screen of death? No, I love the cloud over

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am NOT denigrating the cloud. I love the cloud just as Gina said there's  All of our all of the work we do on these shows is done on Google Docs or rundowns ever as you know  We love the cloud there's nothing wrong with it. I just want choice. I don't want to be forced to use the cloud  And we fought long and hard to get this choice I just want to point out I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well, I also fought long and hard to get away from the hegemony of of  hugely expensive software from Microsoft and Apple and I'm freed from that now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's an interesting way to put it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean that's interesting. I mean when I did my first book draft, you know, my editor was like, oh we use word  And I was like, oh, I don't want to use it. I don't have a light  What's up? They have I I didn't have a license and I was a freelance blogger making 12 bucks a post  I couldn't afford couldn't afford Microsoft office. I had to find you know  Yeah, you could use open office, but of course my book publisher had these elaborate  Quite revision tracking and it didn't quite work with open office, you know as well as it should have anyway, but  But yeah, and you know, obviously I just hated it because I'm a programmer. So word is the worst

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I just want to work in a text every every publisher still does this I don't understand why I know I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who wrote numeracy and the  Jeopardy book  Said he used Doc's for this publisher. I was surprised at that really. Oh, that's nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I mean this was years ago now Doc's actually does have drive has pretty good word a document support  You can export to word and I'm not sure how it does with templates  but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Things are better. That's the only issue I have left. I've got to do a letter for one of my students  I've got to do all those immigration letters. So I have to unlearn  Yeah, pain in the butt, you know fine, but but it's do you have a regular computer? I mean  Sure, I've got a Mac next to me. Yeah, I have a Mac and do you ever use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean if you really wanted to do this, right, you should get rid of that. I don't I basically don't I basically don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use the Mac at home. My Mac at home now is basically my Google Cloud Print machine  Yeah, cloud prints great love cloud print. Yeah. Yeah  And that's and that's it. That's it the one of the office. I took it out today  For the first time out of my drawer in three weeks. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Accept the premise of what's the guy's name who comment on your blog Vance McAllister?  I've accept Vance's premise that for some people simpler is better  That generally though is an attitude that is espoused not by the people themselves, but by the people who administer them IT's  Professionals school administrators who don't want to give kids any power control or they want to control. There's also an elegance argument and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's bad. I think Vance is making more the elegance argument  That I don't I don't need more I want this this works it and and why should I be relegated to the bad hardware?  and  Why are you getting so emotional about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You shouldn't be relegated a bad hardware and part of my argument was it should be better hardware for that price  Frankly, there's a USB 2 is it's unaccountable. That's that's that's ridiculous. Well, yes, it's unaccountable

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just it's it's it's I think we're also extremely early in the life. What's a chrome is an OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is your and so understand a negative review about a particular product is only about this snapshot in time  It may get better. It may be a better product coming down the road. There may it's I'm not reviewing the prospects of Google OS  I'm saying don't buy the pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get that but I'm  Loving the machine. I just played. I'm glad you like it. That's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it's I Leo your point about having a choice though. It I think is a good one  How does that choice reconcile itself though? You know, like what could can Google do to make that choice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know actually viable well Android in Android's a really good example of huge amount of choice  and I'm doing a very interesting experiment with my 80 year old mother who's staying with me for the month and  She had a feature phone terrible feature phone, which she couldn't use she couldn't so I gave her my Galaxy Note 2 and  Now I know what's gonna end up happening, which is she's gonna end up with my iPhone  But I'm giving it a shot and I put now there's a Samsung has a simple finder  Which is you know considerably less complicated and she's going through there's a lot of tutorials and pop-ups of how to do this and that  and I'm watching with great interest to see now there's an example of  A platform that gives you plenty of choice much more so even than an iPad or an iPhone  But it may be that that's gonna throw her for a loop  It's not easy to use  So what phone are you using now I'm stuck with an iPhone until my HTC one comes next week  Ah  Are you gonna install Facebook home? Oh, of course now I've learned a very sad thing and I'm disappointed to hear this  And Renee Richie of I'm or was telling me this that the Facebook home that comes with the HTC first and other phones  Presumably that should come along designed with a Facebook home on top of it have more capability than just downloading the launcher  So when we download the launcher and put it on our Android phones our galaxies or HTC's  It will not be the full Facebook home

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there was something about in their privacy statement  They said what there was a distinction between the what was gonna be installed on the first and what you get in the play store  Which I thought was interesting  I guess I think it was something about how the version installed on the first would be able to tell what apps were giving  Notifications that kind of set me off like oh, that's a different APK then yeah, right there's gonna be a different thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're really doing it's more like HTC's more like a modified HTC sense  They're really doing a carrier modification on top not just a new launcher right and what are you what are you missing exactly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sure what from a user feature wise I'm not sure  What's missing? I just there was a there was just a you know people ask questions about privacy  You know what information is this Facebook home transmitting back to Facebook?  And then there was a bit in the bullet point we covered it last night all about Android all that Android  It said that the Facebook home on the first is aware of the notifications that other apps are generating  Because you know part of Facebook home is there is the redesigned notifications, and it knows what apps are generating those notifications  But the one in the play store does not so that made me go hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This sounds like this is actually two different builds, but I don't want the first unfortunately because it's kind of a crappy Android  Yeah, yeah, you definitely want the one it's conceivable HTC might offer a specialized version of Facebook home on the one since it's an HTC product  So we'll see this comes out April 12th  I want to talk about Facebook home. I you we haven't had a chance to with you guys  And I'm sure there's lots that you have to say about it, so let's do that in just a second. What do you say?

This is what I should have this is what I should have given mom would have saved me some money. Maybe I will  I want you to visit twig dot ting dot com ting is an  MVNO, you know what that is it's a  mobile virtual network  reseller mobile virtual network operator I guess the O stands for they resell sprint and  Don't tell sprint, but they're a better phone company  So for some reason sprint doesn't seem to mind this and I'm not sure I guess they figure hey more customers  What could possibly go wrong, but I got to tell you tings got it right  In fact the whole idea was ting wanted to create the no BS mobile service  So there's no contract. It's month to month  I mean T mobile is kind of making noises about doing this tings really doing it no early termination fees  So your contract free there are there's no bundling or ride-along services  You choose the service level you want if you use more you pay at the standard rate  You don't pay a penalty if you use less they rebate the difference  That is unheard of you get credits for unused service. There are no add-on charges for  Voicemail picture and video messaging three-way calling caller ID and here's the best part  Tethering and hot spotting not only encouraged you pay nothing extra. It's built in so go to twig.ting.com  Take a look at the monthly plans and I'll show you how this works  This is great for families or small businesses where you're gonna have multiple phones  You don't have to but each phone is six dollars a month  So let's get four. Let's have a family of four effect  I'll use with my family as an example for phones. We currently have on AT&T  I think a  1400 minute plan we don't use it up. I'll use a thousand minutes  We do have unlimited text messages two thousands plenty and I'm gonna use all the data I can afford  So four phones three gigabytes of data  2,000 text messages in a thousand shared minutes a month  the whole thing for the family of four on AT&T is is well over three hundred dollars on  Ting the whole thing family of four a hundred ten dollars a month a  Hundred ten dollars a month for four people not each total  You got to go here do the savings calculator to bring your phone bill and see how much you'd save for exactly the same kind  Of service now there are some differences for instance you buy the phone now ting  We're gonna show you how you can get a little rebate on the phone  But ting has all the great Android phones available including the Galaxy Note 2 which I would recommend I happen to love that phone  You also can choose from standard feature phones  They even have data devices like the Sierra over Drive Pro  so that's like a you know Wi-Fi access spot powered by sprint and  Their 4g through ting so pick the phone you want they have a new phone marketplace  But also a used marketplace which can save you considerable amount of money and when you buy by the way  I want you to go to twig ting comm and you'll save $25 on your first ting device  So you get the device then you activate it through ting they have a fantastic  Dashboard that tells you exactly what you've used  Who's using what I mean the the ting dashboard you've never seen anything so great.

We saw the announcement on Thursday almost a week ago now every shows had a chance to talk about it  except this  So I'm gonna give you a chance, you know, what's interesting though as times gone by people like to see MG Siegler  Who is such an iPhone bigot on?  Tech crunch say I actually like this  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  You I looks really nice. I look I have to say just judging totally just some senior announcement  I have not actually tried home yet  In fact, I don't think I'm gonna be able to it's not gonna run on my galaxy Nexus

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It only runs on certain phones before I would run on the floor wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Nexus for yeah, I think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a version out but only briefly then they shut down the server

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a there was a pre-release but I think it'll run on the floor when it comes out  No, no galaxy s3. Yes, I think galaxy note. Yes  So the idea is it's it's basically I think Gina looks like a new launcher, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a new launcher exactly and I think that uh, I think that sort of like philosophy wise and strategically  That they're going in the right direction  I like the idea of kind of putting people people first not apps  That was kind of one of the things they kept saying is I kept saying during the presentation  The idea that your phone is a messaging device  You want to connect with people that makes a lot of sense  I'm really glad that they didn't go the Kindle fire route  Right that they didn't fork Android that they didn't issue a whole new device  They didn't come up with their own app store that they're not trying to lock everybody into the Facebook, you know ecosystem  This is they're playing nice with Google. They were actually very complimentary toward Google and Google's commitment to openness on Android  I love that a company as big as Facebook. That's so good at making web services  I mean regardless of how you feel about Facebook the product like  Facebook makes a great service that a billion people use I love that they're that they're developing something this interesting and  Forward thinking on Android first, right? We always kind of complain about  iOS first. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the stories that I've read people were saying all the men this hurts Google because you don't get to search  The search is still there everything from Google is still there on the phone, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's two clicks deep though now  Instead of being on the front page, you know used on a stock Android phone Google searches front and center on every page

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but if I want to search the web, I ain't using Facebook. No, no, you won't be you'll use a Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you have to click a couple of times so I don't see this Google really hurts

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, I mean you can put Google there's a thing a Play Store Maps YouTube all of Google sort of flagship  You know all their their great proprietary apps are on this phone, right?  So this is this is not this not a Facebook phone  And you know, obviously with when you get it from the Play Store, it's just a launcher app  I'm just excited to see a big company like Facebook make a launcher, right so far  We've only seen kind of indie developers make launchers  Some great launchers and we've also seen companies like HTC, you know come up with new sort of ui's like the sense UI  Right, but I'm excited to see this like and then we've seen Amazon do the Kindle which is, you know  Completely separate thing right which doesn't have the Play Store or or the other Google apps. I'm excited to see Facebook go  You know what? We're not trying to take over Android  We want to put a layer on top on top of the phone which Android allows and encourages and this has already been done by  You know small indie developers, but we're we're gonna make this this brand new experience. I think it's great for Android  I'm excited. I think it sets a precedent for other companies who want to do work on Android  I think it's kind of a new way to work with Android that all said the I have I questioned the implementation  I haven't tried it myself yet  But there are some things that I'm not so thrilled about a cover feed not so thrilled about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the lock screen, right? So  Whenever you look at your phone and they you know, this is it right now  If you're watching the video you see full screen pictures of your friends  You see the chat heads if you're chatting with somebody their head is persistent will stay there. You tap it to chat

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I like chat heads actually I do too  Yeah, I think chat heads makes a lot of sense and I'm dying for unified messaging service. I want Google Babel now  I'm hoping that the Google voice team was watching this on  Babel does not have voice in it, right? I know it doesn't it does sounds like everything but they say it will  They said hangouts talk message  So here's the you just send a message to a person and doesn't matter if it goes through their phone number through their Facebook account  Through their talk account through the messenger account, whatever. I just want to talk to Leo  However, it needs to go right you take care of her for me  Mm-hmm, and it puts faces front and center which I which is really nice. That's good UI, right?  This is about people technology is about connecting people. Zoc is absolutely right about that. I think your phone is absolutely right about that  So I really I like that a lot  I'm not I mean the whole adding so the one thing about the presentation  I didn't love is that I talked about this a little bit earlier  They they was not kind of set up this like false dichotomy of this grid of icons  You know app icons that have little red badges, right? Which is the iOS experience, you know  Here's here's the icons you can go into and you have to tap through these icons to get information  And he's saying this is a whole new experience on Android and you know, my home screen doesn't look like that  I don't tap their apps to get information. I've got now I'm a power user  But I've got widgets set up on my home screen and on my lock screen  I I look at my phone and I see data and there are plenty of widgets social widgets that lots of companies come out  Granted they've been pretty crappy up until now  But if I wanted to see my stream of Facebook updates or four square check-ins or Twitter updates  I can do that in a widget on yet on Android  So, you know, of course Zuck was making it sound like they were doing something so new and innovative  But he was sort of saying comparing iOS to to Facebook home, which is which you know kind of two different things  I think Android allows this but the reality is that people don't change their default widgets, right?  Like this phone's gonna ship with Facebook home. You can choose between  You know home and your regular launcher you can turn it off at any time  So this is I think it looks like a nice experience so far again  I would say, you know, I syndicate my tweets to Facebook  I interact with Twitter first and Facebook economy secondary check-in place  So I I would say I'm a low to moderate user

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  MG observed that he used Facebook a whole lot more just because it was very easy. Of course, that's the point  Here's the question I'm hoping that Google looks at this and says well we should do this with babble and Google Plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely  Absolutely and Google had started to this a little bit right when the Nexus 7 shipped  Remember that the widget on the front page of the Nexus 7 which is clearly sort of a media consumption device  I mean the Nexus 7 is all about go to the Play Store  Buy movies music and books and you remember the kind of it shipped with that wasn't the default Android home screen, right?  I had to meet yeah  I killed it immediately too. But most people aren't gonna do that. They're like, oh, this is the thing that's on my home screen  I would love to see Google sort of put out a Google Power user launcher app  I mean, this is the thing I'm excited about about home. It's like, oh cool  Like I want to see more companies lot, you know put out awesome launchers that are sort of  Service centric. I mean the problem is I use lots of different services though

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Launcher that's that's that becomes right. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I would use you know, look if Google you want you want us to use Google Plus more and I know you do  This is a way to do it and just steal it. It's just I'm sure they will point by point  They did a beautiful design. I mean everybody agrees. This is gorgeous looking  Yeah, Facebook makes good product point for point steal this design  Just hook it up with Google Plus and you know what be nice make Facebook part of it make Twitter part of us make everything  Exactly and then if you had the choice you're gonna use the Facebook only one of the Google Plus one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would Twitter let them I mean Twitter cut them off from from

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The hose for search but you can still post

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean assume you have the Twitter app installed and it's sucking Twitter every 15 minutes you hook into the Twitter app, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somehow I think Twitter is not gonna blame eyes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're gonna say that's a client. Yeah Twitter has been well, that's true. That is true

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lucy Lucy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Splain babbled to me, you know, I do notice that there's no mention of Twitter in any of this Facebook home collateral is there  They want it to replace. Well, you know what this could this could this could eliminate Twitter. Let's use

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was at the it was at the far right of the of the graph a com scar graph  It's like a graph of where people spend their social time on their phones, right? Which I gotta say rang  Totally untrue for my subjective experience. No, but for real people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fish even me. I know look at if you just look at Twitter you can see it  You could see I mean, that's all the you know, if you look at the main feed on Twitter, you can just tell us people  spewing crap from their phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So let's we talk about babble  The babble team so chat heads is the thing about Facebook home that was sort of like yes, I like that  I like the idea that that that that someone's face who's messaging me pops up above in a layer above what I'm doing  Right because the right now the experience is someone says any message on Android it pops up in the shade  I can see the text of it sort of roll over, you know in the notification bar  And then I have to stop what I'm doing pull down the shade  Look at the notification and then maybe tap on the notification to launch the app and then respond right?  It's a lot of a lot of tapping and pulling and interaction right with chat heads  It just pops up love that and it's a and it's a face and you don't have to know the details  Am I going into Google voice? Am I going into messaging? Am I going to Google talk?  I I don't have to know I don't want to know that that I really like the people not apps approach  First and I really hope that the Bible team was taking copious notes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope we don't have to pronounce it babel by the way. Yeah, that's it spelled babel. It is spelled babel. You're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like what's the schedule for it? We know no cuz Google said nothing about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is all sort of rumor and conjecture isn't it and leaks  Let's see droid life had a was it there was a memo leaked it appears

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's screenshots there's memo leaks apparently they launched babel by accident on some people's machines and they pulled it back  You know if you if you look up in gmail apparently some people are saying that you'll get a all  Conversations have been moved to the trash  Because you're now because your babble chat user these messages are still available in babbled or babel  I hope we'd have to say babel. Can we just call it babble? Let's just call it babble  We just decided I'll decide I think it's because the Googlers read more Douglas Adams than they do read the Bible and they don't  Understand that tower people was not a good thing the babel fish is a good thing, but they're two different kinds of  I'm gif you  Well, we know because the guy who invented the thing said how to pronounce it and I think he said gif I can't remember that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, but it's a point. I don't care who cares

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Google will have a canonical pronunciation won't they they'll tell us how to pronounce it when they talk about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I oh yes, Larry Page will say it's babel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, maybe they could they could split the baby another other reference to ancient history and just spell it babel  But pronounce it babble babble. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I hope for I  Wonder if we're gonna hold out on this until I oh we've still got some time till I oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know looking at the screenshots. I have to say it looks very ugly and googly very flat  It does instead of using Apple style emojis, which are not apples. They're a standard  They use their own emojis  I don't know. I'm not I'm not crazy about these screenshots, but maybe they're just the original  But this is the new look isn't it? Everything's square and no there's an argument that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If we want to see the future of Android design we should look at the new play store  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually I almost never do this now, but I grabbed the APK  That's sort of leaked a became installed because I couldn't wait to see the play store. Oh, so it's not out yet  I won't have it yet. Oh, it's it's rolling out. It's rolling out. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gave my mom my Galaxy Note too soon apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Call her up. Hey mom, would you get the APK for the play store on the machine?  So I can see it be good challenge  Side load the APK mom wait wait wait wait wait wait Leo Leo  You know that that the David Letterman did wonderful things with his mother on the show. I never had your mother on the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, occasionally  Yeah, she she she she's a she's gonna she says she's gonna come in. I don't she's been putting it off  She's been here two weeks. I  Think she'll be on the next twig  That'd be great she loves this show she watches this show that Jeff Jarvis is such a nice boy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's not what she says we know that that Gina Trippetti is such a nice girl

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She says that that Gina's nice girl, but why does Jeff keep fighting with you?  No, she doesn't say that cuz he's wrong was his laport your son is wrong. My son is never wrong. Mr  Jarvis no, she actually is a fan of yours back from the San Francisco Chronicle days. She knows who you are  So she watches she watches with great interest  So so I think Babel will be a unit it's gonna be a unified chat service  It will tie into Google plus Google Hangouts  Google now  Okay, be nice to get notifications

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It would be nice to get notifications through now, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but not a  Apparently not voice yet, although

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy, we fear that Google might give up voice. That's one of the fears out there. Why would they give up voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm worried about voice with all the spring cleaning going on with now that readers out  I feel like voice might be voice. I think is right on that line  They just I just doesn't feel like they do a whole lot. They have an updated voice in ages

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now some guy named Ken is answering my voice number. There's some sort of crossed wires. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? But so so how does this tie in? So is the whatsapp? Is that basically they didn't buy whatsapp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They were thinking about buying whatsapp. Maybe but the whatsapp guy said no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But is that basically what babble is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's whatsapp is basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whatsapp is a closed universe. So you can only chat with people using whatsapp now  Whatsapp runs on every platform not desktop, but it runs on every mobile platform, but it's whatsapp to whatsapp  It's like beluga which Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to SMS no

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's an SMS replacement. It's what teenagers get when they run out of texts that month or they have an iPod touch or you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the closest. Yeah, the closest thing to babble is is Apple's messages  Right messages will send it via text  But prefers to send it via internet if it can and if so if you're messaging in an iPhone or an iPad  It will do it that way and it it does have a desktop component, but messages is bad because it's only iOS and  And OS 10 so the dream of course is to have something that supports all protocols  Google could also to cut around

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course these days everybody gets unlimited voice and unlimited text in plans  I think I don't think text is a big issue anymore. Yeah, if you're 12 years old is it it might be but I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know I pay 20 bucks a month for a family unlimited text plan on AT&T. It's not it's to be no. Yeah, I  Use whatsapp. I like whatsapp  It's rich  And it's better than MMS for sending video audio and video  You know, I have a handful of friends who use it it's not that's part of the problem you have to be using whatsapp  Lot of people use whatsapp. It's very popular. It's huge. Yeah, you  Pardon me you ever BBM. Yeah when I used a BlackBerry I used BBM BBM is great  But again only works with BlackBerry with my brain  This is why there's a huge opportunity  And there is and Facebook, you know is is there I mean this is that's what Facebook home does  You don't have to pay attention to what protocol you're using your friend  Now everybody the presumption is everybody's using Facebook  What happens to Facebook home if somebody's not on Facebook, they don't exist, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, well no, I mean they  Should be in your contacts, right and and and from what it looked like chat heads  Integrated with androids messaging like SMS app, right?  So in theory if you're not on Facebook Leo, but you sent me a text message in theory like that should pop up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I probably wouldn't have your avatar right wouldn't be as cool, but it would work

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it should it should work the same way that the other ones

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They take over notifications to which I'm not sure I'm crazy, but I actually love Android notifications

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I I didn't love how Zuck was like, oh, you know if you get a notification for a friend  You don't really want to interact with her right now. You just throw her away  That was cool. Are you kidding? I love that. I mean, I love the functionality  I just thought it was weird that he said you could just throw her like throwing her away  I don't want to do that. Just being like just swipe it away for later for later

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just seemed like a Google now does that too, by the way when I get birthday announcements from my Google plus people  I've never met I just  That's kind of the same thing same status

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had I I searched for I was looking for directions somewhere on my computer  Apparently has been out in Google now for a while and I just hadn't seen this  I searched for Palm Springs on my my laptop and then a few hours later  I picked up my phone and looked at it and Google now said hey two hours to Palm Springs light traffic  I know is that great? It's like oh  Why is it telling me? Oh, right? I searched for this like I'm really seeing the integration now with now and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What would make me buy a pixel?  What Google now? Why now in Chrome on that's coming? That's definitely. Oh, yeah, that's that's coming

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mark that chat room. I would put that history was mark that word when that happens. He has to buy a pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The chat room saying that is the difference between the HTC first and the download  Version of Facebook home and in fact, it does say that on the web page all  Notifications are available on the HTC first the free home download includes Facebook notifications only. Ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, and that makes sense. They can't hook in a notification limitation. Pardon me. That's not a limitation. That's a technical limitation. Yes  Okay, so explain that to me Lucy why

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You would have to take the Android code and hook into it, right Gina  That's what they do with touch whiz or blur or HTC sense. They hook into it more deeply than a launcher can

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right. That sounds more kind of like a skin, right?  Yeah. Yeah, so the skin can take over notifications with launcher cannot  Yeah, yeah something like that  That's I know it sounds kind of vague  I haven't done a whole lot with notifications  But it sounds like because they're shipping because it's because that the first doesn't come with sense, right?  It's just home and then you can I guess switch back to the vanilla launcher the vanilla Android launcher, right?  If you want it on on first, right?  A little bit of an integration with sense exactly you can still remove it. I believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  Just I think this looks beautiful. I just want this is this would get me back on Google Plus  Big time for it's so easy to use. We're so integrated. I'd start using it instead of Twitter  Yeah, I would get involved in the chat the hangouts. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not good for some things right when the when the big news event is going on you're not going you're going to Twitter  You're not going to Google, but that's a critical mass issue. Isn't it? No. No, it's it's a form issue  It's a style issue. Okay, it's it's it's also the form of the thing you can have  Your post could be around three hours later  It's somebody comments on it comes back and they got rid of the original problem  Remember back the early days of Google Plus was it was scoble scoble scoble scoble over time somebody, you know  Come out on scoble came back up. It was scoble hell, right?  Love you Robert, but  And I know what you're talking about, right? So they fixed that yeah  And it's and and and suddenly the complaints went nowhere, but still  It's not meant for  Trying to stay on top of something. No, it isn't meant for conversation. Yeah, unfortunately  It's weird how it's it's different and I don't you know, what would they give up if they if they tried to gain that Twitter share?  the  There'd be too much stuff flowing by I think you don't think people would post

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so let's so what okay, so some of the things that I go to Twitter if somebody's  Supported it supposedly has died. I'll go to Twitter to see if they died  That kind of thing would make it too. Oh, that'd be fine. That'd be fun. No, I think it's more that when you have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know Egyptian up right away jokes are happening today. Okay. Yeah, but you're not gonna do that on these little snippets  I'm not gonna have one but on Google the reason I like Google Plus is because the conversation is good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and you can see things like the fact that when you cry in space  The tears don't fall they go straight out  That's  The kind of thing I'm not kidding actually literally this is the kind of thing I expect to see on Google Plus  Is that the Canadian astronaut? Yeah  He's right. Yeah, I mean this is cool. This is the kind of thing you see on Google Plus because it is more long-form more thoughtful  He's gonna make himself cry by  Water into his eyes, I think they should just bite him or spank him or something get another astronaut to kick in the  rear end  on space

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It it looks kind of crazy. Wow. Yeah, it's kind of sticks sticks to the face  You just got a ball of water like clinging to your face  Look at that

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Burk says he's just snorted up his nose. It could be like that those French people

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have such sort of some sort of like innate inner like innate gravity. No, you know what that is that surface tension? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It makes the the surface tension of the water makes it turn into a ball  Really awesome that's Google Plus right there, baby  I'd love to have that  Pardon me the place to share and talk it is much more conversation. Absolutely  Which I know is you know, it's funny. We were talking the other day about there's this new service called branch  Branch calm that is Twitter based conversation basically adds kind of a  Threaded conversation off to the side from Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah kind of what happens is I'll get into an argument with somebody on Twitter  I try to argue less these days and so they say hey take it to branch  Because then you can invite people in you can have actually more of a conversation one place that the problem  The problem they have is that after I've already had the conversation that we had the conversation again, right?  They've got to solve that sick a patient problem of being of when I feel like having a conversation with somebody  Knowing to go to branch to it and they just released a new design  You know, it also branches partly backed by Ev Williams  So Ev is meanwhile doing of course medium medium just introduced a whole bunch of new collaborative tools  It looks like medium. That's interesting. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they so think ups new office in New York is actually in the branch medium office  So we're gonna be sharing space with them. We're sharing space with them. Yeah. Yeah, so it's in a common open area  And they collaborate and they're both they're both backed by obvious, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Obvious and beta works and and the others a lot of parentage there. Yeah, and in both cases you sign in with Twitter  So it's an interesting see I I kind of understand what they're doing because you know  One of the reasons I didn't like Twitter and I fled to Jaiku and pounce and all these other places was I wanted threaded conversations  yeah, and every but that would not have worked on Twitter and  and buzz and  So this is a way of side loading threaded conversations without impacting the main

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On medium you can comment on a paragraph in the in the bill I like that  Yeah, so you're coming directly on an idea which is really like that. Yeah. Yeah, you saw that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Winer esque there's an issue on Twitter half of the the fake users on Twitter are now out of control  And this is where Google Plus is going see  Justin Bieber for instance, it's estimated has half of his followers are not real people  Which kind of cuts back on the follower count a little bit. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a service. I forgot the name of it that will go in and estimate how many of your followers are fake  By the way, this just in I think it's just in Kleiner Perkins and Google Ventures are starting a Google Glass fund. Ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That makes sense  They've done that before

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't they do an iPad fund or an iOS? Yep. Yep. I think so. Well not Google Ventures didn't but yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Kleiner did KP did I heard it yeah  Go ahead let's take a break we're gonna talk a little bit more. I'm just looking at this fake  Twitter followers story Bill Gates also has a lot of apparently half fake

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that you can buy for ten bucks? You can buy the question. Are people buying them or is it happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Spammers no benefit to that. The only possible benefit to that is what brag you have more I can see some celebrities doing that to brag  But you know, they're gonna know there's a huge benefit what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well to celebrities in Hollywood your Twitter the number of people who follow you on Twitter is part of the deal  The contract so it's you can get more money for a movie as a movie star  That's part of what you're bringing in. I got two million followers  And they make much more money

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Last time I negotiated of my book deal I you know, they offered me in advance and I was like hey  You know what and and I listed, you know, my Twitter followers Google plus followers different and I was like, oh, okay  And I got more money. I mean, you know when you have that marketing power

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It gives you cloud. Yeah, it does people people all the time. They mentioned

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, this person has 20,000 followers. They must be real. Yeah. Yeah, it is really I think a status symbol within the network  I I'll confess. I better for worse. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Had that we had to hand it we have accreditation going on here. So I had to redo my CV. I put it on there  What the heck? It's just some monetization. It's kind of ridiculous, but but I did I mean I felt ridiculous, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was there in my negotiate like I felt ridiculous because it really because it is so easy to buy and fake and whatever  But it is it is a thing. It is a thing. It's an indication of one's reach

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Except that it's fake. It's fake same with likes like lights or meaningless. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someday we're gonna look back at this era and say what were we smoking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seriously, well are part part of this problem I would argue  is  That it's still a mass media mentality. Right? Look at the metrics that we have in media. It's  Masses of unique users page views. What do they look at that we made?  And and and pretty worthless those metrics and and so how many how many followers do you have?  I mean likes do you have so what but that's the way we measure media media for all that time and those of us

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who like here at Twitter where we pay less attention to raw numbers, but more attention to the engagement of the  We've actually produced results far beyond the numbers that mass media would  Embrace effects one of the pre it's one of the interesting challenges of selling the network is the numbers are low  But the results are high

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know the other thing is Leo that basically you on this show all your shows you have what is now being trumpeted elsewhere as  native advertising  Right that that it's when you when you do a ting ad and it's you talking it through  It's it's inner. It's part of the part of the product as part of the fans exactly what people are trying to mimic

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's so funny on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All kinds of other media Felix Salmon at Reuters had a really really good piece this week  About this and trying to look at whether or not so-called native advertising is scalable and he argues it's not  But he also wonders whether that matters because if you if somebody actually reads this thing that is on BuzzFeed  How much more viable is that that it happened to be you know, but near near their eyeball for 40 seconds

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we've scaled it pretty well. I don't know how much more we're gonna be able to scale  Here's a funny picture Mark Andreessen  And of a Driesen Horowitz, and I don't know who these other venture capitalists are all wearing glass  Mark Andreessen when he wears glass  Looks like he should be on Star Trek or something. Yeah, he does. Yeah the shape of his head  This this kind of this rests my case, I think the first thing they should invest in is somebody to make glass look less dorky  That's John Doerr on the right John Doerr on the right, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So these are big-shot venture capitalists. Yeah, you can you can say they're really committed to the platform was they were took that put that portrait

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's committed. That's how committed they are committed. I don't see Kevin Rose wearing the glass  So at Google Ventures Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and buyers an investment syndicate  They don't say how much money they're thrown into that. Yeah, so this could be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd say it probably meant more when Kleiner Perkins on its own did an iPad  Fund then now there's Google Ventures in it, but still

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff good news. I just did a fake followers check on your Twitter account. You're very good  This is in fact one of the highest percentages. I've ever seen 85% good  Is that amazing or what and the rest hate me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I do I report spam accounts like mad on Twitter because it is easy enough to do it  Yeah, I do too. Yeah, I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have like every once in a while Russians will retweet things from years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, the Russians were taking over on Twitter like crazy about three weeks ago. Yeah, it was it was driving me nuts  It's like they suddenly discovered

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina we're still doing it takes a while. It's it's social bakers calm for the fake follower check  I'll do Gina and when we come back, we'll tell you how fake Gina is and then I'll do me and then then I'll be all over  I know I know I'm I think it's really a matter of  The percentage goes up the larger you get I guess  I'm not sure

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's fair enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think once you're verified things get really weird because you get on the special Twitter verified list and I think that you know  That the fake these fake accounts sort of glom onto that list as like oh, these are celebrities and big shots, right?  I'll follow them to make myself look legit, you know, right? It's some weird spammer thing. I don't I never really did understand it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, have you tried Hulu Plus yet? Oh, I love Hulu Plus. It's a way you can it's good  It's great for cord cutters, but even for people in fact somebody in the chat was saying I just use it as my DVR  It is a way to watch  Unlimited instant streaming of your current hit TV shows your classic series  Great movies and it's on almost everything  It's on of course many smart TVs, but also blu-ray players gaming and video games  But also blu-ray players gaming consoles the ps3 the Xbox 360. It's on Apple TV  They have a beautiful hulu plus interface the Roku mobile phones tablets and you start watching on your Android device and you get home  You start watching on your Roku. It's gonna pick up right where you left off  799 a month with limited advertising you cancel at any time, but you can get two weeks free right now if you go to Hulu Plus  dot-com  slash  Twit not not hulu.com but hulu plus  Comm slash twit or visit our website if you go to twit TV the banner at the bottom of the page click that link  You'll get the same deal two weeks free of hulu plus a great way. Yeah right there two weeks free. That's double the normal  the normal deal  Really great stuff on hulu plus and it it should be part of your overall cord cutting strategy my friends  Who look plus comm slash twit or visit the website click the banner and  And get get going with hulu plus today  All right, Gina, okay, I'm gonna do my fake wait wait when we got Gina's first  60% good oh  That's low 30% fake or empty 10% inactive no mom lower than that though. I'm lower than that  I know I'm almost 50% I think  It's really interesting now  I don't know how they they don't aren't real clear about how they determine fake followers, but see you can see these are your fake

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Followers there a lot of eggs a lot of eggs. Yeah, that's a giveaway. I would love to know how they're doing this because  fetching  Someone's followers is really hard when there are lots of them right you know about it, right?  Yeah, right because if someone has three hundred thousand followers two hundred thousand five they do a sample  They do a sample okay, so I think they said that when you when you request a list of followers  You know you get about 200 per page, and you only get like 15 API calls per minute, right?  So like you know you're limited. There's it's got to be a sample so then they must parse through that sample that makes sense  So I wonder if it's a sample of your latest followers  Because I know you wouldn't want to do that either would you you wouldn't want it?  No, you wouldn't want to do that  It would have to be a random sample which I don't think is too easy with the API

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Off the top and if Twitter is clean if they are pruning which I think they are doing to a pretty great extent

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't this going to be oscillating? Well? I'll tell you because I haven't done mine in months  But the first the last time I did it I think was 45% fake I  Tweeted it. I can't remember. It was a really high number  But I've been on Twitter a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you were like thousand followers, so you were the most followed person on Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know when I was the most followed person on Twitter when you could be that with five thousand followers  That sounded amazing at the time yeah, and then Kevin Rose, and I were in a race  Race to see who'd be number one and then like shortly after that Ashton Kutcher joined it was all over

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, basically at that point boom blew me up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ashton argued like I know him first basis  Kutcher argued on Howard Stern basically that Twitter should have given him more value for this like they should have given some stock for making it

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Should have given me some stock for making it, but no  First year I was Twitter  He was here, too  Actually Gina it was all Gina's fault  So did you see this one? I don't know what to make of this this came from an article  I saw it on tech dirt. They were referring to  an article from  oh  I'm gonna find the original link. I'd like to I'd like to tell people the original link. It's from Patrick McKay  Saying that Universal Music has an unusual deal with YouTube. This is scary  Yeah, I bother the heck out of me  That if you if they issue a takedown this is from fair used tube org. That's Patrick's site if  If they if Universal Music does a takedown  They don't have to honor counter gnosis. They don't even have to give you the option to appeal  they just YouTube just takes it down and he quotes a an email  Received by a YouTube user named John his name is is a YouTube account is verner von or volen road  Who posts reviews of old vinyl records? He had a seven-minute video?  Reviewing an old Eric be and Rakim record from the 80s most of which is him talking about the record  But there are a couple of clips of him playing segments of the record  It's his opinion that that's fair use but that's neither here nor there  He got an email after YouTube pulled it down from UMG's request. Hi there. This is from YouTube  Thank you for your counter notification  The complainant has reaffirmed the information in its DMCN notification YouTube has a quote contractual obligation  To this specific copyright owner that prevents us from reinstating videos in such circumstances  Therefore we regretfully cannot honor this counter notification and that's that and  Then he points to the help page referenced in the email which says on YouTube's site  Nice Python script YouTube enters into agreements with certain music copyright owners to allow use of their sound recordings and musical compositions  In exchange for this some of these music copyright owners require us to handle videos containing their sound recordings in ways that  Differ from the usual process on YouTube under these contracts  we may be required to remove specific videos from the site block specific videos in certain territories or  Prevent specific videos from being reinstated after a counter notification in  Some instances this may mean the content ID appeals and or counter notification  Process won't even be available in the first place. There will be no appeal  We win you lose and even if we're wrong  There's nothing you can do about it and I have to say it happens to me so often that there are incorrect takedowns  NBC Universal the sister company of this did it did a takedown of one of our  Videos I didn't notice for a long time had no NBC Universal content in that case  Appealed and it was immediately reinstated and if it had happened from UMG might be there be no appeal at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gee, let's test it Leo. Let's play a UMG song right now, huh? Not on this show

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's do it on a show with no ads  Because it cost me it cost me money. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's that that's scary that's that's evil

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's definitely evil

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know if it's true if this is as exactly as reported

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it is you can see that I mean this is a YouTube page. It's not some phony page. I'm reading directly from  support.google.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is to make to make Siva body and Athens argument, you know a company  He argues companies must be evil and I disagree with that  But but but there's a greater truth it in the sense that Google deals with Verizon ergo Google sells its soul  On net neutrality Google deals with music companies and says please don't sue us and it sells its soul  Would appear I can't believe that anyone in Google thinks this is a good idea for the customers and what happened with being customer first

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, doesn't it also raise legal issues for instance if there is a fair use defense

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Google doesn't have to allow anything to go up or down  There's no there's not like it's it's it's a free speech issue in a constant

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, but it but they might know of course not because they're a private company  But they'll write they might they not lose their DMCA harbor status safe harbor status  How so because the safe harbor clause protects them yes because they're not a publisher  Right as long as they adhere to the DMCA takedown process  Oh, I see. So if they don't do appeals if they don't adhere now  I'm no lawyer and we got to get an Eli Patel or somebody to explain this but but I I  Wonder and maybe not but I wonder would this not impact the thing that protects you in  In the DMCA if you don't honor the DMCA takedown process exactly specified now  Maybe it doesn't specify that there should be an appeal process. Well, that's what I'm asking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there is there a chat room? Is there an appeal process?  mandated under DMCA

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Be an interesting way for the answer. I think there has to be no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure there's at all. The point is that you mitigated your liability if you took it down  Right, that's the DMCA process. I think the the appeals process as long as you make it easy to take it down

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who cares right if it's real, right? That's the issue we get takedowns all the time from like Brazilian broadcasters and stuff  I don't I don't understand  DMCA says you have the right to safe harbor as long as you don't exercise editorial control. You're a vessel

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not so sure that's true on it. That's that's that's a leftover of the and probably whoever  Khalifa saying and there's a lawyer but but there's this commonly held belief out there from an old  Prodigy case  That which is the DMCA was actually the answer to  The original prodigy case if you didn't touch any content you were safer  Then if you once is he once you made an editorial control  Then you became more liable and Congress in a rare moment of wisdom realized how wrong that was going to be  Because what would mean is no one would ever touch any content and they would just all leave crap up  So they had to leave the ability for you to take crap down  And not suffer they also had to leave the ability for you to have interactivity and have people put content up without you suffering  And that's where section 230 came in and that's where the DMCA  Tearout is so it was actually an answer to that idea that if you touch it you lose  That was that was what what what this was to cure

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm pissed off at Google because we're trying to hire people who live in Austin and they're never gonna move to Petaloma now  Google fiber  Google fiber  It's official next stop Austin, Texas for that gigabit fiber and AT&T says yeah, we're gonna do that, too  Yeah, I don't know how much they'll charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where's the timpani's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You usually say and that's and that's there you go Google change look, I'm sorry I didn't give you the cue it's my fault  my fault  By the way Jeff if this makes you feel any better  Some strange person named Zack Kummer or comer on CNN has it was given a rave review to the Chromebook pixel just came out  rave review  A rave review he says he says with the pixel  I'm totally on cloud 9 if you're looking for a speedy sturdy machine and are comfortable living in the cloud  The pixel may be for you overall  I found this computer to be a refreshing approach to computing in the cloud  Thanks to its high def screen and wicked fast computer power  My month with a pixel rant and the Leo wine thoroughly changed my thinking on how a computer should behave while handling my files  He does say he does say he's not crazy about battery life, which was terrible  Charging port gets unhinged with the accidental pull the wire  I don't sure I had that problem and he doesn't like the fan noise  I'm wondering if Zach's ever used a computer to be honest with you, but okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of fan. Well, I was I got spoiled by the by the  $249 Chromebook with no fan. It was quite lovely to never have noise come out of it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you're gonna have anything with an i5 in it. You're gonna have a fan. Yeah, I got a fan  I don't like it either. Yeah, and an i5 is not wicked fast, but it's okay. Nothing wrong with it  You gotta have the last word don't you? Yeah, just gotta try this  He says up to now Chrome OS computers have been inexpensive and fast  But Google has done something unexpected with the new Chromebook pixel. I don't know who this guy is though  So I don't know if I can trust him  I'm just I read that so you'd so you'd see that you're not alone Jeff  You and Vance and this guy's Zach

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're gonna get a room and get a room you guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see what else here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you guys think of the News Corp and now CBS threatened to pull their networks off because of area?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, speaking of whining they need the Leo whining so apparently they're unclear on the concept of free over-the-air broadcast television

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but here's the problem. That was the when networks were forced to pay to get carried  I mean when cable was forced to pay to carry network, sorry  Retransmission fees that right there was ripping off every one of us the country. There are airwaves  We give it to them for free and and in return we get programming  That was the deal and then along comes cables. You know, it's not fear cables making money. So what they so they charge cable  They're not charging cable. They're charging us the viewers, right?  So if you still want to watch free over-the-air  There's only a last I checked about 12% of Americans still watch TV over revenue years  by the way  those are often poor people and old people and  CBS and Fox and NBC are trying to screw poor and old people and they say they want to pull off  Programs and put them behind a wall which by the way, what are they gonna put on worse shows even worse shows on their networks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't don't they in fact have advertising on those shows. I mean, are they not making money? It's it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't get it. It's advertising is the business model right? Well, you want distribution

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the point. It's just like newspapers now  With so much competition with so many other issues. No, they're counting on two revenue streams  They're there. They are not very dependent very dependent on this new revenue stream  The New York Times is more dependent on consumer on circulation revenue now than it ever has been  Networks are now getting networks and local stations are now getting fees consumer fees. They never got before right?  So no, they're there. It's not it's not the majority of the revenue, but they're dependent on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So just to recap aero a ERE o.com a Barry Diller company puts an antenna little tiny dime-sized  antenna for each and every person who subscribes up in the city you subscribe to and  Then you can get over the air television over the Internet  Of course, it's only available in New York City right now, but soon expanding to 22

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Court case recently so they're expanding to other cities. I thought it was silly  I don't care about broadcast TV, but now I'm so pissed at these stupid networks a I'm gonna I want to subscribe to area  I'm really gonna do it and then be  Fine FCC take back our airwaves  We can make much better use that spectrum  Only 12% of Americans watch the stuff if we had a subsidy for internet connections for those people  That would be the end of broadcast. We don't need broadcast. You know, what happens if Fox and CBS go cable only  I mean, how do they do that? They still have broadcast channels. They still have to fill them  So like I say, I have a license they have a worse crap on them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, what do they do with their broadcast?  Licenses this is pure bluff. There's no way they do it. They can't they can't do it  But it's an interesting thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is just gonna pay you're gonna pay for the Mindy project

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am gonna dash right after this but I wanted to mention  Think up got accepted into Google summer of code and this is my tip this week Google summer of code  This is for a per awesome program for for college students. I don't think just undergraduates. I think graduates PhDs count as well  It's kind of basically the best summer job that you can get as a student programmer  Essentially Google pays you five thousand dollars to hack on an open source project for the summer for three months and you get actually assigned  A mentor from the open source project. There are some great projects  That were accepted. In fact, I'm really thrilled that we got accepted where we're in there with the likes of Twitter and  WordPress and Mozilla, I mean great really really great open source projects. There's a hundred seventy seven there that you can choose from  Anyway, we got accepted  I hope you'll check us out a blog that think up comm if you're interested in contributing our project or another project  It's fantastic program and student applications open on April 22nd  But between now and then you should be kind of redoing your research and seeing what kind of projects are available for these different  Organizations and you get paid pretty good money  For really great summer job. And in fact, we did this the competition stiff  We applied two years ago and we didn't get accepted  But we did get accepted in 2010 and I mentored we mentored two students and one of them was based in India at the time  He has since landed job at Facebook and moved to the United States  So it's a really great and a resume builder and awesome summer job

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they do the students get to pick the project and there's a project get to pick the students or you assign

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's it's so students apply to as many  Organizations as they want and propose a project that they want to work on and then the projects say, okay  Yes, we have a mentor who wants to work with you on this day. They say okay  Yes, we want these students and then kind of Google helps match them up  Google uses system doing this called melange. It's google-melange.com  Which is the whole system if you just google google summer code 2013  So so a student can can apply for several different organizations  But they have to propose a specific project that they want to get done by the end of the summer and you don't get paid  Unless you're you're done and there are midterm grades. I mean, it's basically it's a full-time job  So your mentor sort of grades you and you get paid in increments over the summer  So if you disappear, you know, you basically got to ship something  so both of our mentees shipped like huge features our installation wizard and and our  Maps plug-in that are still like huge parts of the software, you know today three years later  So with a smaller project like think of you could have a really big impact  But you know with it with a larger product  Project you might get more experience or there might be more mentors  So it's kind of kind of up to you see how much you know  What kind of organization want to work with but it's really it's a fantastic program and we're really thrilled that we're we're in it this summer  I'm excited to mentor someone this summer  Congratulations, that's fantastic.
