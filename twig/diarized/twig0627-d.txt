Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well  Right now from my point of view and my background is computer science is somewhat abstract  I'm looking at information warfare in different forms  The big priorities these days are like helping with cyber security  Fighting disinformation good or as the cool kids call it influence operations  And also countering harassment  First focusing on the worst of it, which is directed against women journalists  There's other areas including helping vets  Women in tech and as you've seen pigeon rescue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You explained that the diapers were for the pigeons I just was I was unclear at the beginning and now I understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Rather call them pigeon pants than depends. I like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now let me pigeon pants. Let me let me let me be the journalist and ask you the hard question  Greg is your supportive journalism  Because of a little residual guilt  Some journals that claim new Craigslist was the end of journalism because you of course took over their class

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're very lucrative classified ads. Well the in the recent in recent years, let's say the last several years  economists and industry analysts have finally taken a look at the numbers because I worried  That Craigslist had a substantial effect. I assume there must be something  Yeah, but some of these guys took a look at the numbers adjusted for inflation  looked at circulation  household growth  Tom Tom Bechdel an economist took a look at this and he showed  starting in the 60s or earlier  When television news became a thing  Newspapers started dying. Oh, that's and that he shows in 2008 and 2009  How with the platforms taken off that's when newspaper revenue plummeted, right?  It's a big concern to me because like I say  Trustworthy press is the immune system of democracy  Perhaps it failed us in 2016  My instincts tells us that Craigslist had to have some effect, but the economists tell me I'm just flattering myself

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking at Craigslist and it's still exactly the same as it always has been which is  In this day and age kind of refreshing who doesn't go there. You need an apartment. That's the place  Like yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I was gonna say I'm on Craigslist all the time. It is my recycling plan for devices  It's the way I get new furniture  I'm just like yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Craig is there an origin story to the to the I use air quotes design. Yeah, I was gonna ask him that exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in  96 or so I'm not real clear. I  Realized that the emails I was posting  I could write some code in Perl  That would turn those emails which were in a predictable format into web pages  I could write a script which built index pages. So I had free  Publishing so it started right away as it got a little more complicated. I realized that I have no design skills  but no  Thank you, I know to keep things simple and as it turns out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Simple and fast are great design points. And what do you have against uppercase letters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a bit of a programmer cliche  That is that I do like a lowercase it's easier to visually parse  But in the case of the name of the thing, I wanted to de-emphasize  The role and presence of the guy named Craig  awesome, I'm still working see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Craig has always been one of the most humble  of  original internet folk and so

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  One thing Craig and I talked about  When we chat as friends that I'm curious what the latest is is we compare gadgets and gadget hunger  Yeah, what were your current phones Craig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm afraid I've overindulged recently. Oh, I don't have the I do have the Samsung fold 3

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, all right. I want to get some input from you on that but okay keep going

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the deal is it is a substantial improvement over the two  Screens much better speakers better. It's faster more durable  battery life has a at best not improved and that's a source of some  Irritation, but I get a lot of proposals  Formatted eight and a half by eleven PDFs. And so  Those are you know, the screen is good for that  I do use my notebook for things but sometimes because sometimes you want a big screen and big keyboard  But my my own is my main computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And and and let it be known that Craig is a Chromebook user because I'm a smart guy  likes else, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's cool, so what are you watching the babies are you getting the acer spin or what are you getting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I do have the fold as a backup. I have an old pixel and  I just know accouterments like this microphone and a decent camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna have to ask you about the microphone because everybody I know who's watching is gonna say what is he using?  Not only does it sound good. It looks pretty sweet cool  This is a tool a microphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in fact Craig I saw it you talked about it before pre-show and I ordered it already so mine's on mine's on the way  Partly because if I get Jeff you should get it too. It's a USB USB C  It obviously works with a Chrome device Chromebook device  But also it has internal memory so you can record locally as you as you're using it  Which would be great for those times when as long as you don't yell at me for whatever my microphone choices

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want I want everyone to be a witness. How can I yell at you? How can I yell at you?  This is the official

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Craig Newmark mic  You find your way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You did that on purpose Craig I could tell what do you mean your comedy tutor

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I know I'm not as funny as I think I am  But around the corner here in the village. This is guy who's been doing comedy for over 50 years  He was very very popular in the 70s  we're trying to help a little bit and  He he has a given me material to use trying to help me with my delivery and timing  I didn't know this  He consents let me Bruce  He knew Lenny Bruce  Whoa, and he says I very little hope

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  way back  Of the collection of friends I have here who hang out at the same coffee shop  There's a handful of people who've been here 50 years and then there's a handful of people who just moved here  So that's pretty cool about the village and I'm afraid you don't find in San Francisco

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm jealous because I think if I were gonna live in New York, the village is definitely the place to live. It's beautiful  Yeah, are you gonna do some open mics Craig I have sworn to not do any open

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's how you that's how you test yourself  That's how you know, you've got it that feedback that link between you and the audience

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's probably saying whatever you do Craig don't do it  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think I I need to stay focused on areas which in fact Jeff Jarvis got me into  He's responsible for my getting into a number of the fields that I spend most of my time in

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it is his fault. Nice. No, no, no, he gives me credit. I don't deserve  Right Craig was interested in and concerned about journalism long before we met well and that concern is well-founded

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm glad you I'm glad you're doing what you're doing Craig. It's no doubt. It's much. Yeah as a journalist. I've got a thank you. Thanks. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the the deal is that Jeff in  2017 got me to read the NATO handbook on Russian information warfare  It described the techniques the Russians used in 2016  But as it turns out the same techniques had been used  well  In an unpleasant manner against me years before  So I that actually really helped me out and now I'm helping out other folks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not a journalist. I just play one on TV. I want to just say that right up front. So anyway  Let's take a little break and then we actually have quite a bit of news to talk about  on this week in  Google  So much fun. I just I'm still kind of glowing a little bit  Our show today brought to you and I mean brought to you quite literally by those great folks at cashfly  We really couldn't have done twit the podcast network without the help of cashfly way back in the beginning  We were trying to figure out how do we get you know a quarter of a million people?  Download a show every week without killing our servers because it was we tried bit torrent for a while  Then met Levine at cash like called me up and said  Let us help and man for more than a decade now  If you download anything our video our audio even if you go to the website and get the content  You're getting it from cash fly the CDN the best CDN in the world  They've been innovating content delivery since 1999. We've been using them since I think  2009 maybe they offer ultra low latency streaming now, which is really interesting to me  Not we're not talking web RTC  We know about the feelings of that the stream delays on cash flies ultra low latency streaming less than one second  They offer a great HTML 5 player with an SDK which you can embed anywhere websites applications even mobile devices  The cash fly is the fastest CDN for throughput globally over 50 points of presence all over the world  So you're closer to your customers and on their low latency network your video streams  Will be streaming quickly anywhere you have viewers doesn't matter where what continent they are and man does it scale up to a million?  users concurrently more than a million users concurrently  You can ingest thousands of synchronous streams. They've designed a platform that can transmucks thousands of streams simultaneously  With live failover they can ingest RTMP RTMP ssrt and more to deliver ultra low latency  SLDP and HLS streams at the same time and  Of course one of the things we always liked about cash fly  I've always loved about it is they tailor your plan to your needs your usage your  particular kinds of bandwidth  Spikes all built on top of their reliable robust global network with ingest and delivery  Wherever you need it all over the world and the best 24 7 365 priority support  Can I by the way just say?  That  Because they have all of those points of presence  They're the world's most reliable CDN backed by a hundred percent SLA. We're not talking one nine five nines ten nine a hundred percent a  hundred percent a million concurrent streams five times faster than other CDNs and  a hundred percent SLA  You're gonna love cash fly and they're nice people too  They've been helping the world central kitchen during the kovat crisis and so far served warm meals to people  In need they pioneered the first any cast CDN infrastructure in 2002 their best top technology  Automatically finds the fastest route to and from customer origin across their global network of pops for maximum performance and reliability  If you're interested, can I recommend just go to twit that cash fly comm bring along your CDN bill?  If you've got one your usage patterns if you've got them  Check and see if you are overpaying 20% or more for a CDN  Nice guys, no pressure twit that cash fly  Comm thank you cash fly for all you do for us twit that cash fly dot com  It's so this is the only show I'm gonna bring this up on but I think it's the kind of subject we should probably  talk about on this show the  committee investigating the January 6 capital riots the insurrection  Have demanded records from Facebook from Twitter from 4chan from 8kun from gab from Google  YouTube from parlor from reddit from snapchat from telegram from the Donald dot win from tik-tok twitch Twitter  Zello and yes phone companies. In fact, Marjorie Taylor cream said if you send them my phone records  I  Said we're gonna shut you down. I don't think she can do that. But anyway  Obviously upsetting to some power. She and she and her boss have power to threaten they certainly can threaten  But I think a lot of people even people on the left are concerned about this notion  Certainly congressional committees have wide  powers  But they want a lot of information  How do we feel about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What do they want that's not public oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They want a lot more than what's public certainly from the phone companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want where you were do they want your texts actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where you have to draw the line if it's not public knowledge. It's uh, it's probably warrant

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it is a warrant if they have a so they have a warrant and a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Congress has huge powers to do this, of course  Congressional but they still have a warrant authority. Do they go before a judge or do they go?  No, they don't need to committee. They're Congress

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Congress has the government. Yeah, they have this power. Okay  They are this so the chairman  Benny G Thompson  Wrote the select committee to investigate the January 6th attack on the United States Capitol is examining the facts circumstances and causes  Of the attack and relating to the peaceful transfer power in order to identify and evaluate lessons learned and to recommend  corrective laws policies procedures rules or regulations  So I think it's important to say that at least in this statement. They're not saying we're going after individuals. This is for  Understanding so that we can do something going forward  however  It says  They seek a range of records from social media including data reports analyses and communications  stretching back to the spring of 2020  They're also seeking information on policy changes social media companies adopted or failed to adopt  including decisions on banning material  You know, I haven't seen the the  Demand like mass Mike Masnick has it if you go to the post on the rundown

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So all accounts users groups events messaging forms marketplaces posts or other user-generated content that was sanctioned suspended removed throttle  Deprioritized labeled suppressed or banned from your platforms related to any items detailed in the request  So part of what they're saying is we can go look at the public stuff  But if you already killed it, we want to see that  Okay, I mean that's I think legit. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's I mean cuz other I mean, it's the same thing like, you know burning

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Your letters after you you're incriminating whatever so sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Masnick calls it a social media fishing expedition and says issues companies should resist

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean if you published it socially it I mean screenshots and everything are there you wanted it to be out  Yep. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think anything that was public

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think anything that was public I  Think it's fair game. I think your DMS  should be considered like a  first-class letter and  And requires a warrant now. The question is I don't know what the what you know, as well as Leo just said Congress can warrant  Can issue warrants as well?  Is it the same power as the court? I don't know. Oh, it's more than the court

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's more than the court a congressional subpoena carries a huge weight behind it I  Need to summon a lawyer into the circle. Yeah. No, I it's my understanding. This is more. This is a this is absolutely powerful

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, but when you go before Congress, what are the it's not I mean, can you use that information to then later charge someone with like a  Felony or a mystery? Well, that's the concern, isn't it?  Well, I don't know. I mean Congress has brought authority. I'll read you what the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  PBS says  And but this is in the context of impeachment by the way, but it's the same thing Congress has broad authority established by Supreme Court rulings to conduct  Investigations they can request documents or ask witnesses to testified  Well, I'm not specified by the Constitution  Congress has a long established history of using subpoenas to compel testimony when information is not provided  voluntarily  They have three options to enforce subpoena  They have three options to enforce subpoenas in the face of defiance. They can pursue criminal contempt  But they have to go to the US Attorney for DC  to bring criminal charges that  faces a  Fine of up to $100,000 in a maximum one-year sentence in prison  But there are other things they can do. I don't think you can send the sergeant at arms to detain them. I  Don't think that's gonna happen  That seems kind of  They can also file a civil lawsuit so  While technically they have the power to imprison they don't I don't think they would use that  And yeah, I yeah, it's it would be challenging

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Legal theory actually on how you should treat statements before a Congress in civil or criminal  Court and it's like  This is a thing because this is all hearsay. Oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's complicated because it's not even a perspective. So it's complicated from the perspective of the company  there was in my view there was an insurrection trying to overthrow our government and  If the company says no, we won't give this to you. Are they then complicit in the insurrection?  It's the other way to look at it. Here's Mike

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also parts of the law or  Society that says no that wasn't really an insurrection and people will fight that saying that it was not an insurrection  That's that's the investigation key. That's just how wonky our justice system is  You know, we just had a man that was killed by a police officer yet. There was arguments that said no  He wasn't killed by a police officer. He was killed from other stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But if we can't investigate if the investigative powers are limited  Or barking  If the investigative powers aren't there then how is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  adjudication decided one of the things Mike Masnick points to particularly as  Troubling is internal. This is point 11 of things are requesting internal communications reports documents or other materials relating to internal employee concerns  About content on the platform associated relevant. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and I'm not sure whether I could be I could be concerned about something you could be concerned about something or not  What does that matter? Right? That's absolutely relevant as to whether an engineer inside Facebook said, oh, I think it's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the one said I don't think it is but who cares Masnick points out the company these companies as we've said again and again  Have First Amendment protected moderation  powers and  He says forcing every company to turn over such information seems like a very very slippery slope  towards the government turning that information back around and threatening or intimidating companies over these

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  protected moderation well, but they're being intimidated first by  The majority of the minority leader in the house  We say and I'm gonna come get you if you do anything if you do any of this stuff that the committee with its authority  Yeah, McCarthy is undercutting the authority of threatening them. Yeah, so there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Skewered on both sides by the right in the bar. So I would I guess I  Would what I would say is I would hope companies would cooperate to the degree that they feel it's appropriate  Especially with public or at some time public yes stops and not cooperate to the degree  They think it's inappropriate things like internal employee discussions  And say no, we're not gonna give you that Sue us  Yeah  And let the court decide on that and I would hope that that's the way a company responds to that. I  Don't know. We don't know yet at how how these companies will respond. I can guess that  Is not gonna give them anything they you know, they're famous for not not giving any information  Who won't I'm sorry, Mr.  Eight-kun's it would the successor to 4chan 8chan right cool, which is of course the home of the phony queue  Not the real queue I might add but the phony queue who's the guy the son of the guy the brain is parlor

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It all got leaked anyway, so right matter  That's how that's how I want to be parlor or parlay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I always say parlor. I always thought it was parlor. Oh, they're not very Frenchy. I don't  Call french fries Liberty Fry, so I think you could probably assume they're not saying parlay  You're playing off I get it with this is a kind of pun of parlay as in and parley but  Well, I don't think they're that smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What is the Donald Donald I know to speak

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Honestly, we're not in touch with anybody at parlay so we don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To be I do I did find that I had a parlor login  Oh, I have an account so I guess I did that to protect my name

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I immediately sign up for it I don't hang out there I  Don't hang out in sewers. Well, I don't know if it's a sewer, but I  Yeah, it's not my cup of tea. Let's put it that way. All right, like these people don't want me. I know it  Oh, I go in there regularly bait them

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So is the court of twig ruled here that that public things yes private things resist  Yeah, that's a good thing going forward and I if you put up publicly man, it's public somebody somebody's shorted somewhere so

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably I'm good on that. I I need to know more about this situation. I'm sorry. I'm waffling  I just I can't make a call until I actually know more. Oh, come on. What kind of do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We need hot takes here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have nothing I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can't give you a hot take I can say if it's public you should only give you a hot waffle

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what that's actually a nice little pun instead of the queen of the hot take she's the queen of the hot waffle  That's gonna be the title of the show right there hot waffle  Or Stacy's hot waffle. No, I think we'll just leave it that awful

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't want to have any ownership

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, yeah, I think that that's not unreasonable  I would expect that's what these companies would do that's what Apple does is what Google does where they resist where they feel it's  inappropriate they you know and

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Up to the point where they can't we're you know, all right, so let's turn around. What if they said McCarthy?  You're right. No, we resist the whole thing. Well, is that wrong of them? No, I don't think so  Really? I think that's wrong of them. I  Think there was a serious thing that happened in the country and  this was the mechanism by which it was done and we are all screaming all the time about how they ought to  Fess up about about how things are, you know  Anti-vaxxers being organized there and other things being organized there and the government comes to them to says tell us how this was organized

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There and they don't I'm Jack Dorsey  I think a reasonable the CEO of Twitter the reasonable take would be you know  This is unclear what your power is and how much of this I can legally and responsibly turn over  I'd like a court to rule so we're going to respectfully say no until a court gives us a clarification. That's fair

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Interesting to tell what's app is not here. Is that just under the Facebook or oh that isn't true. I mean telegram is here  Must because Instagram isn't listed either. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, yeah, I think it you know, I mean look this this whole thing has been a partisan mess  From the beginning I'm not surprised that it's become partisan again  and  Yeah, I mean I would I think as I would like to get to the bottom of this, right?  But you can see why Marjorie Taylor Greene and Kevin McCarthy are saying you can't have our phone records

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a different question  But that is if there was illegal  Conspiracy to bring down the government through the phones  You know we do it to the mafia why not do it to the insurrectionists

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and you you get phone records on people who are persons of interest in a case and so if you establish that  Marjorie Taylor Greene is a Jeff  Jim Jim Jordan is thank you. Thank you finish Jeff Jarvis that Jeff Jarvis. Sorry  Brain brain Jeff always a jacket never mind

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  No, I think it look I want to get to the bottom of it I don't you know  There there's things like who are you talking to when you're over there in the corner making a phone call  Who are you talking through? That's one of the things by the way that a number of members of Congress do not want to  talk about so  Okay. Now now we understand it is not Jeff Jarvis. It is Jim Jordan because Jeff wears  What were you saying about a jacket Jeff is a well-dressed well-dressed guy  There's a battle going on over in reddit that I've been watching with interest  Fascinating so there is a at least one sub reddit on the reddit more than one I think but there's at least yeah  There's the r slash are no  So  Until today  Reddit said we are not gonna block  the sub reddit no new normal which has  124,000 subscribers and is really about not getting vaccinated  And because reddit said no we're you know free speech. We're not gonna ban them  135 other sub reddits including some big ones like the Macintosh sub reddit went dark  Said okay, we're not gonna participate in reddit  We can't in good conscience participate in reddit power to the people then it works  Today reddit bowed to the pressure and shut down no new normal

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow, I don't think our corgi was was affected

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Those corgi people just are such  Wafers and they're not focused on this  By the way nor did the Valheim sub reddit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, you know, I think yeah the site our new normal according to reddit was guilty  And this was the thing that finally put it over the top of a practice known as brigading  where  Members of the sub reddit are encouraged to go target a you know, the slash are slash kovat group for instance  We found very clearly that the sub reddit is not going to be able to do anything  signals indicating that our  No, new normal was the source of about 80 brigades in the last 30 days  Largely directed communities with more mainstream views on kovat or location based communities that have been discussing kovat of restrictions  Slash are slash Hawaii for instance is very actively talking about what's going on in Hawaii with regard to kovat  this behavior continued even after a warning was issued and  That finally gave them I think the leverage to shut it down. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The people for am I the people  They actually did it which is the other reddit thread that I am often on  So they actually did  Stop. Okay. So there you go. The core he's didn't and I'm on that a little bit AI

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ta yeah ai ta. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I follow them to  often often wondering what the hell people are thinking but  Yeah, yeah and I noticed a lot of the the subreddits that I participate in were shut down I guess they'll come back  They'll come back. So that's interesting. That's a I think that's actually kind of a good example of self policing and  And a social network doing a good job of figuring it out  Reddit did clarify its guidelines today to make clear that it prohibits posting health information that has been  Manipulated and presented a mislead or poses a risk of  significant physical harm all you you follow T foo  Or is it is it I am I the a hole  Because T foo also T fool which has 10 million subscribers  Today I f'd up is the yeah. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Columns, okay, so I really love this I'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Futurology also shut down  Steve Huffman who's the CEO of reddit wrote last week  He wanted the reddit to be a place for open and authentic discussion  Dissent is a part of reddit and the foundation of democracy  I kind of agree with him, but it read it is also owned by Conde Nast and at some point  corporate interests  Take hold Pokemon ghosts of reddit was going dark and would stay when yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So someone on the chat just said there's a waffle one so I went to our waffles, but I didn't go to I love waffles

Transcript:  We don't we can't judge because it's not our generation  Yeah, and and their generation this is seems to be how they communicate  One one wouldn't want a child to become a complete addict you know  But at the same time I don't think three hours a week is much my mom and dad  And I'll never forgive them for this that I can only watch half an hour of TV a night  Which is three and a half hours a week, so it's not so different  You couldn't even get a movie in once no I had to choose between man from uncle and Batman  like  God  What what the hell am I in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, but what's the difference between  Your parents or me as a parent putting this in versus China government is it because this well that's a good overlord

Transcript:  It's that's a very good point where it might be accessible for a parent to do  It should never a government should never be allowed to do this right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  They're not 20 depends on how much money you make. I thought it was like 20%  It's yeah, it's based on how much you make in little chunks. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I like it. I like that. Yeah, if you pay see 2040 Stacy 2040

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In South Korea a law has passed will soon be signed into law. This is gonna be  Interesting that requires Apple and Google to offer competing payment systems in  Their app stores. This is something both Apple and Google have been fighting in the US and they've been fighting for a long time in South Korea  Companies that fail to comply could be fined up to 3% of their revenue in South Korea  Apparently we talked about this on yesterday on Macbreak Weekly Apple says no, it's no problem  We'll just bill the developers for their 30% share. We'll send them an invoice  Which is very interesting, I don't know how they're gonna get that money now this only applies to obviously Korean  applications the Korean app store

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  explain this to me a bit because  now  I pay through Apple  And Apple takes 30% of everything you pay through that mechanism  But if I paid through some other mechanism Apple's just gonna say you still owe us  Yeah, otherwise, we're gonna take you otherwise if you don't pay us we're taking down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like what the state of California did when Amazon wasn't paying sales tax at the end of the year when you filed your income  Taxes in the state. They'd say well, what did you buy online and give us?  Yep, any sales tax you didn't pay Amazon you're gonna pay us not that it worked but I mean at least they tried

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But Apple still has the power to take down the app that if they don't get paid and Apple knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if you don't pay Apple in this case, yeah, that's true. But how would they know they wouldn't know how much you got would they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so are they doing it to the you could do it right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, they wouldn't know for either but it would go to the developers  But let's say I'm using Instagram and I want to buy something on  Instagram instead of going through Apple, which it does right now  Actually Instagram is a bad example. They don't sell anything but there's an in-app purchase somewhere  You would go to PayPal or would go to the New York Times  That's actually who would like to do this right New York Times would like to send you to stripe and have you pay stripe  I don't see how Apple would know unless they're monitoring all the traffic going in and out of your iPhone

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are they are they I don't think so. I mean they have the capability. I'm sure in Korea

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In Korea, this has been nicknamed the Google Power Abuse Prevention Law  Boy, is some idea of what they're what they're going at  The Google Play Store accounts for 75% of mobile app downloads globally in the second quarter Apple  65% of App Store consumers spending in an app's purchases. So it could be a lot of money billions of dollars  And and a significant hit to Apple, but more importantly from Apple's point of view. It could be the first domino in  Because the US is considering something like this. The EU is considering something like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So is this is this righteous is this is is it a monopoly or is it fair game?  But hey, I get it's my phone marketplace and I check the apps to make sure they're okay and that's what I deserve

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's the interesting thing even though the FTC and Congress are looking at doing this  President Biden is bound by a trade law to protest it because it is a South Korean law impacting American companies  And actually I would support him because I don't think that's how this should happen  Not by by you don't fiat

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't think a  Another country should pass a law or do you not think that the US should pass a law or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you think well, it's an interesting question because I don't I think it should really come down to  Well, that's a good question because if it's not the government  Is looking at these no actually and the FTC and Congress is considering a similar law actually  Amy Klobuchar I think it was Klobuchar introduced a similar law the so  I don't I don't  Don't know I just don't feel like it's right. Are you gonna hot waffle right now? I'm hot waffling. It's all the rage  It's all the rage on the one hand  In some cases Apple is rent-seeking, you know, you could say legitimately  Let's say flappy bird wouldn't exist if it weren't for the iPhone in the app store and the revenues they're generating really  It's it's reasonable for Apple to say 30%  because if honestly if you put it in a box and sold it in a  Remember there used to be software stores for computers if you sold. Yeah, they would take more than half  So 30% and Apple does the download they do the marketing. It's very easy for developer to do doesn't seem unreasonable  It's a little different for a company like Amazon New York Times Netflix who already have  Completely separate from Apple existing businesses and Apple saying oh, yeah  And if somebody buys anything from you on our platform you give us 30% of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is your analogy is right your now? I think your analogy the store is good if you're blockbuster and you sell the video  Yeah, you can still sell the video otherwise  But if you want to sell it to the customer walks in my door blockbuster or Apple I get a cut

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's my store. I get a cut by store. Yeah, and 30% is less than the traditional cut  It's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Microsoft and Sony's charge on their game consoles. I think this is get ready and get ready. I think this is a symptom of moral panic

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know what about so but there's a carriage agreement here  So if you think about us getting mad at ISPs  Because they're charging companies like Netflix for peering or they're gonna charge people like net neutrality  So they're gonna come in and say you need to pay us to get your website delivered  You would argue against that because consumers don't really have a much choice right there, right  Is it a monopoly and that's I guess so is it a carriage disagreement or is it just like a shelf space  payment disagreement and I would argue it's more like a carriage disagreement, especially on Apple because Google lets you side load  That's just my take that's my non waffle

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact of all the companies Google seems the like least likely the one you should you should censure for this  Because you could do it with Google with exactly  I don't know, you know, this seems like moral panic, especially when you look at the nickname

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly. That's the thing. It's retribution against. Yeah. Oh, they're too powerful be South Korea  We were pretty good at the internet and then we kind of fell behind

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think they followed behind

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They all everybody has Google jealousy  Everybody says Google jealousy. German has Germany has Google jealousy South Korea has Google jealousy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Facebook doesn't have a sense of humor  Microsoft I don't think has a sense of humor Amazon doesn't have much sense of humor Google has a sense of humor that is I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  100% it makes me love you give them that even more yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Even in the face of Korea and moral panic they've got a sense of humor

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very funny I  Like the whispered

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I like the whisper throughout

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The whispers are great. I don't know if they're gonna run that on TV. I doubt well, maybe they will two minutes  No, but you just did it for them you could do a cut down I wonder I  Know I  It's good enough to run on TV. I just wonder if anybody would get it like if no we get I don't think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I almost I almost tuned it out. I almost tuned it out, so I know a normal folks would probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There goes Google again being fancy, and who knows who's Johnny. I mean most people don't know yeah, they don't know it  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They haven't sat through eight million Apple product launch

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another one coming up. I think in about a week and a half. I don't know no invitations

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have they not sent anything out yet not yet if they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So our thinking is that they so they don't want to do it the day after Labor Day, which is Monday  So they would normally do it on a Tuesday, so that's rules out the seventh  Maybe they do it on the eighth the Wednesday or more likely they'll do it on the 14th the following Tuesday  So you know we'll learn it on the seventh what they're gonna do it on the 14th  There's I think that's what they're gonna do it now there was you might have seen a rumor that Google was going to do it  Right before Apple's announcement, which would be I think foolhardy bold  But foolhardy  That rumor has been debunked  Prosser has said no, they're not gonna do it and he's usually pretty accurate  He said my sources say Google is going to announce the pixel 6 October  28th

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now announce or make available

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually that was he says launching so let me get this right. I think launching means available in stores

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Better not be like my the aces. I can't buy which is just every day

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every day so the ounces depressor launches when people can get their hands exactly so the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Original rumor came from bald panda on  Wibo which is that sounds like no pants tech cover. Yeah, they've been wrong before  They said it was gonna be September 13th, which would be the day before an apple a putative Apple event  Social media freaked out processor writes outright laughing at Google, but he says he looked into it and  Reaching out to a few of my best sources  he says  The event will be October 19th, which is a Tuesday  Put it put a mark in that one and we got to get ready to do that and the launch will be  Thursday the 28th nine days later  That's when the market launched it'll be in stores and could be in your hands if you order it right away  so the made by Google event is  Is the 19th oh  I'm sorry, that's pre-orders  So the event could be the 19th or it could be earlier because you know you might announce it and say for ordering on the 19th

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want the phone in my hot little hands. Yeah, that's all I want

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We all want the pixel 6 although I am again. I'm asserting. I thought was interesting Craig really liked the fold  I really like the littler folding phone. I went I was in best buy and I gotta say it's impressive  It's very impressive great screen. I little little works for me as opposed to  Big you know I don't want a phone  That's kind of a thick fat heavy phone that turns into a small tablet  I would rather have just this little  Pocket square sized thing that could fit right into your jacket pocket and then opens up to a normal phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Still sewn shut. How did you know you could tell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you stick your phone in your jacket pocket it gets all bad go down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Restaurant jacket

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I was gonna ask that part which pocket would you keep that one in as opposed to well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it put the side pocket you could put it in a breast pocket on a shirt

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know something like you were she's more like you're yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does look like a cigarette clothes pinning Siggy's okay, so here's an interesting thing  The clothes pinning eyes annoying, but I bought actually I got it for free because I got  you know  credit from  Samsung I think they give you when you pre-order $150  Yeah, so these this is a $50 leather case so without the case it is there is clothes pinning  Do you have a over-the-shoulder John there is clothes pinning? It's it's annoying. Okay. Yeah  Yeah, I don't like that okay, but with but as soon as you slice  But you're gonna want this case anyway because it makes it a little grip here  Yeah, and it actually makes a little classier you can get it in colors  I think it's kind of looks a little bit better thicker. Yeah, it's a little but not yes  You know it's really nice nice and thin and then there's no clothes pinning because the case  Kind of makes up for it and does that look kind of nice? I love

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's really I'm gonna I'm gonna wait and see what the pixel 6 looks like but that could be my next

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The software and pixels better right the problem with Samsung is they have to you know  They have to put their apps in addition to the Google apps and well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's your experience with this one considering you you have had the pixel line for several iterations? It's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the cameras good there were some knocks on the on the flip 3s camera that said oh, it's not as good as the s21  It's more like the s20. Well. You know what the s20 is actually pretty good camera. This is portrait mode of Lisa  And I think  Lisa will do anything for the company that color red is hard to render in digital, so I asked her to dye her tongue red  So I can test it now slushies, but very good. Yeah  Here's a picture of we went out to  dinner with  Odokta and his daughter and this is just selfie the selfie camera. I think it's fine. I'm not only fine  I think it's a great camera. Oh, there's a doctor  Mugging for the camera. I think it's a really good camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My only beef is the white balance is a little off with it in all of those shots that you've shared  And that's probably something in software that they could fix pretty or you could

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Doctor and doctor it described the symptoms of white bells being off  So how do you know that if you go back like look at the just that one there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Notice everything is a bit this little blue blue. Yeah  Uh-huh, and then when you look at this shot of them having dinner  What's normally sort of?  Warm is it's got a green hue to it like look at miss Lisa's face her face has a little green

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think she's that way anyway. Let me let me get auto  If I use if I use the auto function, that's just built into Google Photos. It actually gets better  This is the original and I can of course you can you can you know white balance it after the fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Saw this the image on  Glass dot photo. Yeah, this is this I put shared it there  Really compress it or making images look bad the way the other apps do  Yeah, and when I when I saw it there was like, oh she looks blue. I should have white balanced

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's my right. I should have white balanced

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, I'm I'm man what I'm taking away from this is I'm just never gonna show and any of my photos

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, he's got a good eye actually it's good he's gotta go I see that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's never gonna see any of this well speaking of which I don't fear office

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm curious to get ants view of the AI photo upscaling stuff that Google's done and they do it in Photoshop and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm all for it because that's been around for a little while now and it's getting  New here. Yeah, sir. Okay, it's getting better  Photoshop and Lightroom does it as well  And and it also depends on your image because I've tried it with some of some older rebel Canon rebel  Photos that I had and scales it up and it doesn't make it look any better  It makes it too jagged on edge is thinking that it needs to be sharper  But it just gives it really really jagged edges and it's not not as nice. So you're talking about the Adobe  Technology. Yes, Adobe has their sensei of doing a super enhance  Yeah, the same way that Google is using this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought you're talking about Adobe. So this is the Google the new Google the new Google thing  Hey, I thought now if this this is in petapixel if this is the actual  Original and this is the result that's kind of mind-boggling, but I don't know that's why I'm asking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, but but okay, so that image on the left. That's a lower resolution image  But it's scaled up  So it's gonna look pixelated if it was just shown on your screen, it would look better phone screen  Yeah, I wouldn't notice how bad it is. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Think that's reasonable now what they can't do is make up and so this is not like, you know in CSI  How they would always be like computer enhance enhance  License plate and you're like so it's not gonna be able to fill in numbers or things that it can't see what it's doing  Is it saying? Oh, well, this is how noses normally know what it looks like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, actually, it's more interesting than this is from the Google blog post this sr3 technology  Okay, the model is trained on an image corruption process in which noise is progressive  So they start with a high quality image and they add noise progressively  Until it's only white noise a pure or you know pure noise. So it's artificial dumbness  It says this is what happens when we go in this direction and it learns then to take reverse in the other direction  So it isn't saying that's what a nose looks like. It's actually saying  Based on the degradations we've seen over and over again. So that's an interesting way to train and I have to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These examples Google's giving are pretty amazing better. It wasn't are they do they have them on anything that's not basis

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, they have  Yeah pizza pizza

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I train when I was having for dinner samples, I tried it with some landscape

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  images and with landscape images you get a lot of you know trees and whatnot sort of the  There's detail with those leaves and if you overdo it  It'll almost look like more rain and then just like little razors. So you have to be careful with over sharpening

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also with including the sr3 model in the cascading pipeline they write we also introduce a new data augmentation technique  Which we call conditioning augmentation that furthers improves the sample quality results of  CDM while the super resolution models and CDM are trained in original images from the data set during generation  They need to perform super resolution on the images generated by low result by a low resolution base model  Which may not be of sufficiently high quality in comparison the original images this leads to a train test mismatch for the super resolution models  Conditioning augmentation refers to applying  Data augment you might be right it might actually know about noses to applying data augmentation to the low resolution image in input image of each  Super resolution model on the cascading pipeline these augmentations which in our case include Gaussian noise and Gaussian blur  Prevents each super resolution model from overfitting to its lower resin resolution conditioning output

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So they're actually doing some wild stuff at this day see in the post that shows how it's upsizing a train a pizza  burger a dog

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Various other here you go you can show this John because we can actually watch it happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It'll cycle through very I was here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is remarkable. This is very much  Center enhance zoom enhance  Center this is straight out of Blade Runner

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In my experience this stuff is working best for images that you shoot with a high ISO  Meaning you shoot somewhere. That's really really low light, but yet you still want to get some details without a bunch of grain and noise  I've seen better better effects with that because I've shot a shot some sports here with the hard heads and whatnot  And it's just those field lights, so it's dark out there  And I tell it to enhance it and it it does make it look way better than

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you able to use this technology or using Adobe or somebody I'm using Adobe's is pretty much the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're they're both sharing notes because this is this isn't new. This has been at least since like  2017 2018 somewhere in that area

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It could be the models that Google is using is they're saying that they've got new models that are doing better

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know and do it is their point. They're doing it differently. They're finding new methods to get there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, cuz so I'm not sure which method  Adobe uses ant but  They actually address this comparing their results with which is the green  to other  techniques including regression pulse

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  FSR I can't remember exactly  Exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are way over to the right there yeah, I  Would you know what we really can't judge this until they say here, you know try this in Google photos  Let's see the ant test the ant test. I  would submit it it probably isn't  the same as what  Adobe's doing because I  Think this is this looks like why would Google do a blog post? Yeah, right because why would they do right?  Here are three different four different ways of doing it or three different by cubic  regression  SR3 which is their machine intelligence technology and then the actual  originals  And it's it's true that Google's doing a remarkably better job according to he looks like a British poet or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know  On the happy bird

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that all the I mean that's all British poets. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I you know, I'd love to know more I'd like they don't you know  They don't it doesn't seem like they're offering it. You know, not a lot of this is from github. Maybe there's source  I don't know. Maybe there's source code. It's interesting. Google's publishing this research on github a Microsoft site  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have an example, I don't know if it'll translate though

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is in Adobe's no go. Yeah, go to his screen. This is an Adobe's photo shower a light room

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is this light room using that enhance and this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The enhanced version of it. Yeah, I think that's I think they're using other techniques like by cubic. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't think they're using Google's Gans or AI stuff. I'm Elston. Yeah, see the original is definitely softer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with you. I've used light rooms  And yes as well  That's almost like an unsharp mask and stuff. I don't I'm not sure but even up to the the resolution if you look  Here they're improving resolution as well, huh? Oh, yeah, I see. Yeah. Oh look at that big difference  Huh? Well, I have to say then that looks pretty good  Given how much they're there. They're what quadrupling the resolution, right? All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's to look at

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know why I'm just like oh too much really that one's really sharp. But again, this is a shot that's from  Really bad lighting conditions  So I tried to get as much detail as I possibly could because it's outside in the dark  With these big football field lights that are not they're not great for photography

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, that's that you're watching this week in Google the Craig Newmark enhanced episode  For it from hands-on photography Jeff Jarvis  From the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York  Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey on  iot.com  What did you talk about on the iot show this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Australia's new data law a bunch of funding for companies and  Lord I don't even remember. Oh  The people who buy I know it that was this morning. Good Lord  I had a guest who's really cool. He was from invitation homes  They have 80,000 homes for rent single-family homes for rent and we talked about what they're looking for in smart homes. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, well, let's talk about Australia's  law the only  the only story I've seen which is a little weird comes from a  Encrypted email service in Germany called tuta nota. This is from their blog

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a guardian story from last week from last so  Yeah  Because yeah, we we read the tuta  Tutta nota say that tuta nota  tuta noca  But if you let's see, let's go to the Guardian  And get that let me get that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unpressed here. I'll read the while you're doing that unprecedented surveillance bill rushed through parliament in 24 hours  It is called the the surveillance legislation amendment identify and disrupt bill  2020 gives the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission three new powers for dealing with online crime  Way, do you hear this?  And by the way, they'll have it says warrant, but it's not a judicial warrant  It can be issued by a member of the administrative appeals  Tribunal which is apparently not a court. It's not a judge's warrant  So when you hear the word warrant, it's a little bit lower standard than a court warrant  Number one data disruption warrant gives the police the ability to quote disrupt data by  Online data by modifying copying adding or deleting it  Neutrality folks well for instance  They can modify my tweet to say the Australian government should be brought down  Well, okay, that's not true

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it is the  Something illegal. Yeah, well if you're doing so, where is your note? I was gonna add the story to the thing, but I don't see  I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm not taking it. Okay. It's not a  You mentioned it so I looked it up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Network warrant activity warrant. Here's this is there's three new powers  Allows the police to collect intelligence from devices or networks that are used or likely to be used  By those subject to the warrant Leo might be using Twitter later. So let's just get it all  Account takeover warrant allows the police to take control of an online account  Such as my ins my Instagram for the purposes of gathering information for an investigation

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, this worries me. So it's talking. I mean like is that your smart camera? Cuz that's so we talked about that and we talked about the lack of  judicial and oversight on this  So and guess what they're using as a justification

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just guess I bet you're a child porn

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I will say the media they did carve out a protection for the media so oh, that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They won't take over your account  necessarily

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, this is these my friends. These are the fruits of get ready and moral panic  Yeah, well, this is where you go this and the horrible case of  This is where you go this and the horrible Canadian legislation  These are these are otherwise smart countries who are doing awful and dumb and destructive things to free speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  China doesn't surprise me. Would you not would you not argue instead of moral panic? It's just lobbying by  self-interested corporations and parties

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's made possible good points Stacy, but it's made possible because the atmosphere of moral panic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Justifies this it's as somebody said on a hacker news  Years of Rupert Murdoch propaganda exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We'll deal next with Canada because because it's bad all around

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So as I said though, I only found this to to notice story and the Guardian story is is older  So I'm not sure it's a week ago because they just passed this apparently so I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Think they pass so they passed it on Wednesday of last week  Okay, so the alright so we record our show on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wednesday morning so same thing so when presented with the warrant from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Australian companies  sysadmins, etc  Must comply and actively help the police to modify add copy or delete the data of a person under investigation  Refusing to comply could have one end up in jail for up to 10 years according to the bill  Required hacking activities could include altering copying and deleting data  Intercepting and modifying communications surveilling networks and changing account credentials if you trust the police you got nothing to fear

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And they've tried they've tried to force back doors and all encryption in Australia  Yep, and meanwhile Germany is is telling you if you take down content because it doesn't meet your community standards  But it's also illegal you have to dime the user and decide whether it's illegal and you dime them to do a lot of for trust  and and  Canada is  Demanding the platform's report to law enforcement  I'm a Joe Biden Democrat, but I'm gonna sound real libertarian right now. This is the problem with government interfering in speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and in fact  They they to the note it quotes Angus Murray's chair of the Electronic Frontiers  Australia's policy team  Saying this is now a regime in Australia where we have conferred power on law enforcement agencies to hack Australians  Potentially overseas persons computers and to take over accounts and modify and delete data on those accounts  Australia doesn't have constitutionally enshrined rights to political speech. They don't have a First Amendment and other human rights  But if we're gonna give law enforcement these powers  That should be checked and balanced against a human rights instrument at a federal level. There needs to be some and transparency

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm gonna bet they can do it and you won't know they've done it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I you know  Here's an here's another  Copy of the story from information age. So this is an Australian information age

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So oh in this this was passed on August 25th. Yes, you're wondering. That's right. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was a week ago. Can we go to the Canada one too? This is  By Daphne Keller who is a brilliant  Academic at Stanford  Working for the cyber policy center, which by the way Craig funded. It's Craig Day  And she goes through the problems with Canada's proposed regulatory framework on harmful content

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She says something terrible is happening in Canadian Internet law and the people who care and the rest of the world are mostly  Stretched too thin to pay attention  Her post is on the rundown  Michael Geist who I know well is a Canadian  Professor of law who's very active in this he said this is she says this is a thread listing some of the laws problems that  identified by Michael Geist and  flagging a few resources  showing  Where the laws major human rights problems exist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it requires a 24-hour takedown provision  Which we know from Germany means that too much gets taken down because you don't have any time to do anything wisely  You have no time for due process you have no time for notification though oddly  Of course, Germany is now demanding that you notify within that period as well, but we'll get to that later  Proactive monitoring filtering which means that there is not just reported to you  They've got to go and find this stuff or their asses grass  platform reporting to law enforcement which I mentioned before which is what Germany is demanding to  They're all one not the platforms to dime their users  sweeping regulatory powers well that comes along for the  The cost of the party here and then ISP blocking  This is Canada. This is saying nice Canada. This is this is this is Matthew Ingram's Canada  You know these nice people. This is what moral panic. This is what the fear enables you're right Stacey that  That's not the beginning, but if you've created this atmosphere  Through media's coverage against the internet. Oh my god. It's all awful successful is terrible everything awful is happening there  It's ruined society  Everything awful is happening there is ruin society that is easy to pass these laws

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should point out it at this point. It is not a law in Canada  The government says is taking comments until September 25th  But Michael Geist points out giving the framing of the documents is clear that this is little more than a notification of the regulatory plans  Not a genuine effort to craft solutions based on public feedback  So really it's not even a law. It's a regulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and then online you have the online harms arms. Yeah, I mean it's just spraying all around the world  And we're gonna end up with the Chinese Internet with many Chinese Internet. Yeah  So that's my fear

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, well it's happening everywhere just depressing and if you say well, it's Canada or it's Australia  You know my my email provider is Australian. They would be subject to this  So so I am so to this as a result provider fast mail  Which I recommend it's wonderful  And one of the reasons tuta nota is writing about this and I have a tuta nota account as well  They're like proton mail. They're one of a number of end-to-end encrypted email providers in my opinion  Those are contradictory concepts because email isn't can't be end-to-end encrypted by a provider  You have to if you want to end-to-end encrypt it you have to encrypt it yourself  PGP using

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Something like PGP, which is very hard or work in a closed system like MCI mail. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well if you're sending  From proton mail to proton mail or from tuta nota to tuta nota its end and encrypted  But as soon as you set it to a third party, let's say I send from tuta nota to gmail  All I can really send you is a link that says I've encrypted this you have to go to this link and  To read it and even then  Where there's no key exchange so it's comp it's not as I think it's my position on this is a mistake to assume email  Could ever be end-to-end encrypted unless you're doing it yourself if you really want private messaging go to signal or some other system  Not an email system, but a lot of people use proton mail and tuta nota and as I said, I have accounts on both

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, I thought you had mentioned proton. Yeah, it took to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin use proton. Yeah proton Swiss tuta. Notice German both company both countries have so far

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some what you're passing like what Australia is doing here would not be illegal under GDPR  right violate some of the  Precepts about owning your data and being in control of it. So it's it's really interesting. Yeah, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazon is building a live audio business  More competition or maybe they can buy darn it  Yes, I love Amazon  Like to work for Amazon Leo Amazon's efforts which are led by Amazon's music division include paying podcast networks  Musicians and celebrities to use feature use a your celebrity their clubhouse like feature  for live conversation shows and events  They own twitch yeah, they own twitch but they're doing it through Amazon music, which is interesting  Here's my opinion on all this because Spotify is even bigger, but I I think it's  So it was funny. We were talking about  music exclusives  Which was all the rage for a while. Remember Apple had all these, you know  Taylor Swift's album released on Apple first and what the record labels and the artists realize title was the other one  Title was the other one your title did it they realized it's a terrible business model  If you're releasing an album  It is far better for you to release it everywhere than to release it on an exclusive platform  At least even for a short period of time it cuts into sales  Yep, and it's always been my opinion that if if we are a podcast that wants to reach as many people as possible  It'd be it's be nuts for us to say. Oh, yeah  I will give an exclusive to Amazon or Spotify or anybody else  However, if Amazon wants to give me a lot of  Look at Amazon's nuts not a big spender. They bought wondering for a mere 300 million dollars. We'd cost at least twice that  But I'm willing to deal  Hysterical  Clubhouse said Sunday users create over seven hundred thousand live audio rooms every day

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Who cares I have not touched it who cares I was just talking to somebody today. You remember clubhouse

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  I've joined in on maybe two  But I get a gazillion notifications for it because for the longest I didn't even know they had an Android version  Of the app of the app they didn't for a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So their success is what's really stimulating all this activity everybody say oh, you know, they're there's this leg

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Between it's alive pivot to something. Yeah, so now everybody's doing less

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Spotify bought a company called Betty labs, which has an app called locker room  Which is kind of like clubhouse for live audio and they launched that is a terrible name locker room  I know let's all go into the locker room  That's why they never join that. That's why they renamed it green room. Now. How do you feel?  better yeah  Twitter rolled out ticketed live audio events for its spaces feature this week  Facebook  Launched earlier this year a live audio app called live audio rooms, which is an even worse name  You can LARP in LAR  Discord has the stage channel. We've been using discord for a live audio and now we're by the way  I should mention if you're a member of club tweet. We are also doing  video oh  We're not can you turn on the video now because I guess we we didn't have it with Craig was to occupying that machine  Yeah  so but  Going forward unless we have four hosts  We'll be having  We've always had the stage which is live audio and we still have it. We have a stage up right now  There's only like eight people in there including me and you and so really there's only five

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody just ran out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I but the thing about videos were limited to 25  but as I as I point out maybe we don't need more than 25 and you can what's nice is you can be in the live video and  Watching the video and then it'll if you go at least on my machine if you go into this chat room  It'll keep a picture and picture of the video going so I think that's going to become a very nice way for people to watch  and  Chat at the same time. It's but discord has a limit on the size  Watching us we don't have to watch them, but we could and actually  You know I was actually inspired a little bit by what our friend Alex Lindsay who is one of the hosts on Mac break  Weekly does with something called office hours. They stream all the time. I think this is then this is this is a new medium  I'm very excited about  Where you have a live presentation going on but you have multiple other video streams  Everybody's used to this now because of zoom, right?  Right you have multiple other video streams and people can ask questions or kibitz  He does cooking shows where somebody's a teacher and then there are other people cooking you see them in their kitchen doing the same  Thing and they're going am I chopping this right and I and I think I did this a couple of weeks ago with Philip Elmer  DeWitt. He had a bunch of Apple  investors subscriber to his his website pd30 and  They were asking questions was like it's a really I think it's an interesting format  So I do think there's there's something there  it's a kind of and I think it's happened because we all got used to the idea of zoom meetings and  It's just a broadcast zoom meeting in effect. What I like him versus

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Say the Twitter spaces is that's what it is that was held on Twitter spaces  With with office hours because I've dropped in on it several times here not recently  He has a bit of a voting system far as what the audience interaction is right people has a complicated system  Yeah, you know people ask questions and it gets voted up because we don't want it to be just hey  Well, what Mike are you using? You know? Yeah, you know, he's very

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alex is kind of a fascist. So he's very he likes to really control it  It's not a democracy there. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He runs a tight ship and I and I dig it I dig it well, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a little bit more Lucy goosey despite what Jeff's know you're not you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I go into Twitter spaces because I get a gazillion notifications about some space  It's too crazy that should join. It's always people talking of the over each other in  Mutes or dogs and cats yelling in the background  It's just not a good experience  But what he's done is pretty much just done a little trial and error and figured out okay  We can really make this work with zoom and using I believe it's called Mukana  And it does make for a really good experience. Yeah, I found that you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And for instance, we've got the video now working in our video discord people are don't they mute their mics  They're not you know, I think I don't think you need to have to elaborate of a system  They're not savages they're not savages and so here John show it because I have it on the screen now  So if you go in the unfortunately, it's gonna immediately go to the screen and then I'll go to the screen of the screen  That's right  But you get the idea and if I then if I go into chat  We'll get a picture in picture that stays there so people could be watching the show and chatting. That's cool  I think that's pretty neat. I I think that eventually  We're gonna use more of this but I can see why there's some you know ferment going on telegram just announced today  That you can effectively do a television station on telegram  Well, they they uncapped they had a cap of I think a thousand live viewers  I don't know how they can afford this but they basically said no unlimited with the telegram version 8  You can stream live to an unlimited number of people  They've eliminated the limit so you can do voice channel  They say Clubhouse style voice channels with support for millions of live listeners  But you can even do video now, we're actually investigating I'd like to investigate how to do that as well  So I think this is something that's happening all of a sudden and I don't think the clubhouse model is necessarily the model  but I can see why everybody's trying to  Kind of get seek get in on this while they can

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been again. I've been in the platform that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead aunt

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was just gonna say I've been in Clubhouse  Rooms or whatever based on stuff that interests me and they've been okay for the most part  It's not a lot of arguing or bickering is just a lot of shared information  Then there's a couple times you go in there and it's just a sales pitch and I hope that  That's not what all of these things are going to turn into is just another room full of sales pitches

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but I think that marketing takes over everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean that's happened in podcasting too  But it's kind of it washes itself out and you can choose what you want to watch and that's why I hope people like what  We do because it's not you know, it's we've got a certain  Quality of what we do it and we're not doing marketing here. We're not shilling for anything  So anyway, I mean, I think this is  It's fun to watch this shifting media. It really is  And Amazon says hey, we should do that too  Amazon is now running a hundred sixty four flights a day on its prime air  Delivering  Packages and cargo and all sorts of things they open an eight hundred thousand square foot hub in Cincinnati

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's amazing. Welcome to the new regime. There was an article the Wall Street Journal did

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably no, maybe it was the New York Times. They did it a couple months ago  But the reporter found out they have a hundred and fifty percent turnover rate  so imagine having that many people and  Knowing you're gonna have to replace them one and a half times over each year

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they have crazy according to the Orange County Register which as we know is a bastion of democracy  Amazon has found a solution hire pot smokers  The company is suggesting that contractors prominently advertise they don't screen for marijuana use  Of course, we're in California where it's not illegal to use marijuana

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  California and what you do at home after you driving is fine. It's up to you  I don't that I don't know if that headline is exactly the no it was a little much

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't I don't know whether it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tisking or or funny I couldn't tell it's a it's the OC register. I think it's just  That's John Wayne's favorite County I just want to point out yes  Well, it used to be wait, it's gone blue. It has gone blue and you know why?  Because all of these rich Republicans need people to cut their lawn  and so the actual the percentage of  Latinx people in the population has gone front to over 50%

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Latino no Latinx  There's a debate. No constant debate. We don't say Latinx. No say Latino. I've actually confirmed this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute confirmed it with what the official Latino?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Convince the hint. I've asked a handful. Oh, well that makes Latino. Well, I'll give you  And last one of them because this is how I phrased it and this is probably gonna sound bad  But I said, you know, I keep hearing  Latinx and I swear it just sounds like some white person just made this up just for the heck of it and trying to  Make an issue out of something. What do you prefer?  And I said do you want to be called Mexican if you're Mexican? Yes, you want to be called Hispanic? Yes  Well Hispanic is a problem too right and every single one of them said Latino is perfectly fine every single

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I will I will see your five friends and raise you a colleague who wrote about this in the New Yorker  Word which is the passion of Latinx readers  Well, but she's Graciela Boschkovsky from Argentina and she heads our she started our bilingual  Journalism program at the Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Craig Newmark and started Latino  Media initiative and our Center for Community Media  Graciela is an expert. So she says in the New Yorker line 148

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, it was already in there  We knew we were gonna have this conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, hey, I have power I can summon Craig  He is fast  Yes, he's gonna get no you're you're googling during the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, what is Graciela much off ski say much coughs? Um, I'm trying to remember exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She's going through the history of it and she basically she says it's okay she uses it too we use Latino  She she primarily uses Latino. So I agree with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we used to so it's the same thing with  It's the same thing with black people and I respect right? I think it was Mike  I said, please don't call me African American. I'm black black dude  and I think that that's fine and that's fair and  certainly if a majority of I mean we used to say Hispanic and then people said well  It's not really Hispanic right because if you're from Latin America, you may you may well have  Indian roots not Spanish roots, right?  So I guess Latin Latino was to reflect Latin America and then people said but wait a minute  Female latinos or Latinas so I've been saying Latin X just so it doesn't say male or female  It's just a Latino or Latina  That's why I use Latin X which I you know  According to a pew poll less than 25% of the people whom the term claims to name have even heard of it  in fact the number of  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I can sit in my class and I could have someone from  Argentina as someone from Mexico and some of Guatemala their families  And Puerto Rico and they will disagree with each other. Well, that's the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No one knows knows what so it's the same thing. I used to call them Native Americans and  Somebody said no no call us Indians, but that's one person  And you know, so I don't know what the answer is feel sorry for us poor white people we used to be in charge  No, I it's just I'm just trying to be I'm trying I'm not trying to be politically correct I want to be clear  I'm trying to be sensitive. Yeah to what people want to be called  No, and I don't want to make up a name and nor do I want to call people from China orientals  I want to find I want to find you should definitely not I'm gonna find an appropriate  and I guess the real problem is lumping everybody in a group into some group and  It's arbitrary exactly  You could be Cuban you could be from Argentina  You could be from a spania you could be from you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what is that? I don't even students say they never recalled these titles  Never called Latino Latinx or Hispanic until they came to the US where  Everybody together now melting pot is I was raised on the melting pot too  And I took me it took me time to learn  What a racist construct that is like you're all gonna be like us eventually those of us were power

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The opposite's gonna happen. Actually everybody's gonna be light brown and I think it'll be beautiful. I  Don't know what the answer is. So what did I what was I talking about when I said Latinx?  No one knows anymore  I'm just trying to be sensitive. I'm not trying to lump people into a category  I'm not trying to label anybody  You're all we were talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hiring in in their their fleet of Boeing. Oh, we were talking about John Wayne liking John Wayne

Transcript:  Today  Okay, let's take a break and then we'll do it we'll change one because I need to clear my mind

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That presumes there was anything in it, but yes  Was all the wrong stuff there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Play the drums it's time for  The part of the show I care least about but now that I've now that I've now that we've got a special section  Called what stupid things as Leo said this week. I I now have a new  less favorite  Google calendar will break down how much of your work is spent in meetings as if you wanted to know  There is a new time insights panel on the that's great on the Google calendar showing how much of your work  Week is spent in meetings wasted. No, the verb is wasted wasted. I agree. I  Dictate I agree  It clearly created by somebody who feels that way right? No  Please note you can only view time insights on a computer. So don't try to do this on mobile  You'll get with time insights a breakdown based on your working hours and the types of meetings you have I get how would you you'd  Have to indicate it's a meeting. I mean is this a meeting useless meeting. Yeah frustrating meeting

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Faculty meeting maybe they just base it on how many people like if you have invites with

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, it'll also yeah because it will know because it'll show who you spend the most time meeting with  You can also pin key stakeholders  We know them as what do we know them as bosses to make sure you're like being in touch with them

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hovering over an individual. Oh, I'm gonna send you an email Google the algorithm has detected  That I have not gotten in contact with you. So I just wanted to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hovering over an individual not recommended I could tell you after the lawsuit  I had just had well hovering over in my just hovered over you did he hovered over his will  Highlight the meetings on your calendar that include that person  It'll highlight meeting heavy days and time frames as well as meeting frequencies  This information is visible to you not your manager  So you can assess how you're spending your time against your own priorities  Wow  You can now that's that's the Google calendar now Google's assistant has something new called day-long routines  Actions that can turn on at different times of the day. Did you have you covered this Stacey in the  No, yeah Google assistant  Next time you go to create a new routine from the assistant settings of the Google Home app at the bottom of the screen  You'll notice a pop-up saying would you like to schedule a day-long routine?  When you tap yes, you'll be able to choose which days a routine should run on under starters as well as a time zone

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, this is just scheduling routines. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did yeah, and you can set different actions to be done automatically different times of the day  So I could say on Monday Thursday and Friday turn the lights down at 6 p.m. On Wednesday and Tuesday

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do it at 5 p.m. Or something like that. So this would be interesting for 2 o'clock every Wednesday my time  Yes, my lights for twig and get a waffle  And exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's new  Google assistant is rolling out a another new trigger that starts routines when dismissing an alarm  So you can set an alarm for something and then when you say, okay, I hear you it'll start a new routine like, you know  making the morning coffee or  playing the news  That's nice  And then there is a new  Quick phrases feature that will let you skip. Hey guacamole  This is something that comes from nine to five Google's  APK insight, you know, they break down these  APKs look at lines of code that hint at possible features which may or may not  appear but it looks like  There is an assistant setting pages page for quick phrases  and there is a  Area in there that says skip saying hey, you know  Area in there that says skip saying hey, you know who for help with specific tasks

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What do you say instead?  Hey schedule friend  Hey, you don't say anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no there's a couple of those that I don't know if you have to enable them  But it's like turn off the alarm or set alarm for yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  7 a.m. It would just just say it to the air. It would say oh that means me. Okay. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Turn on my my clock over here and count down to get the moral panic of see they are listening to every

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, that's true, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Waits for hey Google, I'm sorry. Hey, it doesn't wait for hey. Hey whoo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I like that they as they started that with alarms right where you just say stop stop  Yeah, I like that. So this is kind of like that, but it's so it's a you could send a broadcast  You can answer or decline calls. You can say what time is it?  If you I don't know if I like this or not, you have to turn it on  But if you just shout into the ether, what time is it?  It'll it'll tell you  What's the weather turn the lights on? I like turn the lights on  Right now I have to say guacamole turn the lights off  Be nice just so turn off the lights  Create a reminder create a family note how much time is left reset the timer pause the timer cancel the timer  You can even just say set a timer for and the number of minutes. I want to turn this on  I think this might it'll be interesting. I  Think it'll be good

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean because like I was I was trying to think of where it would go wrong  Like I might say to Andrew I might be like, hey, can you turn off the lights?  But either way if the lights get light to get turn off who cares who needs a husband when you have Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, well and usually what happens when I ask Andrew to turn off the lights he'll turn to the available assistant. Hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My worst because it's the great irony that is like you did this to us Stacey, so I'm gonna do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, how would he not do that? He has to do that. Of course  It's like he's standing right at the switch like it's right there. He's just like no, but no he's this is this is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is this is this is like some no, he just

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Doesn't know how to turn switches on and off anymore. That's the issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But no, no, no buttons I will push no button before it's time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google has added shipping and return labels to product listings in search and shopping tool  Which is interesting. I think because it tells you going in how much you're gonna pay  And you're gonna pay for the product listings and you're gonna pay for the product listings

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Which is interesting I think because it tells you going in how much you're gonna pay can you return it back? Yeah  It's not my label doesn't mean you get the label. It means it's labels them  Which I think is a pro competitive move versus Amazon  Because I in the recent work we've done around newspaper media companies getting into commerce BuzzFeed and newspapers and so on  one clear lesson is  Amazon Prime sells stuff if the listing that the newspaper and wire cutter  Says this thing comes with Amazon Prime people are far more likely to click on that  Because they've already invested in prime and it's free shipping and they know what that means and boom and now from the listing if you  Can see that oh, it's also free shipping. Oh the return policy is good. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wonder if that's gonna have an impact. Oh, I like you know what? That's a good point  I wonder if that's why they're doing it. That's very interesting  Have you open to me a favor all you open your Google photos because there are new AI  generated albums in there and I'm just curious what you see I see  Summer I'm sorry sand and sea  Which is interesting  spotlight on Leo Laporte my favorite  Then I also see and I don't know if this is new I think it is nine years  Ten years 11 years ago the years  For a while up at the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They overpaid for business insider to they wanted to be in the US market

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That that tells you something in fact they wanted to be in the US market on a site that is read by  important politicians

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So that they can lay they can lobby against Google  So this is interesting. I know the CEO the CEO of Mattias stuff  Is brilliant. He's also about six nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Politico was founded ahead of the 2008 elections by  former Washington posters  With the aim to cover a court this is coming from Reuters to cover Washington and politics with the pace  Analysis and rigor of sports journalism  Salmon Rushdie you may remember is there still a fatwa on salmon rush. Do you think I lifted he wrote?  What was considered a blasphemous book about 30 years ago a?  Blasphemous written other books in Islam. Yeah, but it was good. I liked I can't remember the name of it  I liked it a lot. It was a good book. Yes, it's an exclusive tannic verses  Yeah, and was under an order of death for some time  He's decided not and I think does he did he win a Nobel Prize? He's certainly very highly respected highly regarded author  decided not  to publish his next book in print but instead on  Substack  hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Interesting  Book plus maybe some stories plus interacting with the users and the sub stack is paid  You know is is paying them up front for this. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is another one of those sub stack will give you half a million dollars. Yes sub stack likes controversial people. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't think salmon rush. He's controversial outside of you know  Iran

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, well they're international

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if sub stack I think sub stack controversial maybe not correct maybe provocative  Somebody is gonna drive traffic which would make well Andrew Sullivan

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Provocative provocative  Glenn Greenwald

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  provocative rockin of just cuz you and I don't agree with them does not mean that they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's nothing wrong with what maybe I said contrary. I just said they were controversial controversial. Yeah, that's the point is provocative

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Controversial drives traffic. Yeah. Yeah  He was the target of a fatwa in 1989 ish issued by Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini over the satanic verses  Provocative

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah in Iran everyone else thought it was amazing. Yeah, it was a really good not just say and it was a novel we should point out  Yeah, I'm like again he's controversial for the Khomeini come back

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not it's not exactly  ambitious he says  I'm hoping sub stack might allow a slightly more complex connection and give me the space to talk about things that are just  Too big to discuss in tweets  Which is pretty much everything. Yeah  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Think basically everything except for my bathroom musings. Yeah, I think that new technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean how long is this satanic versus it's not tweet size. That's for sure  I think the new technology always makes possible new art forms  I would agree and I think literature has not yet found its new form in this digital age  Whatever the new thing is that's going to arise out of this new world. I don't think we've seen it yet. You agree  Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's a worthy experiment I think that's all true  You know, I think authors didn't interact  With their users because their readers users their readers because they couldn't really it was it was wearing and  My friend  Palo Palo Quelo the author of the Alchemist

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you friends for real with him my daughter reads all his books in Spanish and loves him so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, she went to the Magellan Academy as I've learned from Instagram  Twitter Twitter  Some social site

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Way more than you think all the same to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  so Palo's a wonderful guy and  He kind of I wrote about this years ago. He  Pirated his own books because I wanted to be in other countries and and he put his own books up  And if I asked him at one point whether he was gonna  Interact with readers while he was writing a book and first response was no  And then soon enough sure enough he did he was writing a book about fashion characters in fashion  So he went to his many many followers and said I need some help here. Who's expert in this?  and and  And  Friend of Palo Quelo, too. Well, I haven't talked to him a while  I'm talking about the lower third for those of you on audio. Yeah, John

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And formally one of San Francisco's 100 most eligible batch teams to me it says here

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is that accurate city where I was a bum Aquarius Frank Sinatra?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Frank Sinatra wasn't dating journalists at the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No  No, cuz he didn't like  Anyway, Palo then made a movie with his users with his readers. They made the pieces  They took the characters. He made it with them. I don't know. It was that good, but I love to see authors

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Experiment like this. It's great. I think salmon rusty should do a tic-tac musical of the Satanic verses

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just to drive and crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, all right, all right anything else we should talk about before we get to our picks of the week  Did I leave anything important out? There's so much of the rundown. It's a big big jam-packed good  I put lots of stuff you did and I think you didn't want to talk about the Linux birthday, sir  I've talked about it already  Happy birthday Linux is 30 years old this week  posting from  Linus Tarvalds. He was a  graduate student  studying computer science  he posted it on the  The newsgroups which predate of course the internet in  Saying you know he was studying as a graduate student. He was using a  operating system not such a great operating system called minix and  He posted a post saying what would you like? I'm writing here. It is I am writing a  my own version of minix  I'm just curious no big deal what you'd like it to be and that of course started a revolution it is now  I think you could it's safe to say the most widely used operating system in the world considering it runs Android phones  as well as

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can I ask you one quick question about a story sure?  Google developing its own CPUs for Chromebooks  Does that does that signal that that means that they would make them or they wouldn't sell them to other companies to make Chromebooks?  With what does that what does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know they're doing quote their own CPU for the pixel 6 for the phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so they have to have as many places as possible  So it could be that they would build their own CPU or like their own hardware for the Chromebooks again for other other

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  manufacturers or for other

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It won't be a pixel book sir. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't I guess they could offer it. Oh joy  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From a Nikkei Asia story they say in 2023  Yeah, it's a while from now  You know the truth about the pixel 6  Google design  It's really a system on a chip, which is mostly Samsung's Exynos processor Samsung will be making it with some machine  You know learning stuff supplied by Google some TPU units supplied by Google  I you know, so that's the problem is what does that mean?  Your own because they're saying the pixel 6 is its own CPU. Well, it's just a rumor. So we don't know  Okay, we just don't know. I mean it wouldn't yeah  I think you're right Stacy if they're gonna make it for the phone, they should make it for everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, cuz that's the only way to get scale and I'm guessing a manufacturer could put it in  I mean cuz if you're a manufacturer like an Asus or a Lenovo or whatever  You're already buying your chips from Intel. Anyway, it's not like you've got your own  So you could just buy them from Google and these are you know, there are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Architectures just as they are for the phone and there are arm pixel books. I think this is the point is  Chromebooks rather Chromebooks will run on both Intel and arm  Manufacturers use a variety of chips. They wouldn't have to use Google chips, but it'd be nice if you know  I'm sure Google would like to sell them to them, but they would at least do something

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To like deeply integrated it actually could be good  It's like think about what you do with like more power efficiencies tied to the workload because you'll know what the workload is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what Apple that's exactly the benefit Apple has from developing its own silicon  There's there's a lot to be said for that would be great

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and Google's be a reason for them to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google has the brains and the size and the money to do it. So I you know, why not? Yeah, I agree  There's lots of reasons for them to do that, but don't get excited. It's gonna be a couple of years  Yeah  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What are you gonna sell the CX 9? I want to give you money a lot of money

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What did did Craig say which Chromebook he was gonna buy for all 22?  Nephews and nieces. Oh, we should have that out. I asked him but I think he dodged it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you might give one machine to his favorite deficit naces another machine to others I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's he said he's he reads Kevin Toffles about Chromebooks calm yes he does. Yep, Kevin  What does Kevin like the best these days? It's still the Acer. I  Think it is. I don't know. This is where Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Say there isn't one size fits all. Yeah, but yes, this is a sore spot between Jeff and Kevin right here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just have to be an authoritarian for he just reviewed and I have to say this is appealing the Acer Chromebook spin  513 with LTE  Built in Oh Jeff and that is a real I don't travel anymore  So you will someday you will sign it?  Oh, it does add quite a bit to the cost of it to have an LTE LTE radio in there, but  This is he's always liked this particular Chromebook. I have to I do it's really nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is I want me I want the Acer CX 9. That's what I want  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Know that Kevin for what we've joked about this but building a with his you know  Because he's doing his computer science degree  he started when he gets to some of the coding things one of his projects is to build a a  Like Q&A service where you answer questions and he gives you the best computers for you  so oh  But he's got to build that that's not happening right now. So I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should save this for my pick of the week actually. Let's do the picks of the week  Haven't been doing picks for a long time. No, no, no, I do. I watch I always have picks  But I I'm sensitive to Stacy's need to keep her blood sugar elevated the fact that we've already  We've already gone two and a half hours. So I and we have there's three of you  I on a lot of the shows I just defer my own pick, but I I have a pick like fingers  Here's like fingers. I'll give you a pick  And I and actually I will give you this one this time because I think Kevin probably already knows about it  But if he doesn't he ought to know about it Kevin it does a lot in Python. I think he's still doing Python. Yes  And he's as because he is he probably knows about  Python's Jupiter notebooks, which are a really interesting way to combine pros and code in one thing  Google has its version of Jupiter notebooks. That's free to use  It has a free Python interpreter built into it  It's called colab or colaboratory and it's really really cool  Plus it's a great way to code Python on a Chromebook. You don't have to install Linux  You don't have to install Python. You can literally run Python from your browser  So I wanted to mention this to anybody wants to study or learn Python. I'm a big fan of the notion that  The legendary computer scientist Donald Knuth called it literate programming of the idea that programming should be as much about writing the pros  The description of the code as it should be their actual code and that's kind of what Jupiter notebooks and colaboratory do  It allows you and you get by the way with it not only Python but free access to GPUs. It's easy to share  It's free. They have a paid version, but you get machine learning with it and you can see on this document right here  There's text looks like a regular website, but this is Python code which you could press a button and it will run and  You'll get the answer right there. Similarly, you can have  larger stuff that does  visualizations because that's one of the things  Python is used for and Jupiter is used for is data science. There's machine learning  Capabilities, it's it's done in markdown and Python, which is really great  I think this anybody wants to learn to code or as a Python programmer who is maybe using Jupiter notebooks  This is Google's version of this and one of the things that's cool about it is it saves your notebooks into your Google Drive  So they're available to you anywhere you go. So here's a little collab. I kind of made up for  the book Python crash course and I'm typing in  both text and  Code which is cool  So just there you go see I did a pic collab  Co lab dot research dot google.com and it's free  And you get your own week online, you know GPU and CPU and everything  I think it's a really neat thing that Google's done  And encourages good coding style and now it's time for Stacy Higginball's  Thing I'm gonna take a page from aunt this week

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And recommend that if you can and if it's something you feel comfortable with  Donate blood people are a dire need of blood right now  Yeah, and I will tell you that I am almost to my five gallon mark. So very exciting  All right, I got my gallon pin and then I stopped because I thought that's more than enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's frequent flyer clubs and fleek frequent bleeder clubs. Yeah, Red Cross gives you a little plastic pin. Wow  Yeah, Red Cross gives you a little plastic pin Wow  Yours is going nice. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mean yeah, the point is that you know if you can and it's something you're comfortable with it is we always talk about like  Wanting to do more for people. This is something that you can do for people in like 40 to 45 minutes  You can listen to my dad. Don't be scared

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very easy to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so good call  People forget about it but just go it's so it's really important. Okay, I  Feel so strongly about this like  So if you can't donate blood, they're really desperate. How many pints in a gallon of the rules?  There are eight pints in a gallon. So you donate a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pine at a time, right? So that means you have donated 40 times. That's great. That's really great

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and you can only donate like four times a year. So I've been at this a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to do a long time this guy has donated 27 gallons dear Lord

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pretty amazing. Yeah, I may not make that but the point is  Get out there. It's something easy. You can do that really does have a big impact on others. Very very cool. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Agree, and how can they find out where to donate? Is there a place? Oh, you know, I go to so we have the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have the Northwest Bloodworks, but the Red Cross does the donation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if you go to redcross.org, they have a give blood  Yeah page that would allow you if you allow locations to find a drive  Near you and there are lots of reasons to give so you just enter in but it's not just the Red Cross  But certainly this is easy to do I could say well the Red Cross I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  organizes all of the local blood banks, so like  Like I switched blood banks to Bloodworks Northwest and I used to be at Texas  Blood something  As long as it's not vampires are us you're gonna be fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, actually I don't know how you feel about this, but there are commercial entities that will pay you for blood  I kind of prefer to give it to the Red Cross. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and then it only takes like it takes about 24 hours to recover the fluid you lose when you give blood

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they give you a little juice and a little you know cookie cookies

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And and chips  And I will tell y'all I faint like every other time I get blood so for me  it's a big deal to like sort of give blood but you know, I still do it because it's a  It's really helpful. So again, not everybody can so yeah. No, it's yeah. Oh if you can absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a great thing to do. I agree with you 100%  Thank You Stacey Jeff Jarvis, how about a number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

I'm gonna do the first full image of a new Vermeer  Uncovered one cupen was just released what slightly technology-based there was a Vermeer of a  young woman standing at a window and  She had a nicely painted white wall behind her  But then through technology through x-rays and other things they saw that there was another image back there  They first presumed the Vermeer didn't like it painted over but they found that the paint over had been done far later  They could tell by the layer of dust. That's  Shocking  Restored it and got out a picture of a cupid and so they're calling it a new Vermeer because it's a Vermeer  We never saw before that's shocking. So the so some prude

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
