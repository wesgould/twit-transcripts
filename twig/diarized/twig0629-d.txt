Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord. That way. Before we get to the Met Gala, I better introduce this guy right here. Jeff Jarvis is the director of the townite Center for entrepreneurial journalism at the  Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the University of New York. If you're just joining us, there's no explanation. Once you said Craig Newmark, there's nothing else need be said.  A number of people when Craig was on a couple of weeks ago said, why was that guy floating above you on the show? The Craig Newmark of Craigslist. That's all you have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was a great tweet the other day where somebody just came on and said, I'm staying up all night wondering whether Craigslist was started by a guy named Craig. And Craig, of course, retweeted it and said, same here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Craig, as we learned, is working on his material. He's working with an actual comedian. And he's actually very dryly funny. And that's the problem. He's so dry, you don't know he's joking. And then you go, oh, that was funny.  Craig's a martini, yeah. With no gin. No, no vermouth.  He's vermouthless. That is Hands on Photography host Ant Pruitt all the way over to our left here. Of course, the not only the host of Hands on Photography, but he's also the community manager in our club twit. And we really appreciate the job. He's doing great AMA with Micah Sargent.  Do you have some come up this week?  Not this week, but next week, the 24th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I believe me and a loved one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nope.  That's not next week.  Oh, do you want to talk? Next week we're going to have fun. Game night. Yes.  Next week we're going to do game time.  Yeah.  What are y'all playing?  We're going to be able to sit down. We're going to play Jackbox games and just shoot the stuff.  You're welcome to join, Stacey.  I'm going to join Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are Jackbox games?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're funny little off the wall games that you can play online with a group of people as long as you have a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you remember You Don't Know Jack? The game You Don't Know Jack. It was basically Trivial Pursuit.  Oh, okay.  So they branched off from You Don't Know Jack to the Jackbox, which is a bunch of kind of, you know, fad games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Check it out. When are y'all doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This will be after Twyatt on Friday, September 24th, I believe roughly 3 p.m.  Because, you know, sometimes Twyatt goes a little bit longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you would love it, by the way. Stacey, you would be so good. You would have... You do tabletop gaming, I bet you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do. And I do trivia.  But it is, I will tell you, it is FECA, but we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, what?  She has a thing she does with her daughter.  Oh.  What is it, Friday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's Friday FECA. FECA is a Swedish tradition. Around three o'clock or so you have a coffee and a small cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, speaking of small cakes.  It's a day I learn.  I got to thank Clarence Christian.  We were talking on MacBreak Weekly about this season is apple cider doughnut season, right, Jeff?  You know about that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I'm here. I'm here in Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Clarence, we were talking about Clarence sent me some apple cider doughnuts from Stan Donuts and Coffee in Los Angeles.  Are you going to share?  Yeah, I'll share. So this is the best thing about work from home.  We sent all the employees home. They came yesterday.  They're all yours.  And they're still here. I got plenty.  They're really good. So thank you, Clarence. I appreciate these are really...  Outstanding.  You could tell they smell like apple. They're like apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Aren't you glad you're not on that stupid diet anymore?  Keto thing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mixed feelings about it. I've had three of these so far.  Maybe not so good, but that's not all.  It was a big haul. All of this stuff came in the mail yesterday.  Here's an email from Marco Gentile. I hope I'm saying your name right.  That's how I would say it.  Marco Gentile, in your last twig episode, the subject of bucatini pasta came up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you get bucatini? I'm going to be so mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I couldn't resist, but pull this package of...  Now remember his name Marco Gentile? Gentile bucatini pasta.  Unbelievable.  He says his great grandfather started the pasta factory.  Unfortunately, it's no longer in the family, but the tradition has carried on.  His father emigrated from Sorrento in 1955 after marrying his mother.  He was born just down the road in San Rafael in 1956.  So it's the same age as me.  He says... Well, there's more.  He says he wants more right-wing people on the show.  But if you...  You know, that's okay. I'm really open to the bribe.  That's awesome.  Actual bucatini from Italy, from Napoli.  Thank you. But that's not all. There's one more thing came yesterday.  Oh my.  Actually, you might recognize this snowflake.  I'm very excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look like Mr. Doncom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And not only that, look at this.  It comes with my very own...  Antiglyphs?  Antiglyphic red-green glasses for 3D viewing.  Yes. I sent you a book.  This is his new... I think the new book that you were plugging, right?  Macrophotography.  Universe at your feet, right?  Universe at your feet.  I'm so excited. So thank you very much, Doncomarechka.  He's famous for these snowflake pictures.  You've had him on hands-on photography.  But he's also the king of macro, which is good timing because App...  I don't know if this counts, but App will just announce a macro capability in its new iPhones yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's great.  Look at this picture.  When they announced that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at that. Look at that ant.  This dude is so nice.  Ant for ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Doncom is really good.  Thank you, Doncomarechka.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Clarence, for the donuts.  Thank you, Marco, for the pasta.  I am so jealous.  You got a nice haul there today, sir.  That's why I like work from home because it's just me and my treats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was thinking about having Taco Bell chicken taco sandwiches delivered to you today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if you spoke to the door.  No, no, no, no. It's okay.  Wednesday is a gas station sushi day.  So that's a time-honored tradition.  I'm going to eat it until it kills me and it might kill me at any moment.  Facebook...  A surprise.  Facebook says...  Actually, Facebook doesn't say it.  The Wall Street Journal says it.  So maybe this is suspect.  They say Facebook has known that Instagram is toxic for teens, but didn't do anything about it.  Company documents show its own in-depth research, a significant teen mental health issue that Facebook plays down in public.  I guess I probably should go to you, Mr. Morrill Panic.  Anything to say about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's what I always say in this case.  We need more data out of them and they're foolish not to get it out so we know.  And that's why we get leaks like this.  What I read from people about this is that from the researchers, the researchers I know, know people inside Facebook who try to bring these things out and try to improve them and try to fix them and know what's going on.  And then they get stopped by politics and economy.  And that's the disturbing part of this.  That's the difficult part.  But from a research perspective, every researcher I've seen just is dying to get their hands on this kind of data so we can know.  As some people hate anything Facebook does, I'm rather the same way about Rupert Murdoch.  So I do come to it with suspicion from a journal perspective, but that doesn't mean that there isn't something here that is racism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like there's some good journalism and they have some deep sources.  Can we specify something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead.  This isn't Facebook the site, this is Instagram.  Facebook's owned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook's owned Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I should point out that magazines have done this to young girls particularly, but women in general for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My wife's reaction is that Facebook didn't invent eighth grade girls being awful to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it did invent showing them these photos all the time.  So here's a parent of a teen girl.  You have such a wide variety.  And I will say, okay, I had an eating disorder.  It is not solely because you look at pictures.  It is a function of anxiety, it is a function of trying to control your life.  I will say that the internet and social media has made it very difficult for girls in particular.  There is so much research.  It's not solely related to Instagram or Facebook about how unhealthy these things can be for them.  It would be really interesting to look at it in the context of the pandemic because they've lost their true social outlet now that it's just on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't see normal girls at all anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey, can I just say something for a second?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's just an easy way to point the finger at Instagram because they are so big and make it so accessible, this content.  They can make it worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Also, I do think magazine editors, when you told them, magazine editors came out and started working on things like body positivity.  Yes, it took time, but they listened.  They talked about Photoshopping.  There was a huge backlash in response to the research that people were doing showing how it affected young girls.  Instagram and Facebook are not willing to say, oh, this is true.  Honestly, I don't know if it's because it's kind of a misogynistic culture there that just doesn't care.  I mean, they're clearly not focused on the well-being of people on the platform.  But I mean, there is a benefit to a bunch of unhappy girls spending a lot of time wanting to be something else and spending that time visualizing that through their platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What would be even worse is if they were using it to advertise to those girls things like diet supplements and exercise plans and other products designed to play into that, which I wouldn't be at all surprised that they are.  I think Facebook, and by the way, I completely defer to Stacey on this.  She's a woman, first of all, and she's the mother of a young girl.  So she is the expert on this.  But I would say Facebook is an order of magnitude difference from a magazine or not Facebook, but Instagram.  Facebook too. But Instagram, when you're looking at Instagram, you're looking at people you think are like you.  You would think in your mind they're your peers.  And when you see them in beautiful environments, in having a great time, parties, and friends, and they look great and they have chiseled abs and all of that stuff,  I think it's worse than seeing a star, a celebrity in a magazine.  I think it's really even worse.  And they are your friends.  Those are the same stars from the magazines.  Stacey, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh no, but on Instagram, a lot of these girls are following their friends or their friends of friends.  And they're following their boyfriend liked a girl in a bikini, and so they got to follow that girl because who the heck is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good point. It may even be your friends, even if there's this.  So I mean, the evidence, according to this research, 32% of teen girls said, and this is interesting, when they felt bad about their bodies, they already felt that way, to your point, Stacey.  Instagram made them feel worse.  Yeah.  The real issue is among teens who reported suicidal thoughts, 13% of British users, 6% of American users, traced the desire to kill themselves to Instagram.  That's really serious.  You know, feeling bad about how you look or feeling bad about your body, maybe eating disorders or one thing, but suicide is another.  That's a permanent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, in suicide, I mean, there's so much research already out there about how like if someone kills themselves in a school, others will tend to do that.  It's, it's, it's epidemic.  So when your community is online, it's, it's wider reaching, but they still feel like your community.  And that can be a real problem.  Just like, oh, well, this person, you know, did it, and they get the attention, they get the outpouring of grief.  They probably if you're, I mean, if you're suicidal, too, it's they ended the pain that you don't see an end to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's these numbers from Wall Street Journal.  I have no reason not to believe them.  40% of Instagram's users are 22 years old and younger.  22 million teens log into Instagram every day compared to 5 million on Facebook.  Facebook is of course losing young people.  But Instagram is where they is where many of them have gone.  Teens in the U.S. spend 50% more times on Instagram than they do on Facebook.  So that's why we're really focused on Instagram in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I look at this stuff and the first thing that comes to my mind is where the parents when it comes to these different influences out there.  I know what Instagram is doing or has allegedly done is pretty craptastic and feeding this content out there when they have all of the control of the algorithm.  They're feeding the stuff out there that's going to get the likes and the activity and keep people on the platform because that's their job.  That's where they make their money.  You know, but at the same time, where is mom, dad or uncle or whomever to say, hey, you know, that's none of that's real, right?  That that person is totally faking.  So love you for who you are.  You know, why doesn't that get talked about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And first, first, I want to thank Stacey very sincerely here for sharing.  Nothing makes us expect you to do that.  And for you to have just shared that I think is generous because it tells people that they're not alone and that there is a beyond.  And I think that's critical.  And I don't want to I don't want to invade the privacy of my own loved ones.  But in some response to you, and as Stacey just said, it's it's it's bigger than one cause.  It doesn't it's not caused by that.  It can be made worse.  But there's so much pressure.  What we're doing to our children today in the in the anxiety is raised.  It's been raised for some time.  And look at things like the college entrance scandal.  Look at the testing and what we do to people.  Look at all kinds of measures of trying to perform, whether it's socially, athletically, academically, collegially, collegially, whatever it is, the pressure we're putting our kids under these days is awful.  And they're cracking under it.  And we can't look at one cause.  You're right.  Parents have have have have have responsibility here.  But even if we turned off, if you took off their phone tomorrow, those anxieties and those pressures are there.  And again, I'm going to emphasize, I agree that Facebook making it worse, Instagram making it worse is something we got to look at.  And I put a a thread up for a researcher.  I think researchers, let's put the researchers I respect here, Isabel, I'm putting her name Gerarda, I think her name is, saying we can't invent interventions.  We can't figure out what to do about this unless we have the data to make suggestions.  And to me, that's the real scandal here is that we can't get the data out of these companies because they are scared, because they're going to show some things that are bad.  But but they've got to, the government's going to come after them to get it.  So they've got to figure out how to get researchers involved so we can try to understand the full impact, so we can try to create appropriate interventions.  And now that's nigh under impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook, when asked by the Senate, the Senate to hand over some of this information,  They told the senators that its internal research is proprietary and, quote, kept confidential to promote frank and open dialogue and brainstorming internally.  This was in response to Richard Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn in a letter they sent to Mark Zuckerberg some months ago.  Blumenthal said Facebook's answers were so evasive, failing to even respond to all our questions, they really raised questions about what Facebook might be hiding.  Yeah.  Marsari, who's the head, Adam Marsari, who's the head of Instagram, says we don't send research out to regulators on a regular basis for a number of reasons.  But he added Facebook should figure out a way to share high level overviews of what the company is learning and wanted to give external researchers access to Facebook's data.  We know how that went with another set of data.  We talked about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and the privacy regulations did get in the way.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I completely understand.  Troubling for parents, troubling for everybody.  I've always seen this as a problem in social media in general, that people always show the best slice of their life.  As in media?  Yeah, and I spend a lot of time counseling my own kids who grow up with social media, counseling them not to compare their insides with other people's outsides.  Because that's not apples to oranges.  You're not seeing the troubles those people have.  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say.  They also cater to a community.  So a lot of these, what happens is you become known for something and then that becomes your personality.  Like you hear all the kids, they're like, okay, liking pumpkin spice lattes is not your whole personality, right?  But it does.  But it does.  It's because they're driving after a demographic that like it's on TikTok, it's a certain demographic.  If it's on Instagram, it's this set of people, right?  This hashtag.  So then you're not only curating, you're not necessarily curating your best self.  You're curating the self that gets you the attention you think you want.  And I think that's a really important thing here because being beautiful and skinny gets you a lot of attention.  Being sad and suicidal gets you attention.  So in some sense, you become this what you're trying, not what you're trying to.  A presentational personality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's about the presentation, not about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then I would also say, just because I think this is an important thing.  And also I'm a parent, so I'm sensitive.  And you too, Aunt.  Kids at this age, you can say, where are the parents?  But you can only do so much.  And I talk to my daughter, for example, and I'm sure you talk to your sons.  But you know, it's developmentally appropriate that they're going to lie to you and do other things.  You want them to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  At some point, the control is in their hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  After sixth grade, research has shown this consistently.  After sixth grade, I know this.  I've read the research.  Peers have a much larger influence on kids than their family.  Their peer group is everything.  And your peer group suddenly now has expanded with this kind of social media to friends of friends of friends of friends.  It's a much larger group.  That's your peer group anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not saying that you shouldn't talk to your kids.  You totally should.  And you could try to ban Instagram, although so many social interactions now happen through that.  And like, you know, so like if you don't get invited to the parties or, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know what the answer is.  I agree with it's very tough.  I don't think parents can immunize kids against this very effectively.  I do not think.  I do think companies have a role.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like I do think if Mark Zuckerberg actually gave two flips about this,  and maybe he will when his kids grow up, I don't know, then, you know, there are things that you can do.  And, you know, you even see this at like, I know on TikTok, they're like, this is a professional person doing this.  I don't know if that has any sort of influence, but they're they're trying to set some things.  And I think it's important to be proactive.  And they're most assuredly not proactive about any of the potential harms of any of their platforms.  OK, that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Stacey, again, I think that there are people.  This is this is what troubles me most.  There are people inside.  This is what this reveals.  There are people inside who were studying this, who were saying that there are issues,  who were trying to get used with the data they had and information they had, who did know things.  And it stopped.  There are some cases where they don't know.  Then we really don't know what influence Facebook had on the election of Donald Trump, I think.  But in this case, we see from this that people knew something and tried to do something.  And it's it's the fact that it stopped the troubles me most.  But the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And so at the very least, I think we can all agree that Facebook needs to start handing this research over research over to researchers that that others need other eyes need to see this.  And, you know, of course, the other story that has been widely reported is that Facebook sent misinformation to reporters on researchers on misinformation.  They they misinformed them about the data said about where it came from.  I'm getting a headache.  So Facebook is clearly at wrong about how it's handling this stuff.  They need to start being more open about that stuff.  And if they don't do it themselves, somebody needs to make them do it because that's that's problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That was my question.  I was going to ask if they send this information over to third party researchers and these third party researchers come up with all of this analysis and says, hey, this needs to be done.  That needs to be done.  So on and so forth.  Facebook and Instagram says, hey, this is our company.  We want to run this the way we want to.  You know, we're sorry, but we want to run this the way we want to.  What's the next step?  Well, I don't know what the next step.  The first step is that they need to get the data over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They haven't even done that yet.  And at that point, I think Facebook should want this input.  They should want to share this information with experts in the field and then find out.  And, you know, if Facebook doesn't act, then there's other then there's other steps.  But this but step one is Facebook needs to enlist some expertise outside of Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is the essence of the high transatlantic high level working group on content moderation, freedom of expression, which I was a part was just this that.  And to my mind, it starts with the company saying, here's how we'll be judged.  We warrant with government.  We will hand over data to researchers.  We will do it in a way that protects privacy and have an agreement to do that.  And you can hold us accountable then.  That's the process rather than than one size fits all regulation was saying, get rid of all the bad stuff.  You're ruining society.  That's not helpful.  But that's true of everybody here is to the New York Times to try to understand what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The New York Times should do that.  They had for a while.  They had a really good ombudsman.  And then they got rid of the position.  Everybody who is in the public eye has a responsibility to to be open so that yes, so they can be regulated if we have to.  But more more, you know, to the point, at least in the short term, so that we can all agree on making this a better, safer place for the most vulnerable people among us.  And that's you know, we don't want to have children feeling terrible about that, growing up, feeling terrible about themselves because some company doesn't want to do anything about it.  That's that's not OK.  And that that would be a good reason to regulate big tech.  On the other hand, I will channel Jeff Jarvis, actually Adam Mosseri is channeling you saying, but we do a lot of good things.  And it is absolutely true.  And and so release that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  So are we going to talk about the costume?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, let's talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is actually really interesting.  Speaking of Adam, the Met Gala, which used to be a fund.  It still is a fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.  Or for the costume section there.  Or the Costume Institute.  Great Costume Institute.  It's amazing.  And it became a very big socialite event where you'd have the biggest celebrities and socialites wearing amazing and crazy outfits and they would go to be photographed.  Apparently, Instagram now at least is a partial.  What is the deal? What is Instagram's relationship to this now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Aren't they a co-sponsor, co-host?  What is the word for?  They gave a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they changed it.  Underwriter.  They changed it a lot.  Because Fashion's biggest night out suddenly became Influencers biggest night out.  And they had actually been inviting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this was actually a thing, but they had invited influencers for quite some time.  But what happened is, and I'm trying to find the relationship, the formal name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm trying to find it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, they're an official sponsor of the event.  But Anna Wintour and her peeps have been for the last five or six years inviting various influencers to the Met Gala.  Now, their live coverage has, they have some Instagram-esque photo opportunities and things like that.  And there'll be certain Instagram accounts that were doing stuff for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there were, I think it was mostly the society matrons who weren't happy that the, who is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just put up under line 129. 129 is Instagram's table at the event.  See how many names we recognize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, I mean, whether we recognize them probably doesn't matter much, Jeff, because we aren't exactly.  We're old farts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we're not exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not a known fart, but I couldn't tell you the first thing.  You're not going to know.  Lil Nas X was there for the first time.  That we know. That's what I know.  I've heard of him.  Megan Thee Stallion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Megan Thee Stallion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jordan Alexander.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Saweetie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Saweetie?  You lost me on the third.  Let's see.  She's a...  Here's Saweetie.  All right.  She's a singer.  Yeah.  Okay.  So there's going to be some...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  Brooklyn Beckham.  Victoria Beckham.  And she's always been there.  And David Beckham's daughter.  They were wearing Valentino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kid Cudi wearing Valentino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lil Baby wearing Coach.  Was it he canceled?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, that I do know.  I don't know much about.  See?  Canceled by what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He got up and had a homophobic rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, bye, Lil Baby.  How about Simu Liu wearing Fendi for Men?  Evan Mock wearing Tom Brown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know Evan Mock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Natalia Bryant wearing Conor Ive.  Denice, or is it Denise?  Rick Owens.  Paloma Alesser.  Alcessor wearing Zac Posen.  Jordan Alexander, Christopher John Rogers.  Precious Lee, I love that name.  I know Precious.  She's an actress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's one of the top...  No, this is Precious.  She's one of the top models for plus-size models, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not for us anyway.  Adam Mosseri wearing Bodhi was at the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel like it's for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's for you?  Wait a minute.  I think we should have done a test.  The Met Gala's for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You should have shown Stacey the picture and had her identify the people.  The Met Gala's for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love the Met Gala.  I love fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you love fashion, it's great because people wear also crazy stuff.  This is actually very tame.  I felt that this year was very boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very disappointing.  Extremely tame.  And the Instagram peeps sold.  Most of this table was not very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Boring.  I have no problem with fashion.  Fashion is pretty fascinating.  I think I've talked about before how I enjoy the Halston docuseries.  Wasn't that good?  I loved that.  Fashion is fascinating, but this whole Met Gala thing, I knew nothing about it until  about 24 hours ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, if you'd been here last year, it was a big thing for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Stacey loves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think fashion has become much more accessible, high fashion has become much more accessible  to people, partly because of things like Halston, but also because of all the reality shows.  Oh, okay.  The Project Runway.  Kardashian's.  No, no, like Project Runway.  I think people are, it's much more accessible than it used to be.  Maybe not.  It is a display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a big...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jeff.  Go ahead, Jeff.  No, I was going to be grouchy.  Go ahead, Stacey.  Okay, go ahead, Stacey.  No grouches allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going to say either in 2018 or 2017, technology was actually a theme for the Met  Gala.  I remember that.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they had cool stuff.  But the other thing is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going to say that's probably when we started covering it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's Temothy Chamela wearing a lovely satin jacket.  I don't know who that's by if I knew, I would tell you.  It's kind of fun.  It's like the Academy Awards red carpet only with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's supposed to be better because the Academy Awards red carpet has honestly all  turned into prom.  So very boring.  But what's interesting is with COVID and recessions, you can actually see the haute couture shows,  so like the runway shows.  Their creations become more wearable.  So New York Fashion Week was just this last week and all of their stuff was super commercial.  I mean, super boring.  So Met was actually our only chance to be like crazy stuff and it really didn't deliver.  That's all.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A little more flamboyance.  Here's some flamboyance.  There you go.  Yeah, you're right.  Is that a monstrous?  It could have been more interesting this year.  This was not...  You know where the really interesting fashion was this year?  I can't believe we're talking about this.  MTV's Video Music Awards, the VMAs had some wild fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That still goes on, huh?  Oh, Aunt, Aunt, Aunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I wrote that stuff off years ago.  Actually, the VMAs were fun this year.  They were fun every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I am sadly in some sort of a bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're getting old, Aunt.  It's okay.  It happens to the best of us.  Uncle Aunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oldish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know how we started covering this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We can talk about Google now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's fine.  Let us just note that all the people who worked there had to wear masks, but the stars in  their display of ostentation did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was it just for their photographs or did they have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I think all around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You had to be vaccinated in order to go.  I do know that.  Broadway's open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're in this weird kind of intermediate stage where half the country's vaccinated and says  it's over and the other half the country's in ICU with ventilators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, no, they're the ones who are saying it's over, the ones who aren't getting vaccinated.  That's why we're in the problem we're in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very confusing.  I don't know what to do.  Mandates, man, mandates.  Let's take a break.  When we come back, the ignoble prizes are out.  The best scientific research of the year.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  I can't resist just going through a few of these.  First a word though from our sponsor, Nureva.  Love these guys.  As you come back to work and you're wondering what do we do in our huddle room, in our conference  room, in our classroom.  I've always said pictures are fine, but audio is key.  When you're on a Zoom or a Skype or a Teams or a meeting, it's so important you have  good audio.  That's why Nureva is such a great solution.  There are plenty of simple plug and play audio solutions for huddle rooms, but getting full  room mic coverage, especially in a bigger room, a mid-size or large meeting or a classroom,  a learning space has traditionally meant making a big leap into the complexity and cost of  ProAV solutions.  But Nureva is changing all that, simplifying almost every aspect of audio conferencing.  So there's two ways you can go to get quality audio in a larger space.  You go to get a ProAV system.  Multiple components, multiple microphones, speakers installed in the ceiling spread across  the table.  Of course they all have to have cables.  You got to have technicians come in not just to install it, but to calibrate the system  and sometimes recalibrate it.  It'll take days to install and cost tens of thousands of dollars per room for the purchase  and the installation.  Or then there's a better way, Nureva Audio.  Exceptional audio for rooms as up to 25 to 25 feet with one integrated microphone and  speaker bar, two bars, 30 by 50 feet.  You don't have to bring somebody in to install it.  It's a DIY project.  If you can mount a sound bar, you can put up a Nureva system.  It'll take you 30 minutes to install each device in the wall, two screws, one cable.  Of course a fraction of the price of AV systems.  No calibration and it gives you a, and your users can act completely naturally.  They can face any way.  They can socially distance.  They can do what makes them comfortable, but you still get great audio.  And it really comes down to Nureva's microphone mist technology.  Instead of using expensive beam forming microphones where the person, the caller, the talker has  to stay right in that one spot.  You can't turn.  You can't face away.  And of course if you rearrange room, you have to recalibrate.  Not Nureva's microphone mist technology.  This is where software, it really is computational audio.  Really makes a difference.  True full room coverage.  No matter where you move, no matter which way you face, it's like putting thousands  of microphones in the room so that everybody can be heard.  And it continuously auto calibrates without any intervention on your part.  Their microphone mist technology is patented.  It's incredible.  It's a no touch design.  You don't have to wipe down microphones.  It's really incredible.  Nureva console is a simple intuitive platform that lets you easily monitor, manage, adjust  and scale your fleet of systems from anywhere.  No training required.  The question is, which approach will you choose?  Learn more at nureva.com slash twit.  That's N-U-R-E-V-A dot com slash twit.

The Ig Nobel prizes are out.  You know about the Ig Nobel prizes, right?  Every year, the 31st annual Ig Nobel prize was last week.  Each winner a real scientific project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let us say, just to start off with, I love it too.  Some of these projects do have a purpose in life and we make fun of science.  These days we probably shouldn't be making, I put on the list so I'm okay with this, but  let's be careful making too much fun of science since science is going to save our damn lives.  But having said that, let's have a good laugh.  Look, we all love science here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody's, look, it's a tech, look, if you're into technology, you have to love  science.  Technology is just science applied.  You can't have one without the other.  So nobody's knocking science here.  But sometimes for various reasons, people study interesting things like for the biology  prize.  And this is, this goes to Sweden.  We're analyzing variations in purring, chirping, chattering, trilling, tweedling, murmuring,  meowing, moaning, squeaking, hissing, yowling, howling, growling, and other modes of cat-human  communication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The paper.  Well, we do want to understand what our cats are saying.  I think it's perfectly useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The paper in the proceedings of phonetics 2011, speech, music and hearing KTH Stockholm,  a comparative acoustic analysis of purring in four cats.  And then they succeeded it with the phonetic pilot study of vocalizations in three cats  the following year.  In 2013, they did the phonetic pilot study of chirp, chatter, tweet and tweedle in three  domestic cats.  In 2014, they're really, they're really, this is their life work.  I don't, I don't want to knock it.  A study of human perception in intonation in domestic cat meows.  And of course, I think the reason Suzanne Schatz just took this award away, her seminal  work in 2016, Melody in Human Cat Communications, which she calls Meowzik.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh dear.  Okay.  You can't read that with a straight face.  You can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the ecology prize, it goes to Spain and Iran for a joint study using genetic analysis  to identify the different species of bacteria that reside in wads of discarded chewing  gum stuck on pavements.  And here's where they really get the award in various countries.  They were not content to stop with just one country.  They want to do various countries.  The chemistry prize goes to a large number of researchers all over the world, Germany,  UK, New Zealand, Greece, Cyprus and Austria.  This was really an amazing study.  They tested, chemically analyzed in fact, the air inside movie theaters to test whether  the odors produced by an audience could reliably indicate the level of violence, sex, antisocial  behavior, drug use and bad language in the movie that audience is watching.  They call it cinema data mining.  The smell of fear.  And actually what they're hoping, because they're ambitious scientists, they're hoping  that they can use the analysis of human volatile organic compounds as a tool for age classification  of films.  This film smells too adult for you.  Wait, what?  It's just the research.  I can only go with the research.  Economics prize.  Go ahead.  This one I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The economics prize.  Nope, I'm just not going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go on.  There's nothing to say.  Nothing to say.  It's just, it's good work.  In the economics prize.  I think this might be too intuitive, right, Jeff?  I think maybe.  I liked it.  I liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you got to take, you know, there aren't  really filter bubbles when you do the research to discover this.  You have this presumption, you have this, you have this impression, but it's worth doing  the research to see whether it's true or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The economics prize goes to Pavlo Blavatosky for his research in discovering that the obesity  of a country's politicians may be a good indicator of that country's corruption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fat politicians.  Fat cats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got a hypothesis.  You got to test it.  You can't just say, well, that's obvious.  Can sex improve nasal function and exploration of the link?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, they're trying to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can get rid of my CPAP.  Yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're trying to demonstrate that sexual orgasms can be as effective as decongestant  medicines at improving breathing.  I'd like to participate.  I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't want to see that research though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd like to volunteer.  No.  No, the Ig Nobel Peace Prize, of course, we keep it right here at home in the US of A,  and I think rightly so.  This very important research published in the Integrative Organismal Biology Volume  2, No. 1 for 2020, Ethan Becerra, Steven Nalloway, and David Carrier testing the hypothesis that  humans evolved beards to protect themselves from punches to the face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, you got a problem with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, you know how scientists are.  That's exactly why I grew my beard out.  They like to write it in fancy fancy.  So, the title really is Impact Protection Potential of Mammalian Hair, Testing the Pugilism  Hypothesis for the Evolution of Human Facial Hair.  We still don't know, by the way.  We don't know why hair on the face, but not hair on the biceps or hands or something else.  I don't know.  You have hair everywhere.  I don't know.  Palms.  Palms.  Thank you.  There you go.  That's one place, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Depends.  Physics Prize for Research on Why Pedestrians Do Not Constantly Collide with Other Pedestrians.  Kinetics Prize for Connecting Experiments, conversely on Why Pedestrians Do Sometimes  Collide with Other Pedestrians.  Just kind of, sometimes you get these intersections.  Taurus in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Taurus in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Going slowly.  Completely different teams.  Completely different teams.  I don't know.  It's weird that they both.  That's how science works.  That's how science works.  The Entomology Prize.  This is useful.  Bugs.  New method of cockroach control on submarines.  Gotta, gotta have it.  Yeah.  Gotta have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dude, as someone who lived in Texas, that is applicable probably there too.  Roaches were a real issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, if you read the title of this scientific paper, you may be confused about its import.  This is from the Journal of Wildlife Diseases.  And too many scientists to name them all.  But the pulmonary and metabolic effects of suspension by the feet compared with lateral  recumbency in immobilized black rhinoceroses, diceros bicornis, captured by aerial darting.  And what they're trying to figure out is, is it safer to transport an airborne rhinoceros  upright or upside down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was going to say, is he on his side or is he...  Upside down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Upside.  Lateral recumbency versus suspension.  Upside down is the right way?  Suspension by the feet.  Well, you know.  Yes.  That's what...  What was the conclusion of this paper?  Yeah, I've gotta know, right?  Let's dig into the abstract.  Aerial translocation of captured black rhinoceroses has been accomplished by suspending them by  their feet.  We expected this posture would compromise respiratory gas exchange more than would lateral  recumbency.  All I can see...  Black rhinoceroses.  Hey boss, how is your lateral recumbency these days?  I've been laterally recumbent for...  Suspension by the feet for 10 minutes did not impair pulmonary function more than did  lateral recumbency.  And apparently, there they are, augmented gas exchange to a small degree relative to  lateral recumbency.  So they farted?  Black rhinoceroses immobilized were not as hypermetabolic as were white rhinoceroses.  See, again, they played the race card.  I'm very...  I just...  I'm very disappointed.  Very disappointed.  Anyway, the Nobel prizes, ladies and gentlemen.  Congratulations to all our winners.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Intuitively...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I gotta go back...  Go ahead.  I gotta go back to the cat at the beginning.  That...  Tweetles...  You know, they've been...  You said they've been working on it for like 15 years?  Yeah.  That's what's amazing.  That's impressive considering cats don't give a crap about anybody or anything and yet they  were able to research purring and tweeting and all of that good stuff.  I can see why it took 14, 15 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting because they started with four cats and then it was three cats.  I don't know if the cat dropped out.  Maybe he was disqualified for marijuana use.  I don't know, but they're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure that cat was like, I got better things to do.  I'm not doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Typical cat.  Intuit is buying MailChimp, the mailing list company for cats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody's got to have a newsletter now.  It's the constitutional amendment that you're required to have a newsletter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me tell you, this is apparently a very lucrative field.  $12 billion for MailChimp.  $12 billion.  I pay MailChimp.  Is that how you use for your newsletter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is, but it's so much more than newsletters now.  It's more like a CRM kind of for customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's probably why Intuit wants it, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because they do financial stuff.  Intuit said MailChimp has the data, I believe, in a statement.  They have the data, we have all this other information, why not just put it all together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's always scary when they say it's about that.  They said it openly.  Yeah, they did.  This is Intuit CEO Sasan Guzzari.  MailChimp has, quote, a lot of customer data.  We have all the purchase data.  The magic is putting these two together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is true.  A lot of the MailChimp backend is dedicated to people who want to send emails to sell you stuff.  I don't obviously use it that way, but if I send you an email with Stacey's Pottery and I'm featuring three pots,  I can see what people click on.  I can see actually who clicks on what.  Now if you actually have the purchase data on their side, you can actually say,  I think it's Leo bought this particular pot and I can pull.  I mean, that's actually pretty interesting.  I won't lie.  It's that close in the loop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We know how much Aunt Prude loves TikTok musicals, and I'm sure that's why Jeff Jarvis.  I put this on here just for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you kidding me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just for him.  So when I say I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky, I could be hurtful, I could be purple, I could be anything you like,  what comes to mind?  I don't know. Wizard of Oz?  Nothing.  It's the grace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this a Grace Kelly movie?  I don't know where it's from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just know it's all over Twitter or TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is this Yentl or something?  Sounds like Yentl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People do, they record, one person can record all the parts or two people can record all the parts.  And so it's quite popular.  You can go down below the one you're going to show and show why it's popular.  I'll show you. I'll show the girls.  Oh, collaborative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, here's some girls. This is called the Grace Kelly singing challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky, I could be hurtful, I could be purple, I could be anything you like.  I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky, I could be hurtful, I could be purple, I could be anything you like.  It's like a round.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it can just be one person singing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like it though that they have this in a in a DAG mobile app. It's cool.  I know, isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to say I'm a TikTok fan. My son now has 200,000 plus followers and millions of views on every video. So I'm a believer.  So anyway, the reason.  I'm a sucker for these. They're all pretty to listen to.  I love them. I love them. I love the singing ones.  So apparently, I didn't know this, but Ryan Reynolds, who is of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, this happened yesterday.  The owner of Mint Mobile.  Don't give away the surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Will Ferrell are working together in a movie called A Christmas Carol.  And Ryan Reynolds decided, you know, as long as he's got nothing to do, because this is the problem, frankly, being on a movie set, you got a lot of free time in between takes.  So he thought he'd try it himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Will Ferrell walks in and does the high part.  That's pretty damn good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's really freaking good.  I hope this Christmas Carol is a musical.  That's really freaking good.  Apparently it is a musical, so I guess they can both sing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it's going to start like a musical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That would be no. No, negative, sir.  That was good though.  I give credit where credit is due, that to be able to do this inside of a mobile app is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to make him a Tik Toker sooner or later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why Tik Tok is so amazing, because it enables that kind of collaboration and remixing.  And it's just a new level of content creation.  So wait, I've got a better for you, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I will say, no, well, I was going to say, because I thought of Ant this week, actually,  I realized I finally learned how to do makeup and I, everyone was like, oh, just watch a YouTube tutorial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just going to say, Stacey, you look really good today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, thank you. I did not. I didn't. I don't have contour, but I finally learned how to do contour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just going to say, I didn't want to say anything.  No, no, no, I noticed right away. I wanted to be, you know, because I know people, you don't say, nobody likes it personal.  But given that you've raised this point, whatever you're doing, it's working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I had an event earlier, so that's okay.  But YouTube gave people infinite time, so their makeup tutorials were killer.  I was like, I do not need to watch someone for 10 minutes, but for like a minute, people can get everything I need.  And so, yeah, I'm like, screw YouTube. TikTok is where it's at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and as we mentioned last week, TikTok has more viewing now, more view.  People spend more time watching TikToks than they do YouTube videos.  And that's probably why. Short attention span.  I talked to my son a lot about this because he's really become the TikTok master.  He's now my teacher on TikTok, quarter of a million followers and growing fast.  You can go up to three minutes, but he's found that it's better if they're shorter.  So, by the way, today he posted a video today, 4.6 million views so far.  This one we showed. I thought we showed this one last week.  I would like to eat that.  One of the things he does is he's big on sound effects.  People love those sound effects.  Folie ASMR, whatever you want to call it.  He's the master. The other thing he does, and I talked about this, is it's not clear when it's looping.  So people watch it over and over and over again because they're not sure it got to the end.  And he's like a high quality gift.  He does that very consciously.  How long does it take to edit?  Half a day. So here's his most recent.  This is a duck sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice choice of music for this one.  I know. I told him that. I said he gets paid off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although I've heard it, I think, a couple of times on some of my videos.  So maybe it's just trending on the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I asked him how he figured out what music places he does.  He's just listened to Spotify a lot and tried to find something that works with the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Plus it's the real sound too.  The real sound is what's key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, eight million views, seven and a half million views, three and a half million views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I was asking you before and we got interrupted ourselves.  How do you turn that into a living?  I keep asking that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Try not to be that dead.  Because, you know, when I was a young, well, when his mom and I got married, his mom's brother said,  Don't marry a DJ. Those guys, they're the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're not going anywhere.  Just a subtle nudge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So, but that's true.  And I realized I was doing the same thing with him.  Oh, come on. You know, that's not real media.  But it is real media. This is modern media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He could get invited to the Met Gala next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't be surprised at all.  And I hope he wears that sweatshirt and sunglasses and the cheesy porn stash,  which all of which we try to discourage him from wearing.  My mom, eighty eight year old mom says, Don't wear a hat, Henry.  You're so cute. Why are you wearing a hat?  But I just tell her, Mom, it's a different generation.  You know, yes. So but I'm you know, we worked out this morning together.  I'm always querying him. You know, what's so what are you learning?  And he's really paying close attention to the feedback that he gets both from comments but also views  and is tuning it slowly closer and closer to and you can see that it makes a difference.  It really does. What kind of metrics do they give them besides just views?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there any? I'll ask him. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so you asked how do you make money? So there's a couple of ways to make money.  Tick tock ads are not interstitial. They're not in your video. Right.  So unlike YouTube, you don't have pre-roll, post-roll, mid-roll.  So there's nothing tied to your video. So you don't get any of that ad revenue.  You know, it's like Instagram. It's every few videos.  There's an ad. Now I see a lot more big brands on Tick tock.  So I obviously Tick tock is doing suddenly very, very, very well.  But they do have a hundred million dollar creators fund.  So that gets parceled out. But, you know, he's got four million views, maybe six hundred bucks.  So it's not it's not a big wow. So what most of that's like YouTube money.  No. Yeah. But what Tick tock does, because they know they're not sharing revenue with you,  they allow you to have ads so you can sell your own ads in there.  And the CPMs are something something like five bucks, which if you have seven million views is seven thousand dollars.  Nice. Is that right? No, it's thirty thirty three. I don't know.  Five dollars per thousand. Chat room. Seven million seven thousand.  Thirty five thousand dollars. That's a lot of money. Is that right?  Could that be right? Thirty five thousand dollars. So go save us, please.  It's a lot of money. Can you do it? No, I just did it. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry. I was signing up for the Pixel Super Fans Club because I'm like, we're going to talk about Google eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on. I'm sorry. So Scooter Actions saying the U.S.  Tick tock creator fund is actually now they plan to spend two hundred million over the next twelve months,  August to August twenty twenty to twenty twenty one and will be upwards of a billion in the next three years.  And more than that globally, they have to because otherwise creators, that's what killed Vine.  You got to share that money back or creators go. Yeah, we'll go somewhere else.  And he told me YouTube shorts is doing this, too. So nevertheless, is he cross posting it to anywhere?  Yeah, he puts it on Instagram as well. And I told him, do YouTube shorts. Why not? What's wrong?  Why would not? Why not? I don't know if he's going to.  I don't. But the next step for him would be to going out and selling ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow. Or signing a deal with like having a knife company or a chopping block company or pan company.  He's going to be. Or Sir La Tabla. Exactly. He just goes into his cooking. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He he's going to be a guest poster on the taste made Instagram this week.  Tastemates big. That's a big Instagram. That's branding there.  Yeah. So I think next year we'll see what we see what I've been saying about my son.  Yeah. Don't be a tick tock star. They don't make any money. I might be wrong.  I think I think it's not influencers. He's a content creator.  And actually my feeling is even if he doesn't make money on Tick Tock, he's the skills he's getting are useful and will get him plenty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the one thing I can say about Tick Tock is the way it puts constraints on the content creator.  It's good. I need to create content that is 60 seconds long.  That's going to make people want to stop to click on it first of all and then make them want to watch it all the way through for 60 seconds and then make them want to say, hey, did you see this?  Let me show this to you. That's pretty dadgum challenging and not everybody can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's I am big pentameter. It is. Yeah. Right.  It's the limits of poetry and art. The constraints. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it also means this is true of YouTube and Twitter and everything else.  If you're going to be a content creator, you have to work your ass off. You have to post every day. You cannot stop.  It's a content machine. Go ahead. I'm sorry, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I was just going to say, Jeff, how does this relate back to Gutenberg?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Give me time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Since you asked, actually, two, one.  Shakespeare found that verse sold better than prose.  Interesting. And so Shakespeare was the first major playwright who ended up with a real market in printed planes.  So around the same time that Montaigne invented the essay and Cervantes, the modern novel and and the guy named Johan Corollas, the newspaper all around sixteen hundred Shakespeare proved the market for printed plays since you asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you don't mind, I'd like to take us back to the 21st century.  Yes. I'm just teasing. I love it. I could go on. I love Shakespeare.  Can we show the picture from Inspiration4 right now, John?  Today, the first all I didn't realize this.  There has never been an all civilian space flight into orbit.  This is the first all civilian mission orbit. We've been talking about Inspiration4.  I was supposed to watch that doc on Netflix.  You got a little time after the show because they're launching in two hours as we record.  That'll be around five o'clock Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern.  This is the Inspiration4 crew. If you watch the documentary, I think it's called Countdown, you really get inspired.  Jared Isaacman, who was a startup guy when he was 16 years old.  He created a credit card payment company called Shift4 Payments, has become a billionaire in the years since, in the 21 years since.  He also has taken that money, learned to fly commercial military aircraft.  He bought 40 fighter jets and has a private Black Diamond jet team. They do air shows.  He's got 6,000 hours in the air, so he's an accomplished pilot.  He bought the flight. I don't know what he spent, but he bought the flight.  And he said, we're going to buy three other crew members because the SpaceX Crew Dragon  hulls, well, it can hold more, but it can hold up to eight, seven or eight.  But there's going to be four on it. So he had a contest.  First, he said, I want somebody from, it's all to benefit St. Jude.  And they've raised, by the way, I think $100 million so far for St. Jude.  They've raised a lot of money.  Who? How much did the flight cost?  I don't know what he spent on the flight. They don't mention that.  About $50 million according to Out of Sink and IRRC.  Okay. $50 million. Hailey Arseneau is going. She's 29 years old.  She was treated for cancer as a child at St. Jude, will be the first astronaut with a prosthetic.  She has a prosthetic femur and she's a physician's assistant at St. Jude's.  So she's going up with her. Then they had a contest.  You might have seen the Super Bowl ad where they said, if you contribute to St. Jude, you're in the drawing to go to be in seat three.  And this guy, Chris Zembrowski won it.  Turns out he's worked in the Air Force. He maintained intercontinental ballistic missiles and served in Iraq.  So he has some experience. He has a BS in professional aeronautics.  He'll be going. He's got a family, two little kids.  And then the fourth crew member, Dr. Sean Proctor, is going to be the third or fourth African American woman, black woman, to go into space.  And she again, just kind of she won by submitting a video on Twitter to show her entrepreneurial spirit.  She's 51 years old. She's going. So this is kind of an inspiring crew.  And they are they are now in the capsule. So we were just showing the video.  There's a picture of them kind of bonding as a team. They had to do astronaut training.  They all have a role. They're flying the craft. Fortunately, they have a very accomplished pilot in the front seat.  But there they are. They've actually entered the spacecraft.  How long are they going to be up there? Three orbits.  I'm sorry. Three days, which is how many orbits? 60 orbits. I don't know how many.  Every 90 minutes they do an orbit so you can do the math.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So wait, there's. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  This is meant to be transport from here to the shuttle or back.  That's what that's how it was used last time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then it will also be used to go to the moon, won't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or is how do they like do things that humans need to do? Poopoo eat and poop and stuff in their suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's actually if I can find the picture, they can get up and move around once they once they get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a book on that. I can actually answer that question, but the book is downstairs.  It's it's a really good book. Do you remember anything at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just make up something and that would be OK. No, I have the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not going to make it up. Just stay tuned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Also, just trying to grab a name. I can name. That's right. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you're on to her. No, no, I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We moved and I don't know where my kids science books are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a bathroom. I will tell you because I remember now because there is a viewing dome.  Once they get into orbit, this the top of this capsule opens up and there's a clear viewing dome they can go into.  And the reason I know is because the viewing dome is next to the bathroom, which is over here.  So there is actually a little space. There's an actual bathroom. Yeah. OK.  Yeah, it's a fairly it's a fairly capacious. And so food they just get.  They just get crackers. Astronaut food. You get astronaut ice cream.  Ice cream. You get Tang. It's great. Prime rib.  Prime rib in a bag. You know, it's a normal Taco Bell chicken sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a regular space flight. OK. They're catering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a regular. I want to know something super nerdy. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can name three of the African-American women astronauts who've actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know Mae Jemison is one. Right. Mae Jemison. Joan Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you know her. Aunt Joan. I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Nice. And who's the other one? Mike. Mike? Stephanie Wilson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm impressed that you can name them. That's great. I love astronauts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Me too. I can name lots of female astronauts. I'll be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So have you been following this inspiration flight at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I have other things I'm doing. It's pretty exciting.  I would I would actually. It is exciting. Get your daughter to join you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the dock is great. The dock will tee you up very nicely.  And this twenty nine year old, she's on screen right now.  Haley Arseneau, not my screen on the TV. No, there we go.  Is is absolutely great and adorable. They're all great.  You really start to if you watch the dock, which is only two episodes,  because they're going to have more episodes as the flight goes on.  It really gets you to get to know them and get excited for them.  Which one of the things Haley, first of all, the video call that they each of them got saying,  by the way, you're going into space is wonderful.  And Haley wrote and said, are we going to the moon? Where are we going?  I don't know. Where are we? Where are we going in this? No, no, no.  But it is real orbit. In fact, it's a little higher than the space station.  So it's a fairly. Oh, wow. That's an actual. It's a high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The book is called What It's Like in Space, stories from astronauts who've been there.  It's designed for kids. It's by Ariel Waldman.  And I have a copy and it is amazing. It answers all of your questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, neat. Anyway, I wanted to mention that because I'm inspired by it.  And I think it's really, you know, it's interesting because unlike Jeff Bezos's flight or Branson's flight,  this is these are it's a real flight for one thing.  And there's these are civilians, but they are trained and, you know, there they are in the, you know,  the centrifuge and everything. They have to be highly trained for this.  But there are civilians and they're going to get to do it, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's pretty. Your friend and listener, Tanya Wyman, sent a message to me on Saturday during football.  It's like, hey, make sure you watch this doc. And I put it in the queue and I never got around to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can watch the launch tonight. And then after after the launch, you can you'll know a little bit more about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are they going to try to accomplish any science?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have some science. Yes, they have some science they're going to do.  I don't remember what it was, but they have some projects up there.  Yeah, you can't go to space without science projects.  So they can listen to cats in space.  How cats communicate with aliens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Astronauts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, can you imagine a little cat with a little helmet that it's trying to get off the whole time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will not be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cockroaches in space.  We could figure out what to do about cockroaches in the space capsules.  This would be very useful.  What if they survived?  They will. They will. Oh, Stacy, they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sure they will survive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I bet there are already roaches in space.  I bet the space station has roaches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is a good question. I'm like, that's not in my book, but I wish it were.  You think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's pretty clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  International Space Station infested with mysterious bugs, says the New York Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  And more to come, including the Google changelog in just a little bit.  We have a show today brought to you by CrowdStrike.  This is a very interesting approach and I think very successful to fighting ransomware attacks.  Using the knowledge of the crowd.  The problem is ransomware never sleeps.  It's constantly moving, constantly changing.  And of course, constantly attacking.  You've seen the headlines. We talk about it all the time.  Ransomware attack after ransomware attack, holding businesses hostage.  And if you've got a business, you can, I know I feel this way.  You can just like feel like it's only a matter of time before they come for you.  And then you're going to have a very, very tough decision.  Pay the ransomware crooks millions of dollars or lose everything.  Well, there is a third option.  Defeat your adversaries before the fight even starts.  I don't think anybody disagrees.  It is always a lot better not to get ransomware in the first place.  Thank goodness there's CrowdStrike.  You're not alone in the battle against ransomware.  A secure future demands a shared defense.  That's what's so cool about CrowdStrike.  Their Falcon platform uses something they call ThreatGraph.  Advanced AI to analyze the behavior on your devices, your servers, your cloud workloads.  But also of all the other people using CrowdStrike to find the threats and stop them.  That means you can harness the power of the CrowdStrike team to protect you.  Because ransomware is constantly changing.  How much information? Get ready for this.  I talked to CrowdStrike's CTO, Michael Santones.  A trillion bits of data a day.  Seven trillion, trillion with a T, a week.  That's how CrowdStrike fights ransomware.  It's like they have their feelers out throughout the world.  Keeping an eye on everything, on the most sophisticated cyber attacks.  And then delivering you protection via the cloud through a lightweight, intelligent agent.  Forrester found Falcon Complete delivers 403% ROI.  And I'll tell you, 100% confidence.  They harness the power of every click, every action.  All the allies to grow stronger and stop cyber threats before they can stop you.  Falcon Complete stops breaches every hour of every day through expert management, threat hunting, monitoring and remediation.  I love it. They put their money where their mouth is with CrowdStrike's breach prevention warranty.  They don't just say it, they guarantee it.  For Falcon Complete managed customers who receive a warranty, you're covering up to $1 million in the event of a breach.  Terms and conditions apply.  Michael Santones explained when I talked to him, what makes CrowdStrike different and sets them apart from others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think what makes us unique is we've always tried to stay true to our mission to stop breaches.  And today it's never been more relevant.  When CrowdStrike was founded a decade ago, organizations and governments were being breached.  And technology that they were using was not protecting them.  So our goal was to build the fundamentals that organizations need to defend themselves and to stop breaches.  And that is everything that we focus on.  We focus on the customer, we focus on stopping breaches, and we make sure that we continually innovate to stay ahead of the threat for the benefit of our customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ten years later, Gartner Magic Quadrant named CrowdStrike a leader for endpoint protection platforms in 2021.  It really works.  Join the fight.  Experience the power of Falcon Platform free today.  CrowdStrike.com slash twit.  C-R-O-W-D crowd is the power of the crowd.  Strike, S-T-R-I-K-E.  You'll strike at the heart of ransomware.  CrowdStrike.com slash twit.  CrowdStrike.  Because what we've built together is worth defending together.  And we thank them so much for their support.  I really enjoyed talking to Michael.  Super smart guy.  And what they're doing is really sophisticated.  CrowdStrike.com slash twit.  Please use that address so they know you saw it here on the show.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to talk about Amazon at one point.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we haven't talked about Amazon and there's a lot to talk about.  Hourly pay for Amazon.  That's what fascinates me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  So Amazon has it.  So they've raised their hourly.  A few weeks ago we said they're going to hire 55,000 people in technology  and corporate.  Now they've announced they're going to hire another 125,000 workers for the  warehouses and they're going to raise their minimum pay from 15 to 18 dollars.  And at the same time they're going to pay full college tuition for front line  employees.  That's what that means.  What this does, what just fascinates me is that it puts tremendous pressure on  Walmart, on other employers.  And even without Congress, Amazon is having an impact of raising wages where  they have employees.  And at a time of tight labor, at a time of difficulty, it's rather like  regulatory capture.  Amazon is doing it saying, hey, we can afford it so far.  We're going to put pressure on everybody else.  And you want to complain about unions and all that?  Well, we pay more.  So I'm not saying it's all golden hearted, but it is really interesting how  a company that size can have that kind of influence on the economy as a whole.  So I just wanted to make mention of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's great and I would love to see them make working conditions more  tolerable.  Because you're earning that 18 dollars.  I mean it is hard work and it's hard on the body.  But yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They have that college fund that's paying full tuition and if I read it, right,  it said they're paying it up front.  It's not something that you have to pay like that.  It comes at the end where they reimburse you anything.  They're going ahead and paying it.  And it made me think, OK, if these working conditions are known to be so  terrible and you're a college student, where's the balance?  How is that going to work out?  Is this a way for them to change the culture that they have?  People just assuming their working conditions are so bad.  Will it change for the people not going to college?  I just had a couple different questions about all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And one thing I've heard too is that they recognize that eventually robots  will replace more and more of these people and they want to be able to say,  well, we got them ready for that world.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To me it comes down to is this, well, we're going to raise it to 18 bucks now.  Don't pay any attention to anything else.  Or is this Andy Jassy, the new CEO, saying, no, clearly it's reputationally hurting us.  We've got to do something about it.  So let's do some things.  And I bet you there's more.  I hope there's more to make this a better job for people.  You know, it's hard work.  It's warehouse work.  It's hard work.  So is it enough just to say, well, we're going to pay them more?  And I agree with you.  Giving you educational opportunities is great because that means...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's more important if they can actually, if you have the time and the  ability to do it, that actually does help you level up if you're interested in that.  And a lot of people probably are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Good.  All right.  My former CEO, I remember when we went to a more automated system for our clients and  hanging out in the gym with the CEO, he says, you know, I want us to have this product to  where our staff can do more things that require some brain power, not just being somebody  pushing a button.  And so we went into this automated process and it did.  It made people put their thinking caps on and be a little bit more analytical about the  day-to-day operations versus just straight up data entry at the desk.  You know, so I totally dig if they're trying to set up the staff to be ready to maintain  the robots so the robots don't take us over.  I salute you for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon is also making their first TV set.  The fire TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who are the poor folks who bought their Amazon phone?  I don't know if I want to buy an Amazon TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're putting TikTok on it.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Comcast is actually partnering with Hisense to make their own.  I saw that too.  So yeah, I'm like, everybody needs it.  There's so much data on those platforms.  And if everyone's going to be moving to a streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Last week we had the story of the TV as the ad platform now.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Xfinity TV made by Comcast and Hisense will have Comcast X1 box built into it.  That's the other reason they want to do it.  But I think you're right, Stacey.  It's really, it's all about data spying on the users.  Amazon CEO, Andy Jassy says, it's hard to argue that it's a monopoly.  It's hard to argue that it's a monopoly.  He says, our retail business, just about 1% of the worldwide retail market segment.  It's nowhere close to majority share.  We compete with very large companies.  The world wide is cheating a little bit, but go ahead.  Yeah, but there's Walmart, there's Target, there's Amazon.  Can't disagree with him on that.  Also, Amazon's media ambitions are strong.  He says, it's still early days for us in media.  This is an interview with CNBC.  We're off to a great start, but we do believe we have an opportunity to provide a unique  viewing experience for our customers with really original and creative content.  They bought MGM for it.  They're going to be able to see the content.  They're going to be able to see the content.  They're going to be able to see the content.  They're going to be able to see the content.  They're going to be able to see the content.  For original and creative content, they bought MGM for $8.45 billion.  I don't think that's been approved yet.  They spent $11 billion on content last year.  They bought the Lord of the Rings TV series, which debuts in a year, for $465 million just  for the rights.  And by the way, I have been informed it is not the Lord of the Rings story that we've  already seen made into movies.  Is it a prequel, John, did you tell me?  It's in the Lord of the Rings universe, but it's a different story.  So all they really bought is the rights to the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or the Simularalon or whatever that book is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Simularalon, yeah, right.  That thing.  Yeah, that thing.  Nobody ever reads, right?  Have you tried to read it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, no.  No.  I barely got through the Lord of the Rings.  I'll be honest.  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Simularalon is even more.  A collection of mythopoetic stories by JRR Tolkien.  Silmarillion.  Silmarillion.  It has five parts.  In the first, Ayuna D'Ale tells of the creation of Ea, the world that is.  The second part, Vala Quinta, gives it, never mind, forget I said anything.  And we're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're done.  Where's the three body problem?  That's what I'm waiting for.  They're working on that, right?  And I feel like it ran into trouble.  Yeah, well, they were, but I thought it ran into some issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We will see Foundation on Apple TV Plus this next month.  That's coming.  The big thing, the big ticket item they're looking at is NFL football.  They want to buy, they already have a Thursday night package.  They want to buy Sunday night as well.  That's big money.  A lot of eyeballs.  That is money.  Yeah, big money.  Both coming and going.  You have to do both.  Amazon v Murdoch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Murdoch was, didn't we say that he was like throwing things?  He was like really pissed.  Or is that my imagination?  Maybe that was a dream I had.  Rupert, what's the matter?  What's the matter?  The next big tech battle, Financial Times says Amazon's bet on healthcare  begins to take shape.  We've talked with everyone of our sponsors, Amazon's pharmacy.  Yeah.  But that's not all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was this about their pharmacy stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is, hey, what's your name?  Help me finish surgery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At Houston Methodist Hospital, the very same technology that plays music and sets your  timer instead hears start surgery.  I hope they're not using the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The thigh bone's connected to the knee bone.  Are they using it to control like, are they controlling like DaVinci, like laparoscopic

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  surgery machines?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're checking off things.  You're checking off.  It's like a takeoff at SpaceX.  Did you take out the scalpel?  Yes, I took out the scalpel.  That was a big deal.  They implemented that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then it also memorializes it.  So you can say, yeah, I took the scalpel out.  I told it I took the scalpel out in 476.  That's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it forces like these people who are kind of like, yeah, I'm so awesome because I'm  a surgeon.  It forces them to have to go through it and leaves a record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also being used in consulting rooms where the doctor can add information to the  health record with the patient's consent by saying, you know, hey, now I have to say I  don't use, I don't use the a word.  I use Ziggy and I have the male voice, but then I've recently added Samuel L. Jackson,  Melissa McCarthy.  So it's like it's got a multiple personality because if you say whatever person's name,  if you say, hey, Samuel.  So I think I want the physician to say, hey, Samuel, this guy's got a bunion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you mean a bunion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samuel, if you ask, if you go, hey, Samuel, why do you cuss so much?  Just try it.  I'll leave it at that.  Swear it's a bubba blue streak.  It's great.  So instead of typing in a keyboard, the doctor is actually kind of saying, hey, remember  this, remember that.  I think that'll be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because right now they dictate to like almost a dictaphone.  Well, this is when you're talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when you go to at least my doctor, my doctor is sitting, often is sitting at a keyboard  looking at my medical record.  This is at Kaiser, big HMO.  And then he'll talk to me and he's very nice.  He's personal. I love my doctor.  He actually listens to our shows.  So hi, Steven.  Hi, doc.  Hi, doc.  Hi, Leo's doctor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't put him back on that stupid diet.  He was really grumpy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, he didn't put me on that diet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He said, don't do it.  OK, good.  Thanks, doc.  I have to say the last checkup I had, I had a zoom checkup with him.  He says, before we go, can I ask you a tech question?  I said, OK.  What?  He said, should I buy the Model Y or the Mach-E?  Nice.  I went into a whole thing.  He said, well, that's good because I put it in order on the Mach-E.  I said, well, you shouldn't tell me that upfront.  Anyway, no, he's great.  But he spends a lot of the time typing while he's talking.  He's always entering in notes as he's talking.  That's how he does it.  I guess that's replaced the pen and paper.  Yeah, it used to be pen and pad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't bother me.  Or now they dictate.  At my place, they dictate.  Do they while they're talking to you?  No, they take down notes and then they have to go off.  Afterwards, they go off.  And they dictate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And there's no amount of transcription.  I don't know.  It would be a little weird if he's doing it while he's talking to you.  So he says, so, Leo, how's your sleep?  That's not so good, doc.  His sleep is not so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And do you feel this cough?  He's coughing.  The prostate's OK.  It's OK in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me out of here.  So Amazon.  Nurse, help me.  The nurse, help me.  Amazon has given the Kindle.  And you know what?  I use a Kindle all the time.  And I forgot before I came in today to boot it up and see.  There's a new UI on the Kindle.  First since 2015.  What?  Yeah.  So boot up your Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  I got to go grab my Kindle.  I'll be back.  Well, it probably has to download it.  And a waffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We know she has a waffle.  Boy, she's been trying to get that waffle.  She's been trying like crazy.  Yeah.  Any excuse?  Let me get that book on how astronauts move.  I'll be right back.  You nailed it, Ant.  You knew.  Yeah, you did.  Holy cow.  Oh, no, I can find that.  I've joined the club too, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, he's got his own waffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I have to admit, I ate that donut.  I didn't want to.  I'm waffle-less and I'm back.  She's back and she's waffle-less.  You're de-waffled?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I just, they take a long time to toast, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I hope you bought it.  That's how we eat.  In the restaurant trade, that's what we say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds like a hilt waffle.  Put down a waffle.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Adam and Eve on a raft.  Wreck them.  Drop the meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's how we talk in the biz.  I'm just saying.  All right.  I'm going to restart my Kindle and see.  He's playing with his iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's playing with his iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So in the Big Apple event yesterday, they kept showing how pilots love iPads strapped to  their throats.  They're like, oh, I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  I'm going to do this.  So he's got his iPad strapped to their thighs.  Well, there you go.  It's not strapped to his thigh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He keeps clicking.  Nothing's happening.  Nothing's happening.  Hey, this thing's not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There we go.  It is mounted to his thigh.  Oh, he's holding his leg up.  Oh yeah.  They all got iPads on their thighs.  See Apple's looking at this going, yeah, baby, that's good.  You keep it up, Elon.  Keep up the good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, do I have three days worth of movies?  This is going to be really boring.  Once you see the earth, what's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the things about this Inspiration 4 is it's the first civilian, all civilian crew  on an all civilian craft with an all civilian company.  It is launching from Cape Canaveral, but you know, a NASA launch pad, but all the civilian  space companies have offices down there.  I love also that they've designed-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, is Mission Control civilian as well?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's SpaceX.  It's so weird to watch Mission Control on a SpaceX launch because it's just a bunch  of guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're going to have them on shorts and flip flops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seriously, they're in Hawaiian shirts.  They're basically sitting at like folding tables with computers on them.  It's not-  Huh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is not the NASA Mission Control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not quite.  But you know what?  It's probably more realistic.  The other thing I love, he designed the suits to look like they're like in a movie, right?  Doesn't this look science fiction?  It's like the inside of a Tesla.  No less risky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is it more functional than looks though, sir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  One would maybe say that, but no.  I think it's really about the looks.  It's cool.  It's very cool.  Now, John, you're going to have to- John's our space expert.  I've seen in some articles it says that the flight is entirely controlled from ground,  but it does feel like these guys have something to do up there.  Yeah, they're tapping on their iPads.  Okay.  So, it's not fully autonomous in the sense that Houston or ground control will control  it, but-  El Segundo.  El Segundo.  See, there's the difference.  Kennedy Space Center in Houston?  No.  It's actually in El Segundo on Route 405, but it's a great place.  There's a donut shop just around the corner.  If they lose control of it, they can take over, but they're not what one would call  fully trained astronauts.  I think Jared is a pilot.  The P.D. is in Florida.  I know.  I'm just joking around.  Oh, okay.  I was like, that's not right.  It's Johnson Space Center in Houston.  I know.  I was like, I grew up there.  It's Johnson.  Am I right?  It's the Johnson.  It is the Johnson Space Center.  Home of all my field trips.  And SpaceX is in Torrance, not El Segundo.  It's just down the 405 a piece.  It is in the same area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry, Leo.  Sorry.  Space nerds, they want you to get it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get it right, space nerds.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  It does look like the spacesuits from Prometheus from the movies, I really think.  But they didn't have iPads in there.  That's so cool.  So cool.  It's going to be a night launch, a dark launch, which is always interesting.  We will keep an eye on that as we go.  Update Google Chrome immediately.  In fact, this has been a bad week for update everything immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Set everything.  Just turn it all off.  Let it update.  Back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Security vulnerabilities.  Eleven of them in Chrome, two of which are already in the wild.  That means there's zero days.  They're active.  That means you need to patch.  The patch went out on Monday.  And your Chrome should now be version 93.0.4577.82.  All you have to do really is launch Chrome, check about Chrome, and then close it and  reopen it and it should automatically update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not true of Chrome OS.  Just Chrome the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chrome OS, if you go to about Chrome OS, I think it will tell you what version.  And if you need to restart, it'll tell you to restart.  So I think you can still do that.  I think it's in the system tray in the right there.  Yeah, it usually has it right in the bottom right corner.  So click, take the trackpad.  That's that square thing at the bottom.  You move your...  That's what that's called?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And then move your finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the cursor?  He's not laughing.  He's not laughing.  What's the cursor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm old enough to remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The cursor is called Jeff Jarvis.  He's the cursor.  Yeah, you betcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who's the cursor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samuel Jackson.  Why, how can we have all these TikToks things on here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff is obsessed with TikTok.  No, I only put...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did put that one on there.  I like...  For Ant, I do musical TikTok.  For you guys, I do food TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I wanted to let people...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, you know how Google said they were going to start showing AQI, air quality index, on  their devices?  They do.  Mine now have it.  Mine does too.  And I'm very excited about it.  I saw it this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I went out and took a deep breath.  Do they get that from the purple maps or where do they get that?  Do we know?  Oh, I don't have it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's see if I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's on the face of my...  So, when you're on your Google Home Next Home Pod map...  It's airnow.gov.  It's airnow?  Okay.  Shh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Shh.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It stopped talking.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the lower...  When you're just sitting there and it's showing pictures and you have the time and it's in  the lower right there underneath the...  I think it's underneath the weather.  I saw it this morning.  I can show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, show us.  Oh, wait.  No, I can't.  No, you can't.  It's attached.  Well, I have to have a photo that's not...  We don't need it here.  We have clean air here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, shut up.  We need it here.  I can tell you that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, here.  Oh, wait.  It's not showing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's now just a photo.  Damn.  It's because you moved it.  Damn it.  I know what I was trying to do.  I'll back you up on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll back you up on that.  Okay.  Thank you.  Oh, here it is.  You want to see it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  If you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See that green bubble at the bottom?  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's green.  It's good.  It's clean.  It's green.  It's clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's good.  is why I was just...  Oh, I thought this was on the pixel on your phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is on your...  No, no, you have to have one of those.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have any of those in your house.  You don't like those.  I didn't say I don't like them.  This is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You don't want anybody listening.  I don't really need it.  Oh, yeah, you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't know you need it.  Yeah, you do.  You know why you need it?  Because Amazon is getting so chatty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If I hear one more, I'm like, set an alarm for...  Did you know?  Sorry, that was just me.  I just get everything.  It's like, by the way, and I'm like, argh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't want to hear your by the ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, we had Carl Bodie on Twitter and he was great.  Thank you for recommending.  He was so cranky.  I love him.  He's like really great.  Oh, I adore him.  That cranky is all love.  I think we're thinking of getting him on Twig because I think, Jeff, you're going to be  taking a week off in a week or two.  You can see my father this week.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I thought Jason came to me and said, will you be on Twig?  And I thought, oh good, Stacy was on.  It's my turn now.  I love this.  I'm at the grownup table and I didn't listen to the date.  So I was all ready.  I told my wife I'm not going to be able to make dinner last Sunday.  I go into the rundown.  I'm adding.  Oh, it's not you.  And then and then I suddenly see I got preempted.  I'm not at the table.  No, I'm not there.  It wasn't.  I thought I did something wrong.  No, we booked ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I bought it.  Yeah.  Well, that's going to be a really good one.  I hope you can make it.  September 26th.  It's a I'll be back from Florida.  It's a week from Sunday.  And the reason it's going to be kind of a journalist roundtable, Dan Gilmore from the  formerly the same as a Mercury News, but but he's been working at the Walter Cronkite  School in Arizona on journalism.  So and Stephen Levy, who is kind of my personal hero of what he calls slow journalism, he  wrote several of the quintessential textbooks, including Facebook books and his Facebook  and Google books are great anyway.  So that's going to be an interesting twist.  Even Dan Gilmore and Jeff Jarvis.  That's going to be I hope there's no news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  White men do journalism.  I'll see myself out.  I'm just throwing it out there.  I'm like, I have thoughts on all of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would you like to join us that week?  You can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would not like to join you that week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we would love to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, I'm good.  Thank you.  But, you know, if you could find someone.  Shea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last Sunday, we had three.  I mean, we had Carl, but we had two women on with Carl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I believe you.  I'm just saying that they all come from a certain era and a certain time.  My era.  And maybe not just there are.  It's old journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's old journalism.  Yeah.  No, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just there might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll get a TikTok star on with us and that'll round out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Under the desk news is very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Under the desk.  Do you know who that person is?  No.  Is that on TikTok?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you not follow Under the Desk News?  No.  It is excellent.  It's journalism on TikTok.  Go check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it just Under the Desk?  Oh, yeah. Under the Desk News.  Yeah.  There you go.  Wow. 1.2 million followers.  Here, let's just play a little bit of Under the Desk News.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To apologize for scaring the crap out of some of you this morning, I will now give you some  of the most unusual headlines related to coronavirus of the vaccine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's literally under the desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will also write you a religious exemption if you donate to his church.  Then the Pope came out and encouraged Catholics to get the vaccine.  I found this at CBS.  They're claiming that hypertonic nasal flushing can help reduce the symptoms of viral load.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually used that, but I didn't see that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The zoo in Baltimore is one of 70 in the United States that will begin vaccinating their animals.  A 64-year-old man who had escaped prison in Australia turned himself back in saying because  of the Sydney lockdowns, he can't find any work and he doesn't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  We don't have to do the whole thing, but that's good.  I'm subscribing right now.  That's great.  What pronoun?  I shouldn't assume that's she.  I was just going to suggest, yes.  They, them.  Sorry.  They, I apologize.  I had to check the profile.  Cool.  Under the Desk.  And they actually are under the desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or they, they do above the desk news for, is it Fridays?  They, they do above the desk at the, at nighttime is for the Elizabeth Holmes trial.  And then they have, oh, I got to watch that for fun news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's a little, it's like a little gossipy kind of, you know, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They do a really good job of reporting the headlines, providing not much context.  This is much more like people who don't want to know what's going on, but doing it in a  way that feels friendly and then also connecting to the audience.  So the stuff actually about their coverage of leaving Afghanistan was excellent, I thought,  because it was very much dedicated to, or like talking to the veterans and just, if  you, if you follow them, you'll see what happens.  It's, I think they do a really good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should really get them on that show with a bunch of old white men.  That would be very fitting.  And now, and you know what?  They could do it under the desk because we've got lots of room.  I can even raise the desk so that, in fact, let's all be under the desk now.  The rest of the show, see, two can play at that game.  The rest of the show will all be under the desk for the rest of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could do mine under the desk, but my camera's still going to go all the way up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So your forehead is above the desk, but the rest of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right now Mr. Burke is cringing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, I'm over here.  No, Mr. Burke's not cringing.  He's actually taking a nap under the desk.  That wouldn't surprise me either.  All right, let's get back to the news at hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I come out now?  Yes.  What is he doing?  You don't have to be under the desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I automatically moved you all under the desk.  He's really under the desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  Mic move so I can do that.  Google, I was going to do this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What else were we working on?  I got distracted.  South Korea finds Google for abusing smartphone dominance.  South Korea, of course, the home of Samsung.  Samsung.  Samsung.  $177 million fine is not going to break the bank.  Samsung, by the way, uses Android.  But the fine is for hampering the development of rivals  to Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I didn't understand that.  If this is, what is it, AOSP Android,  that means it's out there and available for whomever  to do what they want with it.  So how is that considered hampering?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what Google does do, and I think  this is not inappropriate, but that's my personal opinion,  they have Android.  There is the Android Open Software, AOSP,  which anybody can use for free.  But you don't get access to Google Apps or the Google  services if you do that.  To Google Play.  To Google Play.  So Google strongly encourages people to,  because you can't have access to services, including  the store, to use their version of Android.  And if you are going to use their version of Android,  you have to put the store, Google services, the Google  Apps, all of that stuff.  Google's anti, they call this the anti-fragmentation  agreements.  The Korean Fair Trade Commission said the AFA agreements  with manufacturers like Samsung and LG, which  was out of the business, by the way,  prevented gadget makers from developing  or using modified versions of the Android OS that  does not prevent them.  The Watchdog banned Google from forcing manufacturers  to sign AFA contracts, ordered that it modify existing ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is it more so that Google forced them or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The market forces them.  The market says, because you can, for instance,  that's what China did.  They just, you know, they don't have Google services  on their phone.  Yeah.  Not as desirable, in my opinion.  I agree.  The Google Quantum computer.  I don't know.  No.  Why are we giving up on Google's quantum computer?  We did that story.  This is just a story.  But this is another one saying how it's going to change.  They made another time crystal.  Oh, great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  Appreciate it.  Nice.  Thank you.  I still won't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now we have two.  That's good.  We need all the time crystal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They had a good story on quantum computing that was actually  pretty accessible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not worried about not understanding it.  I'm worried that it is kind of out of the reach of science.  I suppose maybe we'll solve it someday.  But scientists are glad to take government research funds  and build beautiful labs like that Google Quantum Lab  because, hey, free money.  And I guess it makes sense that the government should  be funding this kind of research.  Because what if the Chinese come up with one before we do?  Right.  But I don't think anybody's going to come up with one  anytime soon.  But I'm not an expert in quantum computing.  So I'll just someday one of these days  we'll get somebody's really up on this,  like a real person doing it.  And we can just kind of say, really, come on.  Oh, the D-Wave guys will come on.  What if the real person doing it doesn't want to be on air?  Say again, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The D-Wave guys will come on and talk about quantum computing  until your hair falls out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but are they actual quantum physicists?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've been doing it.  They've been building an actual quantum computer  for the last 20 years.  But see, I feel like, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These things are not stable.  They're very hard to get in.  I mean, it's very confusing to me.  It doesn't seem like they're able to make  these do anything useful except make time crystals.  Yeah.  But we'll get the D-Wave guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can it hard boil an egg without water?  That's what I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the real question is could it do things like  break RSA encryption?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, it could break RSA encryption.  If it's ever worked.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're actually only a few years out, theoretically.  We've been a few years out for several decades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my issue with this.  Sat in the paper with his office.  Wow.  It's been a few years off for a long time.  A few years.  For more than a few years.  Google is facing an EU antitrust investigation  over whether it may be a similar problem, whether it may  be forcing device makers to install Google Assistant  as the default voice assistant on Android.  This is just an investigation, though,  that will keep you posted.  There's always investigations going on  in this kind of thing.  Do you want to talk about Germany's sovereign cloud?  I figure it's got the word Germany in it.  It's a Jeff Jarvis story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just, it was just kind of a quick take mention that.  That was a Stacy story because it said cloud.  How are they going to do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With Google.  I thought it was an ant story because it said sovereign.  Sovereign.  How are they going to do it?  They're going to do it with Google.  Actually, it's interesting because it was Microsoft  and Satya Nadella who kept talking about sovereign,  sovereignty in his last speech at one of the Microsoft  developer conferences.  And I really took that as an indication  that Microsoft was going to reach out to individual countries  and say, look, we will provide you with servers.  You can keep it all locally.  This is something Microsoft fought for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But it's reality because so many countries actually

Transcript:  put these laws into place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Big new undersea cable.  Did you see the, I keep seeing this picture,  it cracks me up, of the Grace Hopper cable coming up  on the land in the UK.  It's a transatlantic cable.  This seems kind of low tech when I look at this picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, how do they do the last mile  to get the cable from the ship?  Apparently with a bulldozer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do they surf it in?  Don't overthink it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So these used to be so insecure in the sense  that literally they would end at these little huts  on the beach that had a padlock on it,  like a wooden hut with a padlock on the door.  So they've upped the security.  But even like a decade ago, you could  visit some of these places and you'd be like, oh, look.  There's the termination point for an eighth of the internet's  traffic coming from Europe.  And you're like, there it is just on a beach in New Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're getting to that silly season, the phone season.  We had an Apple event yesterday.  Remember I talked last week that some rumors and maybe even  that Google video tip that maybe Monday they  would announce the Pixel 6.  It did not happen.  Probably it's going to be later next month.  But they are starting to hype it up with the videos  and so forth in Japan to promote the idea that the new Pixel 6  will have a Google designed processor system on a chip.  They're selling Google original chips  in a Google's Google salty flavor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, we need those.  We need those.  Come on, Google.  Send us some, Google.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Leo got doughnuts.  What do you want?  You can't give me a whole show about you.  You can't give them the chips.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeez.  They just salty chips.  I don't really care if they're like some vinegar too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google, you can't do better than that.  Just salt.  Just salt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, I have to say this year I am.  I'm going to skip the iPhone.  I'm going to buy the Pixel 6.  Just give it a try.  We'll see.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Well, the other thing, I bought an iPad mini  and I could use that as a phone if I get desperate.  And I still have the old iPhone, so I'm probably really not.  Well, because there was basically nothing new, right?  There wasn't that much to get excited about.  The cameras look pretty good.  But you want to get it instead and take some pictures with it  and do some stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The Pro looked quite fascinating to me  just from the camera standpoint.  The rest of the OS, I am not an iOS fan.  I'm just not.  But what they did with their photography side of the stuff  looks pretty daggone good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's got to the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's computational, like the focus pull and stuff.  But I would still like to see that coupled with Filmic Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has actual optical zoom.  A total of 6x over the three lenses.  They're very fast lenses now.  The standard lens is 1.5.  Oh, 1.5.  That's pretty fast.  Very large pixels.  I think one and a half microns.  So I think these are getting...  What's interesting is for a long time,  you would have a real camera because of the,  you could have zoom lenses, multiple lenses,  multiple focal lengths, you could control aperture.  You had a lot more control over it.  You had macro.  Now all of that stuff's being put in a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, the macro is what got me.  To be able to put your device that close to your subject,  to be able to get that one-to-one...  Two centimeters.  Oh man.  Two centimeter focal length.  I want to see that.  Because if I want to do macro,  I have to put these extension tubes on my camera  to get close and get that full frame.  Okay, I guess I'll buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  You talked me into it.  That was easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And we won.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know this is Disney and Google,  but that did fascinate me in their announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to try some close-up pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, what is Kenta flavoring?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think these are for the Japanese market.  I don't know.  I don't know what that is.  Oh, Kenta is a peach flavored powder drink

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  from fermented Japanese salt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It isn't just salt.  It's salts and peaches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google, just stick with the salt, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or just keep it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to, I should go get them.  Lisa, somebody sent Lisa,  this is like Santa's food week.  I don't know.  Somebody sent Lisa some Pokemon flavored Oreos.  What the hell flavor would that be?  This is what happens when you're in love, sir.  Pokemon flavored Oreos.  Come on.  Let's do the Google, you know.  Thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thing.  You know, the thing.  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's T minus one hour and counting.  We're getting closer to the inspiration for launch window.  And I should say window  because it doesn't have to launch exactly at that time.  It may not, but the launch window is exactly one hour away.  In the Google change log,  Google is hosting the search on 2021 keynote  later this month.  Every answer leads to a new question.  Wednesday, September 29th, 10 a.m. Pacific.  Maybe we'll, maybe we should do a live stream.  I don't know.  What do you think?  In the past, we haven't covered these because they,  but maybe we.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just silence.  No, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  I'll think about it.  I'll table that for now.  Hands on from Android police  with the Google assistant driving modes,  long awaited new home screen.  Because they're getting rid of the.  Android auto app.  Still have Android auto, which I have to say,  I'm not as fond of as a car Apple's car play.  Here's the new UI.  Yeah. Car plays much.  Well, what do you use, Jeff?  You, of course you use Android auto.  You need to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's this show called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I just use whatever I like and I like car play.  So there it is.  I don't know the assistant driving mode.  So this, I guess is the idea is it replaces  that Android auto app.  Well, it replaces it on the phone.  Yeah, you still have Android.  That's what's confusing.  You still have Android auto on your car screen.  So how do you get to this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, people who don't have Android auto, right?  If you have a car that doesn't have, you know,  it's not a fancy, fancy, fancy car like Jeff's, you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or it's like a Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or it's a, yeah, you know, I feel bad for Tesla people.  Oh, you're one of those.  I'm not you, Stacey.  Do you think?  She's putting my foot in my mouth everywhere I go.  Do you really like the media interface for the Teslas?  I feel like, I wish they had car play or Android auto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't love it, but I don't.  To me, that's a big negative.  It's not much time in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But she doesn't have the car for that.  For the media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have the car because it's fun to drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is fun to drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I also have, usually there's someone  in the front seat with me and I just work for my phone.  I usually play Spotify.  It supports Bluetooth.  Yeah, and Tesla actually supports Spotify now.  So it's a little bit better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One reason is a little issue.  One of my friends sent me a note saying,  I quit Club Twitter.  I said, oh, why?  He said, because it's not supported by Tesla.  I said, well, you can do it on your phone.  He says, no, it's too much trouble.  You gotta do a deal with the tune-in or something  so that I can, and it's like, well,  it doesn't work that way.  You gotta have your own private feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, you can have easy to use and convenient  and not in ad supported, or you can pay for things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a little weird that Elon is so not invented here  that he won't allow CarPlay and Android Auto.  It is a little weird.  It's not what I expected of him.  Yeah.  I mean, the reason is that those are getting updated faster  even than a Tesla is.  And they have more features and more apps  and I don't know.  Yeah, okay, so you could play quick.  Control freak concerns or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I will tell you, I love the Tesla's games  and because we're sometimes waiting,  we're waiting for a ferry and sometimes you get there  and you're like, you missed it.  And so you're there for an hour.  Stacey?  Or like 45 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no such thing as ferries.  You're gonna be waiting a really long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Everybody clap their hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're waiting for a ferry, everybody.  Google Photos will now ship individual prints  directly to your door.  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't they do that already?  They advertise that all the time.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now you can order prints of specific photographs  and getting shipped to homes in the US  for as little as 18 cents plus shipping.  Instead of a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, okay, so, cause they sell you books.  That actually might be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, maybe they didn't sell prints.  They didn't sell prints.  So this is like, instead of going to Costco,  you can just get a print.  Right.  Instead of the book, you get the same print.  What it costs, like the big box stores  are like 11 cents a print, right?  So this is a little pricey, but I bet they're good quality.  If you can't wait, you can also get your photos printed  for same day pickup from your local CVS, Walgreens,  or Walmart in the US.  Or 7-Eleven in Japan, cause they sell everything.  Everything.  Four by six, five by seven, or eight by 10 prints  in the US, three and a half by five in Japan.  They also do canvas prints.  And of course they still do photo prints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually have ordered a canvas print from Google Photos  and it turned out really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love them.  We've been printing on metal and glass as well as canvas.  Ooh, metal.  Yeah, I did one on metal.  If it's the right photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Contrast, yeah.  Yeah.  It needs some contrast for a metal print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has to be the right photo.  But it really, if you've got the right photo,  we've got some beautiful metal photos.  And which is nice, cause when they get knocked off the wall,  you don't break.  It's clank.  What the hell was that?  Oh, the photos.  No.  This must be Jeff.  This must be Jeff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was rejoicing.  Dark mode.  I keep getting this notification  that I can get dark mode on desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it hurts my eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it does not.  Let me see if they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, there's a reason to do it.  If you do dark mode, like right now,  if I switched to a light thing,  suddenly my face is like super bright, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You have a nice fill light.  Jeff keeps asking why he's pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't play to my ego.  My vanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Vanity, Jeff, come on.  I'm pink anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What does it matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look how nice that Google search looks  with all the dark mode behind it.  Look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ooh, that really makes the label or the animation pop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Google doodle just really sing, doesn't it?  Doodle.  That's what it is.  Celebrating Dr. Idola Maria Roday.  But what does she do?  She was a Panamanian nurse academic  and organizational administrator  who founded the National Association  of Hispanic Nurses in 1975.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was like the, it was like the Kardashian  at the Met Gala.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  When she dressed as a nurse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who was it who wore all black?  The whole black thing.  That was Kim Kardashian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I see it was Kardashian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dark mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought, well, no, we were confused  because we were talking about the Panamanian nurse  organizing, we were like, what?  She's not, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  He's living in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's yet another way to do a newsletter,  this time with Google's Area 120, their research arm.  They call it a muse letter  and it takes your Google Docs, Sheets and Slides  and puts them into paid newsletters.  Maybe you should do this.  I'll check that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I already read everything in Google Docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Muse letter.  Now you have to apply because it's a,  you know, it's request early access.  Publish, here's the example of what it looks like.  Publish with muse letter, public profile  for your content, features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can I just pay or do they want a cut of my ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Offer paid subscriptions to your content.  But you don't do paid though.  You do ad supported, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Can I bring in my email audience?  Can I get paid for my writing?  You can offer paid subscriptions.  Doesn't sound like that.  They must have Google ads in it, right?  What's the point of doing it  if you don't have Google ads?  I love it though that it works with,  you could publish any drive file as a blogger newsletter.  Yeah, that's awesome.  That would say, you know, you could do all the layout in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that saves a lot of cut and paste.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  I might request early access for that.  Let me request early access.  See if I can get it.  Google now asks you to join the Pixel Superfans  with a simple signup form, calling all Pixel Superfans.  Insider access, a VIP experience.  Maybe I should sign up for this  given I know I'm gonna be buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so I didn't realize I already am one,  supposedly, it's official.  I talked about me, I forgot I did this.  So then I said enter the community.  So I clicked enter the community.  Where does it take me?  Do you know where it takes you?  Where?  Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, that's bad.  Boo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ooh.  I can't believe I signed up for that.  Oh, I should have waited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, apparently I can't  because you have to get an invitation  to participate from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you just click on that link, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What link?  That's the whole point of the story  is that now anybody can do it.  That's what's changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've had it before, but now you can say I want to.  Got it.  Let's go to the Superfans form.  What do they wanna know?  First name, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Last name, Leo.  Email address, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's easy.  Thank you.  Some legal stuff to submit.  Leo.  Why do they ask my email address?  They already know my Gmail address, but I don't use that.  So I gave them a different one.  Thank you for letting us know you're a Pixel Superfan.  That's it, that's all I get.  Okay, so now you gotta.  And I didn't get an email yet or anything.  So I gotta wait for an email.  Go to the email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it mean you're gonna get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't get an email yet.  You think it'll be that quick?  They asked me to Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And then it asked me whether I'm a government official

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  member of the press  or an alphabet LLC or Google LLC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm all of the above.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm gonna lie.  You're a government official?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm the president of Club Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  Is that your new libertarian C-steading F operation?  Yes.  We're gonna.  Your seven dollars gets you into this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can buy a little.  Google One has added a new tier  for people who really need a lot of storage.  This would be for you, Ant.  Five terabytes.  Only 25 bucks a month.  Actually, that's not a bad price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  It's not bad.  So it's a buck 99 for 100 gigabytes,  two 99 for 200 gigabytes.  I do the $10 a month, two terabyte plan.  That's what I do.  Which is a lot.  So you're gonna.  I don't really need.  Oh, there's an easy.  So now you can even go.  How would you like?  I just want more terabytes.  10 terabytes.  How would you like that?  $50 a month.  So there's five terabytes is actually the new one.  In between the two and the 10, 25 bucks a month.  Which makes sense.  It's kind of linear.  I think that has something to do with the fact  that Google Photos is now using your storage up a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They knew all along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that's.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

The gantry is the arm is moving away,  which means the rocket is standing on its own.  So they are on schedule for a launch  at about 8 p.m. Eastern time.  Look at that.  Very exciting.  Stacy Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  I can't show this to you because I don't own one.  Just talk about it.  Yeah, this is also a little bit promotional  because this is my guest for tomorrow on the show.  But I don't care because it's amazing.  He's one of my favorite people ever.  So this is called Lucy.  This is a company in Colorado.  They built an add-on to a power wheelchair.  And so what you may not realize about power wheelchairs  is they cost like $80,000 and you're dumb as a rock.  Are you kidding?  Oh my God.  They're basically a battery, a joystick,  the chair and a seatbelt.  That costs more than my Mach-E.  Yeah, they're super expensive.  And they're also a huge risk for people.  A two and a half inch height differential  can actually just tip them over  because they're very top heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other day, Lisa was walking to the bank  and a guy was going, had a motorized wheelchair,  was going up an incline, got turned sideways,  slightly fell off.  She helped him.  He was okay.  I helped him back in.  And his sister was across the street.  She came running over and said, thank you.  I told him, don't leave the house without me.  Yeah, you're right.  This wasn't much of an incline,  but it's very easy to tip them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  10% grade.  Like that's totally crazy.  So these guys, this guy, his niece is in a power wheelchair.  And so they built Lucy, which is, it's $8,000,  but they combine a stereo camera, ultrasonic sensors  and millimeter wave radar.  Is this a smart wheelchair?  It's a, no, it's an accessory.  So you just strap this on your wheelchair and then,  so they're showing you the pieces,  and then it actually can detect when it should stop.  So just like your Roomba stops when it sees like a stair.  Oh, nice, nice.  And the interview was so great because he talks about like  how difficult it was to like find these sensors.  So if you're super nerdy and engineering like,  it's pretty cool.  But the other thing that I love about this  is they've also added radios to it.  So they're hoping to communicate with like  smart city efforts or something like Google maps.  So they can actually, this would be so cool.  It'd be like street view for anybody who's in a wheelchair  because you know, it's really hard to get that data.  So they want to like, so I'm telling everybody,  if you're at Google and you watch this,  like Google's already asking me like,  hey, is this restaurant?  Does it have a wheelchair ramp?  You know, and I'm like,  you could just get this automatically from this company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm really excited about it.  Okay.  And you're going to interview the founder tomorrow  on the IOT show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  He's my guest tomorrow on the IOT podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the luci.com, if you want to know more,  and then you've got to listen to the,  well, you should be listening anyway,  but the IOT podcast tomorrow.  Oh, this is so cool.  This is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a really cool, like,  and they've been working on this since 2017.  It launched February of this year.  It's like, I'm going to get all emotional for a second.  I love the IOT because it makes the invisible visible.  And there's no one more invisible than people in wheelchairs.  And by taking data from something like this  and sharing this, you give so much power to them.  And I,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hope he does well.  This is so great.  This is such a good idea.  It's not about,  That's my thing.  It's not autonomous wheelchair, but it helps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not autonomous.  It's just,  It makes it smart.  It stops before it like runs into things.  It even stops before it runs into people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And had that guy had this, he wouldn't have fallen over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's actually a really common problem.  They said since they launched,  they've saved 10,000 falls so far,  which is a lot.  And if you think about it,  a lot of people who are quadriplegic are in these.  So when they fall, they can't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a serious problem.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, that's great.  Using Intel RealSense technology.  That's really interesting.  Neat.  Thank you.  Boy, that's really inspiring.  And Mr. Jeff Jarvis, do you have a number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a few.  One, I want to mention Andy Slavitt.  Why do I know that name?  He's been our COVID czar.  Oh yes, of course.  So I think it's an important number for us all to know.  We are now at 12 billion doses in arms  are required to get the majority of adults vaccinated.  We stand at 5.5 billion, averaging 1 billion a month.  And he emphasizes that it's not about money  and it's not about even manufacturing.  It's about last mile distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting.  So I just wanted to-  So the vaccines exist.  And-  They're being made.  Yeah.  So it's not merely vaccine reluctance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's in this country, that's the problem.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, this is majority of adults in the world.  World, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, of course it is, yeah.  Yeah, so we were the obviously leading country.  We had the vaccines, we have the money,  we have everything was great, we have a little structure.  And now we're following way behind other countries  and they're getting way ahead of us.  So that's one.  Two, look what I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He got the Google pods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got on that for having gone through torture.  Why?  Why?  I broke them, they just weren't working.  Oh no.  And these are $99.  And-  Are these the Google pod twos?  Yeah, these are the new ones.  You can't even get the old ones now.  Yeah.  And so the only thing I'm finding about it is that  if my phone has to be in my right front pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not your left front pocket, your right front pocket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you have a metal hip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got a plate for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's got a plate in my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh man, all right.  Wait a minute, so it's like you couldn't be  in your coat pocket or?  Well I don't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your back pocket?  It's hot now, I don't have a coat on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the only pocket you have is your right front pocket.  You haven't tried other pockets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well no, I put it in my left rear pocket,  I put it in my right rear pocket,  I put it in my left front pocket.  It had to be in my right front pocket.  And then it doesn't cut out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay.  I would have just gone with the Jabra Elite, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had those and they broke on me.  These are a lot less expensive, they're only 99 bucks.  And they sound great.  99 bucks, they're more comfortable, they're better sound.  Meanwhile I want you to play a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they don't work as well.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What I feel like going back to work, line 142.  Back to the office with Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Many adults are going back to the office for the first time.  Come on, you'll see your friends again.  Luke, Rita, Mark.  No.  Oh look, there's Steve from accounting.  He's being dragged by his kindergartner as well.  You got your lunchbox?  Yes.  Have a cookie.  Hey, hey, hey, hey there, Frank.  What do we say?  Say hi to the miss.  Hi miss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's a little bit nervous.  I'm a little nervous too.  But we're going to have fun today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to draw spreadsheets.  We're going to have meetings about quarterly results.  I have to run by the way, we have arts and crafts today.  Can't be late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Fair enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Say, who wants a cup of coffee?  Come on.  Come on, Frank.  You can do it.  Going back to work.  It's not easy, but we all have to do it.  Bye, Frank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She'll be back later.  And all the kids are waiting out front for their parents.  How was it?  Super cool.  Look, I got to take meeting notes.  Wow, did you write that?  Yep.  Steve had a little accident, look.  Because you've been so brave.  We'll have spaghetti for dinner.  And watch the news.  Yes, what's on?  Mia, doorknots.  Oh, I don't know what that is.  Run, run, run.  I don't know what language it is.  This is dangerous.  Dangerous, is in dangerous.  D-I-W, I don't know who that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, dude had an accident, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's walking home in his underpants.  This happens, it happens.  You haven't been...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He didn't bring his spare set of clothing.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are they?  Your locker, your cubby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's cute.  Mr. Ant Pruitt, what do you got for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  First off, I want to say the photography workshop  that I am teaching at has been rescheduled  because it is going to be held in New Orleans.  Oh, I guess.  And we all know what just recently happened  in New Orleans.  So we were concerned about it being totally canceled,  but it has not been canceled.  It has been rescheduled to January,  I believe it's the 23rd is when it kicks off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm feeling better for you.  I think that's a good thing, Ant.  January 23rd, thank you.  I know it's awful, but I think it's going to be safer.  You'll have fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So if you're interested in checking out the workshop,  go to Wanderersphoto.com and go register  and we'll see you in New Orleans in January.  But my other pick is Dry Bar.  I don't know if y'all have ever heard of it,  but YouTube.  Is there hair dryer in place?  YouTube has the best algorithm.  It recommends comedy standup all the time to me  because that's what I like to watch.  And there's this place in Utah, I believe it's Salt Lake  and it's called Dry Bar.  And it's just a bunch of standup comedians.  And I think it's highly underrated.  And they had Greg Morton on one of their episodes.  He's a former NFL player, a former voiceover artist.  And he's like 67 years old now  and he's just doing comedy.  That's awesome.  And he's pretty dang funny.  So that's Dry Bar on YouTube,  but it's a lot of different comedians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You also go to drybar.comedy.com.  And guess why it's dry?  Cause it's in Salt Lake City.  It's in Salt Lake City.  So you can't even have a cup of coffee.  So enjoy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So right now I'd like to come out of my shell a little bit  and I'd like to act out a movie.  Now this will be two, two and a half hours long.  So some of you are still taking this seriously.  That's not gonna work out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love this guy.  He was on, what is it?  America's Got Talent, I believe.  He's cute.  He's got a lot of faces.  Yeah, he does a lot of facial expressions.  I think it was America's Got Talent.  They say he's a living cartoon character.  Yeah.  He did a lot of the Star Wars voices,  a lot of the comic book stuff.  Boy, it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You wouldn't think after,  it seems mostly if you've been in the NFL  that there's not a lot of second careers, right?  Right.  Exactly.  Insurance salesman.  Yeah, car salesman or television company.  Insurance salesman.  Here's one of his, let's do a cartoon character here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was an only child.  Let me tell you a little bit about myself.  I started out as a baby.  I actually used to do voiceovers for animated cartoons.  He's got a good voice.  For example,  please say thank you for the flower persimmon butter.  Hey friend, like wow, Scoob.  Hello, Jetson, you're fired.  Exit stage lab, right even though, hi, little lady.  I was an only child.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  I think we get the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's so good.  And you had one more?  You had one more?  One more.  Yes.  Since we were talking about fashion,  this made me think about, again,  Saturday was football Saturday  and it's a quite interesting day.  I got the recommendation about the docu-series  and then later on, my niece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you have a girl for the first time.  Yeah.  You're not used to this, are you?  You had two boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I affectionately call her little weirdo  because she embraces that.  I love her.  But while I'm down on the couch watching Southern Cow  get the heck beat out of him by Stanford,  she just sort of walks in  and just decides to have this conversation with me.  And she's asking this question.  She says,  hey, should I get a brown,  should I get brown or black wedges for my dress?  And I'm like, why are you wedging a dress  and what the heck is a wedge?  And she says, it's a shoe.  Poor Ann.  And she says, or should I get a high top?  And I'm like, why are you gonna wear sneakers  with a dress?  And she's like, no, they're high heels.  And then at that point, I just yelled for help.  Where's Queen Bruett?  Get Queen Bruett in here now.  Why are you asking me this stuff?  This is just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, poor Ann.  He's never had girls.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is gonna be interesting.  How old is she?  She's ninth grade.  I don't know how old that is, but that's ninth grade.  She's a freshman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  14 or 15.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're gonna have a lot of fun next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She's doing quite well.  I love her and I'm happy for her.  She's having fun at school  and having fun on the volleyball court and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, she's still doing that.  That's good.  Yeah.  And Bruett hands up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we're getting a little bit of breaking,  not breaking news.  Yes.  Just a moment here.  I just saw this.  It says seven hours ago, but I didn't see it.  Did you see what the Ryan Liza, Devin Nunes suit?  No.  The Eighth Circuit.  So Devin Nunes filed a suit for Ryan Liza.  Is this about his cow again?  Yes.  For a story that the judge ruled  that this original story in GQ was not defamatory.  However, after Nunes sued,  Liza tweeted to the original story  and the court said that was defamatory and actionable.  This makes no sense.  What?  But that constituted a repubblication of something  that he had been put on notice  that the person thought it was defamatory.  And so that's what happened.  This craziness is going on.  Have you heard about Pimmelgate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So in Hamburg, a person tweeted  at a politician calling him a Pimmel,  which is a way to say, somewhat politely, dick.  And so-  That's good, I'm gonna remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pimmel is polite for dick.  I'm gonna use that.  Do Pimmel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do Pimmel?  You Pimmel?  Do Pimmel?  Do Pimmel.  Do Pimmel.  You dick.  Do Pimmel.  Do Pimmel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so the police searched the place  where they thought this person lived.  In fact, they didn't live there, went elsewhere.  And so, it's against the law  and jury to insult a politician.  This is getting to be insane.  Oh, that's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's crazy.  But I don't, this is, where was the judge?  This is the-  Eighth Circuit, where is that?  Eighth Circuit?  Oh my God, this is the-  I tweeted a whole bunch of links to it.  Because why would something that's not defamatory  in a newspaper be suddenly defamatory  because it's in a tweet?  I know.  That's really interesting.  Well, I'd like to see the doctrine there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so I just thought that'd be of interest  to our little audience as we say farewell for another week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you, folks, just as a point of order,  if you feel like a news article is insulting or defamatory,  don't sue the newspaper.  Wait till they tweet it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then you got them.  Which of course they rarely do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And no one's half the battle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a crazy doctrine.  I'd like to know more about that.  We'll read more of that.  We'll talk about it next week.  Hant Pruitt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not quite.  So close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hant, what is on hands-on photography these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
