Are you being silent?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was like, Andy's being in trouble.  It is an audio program.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  If you nod, no one will hear you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I was like, Andy's being in trouble.  It is an audio program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you nod, no one will hear you scream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wasn't even nodding.  I was just kind of like, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to be great today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to ask you about South by in just a second.  Also joining us, so we were going to have Jeff from London, but it turns out, as one  would expect, that his Pixel C on London Wi-Fi is not a good mix.  So we're going to instead have somebody great, Danny Sullivan from Search Engine Land.  Always a pleasure to have you on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hi, Danny.  Good to be here.  I shall try to channel Jeff's curmudgeoning-ness.  Get cranky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the Golden Gate Bridge behind you there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  That's cool.  It's an old, like Disney sold them once.  It's like a monorail.  I got to put the monorail back up.  Oh, a monorail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's got to go through it.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have a monorail in your house.  Wow.  Yeah.  I can't even see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we see it just in case, you know, if a child comes strolling in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  My wife's all set to make that happen.  She's ready to lunch.  She's like, you're going to be doing a thing today?  I'm going to send the boys in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that was the best.  It was so funny.  We're talking about the BBC Reporter, which of course is old news now, but it's so funny  because on Twitter, it would be no big deal on any of our shows if kids come in.  We go, oh, who's that?  But on the BBC, of course, it's very serious.  He also, we found out, was not wearing dress pants.  Yeah, jeans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's not talk about the sweats on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he didn't want to stand out.  I don't want to let down my t-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see the Wall Street Journal?  They did a follow-up interview with them.  It was great.  And they tweeted today that their interview that they did with them afterwards has been  the most viewed thing the Wall Street Journal has ever had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that hysterical?  He's now, by the way, called BBC Dad.  Wow.  It's most successful piece ever.  Yeah, because everybody wants to know what's the deal.  There's his wife in the background grabbing the son who was on a roly poly thing.  And then the daughter.  The interview was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's talking about how he was like, he heard his daughter come in and he's trying to hold  it together.  He says, and then when he heard the baby roll, what he like, then I knew it was over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was over.  Any pretense of seriousness or dignity out the window.  The best take on it was Ben Thompson.  We read it on Twitter on Sunday, but Ben Thompson of Strutechery, who was in a similar situation,  deeply understood what was going on and he lost the whole thing beautifully.  So South By is in Austin.  And I heard a piece on 60DB today.  60DB's founder was in Austin and was lined up to go to TechCrunch's event.  The line was so long he couldn't get in.  The whole event is to show entrepreneurs to other anyway.  Couldn't get in.  So he goes down the line to see who's in this line.  They were all Austinites just looking for free food.  Apparently there's a spreadsheet circulating in Austin that says which parties have free  food.  And so he said there wasn't a single entrepreneur in the line for the TechCrunch party.  Are you one of those Austinites?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, I don't wait in line for anything.  Not because I'm snobby.  It's just because I'm like, eh, not worth it.  Ain't no time for that.  So this will be my 16th South By.  And this year I took it pretty easy.  So I can't tell you too many exciting things.  I can tell you about like Google's Project Jacquard jacket, which looks pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And is delayed even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very hard to put haptic feedback and silver fabric and to weave silver fabric  into a $350 jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did they have?  No, give them a break.  Did they have one?  Oh, look, here's the spreadsheet.  Free at SXSW.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it used to be that South By, this was a huge deal because like I remember when I started  going in the early aughts, nobody had food.  There was beer and wine and hard alcohol everywhere, but you could never get food.  Interesting.  But now it's really easy to get food.  Yeah, I see all these people complaining about not having an Uber and Lyft.  And I'm like, back in the day.  You had to walk.  You couldn't even get breakfast tacos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and of course, first of all, Austin's a great town.  And South By is more than SXSW Interactive.  It's a film festival and it's a music festival and it's an interactive festival over three  weeks.  It made its name in the interactive.  I mean, it used to be very small, right?  Just a few thousand people made its name in the interactive space after Twitter made their  debut there in 2006 or maybe it was 2007, 2007.  And then Foursquare the next year and maybe Goala, which is an Austin version of Foursquare.  And who else?  Meerkat, I guess a few years ago was all the rage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Meerkat, Highlight was one of the ones that everyone was like, for a while everyone was  like, I'm the breakout app.  You know, really, I love South By.  It is now it is mostly marketers talking to other marketers and I guess for Austinites  looking for free food.  Yeah.  And it's kind of sad.  And South By, the people who put it on have really started to like put the hammer down  on like having registered events close to the convention center as part of this way  to like crack down and get people here.  The other thing is Spotify wasn't here this year.  I didn't see a Facebook presence.  They used to have like a house or a bar they would rent out.  Samsung didn't have a big presence there.  They sent people.  So it feels very much like it's kind of drifting away in relevance for the tech scene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I saw that CNN had taken over an entire restaurant and venue and they did, by the  way, they were there.  Jake Tapper did some good interviews.  I thought this has become mainstream.  This is no longer a geek conference.  And I guess there's some very good seminars.  I know a lot of people, you know, people in our circle who had great seminars there, but  it doesn't seem to be what is South By these days?  Is it a party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's it's like a big party and some really intellectually cool content.  Like honestly, this sounds incredibly nerdy, but I have more fun going to the seminars  and the panels and not the big ones like Joe Biden and all of that.  It's more like the guy who kind of discovered the CRISPR gene editing.  Yeah, that would be great.  Talking about.  See, so there's that kind of stuff.  In previous years, I had gone to see like slack physicists talking about like beyond  Moore's law, how to use like the spin of electrons to make a transistor.  That's neat.  He's like, again, super nerdy, but there's also like very cool social stuff.  And there's cool stuff about like medicine and food.  But you kind of have to find it on your own.  And it's totally easy to get lost in just going to party to party to party party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it became a social event and less of a tech event, although I envy you because you're  in Austin, so it's easy for you to go.  And if I know, you know, it's hard to fly down there.  Impossible to get a hotel unless you arrange for it a year ahead of time.  So by being there, you could have stayed at Casa de Stacey.  Higginbotham.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would have printed out the list of commands so you could work the smart home.  Echo turn on the light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Make me breakfast.  So you saw the you saw the connected smart jacket or did they have one there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They had a prototype there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because they said they're going to be delayed a little bit, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  They're supposed to be spring of this year and now they're going to be fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is this is the jacquard technology that we were talking about at WW.  I'm sorry.  Google I.O. last year.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Was that last year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been a while.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel like it's been a long time.  It's cool.  A tap project.  So this is Levi's is going to.  Yes, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They still do.  They didn't sell a tap or anything.  So this is a denim jacket that's connected.  How?  I mean, all I see right now is he's tapping a button on the sleeve to play his music.  Big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It connects to your phone.  There's also so there's the jacket.  What's cool about Jacquard is actually that it's a way to make fabric that is conductive.  So silver infused fabric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so that's confusing video because it has a big plastic button on his cuff, but that's  not not so wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well so I'm not sure about that.  What it has is you add to that fabric.  It's got somewhere on there a pouch where you put electronics.  Right.  And that's what how quote unquote powers it.  I don't know if it's the pack is your smartphone or there's an additional.  Do you have to have a battery for your jacket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I read something that like you have a little cuff link thing that's part of it.  So like this little cuff link part.  That's that little silver thing.  And apparently that's the power.  It's a rivet.  Take that off before you wash it.  And I would always remember to take that off before I threw it in the wash.  I would never I would never wash it like this fit fit.  Which by the way, these hold up really well in the wash.  I can attest to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The original ones did not because I washed three or four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so there's a plastic thing that you have to remove before you wash it.  That must.  OK, so that's a little there is a little battery in this.  I don't know.  Cost, by the way, three hundred fifty dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, I paid three hundred and fifty dollars for a wool coat that does nothing but keep  me warm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so you're going to run out and buy this when it comes out this fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I can't tell my left from my right, and I'm kind of excited by the idea of like  how to get back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, so I don't know why.  So it's not merely connective.  It actually buzzes and vibrates at you with the whole jacket or just part of it.  I think it's just the cuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm reading something that says it's just that cuff.  Yeah.  Like, big deal.  Why don't you just sell me like a cuff I can put on my jacket?  I'm more fascinated by the knowing the left and right because I'm that way, too.  And my son's that way as well.  And it was great.  I really I don't know. Yeah.  No. When I was teaching him to drive, I would say go left.  And he meant I meant to go right.  But he interpreted me telling him to go left and going right because he was getting  mixed up. It was great.  But I'm ready for a support society.  And do you think society can help of being a geeky that like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because in the real world, most people know they're left from their right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did you. Did you lose this over time or did you have it and lose it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I always I'm always like it weren't for the Pledge of Allegiance.  I'd be lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the thing. If you wear a ring, you know, that's you know,  that's your ring hand or something. I mean, somebody that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I wear that.  I'm like left. I think it's a brain thing.  I really do. I always say make a make a Stacey if I'm driving.  So then that means make a left or make somebody whoever my passenger is.  Make a Stacey. So that's my project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So make go go my way and or go your way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then when I drive a driver or a passenger in Britain,  it would get confusing because I would drive there and I would always just think  of left turns as dangerous turns and right turns a safe turn.  So then my wife would tell me to turn right and I would think, oh, turn right.  That's the safe turn. But then I start to go left. But she's no. I said, go right.  She scream and howl and go, ah, we're going to die.  Manage to survive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. So there's the jacket of of perhaps dubious value.  What else did you see? Anything else?  South by that you that we could we forced lobs.  It's not over yet. Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's only halfway through. No, I didn't.  How did you survive without the Ubers and lifts without Uber and lifts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say I don't even know how you survive.  How are you getting around? It's so hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the very first day Sunday.  The two local ride sharing services had problems, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the first day was actually Friday. OK.  And we had really terrible weather, like so when earth sorry on Saturday.  Like it was raining and cold the whole day, so all of the ride shares were overwhelmed.  And we have four of them.  And and like I got down and it was like to ex surge pricing, so nothing terrible.  And then, yeah, so Saturday night was really hard for people.  I have a friend who actually took a ride in some stranger's car.  I was just like, don't do that.  Yes, she just she just walked in.  It's like this guy is like, oh, I'm an independent ride sharing service.  Do you want to ride Christmas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Christmas scene, I was saying I wanted to hail an Uber.  I couldn't. So I just called a cab and then two other people got in the back.  And I said, we've got the way Chris used to be on the Uber board.  We've created Uber sharing and then it drove off.  So that's that's you know what? That's awesome.  That's great. So ride Austin is the big one, right?  Is that the big local ride sharing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ride Austin is the big one.  Then there's Fasten, which is I think gives more money to the drivers.  And then there's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fair. So apparently,  Fasten got really slow on Saturday night.  The busiest hour of the busiest night.  So because of that, people moved over to ride Austin,  which then crashed for several hours, five hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Austin's app was terrible. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so all this did is tell all the geeks from Silicon Valley,  aren't you lucky you have Uber?  Ryan Hoover of Product Hunt tweeted, spent an hour trying to find a ride.  Austin is broken without Uber or Lyft.  Other ride sharing apps aren't working and all the taxis are full.  He was a wet mad as a wet hen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Slate actually had a great article talking about this.  And the key point that I thought was so awesome about it was these people,  the people coming in, it shows how.  For well off people, transportation isn't broken.  They never think about public transport, and that has huge implications.  That's right. For cities. That's right.  And maybe this is a little fairy tale, but I actually thought that was  a really good point that people complaining about.  That's exactly right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the same thing with health care, by the way.  Politicians don't ever have to take subways or worry about health insurance.  So it really changes their perspective on the whole thing.  And what's really sad, you look at a city like LA where,  for whatever reasons, you could talk about all the conspiracy theories.  They never really got a very robust message.  They never really got a very robust mass transit system.  It became a car culture and it makes it, it's a horror.  It's not a very good city because it's spread out so much because of all the cars.  And so you really could damage a city.  Then you look at New York, which is forced to coexist on a small island.  And the subways were built before politicians came around or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although it's even harder with LA because it's not.  It's like LA is one of something like 70 cities in the greater Southern California area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hard to get any. It's an hour to get anywhere because you have to drive on  congested freeways that are congested 24 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People, you know, I know the people.  I mean, we don't have it here in Orange County, but the growth of the metro in LA  has become so strong that now people are complaining they can't get on.  There's not enough cars. So it's so popular.  Ironically, it's been successful to the degree that now they're losing people  because they can't accommodate them all.  I don't know if that's successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are trying to do light rail, right?  And I think the buses are getting better.  I mean, I think there's some movement to get some mass transit in LA, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's huge. No, I mean, there's been huge.  LA has got a huge mass transit system now.  That's what the Metro light rail system is all about.  And the whole thing where you can go down to the ocean, you can ride all over the way.  They keep adding and adding and adding more to it.  But that's been the problem.  It's actually become successful to the degree that they can't accommodate the people  that keep coming onto the network as it's grown.  So now they figure out how do they handle adding on even more cars.  Good.  But the high speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you said cars, you didn't mean automobiles. You meant train cars.  Train cars. Yeah, that's what I meant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Yeah, they're so full that they have to leave without people being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good.  All right. Any you're doing a panel on what, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, intelligent living in the smart home.  It's got Amazon, Sonos and SmartThings.  Oh, fun.  And you know what? I'm going to ask them about what the Amazon Sonos integration and when  that's going to happen. Yes, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Spine, please. I hope you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm like, I'm more excited about one as opposed to the other.  Yeah, they're not going to talk too much about spying, but it's worth a shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's really the question.  Will they talk more about spying or the Sonos integration?  I'll give them that choice. I'll be like, here's your topic.  I think they haven't talked much about either ever since last year.  Well, that'll be fun. Good.  So you're doing a panel and do you have any, is there any way we could see that?  Do they stream those now or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They stream some of them.  I guess I should figure that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I'd love to watch it.  I just meerkat it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I'll do.  Well, now I'm looking, I went to South by Southwest.com slash live and they are doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  live streaming of, you know, limited conferences, actually conversations.  It doesn't look like seminars. You know, they want you to pay the seminar fee.  So I'd be very surprised if they'd stream any of those panels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there are some things that they feel are going to be popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Let's see. You're on Wednesday or Thursday.  You're on Thursday.  So they did a preview of Alien Covenant.  Now you have very quick eyes and Buzz Aldrin was there, the Wu Tang clan, Chuck Todd.  Tang.  Dang. Ray Kurzweil, Steve Case.  All right. Let's go to Thursday.  Somehow I don't see Stacey on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Steve Case is there everywhere.  I know.  Steve is here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Founder and Chief Strategy Officer for Dot Blockchain Music and Pledge Music.  Art installation.  Noya. Yeah, they're not streaming much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Next week they'll stream.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Do they?  I'll tell you all about it.  Do they ever? Oh, so okay.  You could do if you go to their YouTube channels, they put past videos up.  So you might maybe we'll catch Stacey later.  That would be really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or you can come on down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on down.  If you're in the Austin area, or even if you're not, come on down.  I like staying at the Driscoll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  That's my favorite hotel.  Yeah.  And I know the secret entrance to get past the line.  Very good.  You go downstairs, you walk across, you go up all the ways around,  you come down the back staircase and then you're in the bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That must be annoying to native Austinites like you, Stacey, that all of this tech people say,  oh, I know my way around Austin.  No, I mean.  Hey, if it weren't for South By.  It doesn't bother me at all.  It's good for Austin, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, exactly.  I'm like, do I find South By a little bit annoying?  Yes. Do I, am I mad at it?  No, because it brings like $150 million.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you close enough to town that it, you know, ties up your traffic and stuff like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's pretty localized to downtown and I'm about 12 to 15 minutes away.  Oh yeah. So you're fine.  Yeah.  I just, like I sometimes am sad because I'm like, oh, I want to, I'm downtown and I can eat at this  place and then it's already taken over by South By.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Three weeks a year.  Three weeks a year.  Austin is a really fun city.  You've got Alamo Drafthouse.  Some of my greatest memories are in Austin's crowd surfing at Stubbs, things like that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember you one year walking around with what looked like a Ghostbusters backpack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly it.  And I had a camera on a staff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, like eight different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was like the Doonesbury character with the transmitter on my back.  Yeah. That was fun.  Nice.  Well, you know, I've only been to South By two or three times and  I was told before I went the first time by Robert Scoble, he said, well, it's really the main point  of South By and consider the source is the parties.  And so I was prepared to go and cover the parties and that was the remote unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, that's, and that's true.  I mean, consider your source here.  I'm a giant, huge nerd who's actually like into tech.  So I'm like, oh, I want to go to crazy talks by physicists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. No, but I'm with you.  That sounds really cool.  That I would do.  I only went to one panel.  It was Mark Cuban's panel a few years ago.  He started talking and he came off the biggest jerk ever.  And then the fire alarm went off, cleared the room.  And Lisa and I looked at each other and we said, yeah, let's not go back.  So that's it.  That's my only South By Southwest seminar experience.  Let's take a break.  Come back with more.  We're going to talk about Google.  More Google.  We got all sorts of good Google stuff, including Google's new futuristic headquarters.  They get the go ahead.  Recapture just got invisible, invisible recapture.  And are you ready?  Are you going to buy the new Google digital whiteboard?  What do they call it?  The snap jam schniggy back.  What do you jam board?  What?  Five, a $5,000 TV from Google.  Before we do that, though, we were talking before the show about mesh.  And Stacey was schooling me on how mesh works.  And we were talking about the king of the mesh.  This is the company that brought mesh to the consumer space and is transforming Wi-Fi.  So many people nowadays are using, you know,  three or four or five year old Wi-Fi routers that aren't getting the job done.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Don't get a Wi-Fi router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get a super simple, hyper fast, brilliantly designed Wi-Fi system.  Get the Eero.  It's easy to set up.  You can set up in just a few minutes.  You download the Eero app and they walk you through every step of the process.  The units are attractive.  You don't mind having that in your living room.  There's a piece of tape on there.  You'll take that off.  In fact, you can even control the little blue lights on this.  And you can even say, hey, actually, I'm going to take that off.  Dim the light on my Eero.  But my favorite echo command for the Eero.  When you set up the Eero, you see all the devices that are attached to your network.  You can assign ownership to each of the devices.  So I went through our 14 year old's laptop and Chromebook and iPad and phone and game machine  and Xbox and PlayStation and I named them all Michael's stuff.  And now I could say, hey, echo, pause Michael's internet.  And we, Lisa and I continue to surf with impunity.  But Michael goes, hey, and we go, go to bed.  By the way, he cannot turn it back on again with the echo.  You have to use the app, which is even better.  It is amazing.  The Eero app lets you manage your network from the palm of your hand.  I set up my mom with Eero's because she was having trouble  because she has a studio that's out in the backyard.  It was hard for her.  She said, I can't go to the studio because I can't use my echo out there.  I can't use my iPad out there.  So when I was out a couple of months ago, I set her up, put the Eero's out there.  And now I can launch the Eero app and see how her network is doing.  I can manage it from here.  The other thing I think is really important to mention is the Eero is overbuilt.  It comes with more processor, more memory than it really needs.  And that is so it can be upgraded over time.  Features, performance can be improved with new software.  When they rolled out Mesh 2.0, it's like getting a whole new router.  Of course, WPA2 encryption, guest networks, all the features you want,  even some advanced features.  I have a server on my Eero network and I was able to set up port reservation.  So it always had the same port and port forwarding really nicely done.  The Eero 30-day money back guarantee.  And because it's their first birthday, they're celebrating  with permanently lowered prices.  If you've been waiting, you're in luck.  Three pack of Eero's, 399.  299 for the two pack.  So it's $100 off the three pack, $50 off the two pack.  It is a great deal.  You can also buy individual Eero's and expand your network as needed.  Eero.com or Amazon or Best Buy.  Eero, no more buffering, no more dead zones.  Finally, Wi-Fi that works.  Thank you, Eero.  Eero is a hero to people all over the country.  I hear from people all the time.  Never was able to get my Wi-Fi working.  And thank you, Eero.  There was an 8K VR ride at South By.  Did you do that, Stacey?  I wanted to do that.  No, I did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did not see the 8K VR ride.  Well, it's not too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not too late.  It's true.  Devendra Hardwar did a piece on it for Engadget.  There's Devendra.  And I guess it's a pretty, it's a bare bones thing because you're not wearing a headset.  They've got a circular 8K screen and you're sitting on...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, is this in the trade show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like it's on the show floor.  You're sitting on a servo-controlled hydraulic seat, which looks like it's made from,  I hate to say it, but maybe this is a prototype.  But don't those look like the plastic lawn chairs?  You know, you might...  I mean, I feel like...  Yeah, those are...  They might want to work on those a little bit.  I hope there's a seatbelt.  I think there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is like those rides at Disney or amusement parks where they stick you...  I mean, that's just what it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Universal has a great, has a number of great VR rides.  Danny, you must have been to Universal.  I love Harry Potter, baby.  That's Disney, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We hit Universal last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Harry Potter is just Universal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it?  Yeah.  Oh, it's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get to fly.  You know what?  I have to say, and that's the one where you put visors on, right?  Oh, except that no, no, they're 3D glasses because it's still screens.  It's still projection screens.  But you're in a...  You told me about it, Stacey, and then we did it.  You're in a chair that does move.  Yeah.  Does move as a lot of these 3D rides...  Crazy pattern.  But it also tilts you and you really feel like you're flying.  I love that.  I really...  That was one of my favorite virtual reality rides ever.  They also have a good Transformers ride that's a little bit older.  But I love...  You're right.  The Harry Potter, that's great.  Maybe it's because I had three or four butter beers before I got on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those things are disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The non-alcoholic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really disgusting.  Do not do the butter beer.  They were so gross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My husband loved them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're very sweet.  He must have a sweet tooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So last week we were talking a little bit about Google Cloud Next.  10,000 attendees.  Google says 100 announcements.  Three days of keynotes.  Holy cow.  This is the first time they've done a Google Cloud show.  And they've done cut downs.  They have the day one keynote in four minutes,  the day two keynote in five minutes,  if you want to just whiz through it.  But here's some of the announcements.  We mentioned this last week.  They acquired Kaggle, which is a big data company.  AppBridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Competition company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, competition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They run big data competitions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  Competitions.  Right.  A community of data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts.  AppBridge, which is some sort of enterprise migrate data  from on-prem file servers into G Suite and Google Drive thing.  Identity aware proxy for Google Cloud platform.  Data loss prevention.  Key manager.  Go on and on and on and on and on.  This is amazing.  I mean, that's a lot of stuff.  I wonder if this is now going to be as big as Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It would make sense.  They really got to amp their...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cloud's everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the focus on the enterprises can be so important for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was interesting for me because I hadn't been to the cloud thing before  and I haven't really followed Google's cloud efforts that closely.  And it was really...  It felt like this coming out party.  The keynotes were fairly...  And then I think the real highlight was at the end of the first one when  Eric Schmidt came out and he actually set this vision of...  Look, we have spent, I think he said, it was either $35 billion or $3 billion or $5 billion.  But it's like we've spent billions building this cloud platform.  And you could go build the cloud platform if you want and spend the same billions  or you can build on top of it.  For me, it was really this crystallization of Google saying, look, we have a cloud OS  and you can use our cloud OS and do awesome things.  And if you're trying to figure out whether or not you should be using the Amazon cloud  OS or the Microsoft cloud OS, ours comes with awesome machine learning stuff.  So what do you got to think about?  But I was kind of struggling getting a handle on the audience  because most of the stuff was pitched like we're trying to convince enterprises  they should build on it.  Yet the audience seemed to be made up of your typical Google developers  who are building stuff rather than the end clients, which I'm sure were there.  But when I would talk to people, they were mainly developers.  They're like, yeah, I'm building stuff on the Google cloud.  And I've got clients who want this sort of stuff or whatever.  But it was really interesting.  And I think at one point too, they said that Drive was coming up at 800 million users  or something.  So it would be their next one billion user, 800 million users.  It would be next to one billion user product.  And you can think like-  Is that paid users?  I don't think they said paid users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Paid and free, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, doesn't everybody who sends it for Gmail get a cloud Drive account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you get Drive.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I know that everybody has to use it.  And they have said that Gmail itself is a billion user type of thing.  So I guess the Drive is catching up.  And I thought one of the interesting things, I haven't played with it more,  was the whole Drive streaming thing.  Because I run into that problem where I've got 500 gigabytes of data on my main laptop  that's synced to the cloud.  And then I go traveling on my MacBook that it can only hold 250 gigabytes.  And it's like, so I can't sync everything from the cloud.  And now it's, I guess, one of the features is you can see all your files.  And then if you want one, you stream the files on demand.  So there's no more feeling like you have to have them all downloaded,  which is kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting what you say about the disconnect between the people who were there  and the people they thought would be there.  Because it sounds like this is more like a Salesforce style enterprisey pitch.  And instead, they got the Google I.O. crowd there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's hard for me to tell because there were thousands of people there.  And I talked to a handful of people.  And it might have been I was only catching developers.  But the pitch really was, especially on that first day,  like you had this guy from HSBC come out and like, yeah, we're HSBC.  It was like the low point of the whole keynote.  Right. I hate it when they do those things.  But still, but saying we're doing it.  Or you had...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, they said Colgate, Disney, eBay, HSBC, Lush,  Oden, Planet, Schlumberger, the Home Depot, Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they were saying like, and like Verizon came out and they're like,  we've moved to...  And then I'm also trying to process and catch up with the terminology  because Verizon is like, we moved to G Suite or whatever.  And you realize, oh, you're saying that you guys are using Gmail now for all your employees.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was excited about the Verizon thing.  And then they're not using the Office Suite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not using Gmail rather than Microsoft Office.  I get it.  But it was interesting because they talked about how like they're trying to get early  adopters and people going and convincing them they want to shift over.  And I was thinking, are you really having that much trouble getting people in your  organization who already use Gmail for their personal work to say, I want to use it at work?  It's like we had to...  Then certain people would convince people that the G Suite mail was great.  It's like, yeah, I think they knew it was great.  They're still working off of, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a real head to head though between Microsoft, Amazon and Google.  Those are the big three, right?  And I guess maybe...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google has had no luck or less luck getting enterprises even to look at their cloud offering.  Microsoft's kind of won.  And so with Diane Greene coming in, this to me feels like them creating something that,  yes, can meet the developer needs, but is trying to prove that they have  the support, the services, what you need as a company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Greene founded VMware.  She did the keynote, right?  She was keynote number one was Diane Greene.  So it's an interesting to bring in the founder and CEO of VMware to Google  and then put her up on stage.  The message is very clear.  We understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They bought her company for a lot of money.  Right.  They bought Diane Greene's enterprise cloud company for a ton of money just to get Diane Greene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although I don't think I made her happy at the press conference afterwards.  Would you ask?  Well, they had the press conference afterward and they're like, well,  Google Cloud, it's awesome.  Everybody should do it in a hikes head.  So Google kind of has this history of a company that disrupts and puts other companies out of  business.  So now you're telling these companies they should build stuff on your platform,  but how do you reassure them that this is a great thing to do because you're not going  to put it out of business?  You're like, we don't put people out of Google doesn't do that.  I'm like, I think you do, but okay.  So, you know, their message takeaway was no, I guess, you know, you can totally trust us  where Google and it would be fine.  But that was really kind of the challenge to me.  I mean, it was interesting, like, for example, that Snap has built so much of their business  on Google's platform when Google would love to be Snap.  Right.  And would love to have that audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a really interesting point because Microsoft probably people feel much safer  trusting Microsoft with their cloud stuff because Microsoft's probably not going to  be a competitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And perhaps even more so, I would say, with Amazon, although not that Amazon doesn't have  tentacles that go out, but, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Amazon pushes a lot of features to their cloud that kill their partners.  I mean, every year at AWS and VENT, everyone goes and they're like, are we going to be one  of the features?  Are we going to be the company that becomes a feature of AWS and gets knocked out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of the nature of ecosystems.  You're, you know, you're hoping you could be a little fish and survive with the big  fish around.  It's like being a remora-e.  I think more interesting.  Go ahead.  But I think more interesting for...  Stacey.  Go on.  Go on, Danny.  No, I'm going to be the arbiter.  Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a delay on the IAPL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can tell you got a delay and that's hurting a little bit because, yeah,  you're a second behind us.  No, it's not your fault.  We'll fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, but now I forgot what I was going to say.  Oh, I remember the issue with Google is I think one of longevity for features and platform  things that you like because Google is not shy about saying, eh, this sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll cut anything.  Yep.  Well, just look at their message, the mess of messaging that they're making.  And of course, they announced Meet at Next, which is...  What is Meet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's their Slack.  Oh, I'm so sad about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why?  What is it?  So it's Hangouts Plus.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's yet another messaging app because you need it, but this one is for Teams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Slack has text, but Meet is really about video.  So it's the Hangouts video bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think you get text as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  And you get remote access too?  Is it like a go-to-meeting kind of thing where you have video meetings and you share  screens and that kind of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess.  I haven't explored it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dialing.  They've got dialing phone numbers integrated with G Suite connected to meeting rooms.  And you're right, Stacey, that there's always this fear that, well, this is, you know...  If you were an enterprise who had relied on Hangouts, you might be very nervous.  What's going on with Hangouts?  And then for a while Hangouts was on the outs and now it seems like they're adding features  to Hangouts and I don't know.  But for me...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's clear that Google is...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Go, Danny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We need like in the expanse where when they're talking to the moon, it always says in the  corner, one second delay or talking to Mars.  Pretend you're talking to Mars.  I was going to say, for me, for someone who doesn't watch the cloud stuff that closely,  my big takeaway was really like, wow, the cloud has always felt so nebulous.  And to the degree that I've thought of it, it's like you store your pictures up there,  right?  Or other things.  Right.  I know, but that's been my main interaction with it.  And I really kind of came away with thinking, wow, you know,  these aren't clouds.  These are OSs.  This is Google OS versus Amazon OS versus Microsoft OS.  And they've got the Azure names and the Microsoft AWS.  But these are...  It's software as a service.  Systems that run in the cloud rather than on your desktop that people are developing for.  And it's just going to be this fascinating thing to watch how people  choose which of those operating systems they want to build their businesses on.  Which survives going forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think some of the resistance...  And I'm not an enterprise expert, but I do watch...  I do play one on TV.  I watch people in enterprises and I actually own an enterprise.  I think enterprises which at first were reluctant to put their business processes  up there are getting much, much more comfortable with it.  And there's a lot of advantages to it.  And then some of it goes down to, well, we've always been a Microsoft shop,  so we're going to give our business to Microsoft.  Google and Amazon have to fight a little bit harder to get that business.  But there are so many advantages.  For a long time, for instance, we used QuickBooks accounting locally as an app.  But it makes much more sense to use it in the cloud as a software as a service instead of...  But that's the other thing to point out, Danny, is you don't have to go all...  It is an operating system, but you can piecemeal it.  You can treat it as, well, I'm going to use QuickBooks and Google Mail.  And maybe I'll use a Microsoft Office.  You can piecemeal it from all three providers.  You don't have to go with one provider.  Do companies do that?  I would imagine...  We do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  If you're...  Well, if you're talking about running different suites  and buying software as a service from different providers, sure.  But if you're talking about architecting a business process or some back-end system  in the cloud, you pick one because you're going to optimize for costs.  The way you architect your system, it will depend on how on the platform you are,  because maybe...  And this gets into things like databases and who charges what for what.  But this is not something that you just redo overnight.  It's actually a big investment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's where I'm not familiar with how big enterprises do it.  For instance, we're a company with about 25 employees and a bunch of contractors.  We use Gmail, Google Docs, but some people are using QuickBooks.  Some people are using Office.  It's a real hodgepodge.  We use HipChat.  But Microsoft with its teams is trying to win that Slack-HipChat business.  But I think there are a lot of enterprises that use Slack.  Slack is a unicorn standalone app that you just integrate into whatever your other cloud is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think it's the difference between whether or not you're using cloud applications  or using cloud to develop your platform on.  That's right.  So Stacey said work.  Probably not going to mix and match.  But just because your business app runs, say, on Google Cloud doesn't mean that your business  might not also use Slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our business app runs on Azure.  Oh, and Drupal.  That's so true.  So our production workflow runs on Drupal servers on a company called BlackMesh.  That's our cloud for production.  So I mean, we're a mess.  And the reason is, I think like a lot of companies, you did it all piecemeal.  So we use HipChat for messaging.  Yeah, sure, we could go to Microsoft's Teams because we're using Microsoft Office  or we could use Hangouts because we're using Google.  But we're already in Slack.  And I bet you a lot of companies that did a piecemeal, sure, if you're going to  re-architect your business process, you're going to say, go to Microsoft and say,  let's build it all on Microsoft.  But most people do it bit by bit, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, large companies will do these IT consolidation efforts.  And these are like two year.  Millions of dollars.  Millions and millions.  So it depends on what you're talking about.  And some of them, you know, I was at when I was at Time Inc, you know, we used Slack.  And then we also like kept adding like Trello and random other things.  Yeah, see, piecemeal bit by bit.  But then as I was leaving, they wanted to consolidate a bit and suddenly you weren't  allowed to use certain apps anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So to me, every time they do that, there's this productivity hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's also you're not paying for license fees.  You're assuming that you can get it.  You can regain the productivity hit somewhere else.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know nothing about enterprise.  I hated the enterprise IT world.  Me too, too.  I shoo that.  Let's talk about CAPTCHA.  Everybody hates CAPTCHA.  Nobody likes CAPTCHA.  If you're a robot, go ahead and try to figure out this number.  The problem is robots probably do a better job than humans.  And if they're of dubious security value, in fact, we've seen things like people would  create an adult website that has a CAPTCHA to sign in, except it's not really their CAPTCHA.  It's the CAPTCHA on some banking site and they're just getting humans to solve it for them.  And that's the whole purpose for the adult website, things like that.  Google bought a Carnegie Mellon tool called ReCAPTCHA.  Remember, ReCAPTCHA was a great idea because you got two words, one of which  helped with book scanning and one of them was actual CAPTCHA.  But even that's so annoying.  So now they've said, we don't really need CAPTCHA.  Well, guess what?  Google knows a lot about you.  And they know so much about you that they could pretty much tell if you're a human or a bot  just from how you use the computer, from your cookies, from your history.  And so if you're trustworthy, you won't even see a CAPTCHA.  And if they have any questions,  that's where you get that little, you know, for a while they were just doing that little box that  says I'm not a robot and you check it and that was easy.  Now they don't even put that up anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's sad though.  This is great.  The loss of CAPTCHA's had it because I remember Luis Bonon, who I think is the author of ReCAPTCHA,  talking about how great it was that people who wanted to watch porn were helping better improve  the digitization of classical books.  At least they were getting something, right?  They were taking all these words out of books that they couldn't identify.  You could watch your porn.  You helped figure out whether this word in Shakespeare was correctly scanned.  So, you know, I mean, it's great.  It's great that we'll save a little bit of time.  Great.  I guess you can get directly to your porn, but, you know, I feel sorry for the books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or this.  It was they were also using it apparently for Street View, according to Ronam audio and ours  Technica that I remember you would see sometimes you see numbers like numbers on a house.  Yeah.  And that's what you were helping solve that.  That's kind of clever.  Google bought ReCAPTCHA in 2009 for that exact purpose to help them with scanning books and  Street View and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And, you know, so the money that Luis Bonon made for that went to him creating Duolingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right on, right on, right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Language learning.  So, you know, I think it's great because it's bringing contextual analysis into the real world  in a way that people are going to not be creeped out by.  So I'm like, do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and it doesn't I mean, he's this guy's smart because doesn't Duolingo.  It's free because they're due because you're doing eventually translations in a translations.  I love that's to me.  That's thinking that's using your noggin.  Anyway, because Google mechanical, turking, mechanical, turking,  that's exactly what it is.  And if you don't know what that is,  you're listening to the wrong show.  I'm surprised how many people don't know about the mechanical Turk, actually.  I tell people about that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, it's Amazon service where you can pay to get  lots of people to do things for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pennies, you pay pennies.  Yeah.  And they get Amazon cloud powered by humans.  Right.  The mechanical Turk and it's named after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now I'm picturing all these little people on bicycles powering like the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like black.  It's like black.  I know there's like a black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a black mirror.  It's back mirror.  Absolutely.  So it is that I got to continue searching for these results and clicking on the ones that match.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, I've done my day.  Now I can buy an hour free ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is telling though about how much Google knows about you that they don't really need  to capture to know whether you're you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just come on in.  We know.  Hey, Leo.  We're cool.  Come on in.  They can even they do, you know, it's it kind of goes back to that super cookie story where  they, you know, each each system is very uniquely identifiable based on the plugins you've installed  on the screen resolution and how you move your mouse on this huge number of factors  that they can uniquely identify you.  So they don't really need capture.  They got something better.  Knowledge.  Knowledge.  Google is going to break ground on new headquarters.  I always felt like these these ridiculous headquarters like Apple's spaceship campus  were were really they always used to say, I think it was in the Wall Street Journal,  when a company builds a massive corporate headquarters, that's really the company at  its peak and it's all downhill from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But why the armadillo design?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is in Mountain View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These apples gave us a spaceship.

Transcript:  Didn't they didn't they originally have this kind of indoor outdoor  complex that they were going to build?  What happened to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you have to understand that our Googlers are very precious and the more that we can  put them into a contained hermetically sealed environment, the less likely they're going  to go out to the outside world where they might be exposed to have to do chores on their own and not  and not have everything provided for them, which reduces our work productivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is actually not nearly as grandiose as Apple's campus, which I think houses 20,000  employees. This is a tent that size, 595,000 square feet, two stories tall.  It won't be done for three years, two or three years.  It's actually not very far away from Apple Park.  It's kind of down the road from Apple Park if you want to come visit.  Yeah, it does look like an armadillo, doesn't it?  I want to see some.  I think that should be the new nickname.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's all call it that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see some drawings for the inside.  Armadillo.  The armadillo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Arm at the armadillo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Charleston East.  Here's another fine story.  So we're having trouble getting Congress to investigate the Russian connection to the  election, but no problem. Justice Department's glad to indict four Russians for hacking Yahoo!  Two of them worked for the FSB and I think some Canadians were involved.  Justice Department said today they indicted four hackers responsible for a breach of half a billion  user records at Yahoo! Two were Russian spies from the FSB. Two were quote, hired criminals.  They were looking for dirt on politicians so it might actually be related to the DNC hacks.  The spies wanted dirt on politicians.  The hackers were scavenging for profits. All four charged with wire fraud, trade theft,  secret trade, secret theft and economic espionage.  Karim Baratov was one of the hackers. He was in Canada.  He was arrested yesterday. The other three are in Russia, which means it might be a little  tricky to get them out of here.  What was the final discount Verizon got for the hackers?  Nothing. It was a tiny amount compared to the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought it was like $325 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  $325 million. That's not nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Sorry. Not dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And a coupon for Denny's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a multi-billion dollar purchase. I guess it's better than nothing.  We were talking initially about maybe they'd get a billion off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they asked for $925.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, the deal continues to go through and Marissa Meyer,  apparently not going to get the golden handcuffs or the golden parachute that we thought.  The rumors last year were like $53 million.  I think she's only going to get $23 million.  But here's the thing that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me correct.  Oh, yeah.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Verizon saw it a $925 million discount and it got a $340 million discount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what you said.  I think that's exactly what you said, but I may be wrong.  We can check the tape later.  Here's something though that will get you a little mad.  The new Yahoo CEO will make double Marissa Meyer's salary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God. It's like a comedy of errors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because maybe that was what went wrong.  We just didn't pay the CEO enough to save Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel confused at what the CEO is going to be running.  I've lost track of what parts of Yahoo...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this is not Alt-Baba.  That's something else.  That's not the part that Verizon got.  That's what's left of Yahoo and it really consists entirely of their stake in Alibaba.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And maybe Yahoo Japan.  I think a little Yahoo Japan stock sowed in there too.  So let's see what the paycheck is.  A $23 million severance package, $69 million worth of unexercised stock options,  $97 million of existing stock, which she can't sell till she leaves.  So a total of $189 million.  So when they took $20 million for the cyber attacks as a punishment,  not a big deal.  Not a big deal.  $189 million.  She'll be replaced by a former chief of IAC, Thomas McInerney.  IAC owns dating sites like Match.com.  He's going to get a starting base salary of $2 million to become Yahoo's CEO.  That's double what Mercer Meyer was getting.  And he'll also get $4 million bonus in his first year.  Jeebus.  That's 25%.  I'm in the wrong line of work.  I know.  And exactly what does he run?  He runs omg.com and tv.com and Flickr and Yahoo Mail.  Katie Korak's show?  Katie, the Katie Korak show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Katie Korak and David Pogue, who both I think, aren't they like million dollar salaries?  Are they really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just refresh my memory again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Alta Baba has nothing to do with the Alaba steak that is actually going to be part of  the Yahoo that Verizon isn't buying.  No, no, that's Alta Baba is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm confused.  No, Alta Baba is the holding company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's what McInerney is going to head up.  Oh, he's holding up Alta Baba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's holding up Alta Baba.  Oh, now I am confused.  You've got me confused.  She's going to step down from.  So Verizon doesn't need a CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, he's not doing anything.  Verizon, which.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is he doing?  He's just hanging out.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Alta Baba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alta Baba's was left after Verizon acquires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There we go.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The bones.  Okay.  This is a new verb.  I've never heard the verb concretes.  Yahoo to be renamed Alta Baba after Verizon purchased concretes.  It's not a word.  You guys are writers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that's that's headline jargon right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's like, oh, I like using Alta Baba.  According to Washington Post is a combination of the words that wait for it.  Alternative and Alibaba.  So it's all left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all Alibaba.  Alta Alta Alibaba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  So so so this guy isn't the head of what's left of Yahoo.  He's the head of Alta Baba.  That's even more ridiculous of a salary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So she's going to step down.  So they're buying Yahoo, which we know and love as that thing we used to know and love.  And that'll go to Verizon.  And Marissa is not going to go with that.  But because she is still technically the head of that right now,  she is going to get paid a severance because when the deal is done, they're going to be like,  thanks for thanks for handling Yahoo over all those years.  Here's the twenty three million dollars on your set.  But meanwhile, because she's still going to be head of the new Alta Baba company,  she would have stayed there.  But apparently she's going to be all the company is saying, oh, we don't need you anymore either.  So you can step down and we're going to put this Thomas guy in there and we're going to  pay him twice of what we're paying you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But actually, that makes sense because Alta Baba really is just an investment company at this point.  And so he'll be running, as he did at IAC, a bunch of disparate brands.  So he has he was a CFO at IAC.  So he has some experience in running a holding company.  All right.  Not that anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the things that I always thought Yahoo should have done was instead of pursue a product  strategy, pursue a financial kind of strategy that didn't happen.  So maybe that's what's going to happen with the remainder of it.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to take a little break and then we're going to come back with the one thing  everybody who has an iPhone wants.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  An Android phone?  Yeah.  Sorry, a little laugh.  But first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they're all going, what are you talking about?  You're crazy, Leo.  You're crazy.  Well, not crazy like a fox.  Hang on.  But first, a word from Curry, the real life robot pal.  Your first robot.  Your kids are going to love Curry.  I love Curry.  Curry is so cute.  Knee high.  She has expressive, really expressive eyes.  You really look at her and she immediately, she has a personality.  You feel like there's something in there.  She responds to human touch.  She has face recognition.  She'll know who's who.  She maps your house and knows where things are.  And you could say, this is the living room, Curry.  This is the den.  And then you could say, hey, go into the living room and see if the dog's on the couch.  And she'll take a picture, send it back to your phone.  She knows how to avoid obstacles like stairs and furniture, but she also  can route around new obstacles because she's got LIDAR and recognition.  She can totally navigate the place.  She doesn't get tripped up on carpets or thresholds or door jams.  She can walk around.  She's got little tank tread feet.  When she's low on battery, she just goes home to her dock and charges.  She greets you differently when you come home and she really greets you.  She does not speak.  This is really important.  They decided not to make her too anthropomorphic.  They wanted to be cute, cuddly, and they didn't want her to speak.  So she beeps and boops and burps.  But you can talk to her and you can ask her to do things.  For instance, you can say, wake me up in the morning and play my favorite podcast.  This week at Google, Curry will wake you up, start playing your podcast.  You can say, Curry, follow me.  And while you go to the kitchen and make breakfast or brush your teeth,  she'll follow you around the house.  She'll read the kids a bedtime story.  And when you're not home, she can check on things.  In fact, if there's a loud noise, she'll go investigate and take photos or video  and send it right to your phone.  Curry, she's so cute.  I spent a little time with her down there at the Mayfield Robotics place  that I kind of fell in love.  So I immediately put down a hundred dollar refundable deposit.  Curry is made by Mayfield Robotics, which is a division of Bosch.  So they have a big manufacturing arm in Germany.  She will be beautifully made.  They're working on finalizing the software now.  They expect to have Curry in your house by this fall.  If you want to get in line, put down the hundred dollar refundable deposit.  Curry will be $6.99.  So $5.99 plus tax and shipping due at time of purchase.  Curry, K-U-R-Y.  Find out more.  Read up on Curry.  Some of the smartest roboticists are working on this.  And I really think they got something here.  A real live robot pal.  H-E-Y-K-U-R-I.  Heycurry.com  And I think I'm torn because they said we're going to get one of the first  off the line because I put my deposit down early.  And I don't know.  I think I'm going to have her in the studio coming and saying hi during shows and stuff like that.  I'd like to have her at the house too.  You can send her to my house.  You want to visit.  You can have a visit from Curry.  We could share Curry.  You have a seven-year-old, right?  So she would, I think that would be really perfect for Curry.  You know why I want Curry?  Because when our dog passed away, after our dog passed away, the nice thing about a dog,  cats don't do this.  We have cats too, but cats don't do this.  Dogs kind of add a person to your house.  You know, like your dog is like, and when Ozzy passed away, it got really quiet.  And I felt like we need, we need to have somebody, we need a presence in the house.  And then shortly after I met Curry, I thought, you know what, a lot easier than a dog.  But with much of the same kind of personality and she's happy to see you and stuff.  I thought, she can't play fetch.  So if that's important, you should get a dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Neither can my dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know Ozzy, he would get it and run away.  So I don't know.  This is kind of a silly idea, but it's called the eye.  It's a Kickstarter for an iPhone case.  That's an Android phone.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't understand this at all.  I really like, I have exactly.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an iPhone case for an Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the back is the Android phone.  On the front is the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I could use that.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's both.  I could use that because I always carry around two phones.  Right.  It's for the.  Not anymore because there's a pain.  So I just carry one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually carry a Pixel and an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.  My phone is literally ringing.  Isn't that ironic?  I know.  It's calling you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that a real phone or is that your cell phone making a real phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's my cell phone making the noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like that.  It's cool.  A retro.  Well, now you can have your Android phone make one ring and your iPhone make the other ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That could be handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although I.  How much does it weigh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know, but you know, there is a market for this.  They were trying to raise money on Kickstarter.  They wanted $95,000.  They raised $235,000 in just a few days.  They have 30 days left.  So there's clearly a market for this.  It's not super expensive.  They plan to get it out at $189.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the case holds both your phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a phone case.  No, I think.  Well, that's a good question.  Oh, maybe it's just a case that holds two phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But which Android phone does it hold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's actually an Android.  I thought it was a separate phone.  It's an Android phone that is a case for your iPhone.  It's got a five inch AMOLED display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it comes with an Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  I can hold an iPhone.  For 95 bucks.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  28 milliamps of power.  Always on display.  Two SIM slots.  NFC.  What is this called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The i case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The i.  EYE.  If you Kickstarter i, the smart iPhone case, you'll find it.  Five inch display.  You could add an SD card for 256 gigs of storage.  It has an IR blaster so you can use it for remote control.  Isn't that a crazy idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can you take pictures with this thing?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're asking tough questions.  Actually, I think this would get in the way of your camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I would think.  I mean, I'm okay with that because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All you could do is selfies.  All the time.  All selfies all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I've gone off it now.  I don't need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've gone off?  You're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not getting the point.  It's one of those strange...  But it's weird.  They've raised so much money.  Obviously, people want to do something like that.  HTC is saying they will have an unexpected surprise on March 20th.  Spring is coming.  It's funny because I just got my HTC U Ultra phone.  That was the phone I thought I was getting last week but actually came.  And I kind of like it.  You know what I really like?  It's not a Pixel.  The Pixel is the best Android phone.  Although, I got the beautiful blue and they have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's nice.  Yeah, it's pretty.  That's a nice Samsung.  Yeah.  It's not a Samsung.  Well, it looks like it on the back.  Knock it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has a 12-megapixel camera and a 12-megapixel selfie camera.  And actually, the camera has the Zoe's, which I always liked of HTC.  This is actually kind of fun.  I can do a pano selfie.  Let me go to the selfie panorama.  Oh, that sounds cool.  So I take a picture of myself, right?  And then I pan it over.  And then I pan it over the other side.  And I get an extra wide selfie.  Whoops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's...  That changes the selfie game.  It changes your selfie game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Imagine if you've been at the Oscars.  That would have been...  You could have fit everybody in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody could be fit in, right?  That's what I was thinking.  Changes your selfie game.  I really like it.  It's a very good camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can do it like this with the iPhone and that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, no.  What else?  It's not pure Android.  It's very HTC-sense-y with the Blink feed and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I liked the HTC sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You already got Google Assistant on it too.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get Google Assistant on it.  That's one of the phones that Google has now upgraded Assistant, which is good.  It is 7.0, not 7.1.1.  And it only has the January security update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what really happened since January?  That's probably good enough security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now you're being facetious, aren't you?  That kind of bugs me.  I really feel like that's kind of the minimum on an Android phone,  is you ought to be getting the monthly updates in a timely fashion.  And that's one of the reasons the Pixel is a winner.  But the Pixel is kind of uninspiring design.  It's nice, but it doesn't get you excited.  This is a little more exciting, don't you think?  A little prettier, a little more...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so pretty.  It's pretty.  Five point sandwiches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm just going to say I don't need the design.  I don't care about the design because they're all going into the case.  What I need, just if I can rant, I just need a decent credit card case.  That works for the Galaxy.  That works for the iPhone.  You know what you get for the Pixel?  What?  You got to try to find something that's basically glued on fabric.  Yeah, you get the glue on pouch.  If you want the Pixel to be successful, you build me a decent credit card case  because I can't go back to having a wallet and I'm just done.  Okay, my rant's over.  I think that's kind of a specialized thing.  But I don't care about the design.  I don't need the design.  And look at how pretty...  Who walks around with their phone not in the case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My husband doesn't.  I don't like cases.  Actually, a lot of my former colleagues don't.  It's his phone.  Too dangerous.  Now, when I hold it and drop it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've never dropped a phone.  He's...  Really?  I'm very careful.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh my God, my phone...  My phone doesn't have a case.  It's too slippery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One other thing, this has a little screen at the top.  It's a dual screen thing.  This is not a good idea.  It has a little screen up here that could show you notifications.  I have call buttons.  I could play my music.  It's just a little extra screen.  I could see the weather.  I could have little icons.  The problem is it kind of gets in the way when you're doing notifications.  I mean, you still slide over it, but it just feels weird that it's there.  Nevertheless, I mean...  I kind of like it.  And it's part of the always on.  It's the always on screen.  So...  Well, I didn't do it.  But if I raise the phone, let's turn it off and raise it,  then you can kind of see it.  You can't see it very well, but that's the always on screen too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's nice for at night too.  There's a clock.  Yeah, it's a little clock.  That's what I like about the S7 Edge.  You can run the clock along the edge at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never liked the...  I never thought that that was that useful.  But this is...  So this is like the Edge, but it's on the top basically.  It's a little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no.  The only thing I ever use the Edge for is for that clock.  And I think it is well worth buying an $800 phone.  So I can turn it into a car on the rare occasions I'm traveling.  And I am unable to use my Android watch as my clock,  which is the only thing I use that for on my nightstand now.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do wish that...  Technology.  Oh.  What?  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a question about clocks.  Yes.  I actually...  Someone asked me, they want a smart alarm clock.  And they asked if I had done any reviews about it.  And I thought, ha, I have a smartphone and an Echo.  So I never thought about needing something.  So...  Yeah, my Echo is my smart alarm clock.  You guys know of any...  Yeah.  So...  But...  But they have a phone.  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does that mean?  You have a phone.  What do you need?  Yeah, what does a smart alarm clock mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what it means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They want something...  So this is what I asked.  They want something where in the middle of the night,  they can open their eyes and see the time.  And then in the morning it wakes them with an alarm,  and the news and whatever traffic feed or whatever.  That would be a great...  They don't want to have to ask for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be a great thing.  That's called an alarm clock.  That's called a clock radio.  That would be great actually if the Amazon Dot had just a...  Because I like that when I wake up at...  No, when I wake up at the night, I want to know the time.  And I've got my Android watch that sits there and I can see it  and that's perfect.  But an Amazon Dot that had the time built into it  would be wonderful.  That's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, so maybe a case that goes over the Amazon Dot.  Someone get on Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had...  Or you could probably buy like a $29,  like a $10 LED thing and just glue it to the end of your Amazon Dot.  We have the Betty.  And then it would give you the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have the Betty here.  And this was at Indiegogo.  And Megan has one in the other room.  We showed it today or this week on iOS today.  It's an app enabled alarm clock speaker  that wakes you up with a music and a light.  It does a slow glow wake up thing,  where the light gets brighter and brighter.  You can dim the clock to nothing or you can have a very...  It has an app controlled alarm clock, an auto time sync,  multiple USB charging ports on the back, which is very handy.  I thought it was less than this.  It's a hundred bucks, but I guess that's what it was.  You can hold a slot for your phone.  It does not dock.  It just sits in the slot because no one knows what the next...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does it charge the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. Well, yeah, because there's a USB jack in the back.  So you could put a cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But not USB-C?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's whatever you want it to be.  It's the old USB.  And then you run your own cable.  Yeah, you run your own cable.  See how she's got that plugged in.  And I don't blame them because how many times you go to a hotel,  like the Fine Driscoll Hotel in Austin, Texas,  and they've got an iHome with a 30-pin dock on it.  They don't want to buy another clock radio until somebody figures out  what the next standard is going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I keep shoving my phone on there.  And those pins will not go into the lightning connector.  They will not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so what I'm supposed to carry around a 30-pin lightning adapter  before I go to the hotel?  Every hotel I've been in ever has a 30-pin clock radio.  And I'm sure when they put that in, they said,  this is the height of modern technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's Apple just being Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just Apple being Apple.  So this is...  I would tell her, get the Betty.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From Whitty.  Is it him? But OK?  Tell him to get a Betty from Whitty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it shipping now though?  Because I've been burnt on that Lily drone,  and I don't want to buy anything else that's promised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe it is.  It got funded December 9th of two years ago, 2015.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  CNET has a review on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we have one.  So you can see all prices.  Yeah, you can buy it on Amazon from Whitty Design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although I got to feel like in about a month,  it's going to be outdated when Amazon Echo clock  charge dock port comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love that idea of adding just a little clock to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's easy.  You should do that.  Our refrigerator has a clock.  Why can't my smart thing have a clock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I put my Apple Watch...  I have a little tiny Mac classic Apple Watch holder.  It looks like a little tiny Macintosh.  They put the watch in there,  and it looks like the screen on the Macintosh.  But you have to hit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  No, but that's great.  With the Android Watch, Leo, with my...  Because I have both of them there.  With the Android Watch, it's so annoying  because you wake up in the middle of the night  and you want to know what time it is,  and it's just there in a dimmed mode,  always telling you what the time is.  How annoying is that?  Whereas I want to know the time with my Android Watch.  I can wake up, I can hit my desk,  and then the light, then it comes on and tells you the time,  which is such a great feature.  It's that's the kind of usability that you like from Apple.  It just works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple does not make this,  but it is my favorite little gadget on my bedside table.  It turns your Apple Watch...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They should make a version of that that constantly vibrates  so that it would keep...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remind you, it's there.  It's from Elago, E-L-A-G-O.  It's on Amazon, Elago W3 Stand.  I happen to love this, and it's nicely made.  And the watch charger goes...  You put your watch charger puck in it,  and it works so it charges and everything.  It's very nice.  It's cute.  Yeah.  It goes into nightstand mode.  That's actually my favorite smart clock radio.  Anyway, I'm glad I could tell you about the witty  because we did this on iOS today on Monday,  and I thought, who would want that?  But now I know, Stacey's friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There you go.  Thank you.

Transcript:  Mark Zuckerberg announces the creation of a female user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say, is this his baby?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Gizmodo, for the weirdest headline of the week.  So there's a new Zuck on the way.  Max, their one-year-old daughter will have a little baby girl.  Yep.  Mark posted on Facebook where else?  After our difficult experience having Mac,  we weren't sure what to expect or whether we'd be able to—  I didn't know they had a difficult experience—  or whether we'd be able to have another child.  When Priscilla and I first found out she was pregnant again,  our first hope was the child would be healthy.  My next hope was it would be a girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I always like the pictures that are posted.  They're so natural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Strange dreadlock dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's got that army of seven people walking around taking pictures of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you could tell Mark and Priscilla are always just sitting around like this.  With the dreadlock dog.  And as far as we know—

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the timer on the camera went off just at the right moment.  Just at the right moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know there's like 15 lights, there's a stylist, there's a makeup artist,  there's a PR person, there's a photographer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The best thing is they had a whole selection of photos to choose from and they said,  let's go for the one where his wife's eyes are closed because that'll make it still natural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're right.  Priscilla, it's your turn to have your eyes closed this time.  I'll do it next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh no.  They had difficulty in that they had a miscarriage or a couple miscarriages.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  They were very open about that, which was a big deal for—

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is a very big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a part of erasing the shame of having miscarriages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad that they're expecting again.  That was shared March 9th.  And you know, I don't know how I missed that until now.  I'm, I, Facebook mustn't be giving me the latest news from my friends.  If it's not politics, you don't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's really true.  I did not see that post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was no Trump in it.  I could share something on Facebook now and be like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is this huge change in Google?  It's like two likes.  No, no.  Look at what he's done now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  Yeah, boom.  It's like that Monty Python spam kit.  It's not, it's not got much Trump in it.  It's got a little bit of Trump.  It's got a little bit of Trump.  By the way, you'll be glad to know Facebook has banned the use of user data for surveillance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, my big question is, how do they determine that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, they'll still let political campaigns target you, but you know.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because so I didn't know this, but it makes sense.  Like with the pipeline, the Dakota pipeline protests, they were using, they said, actually,  I don't think this actually happened because remember there was a whole thing.  Go check in at the Dakota pipeline protest, even if you're here in San Francisco or in Austin,  because we want to confuse the police who are using people's check-ins to target them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, but it was also things like police would arrest protesters based on like saying they  were going to be at a Black Lives Matter protest, or they were scouting people who were there and  matching them up against people they had warrants against, and then they would go arrest them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's, yeah, but I don't know how they stopped that.  Really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But at least it's no longer approved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think there was also companies that were doing it.  They had like an API, they were using the API to produce some of that data easily and provide it  to law enforcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it reminds me of Tim Berners-Lee's post.  He's the, of course, inventor of the web, which is I think now 28 years old.  It was his birthday was this past week, the World Wide Web.  He wrote at the time an open letter talking about the three issues he's increasingly worried about  with the World Wide Web.  And I think it'd be good to get you guys to weigh in on this.  One, we've lost control of our personal data.  I think that's pretty obvious.  Widespread data collection by companies has, you know, many of us agree to this free content  in exchange for personal data.  But fundamental and fundamentally, we do not mind some information being collected in exchange  for free services.  But he says we're missing a trick.  Our data is then held in proprietary silos out of sight.  We lose out on the benefits we could realize if we had direct forever, if we had direct control  and could choose with whom and I agree to share.  I agree that this is a problem.  I'm not sure how you solve it, but I think some have talked about having some sort of  personal data silo which you then contract to release your data to people in return for  benefits of some kind, whether it's money or free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a company that does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love the idea.  I just think it's too complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Neura does it for health data.  And they partner with certain device makers to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He also refers to what Facebook was talking about, which is that, you know,  governments can use this information.  Bloggers can be arrested or killed.  Political opponents can be monitored.  And it creates a chilling effect on free speech.  So I'd agree with point one.  I don't know exactly how you solve it.  I agree with all three points.  I just think that the points two and three are very problematic.  It's too easy for misinformation to spread on the web.  Who would disagree with that?  But I don't think any proposal to get rid of misinformation on the web is doable only  because one man's misinformation is another man's truism.  And who's going to make that?  Not on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google, the one true source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's I can talk about that change if you're not going to get to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would like to talk about that because Google had a problem,  especially with the Google Home, where you would say you'd ask Google Home,  is Obama planning a coup?  And it would say, yes, as a matter of fact, Obama is because they were pulling news from false.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was just that was just true.  I mean, that's factual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of my point.  Who's going to decide this?  I guess Google feels like they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's the thing they announced this week.  I mean, that that thing's the thing that this week, but the story that we if you ask them now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if you ask them now, it'll just say, I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know what you're talking about, which is actually worse.  Is is Obama's spying on me through my microwave oven?  I don't know what you're talking about is a scary answer.  So what's new then to this story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so they announced yesterday that they Google has this like army of what they call quality  reviewers.  It's about 10,000, over 10,000 contractors.  And what these people do is they are given real searches.  They're told search for this and then evaluate the results that came up  and rate how well you think they satisfied the search you did.  So if you were to search for is the sky blue, then someone would do that search and they'd  look at the results.  And if there was one that was saying red, they'd say this didn't satisfy it and so on.  And they try to they try to rate how the quality of the results they get so that Google can take  all that data and then go build algorithms to improve the things that are weak.  And so Google's added this new thing for all the Raiders to start using, which is called the  offensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Upsetting offensive content.  Upsetting offensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this was designed now because, you know, in December you had these examples like when  you would search is the Holocaust real, you would get these Holocaust denial sites dominating  the search results.  And so now what they're telling the Raiders is do these kinds of searches.  And if you find stuff that looks offensive, looks like it's designed to promote hate,  you know, flag it as offensive or upsetting.  And then they want to go back and use that data now to then try to better identify content  like that and prevent it from coming up when you do these kind of factually oriented searches.  So you're not getting this offensive material.  Now, if you really want to get to that white supremacist site and you know it by name and  you type it in, you would still get that because Google would say, well, you're explicitly  asking for it.  But if you were to do a search for, you know, are white people inbred, the assumption in  that case is going to be that you're looking for information about it.  You're not looking to reconfirm any preconceptions you might have.  And they're going to go towards we're not going to try to give you this offensive or,  you know, inflammatory material.  We're going to try to give you, you know, factual thought out, you know, reasonable material  to come back.  And so that may help with some of the stuff.  It may also help with that sort of what I call the one true answer problem that you  talked about.  The coup thing came from me because I was like it was the day that the Trump stuff was  going crazy on the wiretapping.  And I had typed that into my phone.  I could see, wow, it's and I did a stream of these kinds of examples.  We've had any number of people doing these kinds of examples now.  But they also said in part of these changes is that they're also trying to get the evaluators  to go a bit heavier on making sure that stuff is accurate rather than authoritative.  So apparently sometimes you can get these sites and they gave me one example I didn't  get into.  But, you know, people would be doing these searches and like for Hitler's daughter.  And I don't think that was the answer.  There was some other search that they would do.  And the Raiders would tend to lean towards saying, well, it was very authoritative.  The site seemed to have all these reputations threshold.  But whether or not the facts were correct was another thing.  And so, you know, the emphasis now is going to be more on the fact checking aspect of  it so that you can flag things that are not seeming to be factually correct.  How well do you think this will work?  You know, it's one of those that remain to be seen types of things.  They said that they did a small trial of this.  And then in fact, they rolled out an update that was designed to deal with the  Holocaust kind of search.  And, you know, as I noted in my story, that stuff has changed.  Now, one of the reasons the Holocaust search changes is because enough people were upset  that you were getting these terrible answers that they started writing good things to  explain that, yes, the Holocaust really happened.  Here's factually information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they changed the result merely by changing the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there were other searches like when I would search for was Obama born in Kenya,  the top result I used to get on Google was of YouTube video where he's explaining that  and admitting on video that, yes, he was born in Kenya, except he didn't do that.  They just took a video of him talking as someone edited it and put in words.  Right. So that's no longer at the top.  And in fact, the results are much different when you search for that now than when I looked  before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much energy are these content raters going to put into researching that video?  I mean, is it their job then to go look at every bit of content on the net and verify  its accuracy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's going to be part of it, apparently, is that and they're already supposed to be  They don't have enough people then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They need more people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the goal isn't that they have to research every single fact that you could possibly  search on Google.  I mean, Google's dealing with hundreds of millions of searches per day.  The goal that they're hoping is if they can identify things that are common to pages that  tend to give false facts that they maybe they have enough signals that they can build  either the human written algorithms or the machine learning can identify it.  That's still a tough challenge because how do you figure out what's true?  And they may have more success in identifying signals from content that's not as trustworthy  and being able to filter more of that stuff out and knowing that it happens.  But like another example I gave when you did the factual thing is you could ask,  is Donald Trump paranoid?  Right.  And I think this will still work on Google, Google Home and Google Assistant.  But it would come back and say, Donald Trump is paranoid.  Donald Trump is mentally ill.  And okay, I'm not a Trump fan.  I certainly think he's paranoid and probably mentally ill.  But from a medical standpoint, I'm not a doctor and we don't have any medical things  that have said that.  And in fact, the article wasn't a medical thing that was saying that either.  It was a column that was written by a little known publication called Slate,  which is a highly authoritative site.  See, here's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's exactly the problem.  I just think this is impossible.  And the problem for the potential for abuse, mistakes and a mess is just way out.  I commend them for trying to solve it.  But boy, this doesn't look like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not going to get perfect.  You're never going to get perfect facts that report.  But what they may have success on doing is at least reducing the things where you get  these really offensive things that come up, where you search for are women evil?  And the first result you come up is this weird diatribe where someone's telling you why  they're all evil and they're prostitutes at heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's telling that the tag they're using is upsetting offensive, not wrong.  Yeah.  You're saying this is upsetting or offensive, but that's a culturally defined judgment.  It's highly subjective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You need to use cultural norms in your own locale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have 200 pages of guidelines, by the way.  This is, I don't know.  What do you think, Stacey?  Is this a good idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I was going to back it up just a bit to this idea that Tim Berters-Lee was saying,  which is it's too easy for misinformation to spread on the web.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Google's way of trying to solve that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  So I don't actually think, what if you take that and say, no, it's actually not any easier  than it has been.  What it is, it's scalable.  So it spreads farther.  So it was always easy.  Anybody who's been in high school can say, hey, it's so easy for misinformation to spread.  Right?  Somebody says something and then everybody suddenly believes that,  I'm thinking of terrible things.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm trying not to say them either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm like, oh, that's bad.  It never happens with that hater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Gervals are a good example.  Yeah. Gervals are an excellent example.  Gervals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think the scalability is the problem.  It's not that misinformation is any easier or harder.  It's just that it gets to more places quickly.  Right.  So how do you solve that?  When you create, what we've created is the ultimate publishing medium

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that goes to everybody, that everybody has access to.  This didn't come up in the past because only people with lots of money  could have printing presses or TV and radio studios or motion picture studios.  But now everybody has access, the means to publish, and the publishing that they do  can get to everybody.  And inevitably, you're going to have a huge amount of crap.  And I don't understand how you propose to change that because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think you've got twin problems.  You've got the virality or the viral nature that some of this stuff can spread,  and in particular on Facebook.  And I think they have a challenge as to is there more they can do to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, their challenge is different than Google's because they're not a search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're two different things, but they go hand in hand.  So are there things they can do to better flag stuff to say to people,  maybe you need to think twice about this or just stop outright false stuff that you can tell?  But then the challenge Google has is these things aren't viral on Google,  but Google has a different issue where people who actually may want to go to research this stuff  and get exposed to one-sided things or just completely non-authoritative stuff.  And then it's like, so now they can't even debunk the stuff that they may have heard on a viral nature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My big problem...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what if instead of looking for search terms, Google spent more effort grouping  like information together and by like, you get more perspectives?  And I'm thinking of...  So kind of like your Snopes results would always come up when you did a search  for something, right? That sounds plausible.  I think that's kind of what Facebook's doing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook is putting a flag and saying, here's what you might want to read to or something like that.  That's what... But the problem is it's still so subjective.  Here's why I have a problem with it and I'll let you finish.  I'm gonna let you finish, but first, here's why I have a problem with it.  And I was really worried when we started using this label fake news.  And immediately the thing I was most worried about happened, which is we have our fake news.  Suddenly, they're using the term fake news to describe what we think is real news.  And that's the problem is as soon as you start labeling stuff fake news,  the whole thing goes out the window because everybody has a different opinion on it.  And you and I might agree that there are facts and there are non-facts, but  that's a small subset of this overall problem.  And I don't know if... Is Google supposed to be a fact engine?  Or is it supposed to be a... Well, yes.  Yes.  Well, wait a minute. Is it?  Yes. Google.  That's a misunderstanding of it, I think.  Google is supposed to find whatever you're looking for.  That's what Google's own understanding of it is.  Well, they're wrong. And that's the problem with Snippets and that's the problem with  the Knowledge Graph. They're not. They're a search engine.  They're supposed to enable you to find something you're looking for,  some piece of content on the net, and they shouldn't be judging the factual nature of it.  I think that's a mistake.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'm going to throw a thesis I've got out here for you.  Because this is something I've actually been thinking a lot about with Google.  And my thought is it needs to move from becoming or from being an advertising company  to being a services-oriented company.  I agree.  And that helps solve this problem in some ways because a service it would provide clearly  is factual information, right? Not alternative facts, just facts.  And then it's becoming important not just because of this issue, but also because of IoT,  its emphasis on machine learning, and the way we're going to start interacting with devices  that don't have screens, right? And you can't in a voice world be a search engine.  You have to provide a service and that service would be the facts or the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why can't it just be a search engine?  Well, if I want to know what the...  So here's an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me give you an example. God exists.  Some people will say that's factual. Some people say that's not.  It's not Google's job to determine that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Correct. And in fact, I've used that before when people have said,  well, we should only have factual stuff and they get really on a high horse about it.  And I said, okay, so when I search for that exact type of thing, is God real?  I should not get any religious information coming up because by its nature,  religions are based on faith, not fact. And so if you're going to say you can't  only have factual information in Google...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google should not be not weighing on the accuracy of whatever its search results show.  It should be pure search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but I think there are verifiable facts.  There's no such thing.  No, there are verifiable facts in the world.  Well, I think there are things as search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, sorry. There's no such thing as pure search results.  Why not?  There are such things as verifiable facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's the exact opposite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know Google bombing?  So what?  So that changes what a search results in and that's manipulated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a combination of things. You have some things that you search for that are verifiable  facts. For example, if I search for who invented homework, that should be a verifiable fact, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You shouldn't get some guy in 1905.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And Google is reporting and listing that it's this guy in 1905,  this number. And it's like, no, that's just wrong.  It's not even a fake news political debate thing. It's literally just wrong.  And it's embarrassing for Google when it's trying to provide facts and does it in that  kind of thing that is actually showing misleading facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would submit that what Google should be saying is do not use Google to determine facts.  You could use Google to search for sources and read the source and then you as a human  have to decide whether that is factual or not. Google should not be the arbiter of facts.  It's a search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with you in the sense that it would behoove Google and everybody to understand that  we all need better critical thinking skills and that Google is just a tool like a library was a  tool and that you need to go through on many things that you search for and actually do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  research. Google is a card catalog. The card catalog in the library should be able to find  completely specious, fallacious BS books just as much as it finds real books.  That's what the card catalog does. Google should be the card catalog for the internet,  not some librarian saying, well, that's not true. That is true because that way lies danger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But people don't think of Google that way. People think of it as a repository of knowledge.  Google's job should be educating people.  No, this is the same problem we have with like Tesla and calling its car a self-driving car when  it's really autopilot and then Tesla getting mad at people for not paying attention while they  drive their car off the road. Tech companies and all companies have a history of saying,  misstating what they do and we buy into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Google's pretending it's Yahoo, which was a human generated index.  But that didn't scale, did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me put it to you in a different way. So, search engines biggest challenge had been up until  recently that they had to deal with adversarial information. And by adversarial, I mean that that  was the term that they would use. But what I mean is they had to deal with spam. That unlike our  other research tools before we had search engines, they would go through a small collection of books  and trusted sources and no one was actively trying to mislead them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what Google bombing also is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not just Google bombing.  No, I understand. But you could say Google bombing is a form of spam.  Right. But when search engines came along, you had people actively trying to subvert the search  listings to get poor quality information, but to get a top ranking, they made money off it.  And Google's claim to fame was it had better protection against that. It used links,  it tried to figure out authoritative information, and that's why it wiped off all the other search  engines by and large from the map and took over. But now we're in this weird situation where it's  not just outright spam and people doing keyword stuffing and buying links and all that stuff.  It's that you have a flood of unauthoritative information that's coming in.  And it doesn't relieve search engine from the duty of trying to pick out the best of the resources  that are there. And I think that's the thing. There are some things where Google could tell  it is a fact. And we could say these are facts and they should provide that. There's also a  greater chunk of things where we don't know the direct answer to it. It's not even just  maybe politically charged or where you are on the political spectrum. It's just that  we might not know what the right answer is if you want to fix something or if you want to buy a  refrigerator or whatever. So you need a variety of resources. But the challenge is that you get into  some of these kinds of things where you're not like with the Holocaust search, you weren't getting  a variety of resources trying to help you understand whether the Holocaust is real or not.  You are getting pages that were heavily dominated by denial stuff because the people who write about  the Holocaust never occurs to them that there are other people out there who are searching for  things that is not real and writing content to explain why it's not happening.  So there's a lot of stuff that's going to be changing. None of it is going to be solved  instantly by Google. There's a lot of the onus that remains on human beings to do it. But they  do need to do something. They do need to look at this because it is a problem that in the end  causes them to lose faith. Until now, Google by and large has been able to go along and say,  we have the best search results unquestioned. Oh yeah, Google's results are great. And when you do  one of these searches and you get one of these featured snippets and your jaw goes, you realize,  wow, Google didn't know what it's talking about. And that is not a good thing to be in if you're a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  search engine. Well, I agree with you. Spam is the problem. But I would also submit Google made  a mistake when it said, well, we should give you featured snippets because that's saying we're  going to give you the facts. And that's in the state. I know, but that's their key product

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  differentiator between Amazon Echo and Google Home. Otherwise, I just buy the Echo. I know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they shouldn't be doing that. But so I think, Stacey, okay, I agree with both of you in the  sense that Google bombing is a form of spam, that you're going to get skewed search results because  some groups are intentionally, or maybe even not intentionally, flooding the web with a position.  I just worry that if we start getting in this position, I don't want Google to arbitrate  whether something's a fact or not. That gives them way too much power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, maybe it's go to our app to see more results. I mean, maybe you get that equivalent. I don't  know what to say. I mean, the problem is, we're going to be moving into a world where we have a  limited output, right? We don't have a screen everywhere that you can see things and interact

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with things. So how do you design for that? Right. That's a good point, too. Yeah. All right. Good  conversation. This doesn't go right back to the Tim Berners-Lee because he's kind of saying this.  My problem was it was too hard. Well, I don't understand how it's going to happen without  introducing some other form of bias. His third point is even more difficult, which is political  advertising needs transparency and understanding. He's worried about how the sophisticated ad  networks, particularly on Facebook, are able to serve thousands of different ads.  And you don't see all the different ads, only the people they're targeted to. And targeted  advertising, he says, allows a campaign to say completely different, possibly even conflicting  things to different groups. That's undemocratic. He says he sees that as a problem. I'm not saying  I don't see it as a problem, but I don't see how you solve that because of, well, political speeches  is a form of free speech. So these are thorny problems, but I think they come along with what  you invented, what Tim Berners-Lee invented, which was a publishing medium open to everyone.  Right. It's not a bug. It's a feature. Yeah. I mean, that's what you created. Yeah. And I hate  to see- I blame Tim Berners-Lee. Well, now he's saying we ought to regulate this. And I don't  know how you regulate it because by its very nature, any form of regulation is going to  introduce a bias that some people are going to say, that's wrong. We all find ways to regulate

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  stuff in the ways that we find ways to regulate things in the real world. For example, with the  political ads he's so concerned about, very simple to say, you know what, if you're going to create  political ads and your political campaign, you have to post all the political ads you're running  in a place that are accessible. That's a simple thing to do. That could be done by law. That's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  great idea. That's easy to do. That's a great idea. Yeah. There's other stuff that you can do-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's like a fairness doctrine for the internet age. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's actually a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No hidden ads. Every ad has to be viewable at a publicly accessible site. I think that's a great  idea. And then you have to hope that the press has lots of time to go through your 50,000 different  ads. By the way, speaking of big numbers, according to CBS news study reveals 48,000  Twitter accounts are actually bots. That seems low. I don't, maybe I'm wrong. University of Southern  California- 48 million. Did I say a thousand? Million. Yeah, that would be low. University of  Southern California says nine to 15% of Twitter accounts are bots controlled not by humans, but by  software. So since Twitter has 319 million monthly active users, 48 million would be bots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but to be fair, I mean, at least they're very politically active.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those bots voted. Let me tell you. Well, I was going to say that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there are some useful bots out there. Like I have-  Not all bots are bad. I follow a couple of Twitter bots.  I have a bot. I have a Twitter bot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have a Leo bot? It's called Leo bot as a matter of fact. Yeah.  Oh. It's pretty benign. I think it's chief twit bot actually. Chief twit bot. Yeah,  I call it Leo la bot. But all it does is announce when new shows come out.  Yeah, that's a combination of if this, then that and zappier scripts.  Right. It used to announce when I drove up. That's when I was driving  a internal combustion engine vehicle with an automatic.  An ICE. An ICE. You love it how Tesla people call them ices. ICE.  I do. You Tesla people. Actually-  These Tesla people. Lots of Tesla news, right?  Or just Elon Musk news? Well, there's always Elon Musk news.  There's some question about whether one of the two people who will be going to Mars next year  via SpaceX is one of them might be Elon Musk. I don't think we should let Elon go.  We can't afford it. That's sort of the end game really, isn't it? He won't say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was sort of like James Cameron deciding- He wants it so badly.  I want to make Titanic. It wasn't because he wanted to make a movie about the Titanic. He  just wanted to dive down there and needed something to pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Elon just wants to go to the moon. Yeah.  I'm okay with that, personally. He says,  I can fix South Australia's power network in 100 days or it's free. He wants to build a 100  megawatt battery storage farm for Australia. I guess Southern Australia has energy woes.  This battery thing is actually the gigafactory and Elon's capacity of making low-cost,  high-capacity batteries seems to be exploding. Well, that's a bad word to use with batteries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The power thing is just their own fault because they're on that weird,  we're a half hour off of the rest of Australia. That's their doing. If they would just  be one hour, not this 130 thing, then it'd be fine.  Really? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They really are a half hour off. He's joking. He's teasing.  No, I'm not joking. I know it's true,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but it's not what the power problem is. Okay. I was like, how does this affect power at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the sun goes down earlier, half an hour earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There we go. That's right. It's dark longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's dark longer. Tesla is looking to raise $1.5 billion to help make Model 3s.  Elon will buy $25 million of that. If you want to get some stock in the Tesla, this might be a good  time to do it. You and I already invested in Tesla, Stacey, just by buying the car.  I'm not... That's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so legit question. Go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did the anti-investment and just bought the Volt, so I don't need the Volt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good one. How do you like it? Yeah, I love the Volt.  I really want to get a Volt. I liked the Volt, which I first saw at South by Southwest,  but that is a little gasoline assist. The Volt is all electric.  Yeah, it's all... 200 miles, 250 mile range. Good range, right?  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you been getting that? Well, we don't drive it that far.  Occasionally, we'll go into LA, but the nice thing is I can drive into LA.  It's 45 miles away, come back 45. I don't even think about it.  It's not nice. I did do a trip this past weekend where I went up to Santa Clarita,  and I stayed overnight to go on this tour thing. That involved me trying to find a fast charger  because I didn't know if I'd have enough range to get back with all the trips I wanted to do.  I probably would have made it, but... That's where Elon really was smart,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that fast, the supercharger. Really smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I found... I did find one, and it topped my car up to 80% in 30 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can do that on a Volt? You can find a fast charger?  Yeah. Is it a 40 amp?  Yeah. What is fast for a Volt? 72?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fast charger is a DC. I think it's 50 amp.  Okay. DC.  And it supposedly can add 90 miles in a half hour. And then at home, we have the one that does 25  miles in an hour. But yeah, it's been wonderful. And I think the other thing for me, it's just been  driving a smart car. It's like driving an electric car is like having a new smartphone or something.  But it's been great. Yeah. I'm really impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, when you do your panel, I want you to talk about the audio synchronization  that Amazon is proposing to offer to the Echo and the Dot. This could be bad for Sonos, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, especially if they don't have the Sonos integration done. I mean, I'm not going to ditch  my Sonos speakers. No, they're good speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But audio synchronization... That's the secret sauce for Sonos, right?  Let me see if I get... Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's in Google Home already.  Secret sauce for Sonos is... Yeah, Google Home does that. So secret sauce for Sonos is actually  its Wi-Fi network and how it works. But this is, I was going to say this is more a response to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google, I think. Oh, I didn't realize Google Home did that.  In the Google Home. So let me look because apparently,  in some people's Amazon Echo apps, it's not called the Echo app, it's called the other word,  the A word app. In under smart home, you're getting synchronized audio. So let me just  look and see if I've got it. Oh, really?  Yeah. Yeah. Smart home. No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't got it. But wait a minute. Oh,  maybe I would if I connected. It says use groups to control multiple devices at once. I don't even  know about that. There's groups, huh? Hmm. Oh, I have groups.  See, then look in your A word app and see if you could make your groups synchronize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My A app takes forever to load. Are we avoiding saying the word because  we don't want to set off people's devices? Thank you, Danny. I had to send out a memo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because we're so late. This morning, I did a hit on the biggest station in LA, KFI,  with Bill Handel. And he kept saying the A word. I said, Bill, you got to stop that.  You're buying people's stuff. You're triggering. The problem is people like him think this is funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's not funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not funny. So is it under smart home, you said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, supposedly. If you get it. It's one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So mine does not have it. You don't have it yet. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how well does the Google Home do that? I only have one, so I never tried it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't be bothered to do it. I'm not an audiophile.  I like the Echo because the Echo I think has great speakers. And once I put that in,  my wife's like, this is great. So I don't think the Echo has great speakers.  What I have done is I can use the Google Home in the bedroom and you say things like,  play this in the kitchen. And then the music comes on in the kitchen.  Oh, I like that. Yeah. So that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I only have one. So I can't really test any of those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But I guess they can both play music at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chromecast Audio was supposed to have that feature too. See, the trick is sync. Because  if they're not perfectly synced, if there's any latency at all, it sounds like you've got  this big Echo box. Right. It's awkward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Awkward. Awkward to say the least. I was going to ask if you guys had,  I have noticed that my Google Home, when I ask it to play songs, it has given me some really  random results lately. And if I go down and ask the Echo the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you say play music? You're not saying what kind of music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't judge me. I asked it to play, what was it? Oh, God. Oh, I asked it to play Afterglow by  Churches. And it was like, I can't do that. But if I asked the Echo to do it, it did it.  And then I asked it to play like, I can't remember this. It's an Usher song. I asked it to play.  All right, I don't mind by Usher. And instead of playing me the actual Usher song,  it played me a karaoke version. Oh, this is a big problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is one of the things the new Pandora music, they said, we're going to try to solve.  Everybody has access to roughly the same 40 million songs. The problem is, there's a lot of  karaoke covers, bad versions of songs. You'll say, you know, play The Beatles, Here Comes the Sun,  and you'll get some Japanese cover band doing it. And so Pandora says, we're going to try to  eliminate those from our music. If they do that, that would be reason enough to pay for 10 bucks  a month for Pandora's new streaming service. Yeah, that's just the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because the Echo has been great about giving me, generally it gives me the right results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What music service is it tied to? Spotify for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. So that just means Spotify is better than Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you not using Spotify?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no. Because I am using Spotify and Google. So it's the exact same service.  Oh, well, that's weird.  That's what's so wack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's wack. Well, that's really wack.  So.  Afterglow can be hit or miss says Reverb Mike in our chat room. I'm not sure if he's talking  about the song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Home assistant problems.  Yes. Don't you hate it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw a video that made me feel terrible on, I think it was on Facebook, where it's a bunch of  poor Africans standing in front of their tiny little sad buildings or saying, I just need  another Wi-Fi router. I can't get throughout my house. Or don't you hate it when your Google  assistant just doesn't make you breakfast? And it's like all these first world problems  and it just makes you feel so, so, so bad. That's why I'm selling all my stuff.  It's going to all be for sale.  I'm going to take a break. And when we come back, your picks of the week. You in the mood?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds good.  Got something good?  I'm game.  Are you game?  I think I do.  I'm game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kind of already did mine with the phone, but I'll see if I can find something else.  I tipped my hand too early.  Our show today brought to you by Segment, the Data Hub platform.  It's hard for me to describe what this is, but let me put it this way. If you've got a website  or an app and you collect analytics, in most cases, like in our case, you might have multiple  little JavaScript one-liners in your website. We've got Chartbeat and Quantcast and Google  Analytics and a bunch of different things for different analytic purposes or to measure how  people use the site or get heat maps. And the problem is you get all this engineering time  and all this interaction and you get all these bugs. So Segment makes this completely simple.  Think of it as plumbing. It's the Data Hub platform that collects and unifies and acts,  makes it possible for you to act on your customer data across all of your websites,  your mobile apps, your cloud platforms. Instead of putting stuff, you put one bug on your page  in your app on your cloud platform and then you go to your dashboard at Segment,  segment.com slash twit, and you say, okay, I want to add. And then you add Google Analytics  or Optimizely or Mixpanel or whatever tools, hundreds of choices. You create the plumbing  on their website. The other beauty part of this is the Segment app tag will continue to collect  data even if one of these is down. You don't lose any bits of data. And when the site comes back up,  Segment will feed it the data that it missed. So there is one platform that labels writing  integration code once. It's a single straightforward API that unifies your data, your performing  analytics on any platform from marketo to MailChimp. And that's just Dems. Companies that use it,  Atlassian, Intuit, New Relic, and Reuters. You can do advertising analytics, A, B testing,  attribution, and on and on and on. And really, there's so much, if you look at the site,  there's so much stuff. I want you to go to segment.com slash twit. Save time on engineering,  save money on engineering. With Segment, a single developer can easily integrate a new analytics  tool for the data-driven account manager, another for the app happy marketer, another for the data  scientist who needs the flexibility of a single unified data warehouse. You can dig deeper in  your data, bring data from any source, import historical data, customize what ends up in your  data warehouse of choice. It is awesome. Customer data platform that both developers and analysts  love because of its simple, elegant API and that complete partner ecosystem that just  page after page. It works with everything. Zendesk, Intercom, AppNexus. It can go on and on and on.  Spend your time using your analytics data and acting on it, not struggling with custom  integrations. Thanks to Segment, your CEO will love your quickly deployed integrations.  She might even give you a smooch. I love your quickly deployed data integrations.  You'll also love, as a CEO, you'll love how much money you save. 8,000 of the world's best companies  use Segment to drive growth and revenue.

Jeff will be back next week.  Why don't we let the guest start? Danny, your pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm going to pick my own article that I did yesterday. It's your guide to Google Assistant  and the Google Search app. And if you have an Android phone, you're starting to get Google  Assistant. And I've seen it finally roll out to my Galaxy S7 in one of my Moto Plays. So your phone,  there you have it. But it's a big change. Probably the most dramatic change is going to be that if  you're used to hitting the home button and then either speaking or typing your search, that's  changed. Now all you can do is speak your search to the Google Assistant. And you may like that or  you might find it very awkward. Google Assistant is sometimes very useful giving you answers.  And then sometimes it's kind of a pain, especially if you try to do the tasks that it said it was  going to do way back when. And it doesn't turn out to do some of that stuff as well.  But it's definitely coming to your phone. And so if you're wondering what's happening with it,  the guide is designed to explain to you where that's going, what's that's happening.  And then I'm also kind of refreshing your memory about, well, what if you want to use the Google  app? People may remember using Google Now. Google Now is not part of the Google Assistant. You  actually have to have the Google app separately, either on iPhone or Android to get it. And oh,  by the way, it's not called Google Now anymore. It's just called predictive search card things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hate them so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing that Google had that they used to call Google Now on tap, that screen search,  that still exists. And it still exists even if you have Google Assistant. In the past,  you used to be on any screen. You could hold down the home button and it would tell you things  related to what you were looking at. You can still do that with Google Assistant. It just kind of  involves a little bit of activating it and then swiping up. It can be a little tricky.  And just a few other things in terms of how you can do your searching. It's like basically  always to search using Google on either the Android or the iPhone in this new world of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Assistant being out there. I actually love the Google Assistant.  I only had on the Pixel and that to me, if you're going to get an Android phone,  you want to make sure it's one that supports Google Assistant. As Google's basically said,  though, it's going to be if you can get Nougat, you're going to have Assistant, right? Eventually.  Yeah. Yeah. It's great. I mean, I was really pleased when I opened up this HTC Ultra.  It was there. I was like, yay. Very happy. So how do you do now on tap?  Because it's the same thing pressing and holding the home button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you hold the home button and then after Google Assistant launches, you've got to swipe up on the  Assistant itself. It's crazy. It's a little bit complicated. Yeah. No one uses now on tap. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's the key. You're not going to use it anyway, so you're not going to worry about it.  Never. The only time I've ever seen it is because I accidentally held the button too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the only time I ever see it. I think the biggest shift really will be for people who are  used to holding the home button as a way of activating search and they would type. You just  can't do that anymore. And figuring out with the Google Now cards. That's the hardest thing for me  is like you got the Google Assistant, but then you got Google Now and they're like in two separate  areas. And I kind of liked them when they were united in the Google search app. But I imagine  at some point the Google search app itself will get more Google Assistant like. Yeah. What I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  did is I put a Google button on my front page, which launches the now cards. Or if you use the  Pixel launcher, you could swipe left and the now cards are still there. I just don't use the Pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  launcher. Oh, you guys, this is stressing me out. Oh, what kind of phone do you use, Stacey?  I have the Nexus 5X. Oh, that's right. You have this conversation every time. Well, everybody has

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a different phone and I should have a database. Oh, no. Who has what? But that would be normal.  And you should keep it in your head. Normal people call my mind, but I have no mind. So  I don't know. What is your pick of the week, Stacey? Oh, by the way, I should mention  that article Danny mentioned is on searchengineland.com. And you could Google,  as I did, your guide to using Google Assistant on searchengineland.com and you'd find it very  helpful. As always, you're great. Now, Stacey, your pick of the week. Now this is my pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually installed this so I can't show it to you because now it's in a wall.  Show the website. So this is a Zigbee based Lutron Pico remote. And you don't have to have  Lutron because this is just Pico. And the reason I'm showing this to you is because this will  control anything that uses the Zigbee LiteLink protocol. So that includes things like HueTaps,  or sorry, HueTaps, Hue lights, Cree lights, GE Link lights. I think the Osram lights,  although I haven't tried it. Now, as a caveat, the Hue lights will, they don't support these non-Hue  accessories, but it does work. So this I am using to replace the Hue. Hue makes a dimmer  switch that is hideously ugly. Whereas this is beautiful. And if you, this is just the remote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should show the beautiful part because I showed the wall insert, which was not beautiful. But once  you mount the whole thing, this is what you get, right? Well, you get it with the lights, the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Claro pad. So you have to buy all three of these things that Leo is showing you to get if you want  to mount it on a switch. You put this in your drywall. You just want to, yes. And then you put this.  So if you were going to install this. Over it. Yeah, that goes over. So if you wanted to install  this, and this is also good for if you've got Hue lights and people keep turning on the light  switch and off the light switch and you're like, darn it guys, you can't touch the light switch  anymore. I've installed smart lighting. Leave it on. It's smart.  This is a way. So for the 30 bucks for this whole setup, what you'll do is you'll take off your  actual light switch, turn off your power before you do any of this. And then you just take some  wire nuts and close off those wires. Or you'll uninstall your switch, close off those wires.  And then you pop this guy in and then now it is controlled. So and it's less. Yes, you still have  to do a little bit of wiring, but it's not like crazy scary. Or if you don't want to do any of  that, just duct tape over all of your light switches and just stick this next to it. But that's ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So where, how does I don't, maybe you need to be an electrician probably to understand how to make  this the, there's wires that are going to come through one of these. Like does it, is that a cut

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  out? Oh, I see this slides up that plastic. It holds this kind of thing like that. So it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  separate remote. Oh, I see. It doesn't, it's not wired. It's just a whole plate to hold stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I get it. Okay. That plate thing, see those screws on the top as a, you just screw that where your  original switch box was. Cause when a switch box comes out, do I have one? You'll have little

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wires, but you don't have, you just could cover those up. So here's a switch, right? Here's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  back stuff. This is what's inside your wall. Hold it up a little higher. In this plate,  little higher. Yeah. And oh, I froze. I see. So when you pull, and this isn't what you'll get  there, you'll just get the front pace and none of this back stuff. Got it. Did that make sense? And  then you put this in front of where all this used to live. Makes perfect sense to me, Ollie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't wait to try it. I don't have anything smart,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but if you do try it, if you do try it guys, turn the power off first. Not afterwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Lutron things too. This is the one I have. It controls the lights in my office, but  they're not, this isn't, I think it's a different model, but one of the things I like about the  Lutrons is if you buy like their $60 one, you can replace any of your switches for your regular  lights and it turns all your lights into smart lights and then your Amazon Echo can control  them or whatever. And so these are dumb lights over my head, but I have got a smart wireless  switch on the wall and then my Echo can control them. And it is awesome unless you ask my wife,  because she doesn't like how they flick when they first come on, but I think they're cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see I don't have any of this stuff.  Different light bulbs can help that.  Oh really?  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Cnet, Rychrist over at Cnet actually has done a breakdown of which light bulbs work best  with the Lutron dimmers. So you can go check that out if you'd like. The other thing I should tell  you about these, because I love Lutron, like you, I love Lutron. You can actually get a Lutron bridge  and that can actually work in a dual phone home, a dual OS home with HomeKit and with like the Echo  or a Wink Hub. So oh, oh, and I forgot, if you have a Wink Hub and you have this guy, you can  actually program it to control your lights or you can leave it on the table and program it to do  shortcuts. So then you could be like movie night. But that's neither here nor there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still just walk over to the switch on the wall and turn it on and off. I'm very boring, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Too much work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, once you tie your lights to your Echo, I feel like you will never go back.  I really do.  Really?  And like, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I installed all these wireless things in the house and it was like, I just want to use the  switch. And now everybody's like, A-word, turn on the lights here. A-word, turn on the lights  there. You know, everyone's used to it and they like it to the degree that when we walk into a  hotel, people are like, A-word, turn on the lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're spoiled, huh?  Yeah.  I mean, I know, God knows I have Echos in every room, so I certainly have that part down.  I just need to... So the best way to do this, I think, would be to do what you did, Danny,  because I have some hues, but I don't want to put hues in everywhere. I just replace the switches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, do the Lutrons.  Do the Lutron switches.  It's a $65 switch.  It's a $65 Lutron...  You have to put them on every set of lights, though, throughout the house.  Every set of lights.  Where there's a switch.  Where there's a switch. Now, but...  What if I have two switches?  If you have a three-way light.  A three-way light.  If you have a three-way situation, which is two switches, you buy a kit that has basically  a Pico remote, what I just showed you. It has exactly that, all sold as one plus a dimmer  switch, and then you put the actual switch in for one. I did this in my kitchen. And you're going to  wire those up, and then you're going to take off your existing switch, cap off the wires inside  with a wire nut, and then put that Pico remote and plate on it.  And then you program that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Almost all of our lights have dual switches.  So one of them would have a real switch that would make the Luddites happy.  And then the other one would be the one you talk to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you won't even know because one's the hardwired switch and the other one's the remote,  but it's on the wall, so it just looks like a hardwired switch once you mount it on the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't do anything, though, right? That's going to frustrate people because  they're going to walk up to it and tap it.  No, it'll do things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It still works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why it's beautiful.  Ah, it still works as a switch.  It works as...  Yes. And I should also tell you because we talked about the Lutron makes a hub,  but it also works with the Wink Hub. Wink Hub is... And SmartThings just did a Lutron integration,  although I haven't gotten mine to work yet. So I don't know if that's going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have generation two SmartThings hubs, so I could use that if I got it all working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, actually for SmartThings, it's a cloud to cloud, so you need the Lutron bridge.  No, it's the SmartThings... You need the Lutron bridge to work with the SmartThings hub. Sorry.  That sounds as me hitting my head on the microphone.  I know. I know. You know what? If you want...  You're going to come to my house and do this for me?  I can send you my... I totally could, but I could send you my version one of the Wink Hub,  and then you'll have the Lutron radio. It basically becomes a Lutron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't mind buying all this stuff. I should and do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and there's a kit you can get that'll be a switch, the Lutron hub,  and you're set to wire everything up and get one of your banks of lights going.  It's very easy, and I even wired them myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the Casetta Wireless Smart Lighting Kit?  Probably.  It's got one Smart Bridge, two in-wall tubes, two Pico remotes, two tabletop pedestals, works with  Echo. $189.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, no, that's good though, because you're getting a bridge. You're getting to  that 60 and 60 for each of your switches, and you're getting the bridge, which is a $60 bridge.  It's an $80 bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so you need the bridge, right?  Yes.  You need a bridge or a Wink Hub.  Okay. I could use their bridge or the Wink one. And you said use the Wink,  but if I'm going to buy this kit, I'd have the bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So only with the Lutron bridge do you get the dual-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I sleep on your couch when my wife divorces me for doing all this to the house?  Believe me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, she'll be sleeping on it.  The most popular thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the most popular thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I promise you. It is the most popular thing I've ever done in my home for my family.  And actually, I'm actually about to ... Okay, so there's actually things to know before we  tell people, and I don't know if this is too much for y'all, but Lutron only works with  incandescent lights, dimmable LEDs, because these are dimmers.  So you have to make sure they're dimmable lights that you're working with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some LEDs are not dimmable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So don't put them with like a CFL or something fluorescent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good. I hate CFLs anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they make a switch that's just on off you could do with those because I actually  am about to buy one of those to stick in with some fluorescent lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This would in effect turn everything into a dimmer too, which is nice.  Oh yeah.  I'm going to need ... So this does ... This would do two switches, right?  Because I get two remotes and two smart dimmers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You might also, Leo, when you look at it, I think I bought the ... There's another thing  you can get that's the wireless kit. That is it's one switch and it's one bridge,  and that's $100 on Amazon. And then I think you can buy just the ... Another  switch for one of your things that's like 60. So there you go. You'll save like 60 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh boy. Okay. Someday when I have some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's a lot of people in the chat room talking about it being a proprietary  radio protocol, and it is.  But like Sonos, which uses their proprietary ... Oh, it's Clear Connect.  But it's such a good one and your lights will work.  And pairing things with Lutron is so easy. I mean, believe me, I play with this stuff all day long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you got a home kit, it's all on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I do. And then we already have all the echoes. And I ... Yeah. All right.  So I didn't even put the Hughes back in. It was like, I don't really need ... The RGB thing,  I don't care about.  Nice though to be able to say turn on the kitchen lights.  And you could also have a command right to turn all the lights in the house off, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo.  Yes.  Yes.  I just set up the best command. If you've got Stringify, this is great. So I say,  A, she who shall not be named, tell Stringify good night. And what it does is it turns off  my Lutron light in the bedroom, master bedroom lights. It turns off a Wemo light that my  husband's lamp is plugged into. It turns off the Hue light bulb that is in my actual lamp.  It sets my thermostat down to 70 something degrees and it makes sure my blinds are closed.  And it's all one command.  And it's amazing. Okay. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I turn on the attack jog recording?  So you should buy this.  Let me ask you one more question. And that is which thermostat do you recommend? Which  one do you use? Do you use a Nest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a Nest and I have an Ecobee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm tempted because here's why I want the Ecobee. Because I want one with remote  thermometer mesh because the thermostat's in the hall, but it overheats our bedroom  because the hall is colder than the bedroom. So I want to have a little thermometer in the bedroom.  That's Ecobee, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The speculation is that...  Nest was...  Yeah, that's Ecobee. There is speculation that Google's about to launch that though.  Just so you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Danny raised his hand.  I have a Sensee.  A Sensee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's on the wall over there.  I never heard of that one.  Thanks to the good folks at Wirecutter, it was their recommended thing. And it's about $60.  I have a Nest downstairs, but I have Sensees on the two thermostats in two different rooms upstairs.  They're great. For the three times a year, I have to turn on the heating in the house.  Or the air conditioning. But you want remote access to them, you can get them that way as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sensee is spelled S-E-N...  S-N-S-I.  S-N-S-I. Of course. Because why should it be easy?  The best smart... Well, you know what? Wirecutter now says the Nest is the best smart thermostat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does the Sensee work with Amazon Echo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it does.  How do you know T...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just haven't gotten around to setting it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Emerson makes the Sensee. How interesting. I didn't know they were still around.  All right. Yeah, the Wirecutter is a great resource, I have to say.  They now are saying the Nest is the best.  But they did talk about the Sensee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it depends on your smart thermostat needs too, right? For me,  like the Nest has all that fancy stuff. I'll learn all these things.  But you don't need that because you live in Orange County. It doesn't ever...  Yeah. It's like two times a year I turn on the air conditioning and  three times a year I turn on the heating. It's mainly so I don't have to get off the couch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I don't get off the couch, I will gain even more weight. So I better probably  not put any of this stuff in.  Stacey covers all this...
