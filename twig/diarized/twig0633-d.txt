Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When Posey was first born and stuff, but we Cory's been a long time  Inspiration on this network for since practically since we started Stacey has tech TV since tech TV. Did we talk to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wow. Oh, yeah  Several times I used to you know, EFF offices were around the corner on Shotwell Street  That's right, and I used to just walk over you were the spokes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Spokes model for the Electronic Frontier Foundation  Like that, yeah like that now at pluralistic net  which is I  Recommended it I'm blogged about it  not that anybody reads my blog as soon as I saw you move from  Boing boing over here because I love your links and this is really a traditional link blog where it's just a  Link role of great stuff and I'm really glad that you you do this. So thank you for doing it  you also write on on  medium and  When Jeff heard you were gonna be on he said oh we got to talk about dead letters  This is your piece from three days ago on medium  Email could be the last  Federated internet technology alone drew me in but it isn't  And Cory's on mastodon. We are we have a mastodon instance twit dot social which is federated as well  The idea being that anybody can run a server but servers can inter communicate  So you could follow people on other servers just like email you can address them on other servers if you have the fully  You know a full fully qualified the email domain name and all that stuff  What is the what is the benefit of a federated network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, look, you know network effects are really powerful and anytime you start talking about big tech and tech concentration winner-take-all  Someone's gonna start talking about network effects and go like look you join Facebook  Because your friends were on Facebook and then other people join Facebook because you were on Facebook and that's how Facebook got big  And that's why we have winner-take-all but it's not true  Because while that's how Facebook got big it's not how it stayed big and the way that it stayed big is  By raising the switching costs  so if you leave Facebook you have to convince all of your friends to leave Facebook with you or  Leave them behind and actually there was some pretty damning stuff in the new FTC complaint against Facebook  Where there's these executives emailing Zuck and saying like hey  We're gonna add this photos product now and try to get people to put their family photos in Facebook  So even when they hate Facebook and want to leave they'll stay because the price of leaving will be leaving behind  Your family photos, right?  It's it's so network effects are how you get big but high switching costs are how you take everybody a hostage so that you can  Stay big and the thing about Federation is it means you can move around  It means that if you know it turns out that  You made a mistake when you helped elect Mark Zuckerberg Pope Emperor of the social internet for three billion people  You can go somewhere else without having to say goodbye to all the people who aren't ready to make the the jump yet  And so Federated Networks are a way both to safeguard your own kind of digital self-determination  So you can decide how you're gonna live your digital life  But also a way to discipline people who might be tempted to try and compromise your interests in favor of theirs  You know like the the reason the thing that you can take away really from the West the Facebook whistleblower report is that  Facebook sometimes thinks about what its users want  But if it ever finds a thing that it would make its users life better  But its shareholders lives worse the users lose every time and the reason for that is that it knows you're not gonna go anywhere else  Because of the high switching costs, you know, this is that old Lily Tomlin sketch, you know, we don't have to care  We're the phone company right where else you're gonna go, you know  Tooting cans and a string so if you can federate things if you can leave and go somewhere else  Even if you never do it if the option is there  Firms treat you better and if they don't you can do something and so that's why I  Try never to get locked into anyone else's walled garden, you know, I try to try to pursue this publishing strategy  They call posse post own sites indicate everywhere  My readers are obviously like mostly not gonna find me on RSS or my blog  Which are you know federated and open and so everything also gets manually mirrored as Twitter threads and Macedon threads and tumblr posts and  Medium posts and whatever but the permalinks the place where all that stuff lives the canonical thing is  My own site and if I ever reference something I've ever written  It's always a reference to my own site and not to say the Twitter thread  Even if the Twitter thread got read more because I want the Canon  You know the thing other people refer to the long-term stock that I develop  To be something that I control and that I'm not under the thumb of someone at some other firm  You know, even if you liked and trusted Jack  If he gets like if he goes off to like whatever it is he does bowhunter an ox and has a horrible accident  And and then you know next week like Rupert Murdoch buys the service out  You know, what are you gonna do? Right? So that's why that's why it's really important to at least have the option of an escape hatch  Cory, can I see a question that came up last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  And and bless you you're the greatest warrior I know for freedom of expression and and and I love you for that  So in that I'm not I'm not endorsing what I'm about to say  But right now there's a lot of calls for playing whack-a-mole with bad stuff on the internet  Right, and and how do we get rid of of of January 6 conspiracies and vaccine disinformation and blah blah blah  Does a federated world make that impossible to even contemplate? It's pretty much impossible now. Anyway, I know that  but does it does it does it make the the the dreams of the authoritarians or  the legislators  in hearings  even harder

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, look, I mean when stuff is unambiguously unlawful there's always gonna be remedies and there's just gonna be like a cost-benefit decision  Right. Like do you want to bother like say say say it's illegal  to infringe copyright, which it is right and  example and and you know  Like say this is a real example actually say you're James Joyce's idiot grandson Steven Joyce  The hundredth anniversary of Bloomsday and you send a letter to every pub in Ireland  I know no one gets to read you listen here. Are I gonna come down on you like a ton of bricks?  Technically, it's illegal. I think most pubs where it happened. It didn't didn't affect them  Right. So, you know, there's it's true that  You know we cannot always enforce all unlawful speech  But if I tell you what if people like organized a giant rally  To do that, you know, say a civil disobedience rally to read to read Ulysses  You know, Stephen Joyce would know where to find them and could get them, you know could pull the plug on them  So you do get to damp the scale when speeches on lawful in any event, right?  If so long as it's it has to stay below the threshold of being easily noticed and enforced against but you know  I think that you know when we talk about vaccine misinformation or disinformation  Most of that is not illegal  Right. So like, you know, this is the thing that whenever we talk about repealing section 230 God help us all take a drink  You know, we are  Mostly people are saying well if if if big platforms had to worry about liability for user speech  then a bunch of stuff that we don't like wouldn't be there like hate speech or like  Some forms of harassment or vaccine disinformation or whatever none of that speech is illegal  Like I don't know what they think is gonna get them that now, you know firms  Can take the choice to remove that stuff. I personally hope they do if I were running a message board I would but um  You know the the reality is that speech that is lawful will take place somewhere and even speech that's unlawful  But hard to detect will take place somewhere, you know, there there are  tables and diners where people are  Planning bank jobs and it's true that if like we could get all of those diners to monitor their diners speech  Though the eaters speech we could probably prevent a bank job or two at the margins  And if everyone were forced to eat in one giant restaurant, then it would be easier to monitor everyone's speech  But like I think that there's better ways to prevent bank robberies, you know, I'm not endorsing bank robberies. I am anti bank robbery  I I just don't think that like this is the right approach to to limit unlawful speech  And I think we have to make our peace with there being lawful speech  Even though we don't like it and learn learn to ignore bad speech better  or counter it or or  Impose penalties for it, right? There's social sanction like free speech is not consequence free speech, right?  I can say I never want to talk to you again because of the way you talk  Right and and I can ask my friends to say  Don't talk to this person again because the way they talk, you know, there are consequences that follow from speech, right?  Someone might decide not to hire you. Look, I'm like in the midst of applying for US citizenship here  There are a lot of things that I don't post to the internet because I understand that one of the consequences might be  That someone who works for the immigration service might look at it take it out of context or even understand the context and decide  That I don't have what it takes to be an American  I mean there are consequences to speech and there should be consequences to speech. There just shouldn't be  a  law  Against saying odious things there can be other forms of sanction against saying odious things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well spoken very well. Yeah. Yeah, I agree 100%  And and by the way stay James Joyce's idiot grandson passed away some years ago. So you can go libel the dead  And next Bloomsday, go ahead. Go ahead read read Ulysses aloud. It's okay  I'm sorry and you wanted to ask a question

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he was talking about the the expensive switching costs from getting off of something like Facebook or even Twitter or what have you?  You just detailed a lot of different information that shows just how  Bad things could be on these platforms and the benefits of going to something federated yet. People aren't doing it  Yes, the real problem is a way we can take your photos off of Facebook and put them on Flickr and  Everything else is out there, but people aren't going to do it. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the hang up here? So I you're you're talking about well  There's two things that are probably accounting for why people are staying there actually three if we want to be really generous  So the generous explanation is maybe people actually like it, you know  There's this kind of economics idea of reveal preferences people what people do they secretly like I think is you know  demonstrably untrue in at least some cases  There's another problem which is collective action, right?  It may be that you don't like Facebook  but you can't organize all your friends to leave Facebook and so you stay because the  the combination of of the not liking Facebook and the cost of getting everyone to go somewhere else is so high and  You can't manage it and that's where lowering switching costs can really help  So there's a group that we worked with that EFF who are breast cancer pre-vibers  So they have the BRCA gene and that means that they are  Often sick sometimes  fatally ill  They are at risk of being sick  They're contemplating major surgeries like radical  Mastectomies and they have aunts and daughters and mothers and other family members who are sick or died  And so there's a lot of trauma there and Facebook really aggressively courted them to join the platform  About a decade ago  There was a real push to bring medical communities into Facebook because they're very sticky, right?  like there are reasons there, you know, once you find your medical group you stay and  One of the members who was not a technologist but just was curious and smart  She was poking around and she found this huge bug in Facebook  Where you could enumerate the membership of any group on Facebook without being a member of it?  And this is obviously very alarming for her kind of group. It's alarming more generally Facebook shouldn't work that way  So she took her bug report to Facebook and they said that's not a bug report. It's a feature request  We're not gonna abide by it  It's a won't fix and she made a lot of stink and they said finally, okay  And I guess it's because their ad tech stack benefited from this enumeration thing, but they said finally, okay  You can enumerate a group membership, but only if you're a member of the group, which is still not sufficient for them  It's still a big privacy risk  So for years they've been trying to figure out how to get everyone off of Facebook  Now imagine if they could stand up a diaspora instance, right?  Which is like this Fediverse alternative to Facebook and they could federate it with Facebook through like an API  or maybe if Facebook didn't want to collaborate, but if they could you know be assured that  They wouldn't face legal jeopardy  They could like use bots and scrapers to pull messages out of the group and put them in the diaspora  Instance and then take the responses from the diaspora group and put them back into Facebook. That's how Facebook started  They used to do that with myspace because of course, you know Rupert Murdoch wasn't gonna let his users go willingly  And so Facebook which pitched itself as the pro privacy alternative to myspace where we only show your data to your friends  Gave people this way to grab their waiting inbox from myspace to reply to it on Facebook and push it back  Out with a footer that said I sent this from Facebook. Why are you still on myspace, right?  and  They could do this and they could have a footer on their messages that said this was sent from the pre-viver diaspora instance  Today or you know yesterday?  27% of our traffic originated off Facebook once that reaches 60%  we are going to start a timer that lasts for 28 days and then we're gonna sever the link and  Here's how to find out more about joining the group off Facebook and and you know if they could do that they could  resolve that collective action problem and  And rather than try to organize international everyday leaves Facebook day next Wednesday at 3 in the afternoon  they could let people trickle out one at a time in the same way that like  you know at one point you probably had a hotmail account and  Then you notice that all your friends had gmail accounts and eventually you got a gmail account  You kind of let your hotmail account languish, right?  We didn't have international quit hotmail and join gmail day. We defeated the collective action problem with a low switching cost

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But aunt makes an excellent point. I mean diaspora has been around for a decade. I don't see I forgot I had an account

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but there's no way to get your friends on to diaspora unless you all do it at once  Yeah, right so you can you can go and sit on Leo's diaspora and hope your friends eventually have the light. Yeah  Quit and quit Facebook with you  But like that's that's um a really low probability event like it does sometimes happen  You do see surges sometimes of people quitting because stuff gets bad and often it's a slowly at first and then all at once thing  Last week a bunch bunch of people quit  What's happened join signal for a little precipitating event right sometimes that happens?  And you know signal has this advantage that your whatsapp identity is your phone number and your signal identity is your phone number  And so the switching cost is super low  Right all you do is install signal and tells you which of your whatsapp friends have signal accounts  And people have criticized signal for this right for for having this, but you know it's um  It's a mixed blessing  But it does allow people to very easily migrate from one platform to another  And again that that kind of makes sure that signal behaves itself better. It's one of the the best hedges we have  Against moxie suddenly becoming evil moxie right which you know like no one is immune to it people  People are really good at kidding themselves especially when it's like well  Either I make this little compromise or the hundred friends. I convinced to quit their jobs are  And come work for me are gonna lose their jobs next week and none of their kids are gonna  Go to college right people are really good at talking themselves into compromises  But if that compromise comes with and then the next day all my users are gonna quit signal because it's so easy to leave  Then maybe that's the thing that stays their hand  Maybe that's the they call it the Ulysses pact right where you tie yourself to the mast before you sail into the waters  Because because you know you're strong now  But you know you might be weak in the future one conceivable remedy then might be to make

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Make migration costs lower make it require Facebook to allow you to do that  I'm sure Facebook prevents you right now from saying hey join me in the BRCA group on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Diaspora yeah well you can export your data  But you can't do a real-time link and you can export your data mostly because of GDP our compliance and CCPA compliance  And it's not great  There's not a lot of other places to go because a one-time export is useful if you're like giving your papers to a library  Or if there's another service that that works like it where all your friends are already  And you can get your data out and put it back somewhere else

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just looking at the access act which was created in the Senate by the  That's what I was just talking about.  The alliance of Josh Hawley and Dick Blumenthal and Mark Warner  It's been in committee for two years now. I don't no no no no no it's in the house now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's in the house now.  There's a new bill there's it's part of a package of five antitrust bills  They had a 32 hour markup session, and it's progressing and there's also the DSA and DMA in Europe  So there's actually a lot of action on this and so these are bills that would require the big platforms to expose an API  And you know the problem is who gets to plug into it so in the hearings Zoloftgren raised some pretty good points like  What if Cambridge Analytica wants to interoperate with Facebook or what if it's the Chinese government you know and the answer isn't  Well, I guess we'll just let Facebook keep us safe  From the bad guys because like if our line of defense against Cambridge Analytica is Facebook. I have really bad news for you  Facebook already let Cambridge Analytica get all your data right so maybe maybe instead of letting a  Boardroom full of heavily conflicted billionaires and Mountain View decide  Who is and isn't a fit entity to plug into the service?  Maybe we could have like a freestanding privacy law that  Determined what you were allowed to do with that data and so access act actually has some of that access act says  You can't commercialize the data  You can't process the data beyond what is needed to enable communication between your users and Facebook's users  And you have to let users take the data with them so that that that is a pretty good hedge against it  But what would be much better would be if we had a national privacy law that had a meaningful consent regime  And what they call the private right of action  Which is the right to sue companies that violate the law?  Instead of like writing letters to the Attorney General when you get screwed and begging them to take up your case

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is the California Privacy Act the CCPA is that is that a step in the right direction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a step, but it doesn't have the private right of action right and the reason it doesn't have the private right of action  Is that they correctly assessed that if there were a private right of action the tech platforms would  go like thermonuclear to stop it because they they are willing to bet that they can mollify  buy-off or at least take the temperature of  regulators and lawmakers or  Enforcers that might come after them, but what they don't want is what they have in Europe, which is the Max Schrems problem  So, I don't know if you know Max. He's a wonderful dude  He was a law student from Austria went to Stanford went back to Europe and was like wait a second Facebook is totally violating  European  Privacy law I'm gonna make them give me my data and find out how bad it is and they like stonewalled him and he was like  I've got a law degree and nothing else to do like I can make your life a living hell  Right and and they they gave him his data and and the violations that revealed  Were the impetus that created some of the largest fines in corporate history anywhere in the world  mm-hmm, and now he's going after Facebook and Google again for not complying with the GDPR and  He's brought his case  I believe in Germany because the thing is that one of the ways in which the GDPR is flawed and it's it's like it's  Got many imperfections. One of the serious ways it's flawed is that  Ireland is the tax haven where all the tech companies have their headquarters  It's how like Apple and so on they maintain this fiction that their money is like never touched the earth  it's just like floating in the Irish Sea with Stephen Joyce's ashes and and and  And  Ireland is where as a result the Information Commissioner's office in Ireland is  The place where cases are heard if you have a complaint against them against the the big platforms the big tech companies  And because that's where the European HQ is and the Irish Information Commissioner's office  Like they don't even bother putting on pants in the morning. They just like sit around eating breakfast cereal and watching soap operas  Like the Germans here like 500 cases a year and like the Irish here like seven  And so, you know, that's that's why they don't want the private right of action because if you have to get an Information Commissioner  To to intercede or an attorney general or a solicitor general or a DA or someone to intercede on your behalf  They can figure out like even if they can't buy them off  They can go like they're never gonna go nuclear over this tiny little violation  we'll just pretend this part of the law doesn't exist and just and just like, you know go along merrily and extract some profit that  way, but you don't know where there's a  You know  vindictive  Brilliant once in a generation law student like Max Schrems sitting in Austria, you know eating versht and planning world domination

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He looks like a vegetarian for sure if the private right of action exists, let's say in privacy I  Just smell a little trouble Will Robinson in that  That's what the right and parts of the left are using to go after 230 if we only had a private right of action  They all get sued for the speaker was the speech of the public that everything be okay  And of course, that's not the case  But that's what they're saying is Facebook should be able to be sued for anything that anybody says on it and that of course  Yeah, there's a really big difference though

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because with the so 230 like let's be clear 230 does not exempt Facebook from liability for the things that Facebook says Facebook  So Facebook if Facebook writes something unlawful they liability for it  They just don't face liability for what other people do and a private right of action  For a privacy law is not about letting you sue Facebook because someone doxed you on Facebook, right?  It's about letting you sue Facebook because Facebook collected information on you without your permission  And so it's not about what other people do on Facebook  It's what people at Facebook do so in that regard it'd be actually pretty similar to 230 as we know and love it  It would just be the the it would cause Facebook to bear responsibility for violations of the law that it or its employees  engaged in and it would have to have a compliance regime and you know, like I think that there are Facebookers who would say but how  Could we possibly have three billion users and hundreds of thousands of employees and all these subcontractors and gather all this information and then not  Inadvertently break a law that says information can't be gathered a process without permission and like my answer is yeah, you probably can't  That's like me saying, you know, I'm gonna have a law that if you keep nuclear waste  It has to be safely maintained and you say but I have this leaky swimming pool in my backyard full of leak nuclear waste  How am I gonna keep my leaky swimming full pool full of nuclear waste if I'm responsible if it leaks and the answer like just  Like the you know doctor it hurts when I do that don't do that  Right, like maybe the way that we stop Facebook from being creepy and invasive is by  Prohibiting it from gathering information that it cannot meaningfully contain

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You you write Facebook shouldn't be in charge of how you use Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, that's an article about a really cool little plug-in called unfollow everything  It's chrome plug-in that our British developer made  Yeah, that's right  Yeah  And so this is a really interesting example of how Facebook and other platforms can weaponize  Laws that aren't privacy laws and kind of privacy wash what they're doing, you know  They can say oh well  like the reason we invoked our terms of service or whatever is because we think you're violating privacy and  You know  Like the way that we can figure out if someone's violating privacy is if they violated a privacy law  Not because Mark Zuckerberg's lawyers figured out how to shut someone down for a terms of service violation  And then just wave their hands and went privacy privacy privacy that doesn't make it a privacy violation  So that the unfollow everything this this developer in in the UK sat down a little chrome plug  Oh, no, he didn't write the chrome plug-in first first  He just went through Facebook and unfollowed everything all the pages all the friends all the groups  So, you know, he's still friends with the friends. They're just not in his timeline  In fact, there was nothing in his newsfeed now  He could go and look at what his friends were doing and when he was done he was done or he could follow them if they  Were people he wanted to see from but what he didn't get his infinite scroll  So eventually pull to refresh and there'd be nothing new. I see it. I've seen it all  Yeah, come to the end of the internet. The internet is over  We'll have more internet for you and he loved it  What a great idea. Yeah, and so then he wrote a plug-in to make it automatic because Facebook makes it hard. He made it easy  It's scriptable and  Everybody who used it loved it. They were like this. This is how I like using Facebook  Like I wanted to quit Facebook now. I'm glad to use Facebook  I use it less and the time that I spend there is satisfying and so Facebook hit him with the terms of service  Violation and they said, you know, you have to take this down  You swore on your on your mother's grave when you signed our terms of service that you wouldn't do stuff that upset our shareholders  You've broken your promise you're kicked off Facebook and  You that those terms of service are still binding on you  Don't think that just because you're not a Facebook user you you can't you can go ahead and make Facebook plugins  You cannot the terms of service prohibit you forever  Don't even think about about making a Facebook plugin ever again. And here's the thing, you know when Zuck  Posted his like internal rebuttal to the whistleblower. He said like it's it's stupid. Why would we make  Facebook in a way that deliberately made people unhappy. We don't want unhappy users advertisers don't want unhappy users either  And he's right that if there was a way to make his  Advertisers and his shareholders happy that didn't make the users unhappy  He would all other things being equal prefer his users to be happy  But if there's a way to be happier on Facebook while using it less  That's a thing that his advertisers and shareholders that are a lot more yeah, there are a lot more  You know  Four square for their own interest there  They don't care if you're unhappy if the alternative is you don't use Facebook as much right?  And so, you know, it's kind of a little existence proof and it's it's proof that  You know if we are to have a Facebook that's a good Facebook, which some people will say is possible  I'm a skeptic. I am a Zucker vegan, but some people say that it's possible  We can't leave Facebook in charge of it like there has to be at the very least there has to be an escape hatch  There has to be a way for you to configure Facebook  So that it serves your interests and not Facebook shareholders interests because that at least will be the thing at the boardroom table  When everyone's sitting around planning a new  algorithmic tweak and someone says, you know, I think this is gonna make the users unhappy and someone else says  What are they gonna do? We're the phone company. We don't have to care  The other one goes some kid in England's gonna write a plug-in and then they're all like, oh, yeah  No, it's not gonna work. Huh? Okay, we'll do something different and if they go ahead and do the stupid thing  Some kid in England gets to write a plug-in you get to undo the dumb thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did and the way you make Facebook do this is a digital regulator of some sort

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some it's a couple of things. So one thing we could do is  There's probably gonna be an antitrust settlement in Facebook's future or at least to transfer it Facebook is probably gonna cry uncle at a certain point  And offer a settlement to regulate us says Facebook regulate us  Yeah, yeah, right. Well, it depends if they do that from a position of strength or weakness  I mean the regulate us the Facebook version of regulate us is  Please impose a bunch of rules that will cost us 1% of our annual turnover to comply with but will be so expensive that no one  Can ever enter the market and compete with us right?  Yeah, their first preference is no rules the second preference is rules only they can comply with right right  But but if they if they throw in the towel, right if they if they say like we're willing to entertain a settlement  Then the FTC could say great. You've got a special master from now on, you know, your adult supervision  Anytime you're gonna threaten someone with any kind of lawsuit over copyright patent in terms of service  Torsious interference with contract cyber security, whatever  You just gotta weave it under the special masters nose and they got to make sure that you are not using this  Anticompetitively that there's like a bonafide II think because Facebook will tell you quite truthfully  That there are a lot of people Facebook defends you against right like they have a whole division full of hard-working  Really smart good at their job people who block a bajillion scams a day and hackers and information thieves and  Identity thieves and whatever they just none of those people's job is to defend you against Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a precedent for this the FTC's consent decree with Microsoft put a special master in place

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who would be a good special master for Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so Microsoft special master was a fellow we know and love named Lawrence Lessig. That was pretty cool. That was yeah  I mean max Shrem's. Yeah, there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  somebody really  somebody somebody really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really finally important good Austrian to our political apparatus  You know after that after the unbroken string of dismal Austrian starting with Von Hayek and Schwarzenegger

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'd finally get a really great Austrian. I think this bet you could argue the special master was good for the  Society but was good for Microsoft in the long run

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't hurt. Well, I mean it's I mean  I think the thing that was good for Microsoft was that they managed to get a judge to overturn the order that would have broken  Them up that's what saved that was the victory. Yeah. Yeah, but you know what like it wasn't an all-out defeat for us either  for the for the public interest because  Being dragged through antitrust hell for seven years was hard on Microsoft  Yeah, the Bill Gates deposition that went viral on VHS in which Gates just loses it and just it's like hours of him being like  Petulant and idiotic and you know, like just just awful and humiliating and it's you know, it's on YouTube  You should look at it now  That really changed the internal calculus like when you talk to  Microsoft ease who were executives who were top people about why Microsoft didn't crush Google the way they crushed Netscape  Because they could have done it just as easily  They say we didn't want to end up in front of the FTC again  Yeah, and and when actually and you know in 2019 Kara Swisher asked Gates  How come you let Google buy Android? How come you didn't buy Android?  He said oh we were distracted by the antitrust stuff  But the antitrust case ended seven years for the Android acquisition what he meant was that seven years later  we were so traumatized and  Worried of being tied to the you know  Grill of the FTC's pickup truck and driven up and down a gravel road  That we just didn't want to do stuff that was gonna look bad  And you know Google never went through that and you know  Google has made the best search engine that there ever was and I don't want to see Google disappear  Google I want Google to like stop acting like antitrust law isn't a thing  I want Google to be afraid of the public interest being asserted against it  I want Google to be the Google that it was back in like  2003 when Larry and Sergey came and spoke at a Kevin Wurbach conference and said look guys  Here's the thing you need to know  We're gonna be the best company we can be because all it takes to switch away from a search engine is to change your bookmarks  And so all we're gonna be committed to from now on is just making you as happy as possible and not being evil  Right and and you know I want that Google back and the way we get that Google back is by making them afraid  That if they don't do it that they will face meaningful enforcement consequences that will do to them  What happened to Bill Gates what happened to IBM for 12 years?  And made them unwilling to make their own operating system  So they got Bill Gates to make an operating system for them when the PC came out  I want them to be worried that being  Ostentatiously terrible has consequences even if you have some high switching costs

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cory doctor is our guest. It's always a pleasure to have Cory on his website pluralistic net. What's the latest book? Oh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well the latest book is the paperback let me see if I can find it the paperback of attack surface  So this is the third good. Yeah, I came out last week  And I just got the German edition of it in the mail like half an hour ago  I just went and picked it up what's German for attack surface. I don't remember  It's not you know, then surface and bone attack  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hang on a second like they like to completely change titles. Yeah, well we do the same thing we do that looks never work  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a dirty secret that the original title of thus bake their a soustra their Zarathustra in German is like do you want fries with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not true kids not true

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's called off stand out stunt  Outstand, yeah, I know more words von Edward Snowden. Oh  Nice forward. Yeah  For me. Yeah, it's got a beautiful cover, too. It's it's a it's a gorgeous package. They've actually just reissued the whole  Trilogy in German with matching livery. It's very beautiful  Yeah, and I just closed a deal with my publisher for four novels in 2023 and 2024  I've got a nonfiction book coming out into one do have work to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Engulfing fame Instagram

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Instagram and actually, you know, he says what you've been saying Jeff  He does you know, we we were talking a lot about Hogan's testimony in front of Congress last week  He says as a pundit I find Hogan's proposal to raise the minimum age for using social media to be a reasonable precaution  She also make it a strong case for lawmakers and regulators to impose radical transparency on Facebook  But as a parent of kids just a couple shot years shy of teenage and my concerns are more immediate  should I let my kids get smartphones at some point and explore the wilds of  Instagram tick-tock and  Whatever actually cool internet things kids are using now. I've never heard of is so at what age and  He says the answer that almost every parent except maybe Cory gives I don't know and I don't know  Does your daughter have a smartphone Cory? Is she on Instagram?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, you know like I have never managed to do this but the person I know who's managed this most gracefully  And I actually haven't asked if he's managed to keep it up is my friend Benjamin Rosenbaum  Who's another science fiction writers debut novel came out this year?  and we've written together and his wife is a  Cognitive behavioral therapist and their family has this rule  where anyone can play a  yellow card on anyone else Oh for being like being not great and  Once there are three yellow cards accumulated and I don't know the period like a week say  It turns into a red card and no one's allowed to use their devices  In I guess now in lockdown will be different, but when they were all home together  So all the devices go away. Everyone eats meals together  The way this just if you get a red card everybody stops using everybody in the house  so it treats the problems of  Isolation and technology use as a social problem among a community and not an individual dysfunction

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a hole for a kid. That could be a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's your fault too, but then they stop right right. I mean I it's it's  So what it does is it provides this guy so he had a couple of small kids at the time  so it gave them a kind of game theoretical like  Thermonuclear button right where either one of them could force the other one to lose their device for however long  It's a prisoner's dilemma  Then they would too do I know  But it was hard on the parents. Yeah, right. So you you I don't know if you're all parents, but you know, like  when your parent right there are times where you're like  balancing priorities between work and  Attention to your kid or even leisure and playing attention to your kid, right?  Your kid wants to do something or want something from you and you're like watching some must TV  a book or tired or whatever and  If your kid can yellow card you my god and take away your phone at night for a week, that's revolutionary  Yeah, so I have never had the guts to do it. No, but but Ben is  Remarkably well adjusted as are his kids and the book I believe is called unearth. I should look it up here. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have it right here the unraveling

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unraveling that's it. Yeah, I blurred it  I just couldn't remember what it was called because I read it as a electronic manuscript where it didn't have a cover  So I didn't have to look at the cover every day  It's a superb novel super weird and amazing and big our future comedy of manners and social unrest

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if they have yellow cards in this one because  Every person in this has nine parents that could really be a problem, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That could be like three bodies everyone's got like three or four bodies as well. It's quite an amazing  No, it's like one of these big  you know weird science fiction novels that just like  starts you at the bottom of a mine shaft ten miles underground and then rockets you to the surface at a hundred miles an  hour and you just gotta like grab on and hold on to it and like  Figure out where it's going  Family are like super well adjusted at least from what I can tell they live in Switzerland now  So a couple of times when I've been out there  I've gone and hung out with them and they seem like a very well adjusted group of people and you know, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean they used to you can you can be self you can be well adjusted

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just learned that Switzerland has seven presidents. So this is a perfect place for him to live. Yeah. Yeah, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, but they lived in DC for a long time  Then they moved to I think his wife is Swiss and they moved to Switzerland  but he's um, you know, he's one of these guys with an IQ that could boil water, you know, and like his his he's  He's really like into being very thoughtful and also outre and I always wished I'd had the guts  To do what he did or at least be like more mindful and the thing I think the genius of what he did with his kids  Is that he did it to himself too?  Right the the thing that always determined that my kid was gonna be a screen zombie is that I'm a screen zombie, right?  Right, like we have all these adorable and slightly horrifying photos of my kid when she was like, you know a larvum  Sitting like across my chest while I blogged, you know snoozing, you know  Like if you grow up under those circumstances, you're gonna wanna like  Find out what's on the other side of the screen, right?  Like that's why cats walk on your keyboard, right?  Because you pay attention to it so they're gonna pay attention to it, you know, and so yeah, it's some I  Can't say that I'm thrilled with how anyone in my family including me use our devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Farhad who I have to say of late I have had harder and harder time agreeing with  Ever since he became an opinion columnist, which which is which is true of me, too  Yeah, that's why this one's but I think his point is not is not wrong. He's the question  He says is social media a danger to teenagers?  I'd actually extend that a danger to society and he says we have no idea. That's the answer, right?  And I think he's probably right. We don't we don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The times I think a day before which he quotes by Lauren Steinberg headline is does Instagram harm girls?  No one actually knows  This is the to me the key of the whole discussion now is we desperately need research on impact and the only way we get  By having data and that that's what the regulators should be pressing the companies for is  Transparency of data for this research to occur because we're we're making up all kinds of interventions and laws  and and moral panics  Not knowing what's actually happening and and the fear is you could get to this point where you say comic books are hurting everybody  Comic books are gonna screw up the world comic books are awful or movies or there's a there's a great does he says

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Comics television rock music rap music disco video games ebonics political correctness all have generated  Panic which is in the past if I may be the size these two conversations though  It does seem there's a way a way clear to regulating Facebook regulating Twitter regulating YouTube, which is  Let let the data flow, you know, let others do studies and release your studies  I love the idea of some sort of ombudsman or a master who can master who can say, you know and data portability  Critical. I mean those things don't break up these companies don't really inhibit these companies dramatically

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But give us some say potentially create a lot of innovation if you're hired to have an API  Imagine what can be done with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so like I think that I think there's a lot to that  I mean there the low-hanging fruit is just  Prohibiting Facebook from stopping people from figuring out how Facebook works, right?  That's that's like there is lots of other stuff we could do about like making Facebook tell us how it works  But you know, there's this ongoing lawsuit with New York University's engineering department where they make a free open browser plugin called ad observer  that takes a grab of every ad you see and  And puts it in a thing called ad observatory and then researchers go and they look and they see whether or not Facebook is  Adhering to the promises it made about blocking paid political disinformation and they're not right and and Facebook has  Sent legal threats to ad observer to shut it down  Looks like they might drag them into court at this point  They argue that they're violating the terms of service that they're compromising user privacy. It's categorically untrue  These are free and open plugins. It's my Facebook. I'm saving stuff from my face. Yeah  The Facebook is trying to stop its own users from telling researchers what happens with what they're seeing. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but this isn't asking all the source you're I'm not scraping well, I guess I am scraping Facebook  But I'm doing it on my own Facebook's the stuff I yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're just taking pictures of what's on your screen, right? You're just grabbing the  Mala screen, yeah, they can't stop it technologically  I mean they could try right but you know  This is the thing about a platform with three billion users is you've got three million one in a million or three thousand one in  A million use cases every day  So trying to figure out who's a bot or an automated process and who's not like you're gonna get a lot of tuna a lot  Of dolphins in that tuna net and you're gonna have a lot of users are really angry at you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that three thousand one in a million use cases every day  That's yeah, that's a lot of math, but I think I follow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right, right. So so, you know if we could just like if we could just  Adjust the rules for violating terms of service such that Facebook couldn't intimidate small  engineering groups at public universities  from out of out of  Doing accountability work that just measures how the service works, right?  Especially like in light of them shutting down crowd tangle which was their internal  Analytics thing that they let researchers use to figure out how Facebook worked and it showed that the most popular stuff on Facebook was objectively terrible  So they said oh crowd tangles broken, right? It was broken because it was accurate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're gonna actually I think crowd tangle was also badly designed in that sense is that it wasn't what is the most popular?  How big is it? There was it? There was a denominator needed there  How big was the most popular thing on Facebook and you couldn't get to that to put it in context  So it was kind of worthless either way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they could have added more detail to crowd tangle instead of shutting it down and then their other research portal  Their other research portal was full of so much bad information that dozens of PhD candidates are having to scrap their dissertations and start over again  Oh, yeah, that's right, right? Why would anyone ever trust Facebook to tell you how Facebook works?  So not only should Facebook not be in charge of how you use Facebook Facebook shouldn't be in charge of how you understand Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's what's encouraging to me is that these are these are solutions that I don't think would be difficult to implement  I don't think they would be controversial  Jeff would you?  Jeff you've been a defender. Would you be open to something like I'm not a defender of Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a defender of the Internet, but I fear that that regulation that goes too far will hurt expression on the Internet  So that's what that's what I'm always on alert for in the transatlantic high-level working group  I was a part of with Susan as former FCC commissioner  This is part of what we urged which is that and I think that is one step more than  Allowing the data it's requiring the data  Yeah, it's saying that and this is the FTC model which Cory was kind of headed to you warranted X  We need to be able to hold you account for to account for that and to do that  We need the data to do this in the researchers hands and then it also means the government has to kind of  The whole group got mad at me when I'd say this but government in a way has to provide a safe harbor to say don't  Use the GDPR excuse and don't use the  Cambridge analytic excuse we're going to vet say we government the regulator gonna say we're gonna say yes  You must require this and that's so you can hide behind us  One of the gonna have the data out of you one of the things Francis Hawkins wanted to get a word in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just wanted to thank you Cory. I'm sure I'm oversimplifying this but I just wonder where's the line drawn because  Facebook has a bit of intellectual property here. This is their product. This is their platform  I thought about say like the Nashville hot chicken restaurant there in Memphis, Tennessee  That's just super popular  But yet nobody's banging on their door demanding for that recipe because it's their proprietary recipe and no one's busting at them for not  Sharing it. Why is Facebook any different? They have a product  It's a good point and I think to make it work and keep people hooked on well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're not demanding that they give over the algorithm. We know this recipe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We need to know how many tongues were burnt irreparably from it just the consequence

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I I mean I actually think a better example would be Jamba Juice at one point, you know  Whatever they were using as thickener like, you know, but plutonium powder and asbestos or whatever  They said if you asked for their nutritional the allergen information  They would give you this like three ring binder full of laminated pages  That would say if you are allergic to something call this number and we'll tell you whether or not it's in there  Right and that's like actually we make companies give up there and I don't think that's still the case, right?  It's been a long time since I've been to a Jamba Juice because I don't fly through Oakland Airport anymore  Because travel is a thing that doesn't exist anymore, but I you know back when I used to go to Jamba Juice like  I'm pretty sure that they stopped they stopped making it like go fish, right? Like have you got any eggs go fish?  So we do we do require companies to do stuff and we also  you know some of the things that we're asking a Facebook are the results of  Them making representations prior to a merger so mergers are not  Permitted as a matter of course  You have to get permission from the FTC to undertake a merger  We kind of forget that in this day of aqua hires where you know  Platforms will buy companies more often than you know, you or I buy groceries  But every one of those is nominally subject to scrutiny regulation  Approval and conditional approval right like they can say like as the European Union did you can buy?  WhatsApp and Instagram, but you can't merge their back end which Facebook went and did or as Google did when it bought its ad stack  We are not going to merge the back ends of YouTube and Google and merge your profiles across Google  Products which they did and so I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this makes me think maybe we need an FDA for social media  You wouldn't have to prove it safe and effective, but you'd have to prove it doesn't harm anybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you have to prove that it  Because two steps here one is  The easiest way out of of what the my group said was well, we don't warrant anything. We don't promise you anything  Hey, it's the internet the Wild West. Didn't you call it that? Right? Yeah, and you say no, that's not acceptable  You there has to be a discussion among there is a test

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before there's a promise test right promise from Facebook for sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that so then what happens is and we're and this is where we're we're a right to private action might come in as well  Is that you say because what?  Exactly Corey said about about about a product if the FTC catches you lying about that product, right?  This pen won't stain your shirt. It's stained my shirt  They lied you have action to the Federal Trade Commission to say they lied a pen. Maybe can stain a shirt  That's okay. But if you say it's not going to what it did. We gotcha and you got to try to  Show something so so we have that precedent in in American law at least  Where we can go after for  violating the warrants that you make and  Then the next step of this is is then to say well, how do we do that?  Well, we got to have data to do that  Well, we're gonna require you to reveal data not necessarily to government but to researchers  Whom you could also hold to account for how they do the research. Hello Cambridge Analytica  and say this  We need to open this up so that people can can say surprise  I never thought of this before but look what the data shows show us

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I to me is the key to go  I noted that Francis Hogan has now I've been asked after saying that Facebook lied to their advisory  Council has been asked to testify for the oversight board the oversight board. Can you tell us a little more about that?  That will be interesting. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so here's here's the thing that I I  I think we need to decide what we want to do, right?  some people want to fix the platforms and some people want to fix the internet and  So if you're gonna fix the platforms, it means that you're gonna find a way  That Mark Zuckerberg can be a good  unelected social medias are for three billion people or can be replaced with someone who's better at the job than he is and  if you want to fix the internet you want to make sure that the job unelected social medias are for three billion people doesn't exist ever  again and  The latter is not about making Facebook's algorithms better  It's about making it so that they're less consequential so that you don't have to use Facebook  Even though they may have like a significant fraction of the world's population  Stuck, you know held hostage in a walled garden because you can still talk to them  and so that's where a regulation like a mandatory API or a  defense for  Interoperators who don't use the API but just hack their own API in or both  Which would be the best of all worlds because you know Facebook if they're ordered to have an API  Might then do something to subvert it and then we'd have to wait ten years while they went back and forth with the regulator  Spent a couple billion dollars playing footsie and in court and whatever before we finally got a remedy  So if they subvert it we would also like people to just be able to write bots and scrapers and do whatever it takes to replace  The API with some standalone stuff, right? Like it's great that Microsoft eventually  Standardized the format for for Microsoft Office  But they didn't do that until after Steve Jobs had some Apple engineers reverse engineer all the file formats for office and make the iWork  Suite with pages and numbers and keynote. That's when they actually  Microsoft stopped playing  Shenanigans and actually got serious about having a standardized format and now there's no document lock-in to speak of  And and so, you know that is like a much better future right one in which  We don't rely on Facebook being a benevolent dictator  we make it harder for them to be a dictator at all and  yeah forcing them to like expose their algorithm might be useful in the context of maybe a civil suit or  or even a criminal suit if you thought that their algorithm had done something wrong and you know  there's clearly some things that their algorithms do that are wrong like  you know, it's it is it is  Illegal without exception to discriminate against people when offering them financial products on the basis of their race  And yet Facebook ads do that right as do Google ads. We know that happens. In fact, there was a  lawsuit that the ACLU and the intercept brought against Facebook  That where they are or against the US government rather where they argued that Facebook's theory that the computer fraud and abuse act  Made it illegal for them to create fake users synthetic users  so they could evaluate whether or not Facebook was violating federal law in  discriminating on  engaging in financial discrimination and  The court said that the computer fraud and abuse act didn't reach to that so they could violate Facebook's terms of service  so, you know, there might be instances in which we  Make Facebook provide evidence of how its algorithm works  But I don't think that's how we make the Internet better  That might be how we make Facebook account for bad things it's done  But the way we make the Internet better is not by making Facebook better  It's by making Facebook irrelevant so that you know, if they are bad you can leave

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let the market and so we can invent lots of new things. Yeah, I love this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's we have the agency to invent the Internet to the future. It ain't baked. It ain't done  That's my primary point is I want the freedom to be able to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and you know no one came down off a mount with two stone tablets that said, you know Larry Sergei  Stop rotating your log files and start mining them for actionable market intelligence, right?  There's more than one way to organize the Internet. None of this is foreordained  the the right the way that we went from you know, Del being  Like just Michael Dell in his garage being weird to being a giant company that you know was was  felling the mainframe giants that came before was by  Not allowing IBM to crush the company that supplied Dell with PC ROMs  So that they could make an interoperable PC that could run PC software  And so Phoenix computing made the ROMs Dell put them in their computer. So did compact  So did lots of other people people cloned the ROMs that Phoenix had cloned, right?  They they like they what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander and Phoenix didn't have remedies when that happened  That actually created this dynamic landscape where every year people had a different way to figure out how to make money to make services  to serve a different constituency  To do things that delighted us and then sometimes pissed us off or to get rid of the things that pissed us off and replace them  With something better that was not it's not like a blind adherence to the market  It's it's about allowing the people who use the Internet to exercise self-determination  To decide which services they'll use  How those services will be configured to change those services if they have the technical know-how to do so  yes, ask someone else to change those services if they don't and to be able to  Embrace that ethos from the disability movement nothing about us without us  To you know, the most the purest expression of nothing about us without us is nothing about me without me  At the end of the day I get the veto over how my computer works and the services that I use work  Even though I might make a foolish choice  It's my choice to make because I am here at the whole face, right?  I am the one who knows what I need who knows whether overriding the  Safety measure is the right call to make or not and you as the programmer might be worried that I'm gonna do something stupid  And you might put a lot of warnings in my way that say please don't do this. No, really don't do this  God if you're gonna do this things could go really horribly terribly wrong  You could break your computer and if I just keep typing yes. Yes. Yes  Eventually, it's mine. I get to you know change app stores or do whatever else it is that  I'm trying to do and that you say if I do will result in me coming to some harm. Also, I will  Sorry, I was just gonna say I'll know for the record that right on time now that I'm doing a livecast  There is a leaf blower outside my door. So I will give you're gonna take a break.

Transcript:  Cory did you get up this democracy Leo what but I'm curious for  Right before we went on Twitter released a position paper on the open internet, which is basically to say their prescription for regulation  And considering all three of you have things to say I'd be curious. Do you have do you have the line 92?  I need to 992. Okay  It has five bullet points. So it's simple to be you didn't have to read it. You can create a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does anybody perused it yet I have not read this one yet I did read that Chinese government's open internet order  It's actually wild like one of the things they do is they ban companies from taking countermeasures to block interoperability

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, sometimes you think a democracy is so slow  Just let that you know totalitarian regime would make it all so much easier  And I have to say some of the regulation China's engaging it isn't so bad is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure. I mean I see that what?  China's goal China. So like the the thing that I share with China is I think that that  Firm should not be able to suborn subordinate the state to their shareholders priorities  But I think that where I differ with China is how I think the state should be constituted, right?  I just think I think that the state should be like democratically accountable, but you know the idea that like  In a democracy, it's good to have firms that are so big that you can't regulate them is not really  Coherent, you know  That's that's that's not that that kind of says well, okay  you've got democracy and everything except where these giant companies act on your life, which is everything and  That's not really what we want, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me see if I can pull up this protecting the hashtag open internet by the way  There are two key areas  Avoid entrenching the dominance of the biggest players by protecting competition  Says Twitter easy enough if you're not one of the biggest players  Focus on how content is discovered and amplified less on removal alone  That's interesting questions  Twitter did remove  number of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Controversial but there's blue sky which might or might not bring it back. We'll see I think this is blue sky

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's what is that what this is. That's their that's their version of a federated

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  System does it does it satisfy your your requirements for I like the idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's some weird blockchain nonsense around the perimeters which you know every time I see it  It always turns out to be either a Ponzi scheme or buzzword compliance or both  And I haven't figured out which one it is with Twitter  But I'm sure it's one or one or one of the other both but the actual idea of like an app store for moderation  For for algorithmic sorting. I'm 100% down for that. That's that's kind of the model

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're talking about that excites me to that the speaking level becomes the commodity the value add of  What do you want to see and hear from that? Yeah  Becomes the value add so number three in the list. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I would say that like these principles will look really familiar to you if you've ever read the Santa Clara principles  which are the content moderation principles that were really reified after or refined and finalized after the  New Zealand mosque shootings  Where there was this like moment where people took a pause and were like well  We could we could go 9-eleven after this right we could we could just have  Two lost decades of terrible rules driven by fear or we could actually try and figure out what if  Anything we can do to prevent this right not just say like something must be done there  I've done something now something has been done but actually try and come up with something meaningful that balances out a lot of different  And difficult to balance equities the Santa Clara principles read a lot like this. I have to say I'm impressed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like Twitter of all of the social media companies has done the most  Thinking about this and the most successful work  In this direction, maybe they have less to lose in Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff had it right, you know  If you've got a hundred million users and your major competitors got three billion users, right?  You know when the joke that was going around and Zuck lost six billion dollars off the whistleblower news was he lost one Twitter  Right  well, you know, yeah, but that's but but that's the point right is that like giant firms that are like  Locked on rails because they're worth a trillion dollars and they their their  Shareholders are not going to accept high-risk bets that might compromise that trillion dollar valuation  Really aren't going to be able to do the interesting thing. They're going to be stuck doing the safe thing and  Eventually the same unsafe right? That's how you get IBM, right? That's how you get that's he get cray  That's how you get even SGI right as they were all locked into their their  Path and you know Leo when you were saying we say Microsoft with antitrust  That's the bit I think that did say Microsoft with antitrust as they did have to rethink some of their fundamentals  Which would have you know tapped out anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting article in tech dirt about section 230  Of course Mike Masnick and his crew always very much aggressively in defense of a section 230 point out  In a recent case against Wikimedia that the judge was able to throw out the lawsuit against Wikipedia  Saying nope section 230 says you can't sue them for this  And if you want to save Wikipedia basically the the Mike's contention or actually it was a Glynn Moody writing in Wikipedia's contention  is that if if if you want to if you want to know why section 230 matters  Without it. There'd be no Wikipedia. Yep. Yep. They're they're highly at risk and the boy that that that brings it home

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the case like all all of these cases that actually go to court it's a terrible case  Someone was misidentified as a killer. Yeah, they got the wrong guy right name wrong guy and it and it hurt him a lot and  He Wikipedia  Has a bunch of procedures for preventing that from happening, you know  Writing articles about living people is a big deal on Wikipedia because it was so contentious early on  And it was used to be you know, horrible to people early on, you know  It's part of personal vendettas and their procedures failed, right?  They found a vulnerability in their procedures, which they're going to improve which is really what we want  Right. We want like them to be acting in good faith, which they do  to prevent  Nobody wants the wrong person to be identified as a killer like even the person who misidentified him did not misidentify maliciously  He misidentified or they misidentified him  out of error and so no nobody likes the outcome that that led to this lawsuit, but  Nobody wants to get rid of Wikipedia either and so, you know  like Wikipedia  Has a very strong normative ethic about how they approach this this problem right what their editorial rules are  And it's enforced very vigorously by a community sometimes too vigorously  You know, there's this criticism that Wikipedia is so arcane now to edit in meaningful ways that that it's hard to do  But at the same time, you know, they are teaching us  how to do  crowdsource  distributed  News and information gathering in a responsible way and part of the way that they're doing that is by learning from their mistakes rather than being  Destroyed when they make a mistake, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And and to have that's that to me is the key here too is if it's all a game of gotcha  We're not going to get anywhere if instead you're held to account  For listening to what's going on for understanding the impact for improving what happens  Because and it's all the points made earlier Cory because you have a competitive threat and a regulatory threat and fine  But but but playing gotcha and break them up doesn't doesn't do anything  How do we create new competitors?  How do we create a structure where you're held to account for having something that you say you're gonna have that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Better internet instead of playing. Go ahead. Go ahead Cory and I'll take record just to be on the record  I will say that I wouldn't be opposed to breaking up these big firms  I think at the very least we should unwind the mergers that they undertook on false pretenses if Facebook told a regulator it  Wouldn't merge whatsapp and instagrams back end and then it did we should make them  Spin out whatsapp and instagram same with Google and and it's merged on its back and was well cast in a NBC same with  AT&T and if you merge if you merge on false pretenses, we should break you up at the very  All I'm saying is that doesn't solve it that doesn't solve it  It would do something and it would take up but the problem is it's slow, right?  IBM was in antitrust hell for 12 years  They called it antitrust is Vietnam and during those 12 years IBM spent more money on antitrust lawyers than the entire Department of Justice  Every year for 12 years and in the end they got off the hook because Reagan basically said well  We're not gonna you know Ronald Reagan is not gonna break up  IBM right and and it still was good, right?  Like it was still worth doing that's as I said  That's how we got Microsoft because my IBM really understood that  If we were gonna if if they were gonna keep tying hardware to software that the DOJ would be back at their door  And you know what they did do is break up AT&T. They didn't they didn't sit on them afterwards  They stopped enforcing antitrust law shortly thereafter  So AT&T was able to re merge and become a giant firm  But breaking up AT&T is how we got like modems right right like it was worth doing  You know when we tried when we tried to break up AT&T, you know, they they  Said well look there's this like authoritarian  Asian threat to American business that across the ocean has been copying our intellectual property and  entering the high-tech sector and they're gonna destroy us not company that country was called Japan and  We need our national champion AT&T to defend us against this peril, right?  And  You know if AT&T had been able to suppress modems for another 20 25 years the American soft power and  Industrial activity profits that were generated from the internet would have not  Accrued to the US they might have accrued to another country or they might not have appeared at all  National champions they don't the nation they represent as themselves, right?  AT&T was on AT&T side not America's side Baidu is on Baidu side not China's side. There's my leaf blower. I hear  and and I call them leafy and  And  You know that like that's the thing that I think she shin ping understands and that American  World War two people don't is that like Baidu and Tencent and and all these other big Chinese companies  They are not  Even if they like have state representation and they're under the state's thumb  They are not prioritizing the interests of the Chinese state  they are or they're prioritizing their own interests their executives interests and their shareholders interests and  the only time that the Chinese state gets a look in is when they're afraid of the Chinese state but not because they are like  fronts for the Chinese state and  AT&T was was  Did America's bidding right? They're really important to projecting American power around the world, but AT&T's loyalty was not to America  AT&T was for sale to the highest bidder  They just did work for the Pentagon because the Pentagon would rep would rep for them in the 50s when they tried to break up  AT&T the Pentagon showed up and they said we'll lose the war in Korea if we don't have AT&T like, you know  Womp womp lost the word Korea anyway  But you know, that's why they buttered up the Pentagon not out of like a surplus of patriotism

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before we lose Cory because he's only gonna be here for another five or ten minutes  I want to get another commercial in and get get some final thoughts. We have a lot of these stories  We didn't really mention which is fine  We'll save them. We'll save them for next week, but it's really a pleasure to have Cory Doctorow. Oh, it's great  I hear great. There's a maxim in in chess that the threat is stronger than the execution  I think that might also be the case in antitrust law that the the salutary effects of being under  Investigation for antitrust often seems to be very valuable for both

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As Camus said sometimes you have to execute an admiral to encourage the others

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like Camus probably never did any of that, but okay, that's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think he was ever the king of France now that you mentioned it was kind of theoretical

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But okay, you know, I'll accept it on the lighter side. Did you see Captain Kirk boldly go where a  Few others have gone before but not not anybody over the age of say 88  To watch this morning anybody anybody watch. Oh, yeah, it's kind of cool. I  Have to say it really is an amusement park ride for billionaires, but oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Three minutes my friend Mitch my friend Mitch Wagner posted that he wondered if  Shatner was trying to do a DD Harriman the hero of Heinlein's the man who sold the moon who like  Organizes the first mission to the moon and isn't allowed to go because his shareholders won't let him go because he's too old and  Finally gets aboard a rocket and he goes to the moon and dies  You know because he route really is too old and like if this was how this was how Shatner wanted to go out  I mean, you know that Canadians are like criminally weird. So I have to say for 90 Shatner is sharp

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He he sustained five G's on the way back and without any ill effects  he was it was actually very moving if you haven't seen the  He's in tears  Jeff Bezos  Interrupts him to say let's spray everybody with champagne, but after a while Bezos settles down  Do you think Bezos is gonna kiss every single person who goes up in the?  Or is this pretty much it like from now on you're on your own  How much does he single? Yeah  Oh, I noticed his girlfriend was with him and made a made a point of hugging everybody who got off the crap  But especially mr. Shatner how much to now bill didn't pay nor did the Amazon employee the Blue Origin employee who went up?  But there were two paid astronauts. Do we know how much astronauts? You know what they got they see you did it  They got they said the word literally 400 times in this. Yeah, they did every time I'm going there no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Astronauts yeah, NASA's been clear on this one. They are not astronauts. They are there. They're amusement park riders there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much do you pay to be your aviation enthusiast? Yeah, it's aviation

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very not doing anything nice one here important

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all been done like I think you save 100 box tops from an Amazon delivery

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If only if only  And you have to write it you have to write a slogan

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to write a jingle about Amazon space travel and how much fun it is  If you have the winning jingle in a hundred box tops Jeff Bezos takes you up in the magic penis rocket

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There were no cowboy hats on the penises. Oh, thank God. I did like  What a Shatner said that was really kind of at a loss for words  When he came back he said everyone in the world needs to do this by the way  That's the new slogan for blue origin. It was so moving what you have given me is the most profound experience  I'm so filled with emotion about what happened. He said I hope I never recover from this  I hope I can maintain what I feel now  He said the moment that you go out of the blue into the black  Is is really an important moment where you start to realize that that blue comforter surrounding the earth is so very thin  I thought it was pretty cool. I thought it was pretty cool  For that reason I do think it's it's kind of a billionaires amusement park, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I mean he could he could have come off from went like good evening

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's not he's not exactly an astronaut but he's he's been up to the  Passenger he's a passenger

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I missed it my favorite dream into the studio this morning mr.  Jammer B was talking about it and telling me about  Shatner and what he described sounded just like a normal person  experience and something that they've never experienced before and it just sounded so real and so genuine and that was exactly right  Yes, ruin the moment. Yeah  I mean he was shatner. He's shatner and everybody knows who he is  Or whatever, but at that moment we got to see a normal person saying holy crap. This was awesome  I'm so grateful for this opportunity and I think that's cool. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, my favorite tweet was that we should all dress up by it like apes when he returns

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can we bury the statue Liberty is that  I think should know that a quarter of a million dollars each shatner was a guest  So was blue origins VP of mission and flight operations Audrey powers Glenn de Vries co-founder of a medical research platform and Chris  boswiesen a NASA researcher turned tech entrepreneur paid  Reportedly were paid according to I think Reuters a quarter of a million dollars each  I don't know if I pay a quarter of a million dollars for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you had if you had 50 million dollars, would you pay a quarter million? Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then it's a buck fifty. So yeah. Yeah, I guess I don't know  Yeah, yeah, I guess I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow  It's it's when Cory is here it's hard to get a word edgewise

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But on the other hand brain that operates that speed who wants to get a word edgewise

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want to let you know, you know, you just sit back and listen and take it all let it roll  Yeah, Wow, just some really good powerful  thoughts I  Nereva  You know  Sometimes you need to get together in a large room with a lot of other people and you might be thinking  Can I stand six feet away from that guy because he ain't wearing a mask Nereva is  The solution as we get back to work for getting full room mic coverage in midsize or large meetings and learning  spaces without  kind of violating  Health rules keeping people socially distancing allows you to move around like surface any way you want and yet  You can be heard even in a giant room. Let me compare  Let me compare the two different ways you might want to solve this problem  There are lots of simple plug-and-play audio solutions for huddle rooms  But getting full room mic coverage in a midsize or large meeting and learning space has always been in the past  Anyway, making a leap into complexity  The high cost of pro AV AV solutions the rave is changing all that  Simplifying almost every aspect of audio conferencing  So if let's say you want to yeah, this is probably your initial instinct  Let's we're gonna bring the pros in for this big room  You get a pro AV system that means multiple components mics and speakers installed in the ceiling spread across the table a lot of cables  You got to get technicians in to determine the required components to install them to calibrate them  You might even have to bring them back from time to time  Takes days for installation cost tens of thousands of dollars per room for purchase and installation  Maybe your company's actually been through that process  I've got a better way something called Nureva. They actually have a patent on something they call microphone mist  Technology, it's computational audio you get true full room coverage  But you don't have to put in a lot of mics which have to be cleaned in between meetings  You don't have to have a lot of cabling you're gonna get exceptional audio for a room up to 25 by 25 feet with one  Simple sound bar like integrated microphone and speaker bar  You got got a bigger space two bars will cover space up to 30 by 50 feet and you can do it yourself  It takes about 30 minutes two screws one cable boom you're done, and it is a lot less than a pro AV system  It's gonna do a better job to beam forming mic systems  You know as long as you stay in exactly the right spot right within the beams can work great  But as soon as you move or you face away from the beams boom you're gone and plus you got to recalibrate if you  Rearrange the room this microphone mist technology is is really cool very sophisticated  It you get true full room coverage from these small devices  Everyone has heard no matter where they move even if they're facing away from the microphone and it's continuously auto calibrated  Plus you get a console with your Nureva. It's a simple easy-to-use web-based platform  You can monitor manage adjust and scale your fleet of systems. Yes more than one system even from anywhere  You won't need any training. It's very easy to use  The you know a pro AV system you probably gonna have to bring in a pro or at least a lot of training  Just to operate the software not with Nureva. I I have to say you got a look at this  It is a simple intuitive platform that lets you easily monitor manage adjust and scale your fleet of systems from anywhere  No training required you can install it yourself  And it's a heck of a lot less expensive the question is are you still gonna do that pro AV system?  Maybe you ought to think about Nureva and you are EVA  Nureva comm slash  Twit this patented microphone mist technology is is is literally computational audio. It's very cool  Nureva dot com slash twit we thank Nureva so much  You know how I feel about audio. It's so important  Appreciate their support of our show and we thank you for supporting the show by going to that special address  So they know you saw it here Nureva  dot com  slash twit  Anything else you want to say or should we just wrap this up? I mean, I feel like we're I'm exhausted

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to get to the change log and stuff to oh crap the change log the change log

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, let me just check and see if there's anything important really the most important thing is  It's pretty funny. Actually Google announced last week that on the 19th. They were going to do their pixel 6  There is nothing we don't know about the pixel 6  But maybe Google can find something that we don't know and release that so we will be here 10 a.m  Pacific Jason Howell and I will be streaming then  Then Apple says oh my beer. We're gonna announce the day before  We're gonna announce our new Apple silicon laptops and maybe a Mac mini so we'll be doing that  That'll be Micah and me 10 a.m. On Monday and then Samsung  We're gonna do Samsung Unleashed part 2 on Wednesday  Saturday roll and and and Mary Jo Foley this morning reminded me that the Thursday is when the  Microsoft duo phone comes out so it's a jam-packed week next week

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's gonna be crazy is the pixel 6 rumor to have optical image stabilization

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I believe it will  There's actually the camera looks interesting 50 megapixels on one of the lenses  I'm trying to remember some details. I think the pics pixel binning  I think the the new anti-shake stuff is in the  Pixel in the in the chip itself rather than right more. That's what I was hoping  Yeah, yeah, they call it like Apple does  I think that's the case and I do think what's gonna be interesting is they're making their own system on a chip with lots of  image processing and other  Stuff built in so I think that's gonna be quite interesting  So that will be that will be a big  Gosh I feel bad Jason how I'll put all this effort into the changelog  Play anything. I mean just say Google TV multi-user support Chrome's RSS follow button now available  Assistant driving mode adds Bluetooth auto lunches old Android auto disappears for more users  Google clock 7.1 rolling out with a material you clock styles as part of Android 12  Google and YouTube will stop showing ads on content that denies climate change and YouTube is gonna finally  Stop making its year-end rewind videos and that's  That was good we got it all in

Transcript:  You were speaking to Cory speed. I yeah inspired you. Yeah  Even I talk fast. Yeah, Cory thinks fast too. That's what hard part actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really sorry Cory's gone because I really wanted to ask him about this piece  on the internet by Evan hatch  It's it's a eulogy in a way to a guy at a memorial guy named Lena Len Sasseman  In fact, he's actually in the blockchain here. Here is his picture in the blockchain block 1 3 8 7 2 5  But in the process of writing this  Sasseman was a well-known cypher punk  He makes a  backhanded but  Clearly intentional case that that is Satoshi Nakamoto  Hmm in every respect Sasseman had the skills the knowledge had done work in very similar veins  He took his own life on July 3rd 2011 10 years ago  Only two months before he died Satoshi sent its final communication  Saying I've moved on to other things and probably won't be around in the future. This is two months before Sasseman's suicide  Hmm  It's well worth reading this and I as far as I'm concerned  We've seen a lot of candidates for who is Satoshi Nakamoto the creator of Bitcoin. This is an absolutely  airtight case  that this guy  was Satoshi Nakamoto it also explains why  Satoshi's 64 billion dollars in Bitcoin has never been touched  Hmm because the owner the guy only guy who can access it is gone  but Len Sasseman  Did he have a will I don't know I  Don't know he's a really was a really interesting guy  He was a part of the cypher puck community lived with Bram Cohen the and creator of BitTorrent  He was a contributor on the cypher punk mailing list which is where Nakamoto first announced Bitcoin  I think in every respect this is a very strong  case not going to be on the cover of Newsweek because no one knows who Len Sasseman is but I  Think it's a very strong case  That this is the guy  So if you I don't it's a medium post Evan Hatch  When I read it I kind of got chills I thought yeah that this is the guy this is the guy and  You know, it's a very complicated case that he makes so I was actually interested in asking Corey about this  But we'll get have to just get Corey back to talk about  Let us do our picks of the week and I guess because  Let us do our picks of the week and I guess because  It's there's no Stacey.

It is  Apparently I'm told we were talking about it on Twitter on the Sun there. Maybe it was yesterday  On Macbreak Weekly it is a  suddenly very common style of  Media in South Korea where the equality between the very rich and the very poor is is even more pronounced than it is here  Mm-hmm and like parasite the Academy Award-winning movie of last year  It's it's really about the very down-and-out in in South Korea coming face to face with a very wealthy  and right the premise is  These down-and-out folks who owe a lot of money or whatever are enticed into this game  Where they can win a lot of money?  What they don't know at first is  They're playing for pretty high stakes. I don't want to spoil it. So  But I will say  The games are games that you would recognize the first ones red light green light  Mm-hmm. There is a Korean game  The kids play called squid game that we don't know here in the States, but is apparently popular with the Koreans  So they're playing these children's games, but the consequences of losing are dire  hmm and  And it's very dystopian and and weird. It's the production values are in are high and interesting, but it's not  That emotionally interesting it ends up being you know about these five or six people who you know band together to try to survive  You know this weird dystopian

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No much props and credit to the writer of this this series because from what I read is this  This was something that was written a long time ago that sort of got kicked down and oh interesting  This person was down to their last couple hundred but a couple hundred dollars had to sell their laptop and things of this nature  Just to make ends meet and now they're sitting quite pretty after the script got into the hands of Netflix

Transcript:  Which which Netflix actually told us for once how many people it was so many

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I mentioned this before last week  But it's so many that the South Korean ISPs are demanding Netflix share the cost with them because so many people are downloading  This show to watch it and they're mad and they're mad at Netflix. Mr. Ant Pruitt's thing. You got a few today

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Nick quick the first one is just totally random YouTube serving up a funny video to me and this one was Irish people  blind-test  Irish whiskey versus American whiskey and  They not the same thing at all is it no it's not but it was fascinating to hear what they described and and  From the their nosing and from the palette because it's pretty spot-on  But then there's the whole Irish pride that they have and you know  They sort of battle with that and had to say you know this this bourbon actually tastes better than my  Whiskey, you know so it was a lot of that in there you would disagree with that would you not and I'm not the biggest fan of  Irish whiskey I don't care for Jameson. I like I like to Lamor. I like that one, but that's to PT for you  No, I like Pete see I like scotch that's Petey I love like of all in 16  That's probably my favorite one, but Irish whiskey tastes a little too much like rye to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My father who taught me to drink bourbon says that anybody who drinks scotch would drink their own bath water

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See to me bourbons too sweet and syrupy and I too I mean I like it but it's not I think I don't like all bourbons

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like I like a lot of them. What else you got a few here? Let's get them all  The next one is a whole eight show. I was on their podcast not too long ago recorded it  Excuse me  recorded it and this a  Podcast that deals a lot with geek culture and pop culture and I had no idea how to add me on because I'm not cool enough  For any of that stuff, but it was a fun conversation  Just talking about content creators, and I talked about Chad and in my time with him, and it was pretty fun conversation  That's the hall H show. I believe it comes from comic con and hall H  Is how I get it title hall H. I get it. Mm-hmm

Transcript:  It's in November. I believe it's like the 19th or something like that so got a couple weeks. Yeah

That's great  mm-hmm all systems read by Martha Wells and  the first of the murder bot diaries series and  Thank you and for doing a great job last week with Steve Gibson. That is now on the plus feed  So if you remember of Club twit and you missed the Q&A it was great  That he talked about I've known Steve for 25 years or 20 years at least and so a  Couple more than 20. So I've heard most of those stories. Yeah, but just you know, it's great to hear him. It really is  He's amazing. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm dead serious. This this could have been a little biopic or something. Yeah, I don't see why it hasn't been

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was great driving down that that dead-end road and yeah, there's some great stuff in there  So yeah, if you haven't listened to it  Here's the deal. You got to be a member of Club twit now. Some people might say well  why would you do that because  We we started Club twit to help  Subsidize what we do to put it on the air  Advertisers don't cover the entire cost  So we started Club twit to give you the audience a chance to support what we do and it's seven dollars a month  Which is not very much money you get the ad free versions of all of our shows because if you are paying after all you  Shouldn't have to hear ads voice. I've always hated it when they charge and make you listen to ads  You also get access to the twit plus feed which is a lot of stuff  It's the untitled Linux show the giz fizz the Steve Gibson interviews the games we play  Lisa and I will be on next week that kind of thing. You also get access to our members only discord  It's a wonderful place to chat with hosts producers and lots of other club members  Three or four thousand strong now who talk about everything including comic books and  And and all kinds of stuff. I think it's well worth seven bucks  I really do and all you have to do is go to twit TV slash club twit. It's month to month  There's no it's not you're not signed up for a year or anything  If you decide you're not getting your seven bucks worth  I certainly wouldn't want you to have to stick around so you can you can quit anytime  But I think it's worth it and it sure does help us keep the lights on here  Twit TV slash club to it of course and is the community manager and  And we're really glad you're doing that because that's making it a lot more fun.
