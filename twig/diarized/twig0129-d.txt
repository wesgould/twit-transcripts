Leo Laporte here and joining us right now, Jeff Jarvis from his office at home in New York.  Good to have you, Jeff.  Good to be here.  Jeff is the author.  On Monday.  Yeah, we removed the day and I'll explain that in a second.  He's the author of Public Parts, brand new book from Simon & Schuster, How Sharing in the Digital Age Improves the Way We Work and Live.  And this was a book that he's been writing as we've been doing the show.  So we got a lot of insight into this.  And it's just it's fantastic about public life and public and the new public.  So thank you for being here, Jeff.  Gina is not here.  She's she.  Oh, she's at the White House.  Yes, she's at the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All hail Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, she's we can't.  She asked us not to talk about why she's there.  But I think when she comes back next week, she'll explain it.  She explained it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm going to vote for her for vice president.  We weren't supposed to say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kevin Purdy is here in her place.  We're so glad to have the Purd man.  Hey, Kevin, good to have you.  He's Kevin Purdy on Twitter, the Purd man on the Internet and author of Google Plus, the Missing Manual, which I don't have a copy of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  Google Plus, the Missing Manual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we're just out from O'Reilly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can find it O'Reilly dot com.  Searched out there or on Amazon and.  Out in print and ebook form very soon, but printed over the holidays, so I don't have my copy yet.  How exciting. Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you.  Also an Android wizard.  And follow him on Google Plus.  I just need I just added you to my I should add you to celebrities circle, which you won't tell me the name of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know I have a lot of circles here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I could put you in Microsoft groupies.  No, no, no, photographers.  No, photographers.  No, podcasters.  No, I think tech journalists.  You'll join an elite crew of 716 people.  I like this feature, which we never talked about on Google Plus of the sliders in the circles now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you talked about it previously.  I think we did briefly because none of us had it yet.  I like it showing up for some people.  It's rolling out like everything in Google and I like it, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'm looking now in my circles.  Where do I get?  How do I find it?  Oh, do I click a circle and then it will be in the circle or no?  It's on the stream page, I believe.  It's on the main page.  Oh, that's right.  I remember now.  Here's what you do.  Here's what you do.  You click like, say, acquaintances.  I'm going to click one of my circles and go there.  And then I will get a slider on the page of that particular circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's in the top right corner of your stream and you can slide it to determine how much of that circle shows up in your mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wish I had more granularity because you really only have four positions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says most for all of them and everybody's in my circles because I want to see most of what they say already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Is most the default if I have not done this before?  Yes.  So everything is most.  As usual, Google is not exactly transparent about its algorithms here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What it also reveals to us is that we're not seeing a lot of things in the stream of our peoples.  So there's no presumption that I've seen everything that you've had to say.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I went to family and turned that up all the way because I always want to see anything my family posts.  Same thing with the people I work with.  And then I turned down some groups like photographers.  There's so many photographers on Twitter.  And it was becoming like a photo blog.  And I love them, but I don't want to see as much.  So it's nice that you can kind of fine tune it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And previously you could create like a circle.  And as I was just joking about, nobody could see what you named a circle.  So you could create a circle called like frenemies or something.  Right.  Dorks.  Or people I actually hate.  But they'd show up in your mainstream and you'd say what's the point of the service.  But yeah, that's a really neat new feature that I need to add to a revision of my book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's one feature that I would really like to have and maybe Google will listen to us someday,  which is the ability to, well, I guess they have added that in effect with this slider.  So I could say I don't, what I'd like is to have some custom streams like this plus this plus this.  But that might be too complicated to implement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could manually do it.  But yeah, to remix your stream so you just see like friends and photographers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like let me shift click or command click on the stream and say I want to see this, this and this and make a kind of a meta circle that includes those circles or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And to share that.  I think Vic and Dottra plussed this weekend about people being able to go to the starter page.  And thank goodness we're listed there and get circles.  But I think the more powerful thing is not to have one size fits all circles,  but to have each of us have our own circles that you can subscribe to.  We keep updated and may the best circles win.  And that's really what the power is going to give Google more data on who's authoritative and who is good and who's recommended more by more people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Right.  What is this?  How do I see the starter page?  If I've already signed up, I guess I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you can't.  Yes, you can.  Look up Vic.  You can get to it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vic's post.  Let me see.  I'll bet that it's not too far down.  If you skip the dog caught in the balloons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Funny video of a beautiful baby lab running around the house getting tangled up in balloons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you go down to the four-way, skip the bungee jumping video, which I hate because I hate heights.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what?  I cannot stand that.  Folks, I've been telling you for years, don't bungee jump.  And this video confirms it.  What if the cord broke?  She survives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Crocodile.  She survives.  Go down below her.  This is a great place to find her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just click here.  Plus.google.com slash get started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the weird thing.  I thought I was off the list.  Turns out that it won't recommend you to yourself.  So if you look, you won't find yourself on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which list are you in, Jeff Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe they got it mixed up.  I'm in tech and Gene is in news.  They should be the opposite, but I'll take what I can get.  This is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I follow both of you guys.  I don't see either of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I can add all these people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can just add a circle there.  Oh, that's nice.  Which is kind of, I didn't realize that's what it was.  It wasn't just a recommended list.  You can now subscribe to a whole circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, cool.  So I'm going to add a technology circle.  I'm going to add a politics circle, a photography and art circle.  That's nice.  This is their version of the Twitter suggested users list,  but implemented, I think, in a little more benign way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the reason both Twitter and Google Plus do this is  when you're new to a place like this, you often say,  well, I don't see anything.  What should I do now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The big problem is that you come, I know people who come in,  I'm sure you've heard it too, come in and say,  well, what's with this Google Plus thing?  All I hear is crickets.  It's boring.  Yeah.  And they've got to have starter kits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Now, do you guys yet have the new Google bar?  Because how long ago was it?  We talked about this.  And I still have that big black bar at the top.  So do I.  So do I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've manually enabled it.  There's a cookie trick you can do.  Yeah, there's a hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I don't like to do that because I kind of want the real world experience, you know?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's very slowly rolling out.  Very slowly.  Surprisingly slowly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At a passing life.  Almost as slowly as Timeline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of folks don't have it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Timeline is now out, right?  The Facebook Timeline.  Still being phased in.  Oh, really?  That one is the one I implemented with the developer trick,  because I really wanted to play with the Timeline.  I love it.  You know what's really interesting now?  Because of subscriptions, that completely, at least for people who enabled subscriptions,  changes the experience of Facebook entirely.  So my experience of Facebook, because I allow you, if you go to my Facebook page,  which is facebook.com slash leo g laporte, because somebody else has Leo Laporte,  you can subscribe, which means an asymmetric follow.  Just like a Twitter style or Google Plus style follow, where I don't have to approve you or anything.  But what that means is everybody who subscribed to me now suddenly seeing my posts and commenting on them.  And I have 33,000 people subscribing to me, commenting on my posts.  That means almost everything I post, there's dozens of comments.  And then people bitch because I don't read the comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So have you noticed the kind of more prominent public slash friends slash close friends switcher,  then on the right side of the poster? Is that still not like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I do everything public, right? Because like Jeff, I live in public.  But one thing I do notice while there's a lot of engagement on Facebook,  and please forgive me if you're one of these people, there's a lot of dumb engagement on Facebook.  People who just say things because they want to say things.  You know, comments like, I don't know, you know, I put a picture of frost on my car,  which is a stupid post, but I did it anyway.  And somebody posted dandruff, then Patrick said slow day, huh?  And then somebody said, is that a euphemism?  And then here's a great comment. What? W-A-T.  It's like, Jeff, you live in public. Doesn't the public sometimes get on your nerves?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it does.  The public is, what I often say about this is that the Internet is just life.  Life is filled with bozos. Ergo, the Internet is filled with bozos.  It is life.  And it is life. And there's, you know, you can avoid the...  Let me ask you this. When you have a reflex to post something, what's your order?  Twitter, Facebook, Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can I tell you what I've been doing lately?  Which is bad, bad, bad. I break all the rules because you know when things...  And I agree this is a rule. You should post natively.  So when you're posting on Twitter, you should be on Twitter posting on Twitter.  When posting on Facebook, you should be on Facebook.  I don't do that because that's too difficult.  And as Facebook and Twitter and Google Plus kind of seem to merge in terms of what they're all becoming,  for me, broadcast media. So I use a cross-post tool called PublishSync on Google+.  When I post on Google+, I check Twitter and Facebook in most cases.  But even more what I'm using, and I know this is shocking, is Path.  So Path is intended to be a private stream.  You only have 150 friends at max.  You're only supposed to friend people you know.  My friend Alex Lindsay says, I only friend people on Path that I would want at a dinner party.  It's kind of like a dinner party. And then you post stuff privately.  But Path has subtly at the bottom little boxes for Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and Foursquare.  And most of the time now, if you see a tweet from me, or especially if there's a picture associated,  or a Facebook posting, most of my Facebook postings, they come from Path.  Is that bad? Is that wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Friends of mine who work in marketing and that field say that you actually kind of get penalized for doing that on Facebook.  You do.  In terms of, okay, that's a definite thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Facebook also is a little opaque about their algorithms for rising stuff up through the news stream.  But it's absolutely true if you're not natively posting that they will degrade you.  But on the other hand, if you're following me and you go to my timeline, everything's there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Jeff's question then was, was there anything in particular that makes you want to post a certain thing to one type of...  Yeah, how about you, Kevin?  Hmm. Anything that's ephemeral goes to Twitter.  Like, hey, this bagel's terrible. That goes to Twitter.  Anything that's... usually I think things that do best with the link go to Google Plus for me.  When I want to center a conversation around something, if I want to say this photo, this link, this thing, this video,  Google Plus seems to be the place for me where I get the most benevolent good feedback on that type of thing,  when you can actually point at something as opposed to just saying, really warm and buffalo in the winter.  And Facebook is... I only use it as friends and family.  That is where I go to post things about my life from folks who know me from the meat sphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I just... I'm so... I think first of all, it's a moving target, right?  I mean, there's no rule.  And as... I mean, Facebook has completely changed from being my friends and high school classmates to anybody now.  So I don't know how Facebook or Google Plus or Twitter differ very much.  The engagement might differ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now Facebook's status limit is so much longer now. It's like Google Plus.  You can post a whole blog post on there if you wanted to.  It's many people... I think it's their blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, you used to have to use a note. Now you just put in status. It's their blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, one thing I'll say is... and this is probably because I've abused my blog while I was writing the book.  I blog about the book, but I blog less as a whole.  And I still haven't picked up my pace because I'm just writing at a different pace.  But the quality of conversation on the blog...  When I grew up, Kevin, when I wanted conversation, I put it on Google Plus now.  I might put it on the blog for the record, but I have basically a few people who don't like me coming in there and reminding me how much they don't like me.  And...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The trolls are everywhere.  Now, I've seen more and more people... MG Siegler just did this, turning off comments on their blogs because...  And I thought his post was kind of interesting.  He said, you know, it's not my job to give you a bully pulpit.  If you have something to say, get yourself a blog or a Twitter account or a Facebook.  And I still have comments on my blog. I think comments are great, but I have to say...  That especially for somebody who is a lightning rod like MG is...  Comments really just deteriorate very quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I used to defend comments because it was the means of having a conversation online.  Online is about conversations and power of the people and all that.  But there's nothing requiring us to get noise.  And I just had an exchange just now on email with a flack who sent me something and I just put on unsubscribe coming back.  And she yelled at me for that. That was rude.  I said, well, it was rude for you to send me something I didn't ask for.  Right.  I love it when I freeze in an unhappy position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As you have.  As I have.  You do look like you're receiving email you don't want right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or something else I don't want. Somewhere else I don't want it. Yes.  But... I'm sorry. I'm so distracted.  It's a little distracting, isn't it?  Help unfreeze me.  There we go.  So I was writing a post. I haven't put it up yet.  I was about to put it up about email.  And Bob Wyman, the brilliant Bob Wyman, founder of PubSub and other things, who's now on Google,  sat me down one day and explained that the real problem with mail is that it's sender controlled, not recipient controlled.  Oh, yeah.  And he's absolutely right. And when you think that through, that's the whole problem.  And that's what changed everything.  And Google Plus, as I think we might have discussed in the show before, is almost all recipient controlled.  You see the stuff that you have agreed to get.  And if it's not recipient controlled, it becomes spam.  So that's why they used to be able to send us notifications.  Anybody could. That became spam.  So now we all turn off notifications from anyone we don't follow.  Right.  It does limit the serendipity a bit, but it gets rid of that.  Comments are still spam worthy because somebody we don't know can put something in there, but we have more controls to kill that.  So whenever the recipient loses control, it becomes noise.  And that presents just like phone calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why we hate telemarketing.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's why, you know, what gave us more control?  Well, to an extent, the voicemail did.  But then the obligation fell to us to return the call.  To an extent, ID did.  But then there's fights about that.  And so we fight around this so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It just seems somehow wrong to post and not engage in conversation about the post.  That's the ultimate in broadcasting, right?  And I thought we were moving beyond broadcasting to conversation, but maybe not.  But it gets ruined.  It gets ruined by trolls and people who are not really engaging.  They're just spewing.  I mean, if you give a lot of caring feeding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, Fred Wilson's blog has magnificent comments because he gives a lot of caring feeding to them.  He values them.  And I respect that about him.  You know, maybe I'm just more hateful than he is.  And I get junky comments, but I just don't want to bother to some extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a lot of work. It is a lot of work.  I'll give you an example.  And I get hate mail every day about this.  But we have, as you know, a very active chat room.  There's 773 people in it right now.  And in order to keep that chat room from descending into the eighth pit of hell,  which every IRC chat, every forum does, we have a dozen moderators at all times.  I didn't know that. I never knew that.  We have Dan, Bear, Brass, right now, CWBP, Darth Emma, Hip, Legat, Life's Azu,  Marmot, Mick, Nightflyer, Slyfair, Texen, TTK, and Warpoli.  Those are all mods.  Thank you all mods.  And I get email all the time from people saying, I was kicked out of your chat room.  And what people don't understand is, yeah, the minor infraction that they were kicked out for,  and often it is minor, multiplied by a thousand becomes an unusable thing.  And so I do think that to create a community requires immense amount of care and feeding.  It does.  And, you know, I just, John O'Bacon wrote a book on the art of community,  which I think is a good start.  But mostly I think the takeaway is you've got to participate heavily to keep that moderated and to keep that good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also think, and this post-harmor rain that I'll put up in a day or so,  that we also need new norms where we redefine what's rude.  Right.  It's almost seen as where we carry over the old norm from old communication that says if you don't respond to somebody, that's rude.  The new rude needs to be if you send me something I didn't ask for and you expect me to respond immediately, that's rude.  And I know you've admitted, I think in the past, Leo, that for certain kinds of communications,  you're not going to touch it until you get sent two or three times.  Right.  Right.  And I just kind of can't, if it's that important to you, then try two or three times.  Okay, I'll pay attention.  And I'll admit that I'm on certain kinds of communication.  I'm like that too.  And in the old days, that was rude.  But now it's rude to give us noise.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Especially pitches for things like, you know, requests for things, even among your friends.  I mean, if someone, if PR people email me and I don't respond, it just means I'm not interested.  Right.  Or if a friend.  Stop plugging me.  Lately.  I've learned that if they don't, if they ask me to help them with their phone and I don't respond,  it means I just don't know what to help you with or, you know, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lately, there has been a trend.  I don't know if you've noticed this, Kevin, from PR people to send three or four follow ups saying,  I didn't see a response.  I was wondering, did you want me to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just making sure you want, you didn't miss your opportunity to meet with CEO.  No, I'm ignoring you on purpose.  I'll be in New York next week.  And hey, I noticed you're in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You must get a mess of those before CES, right, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't use my email for three or four months before CES and then for three or four months after.  So really, if you don't get an email from me, it's only you have to email me in the summer.  That's the only time I can I can accept to read email.  Oh, it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like a Japanese samurai.  You only you only venture out that you collect it all in the fall in grain form and bring it home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just I think we are in a I think your next book, Jeff, your sequel to Public Parts,  has to be the Rude Society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm thinking about just that, Leo.  I'm thinking about new norms.  What occurred to me in the whole privacy debate is that is that we're trying to put old behaviors onto a new reality.  And when it doesn't work, we go crazy.  Right. And so you can think of so many areas where that's true.  But it's but but email and communication is a great one.  But so much of the rest of society, I've been taking notes and notes and notes and notes.  But what we're really doing is we're just adjusting our norms.  And that's a process of negotiation that occurs.  You know, what's the root is it rude when you're standing talking with someone to pull out your phone and read it?  Right. Oh, yeah. Right.  It depends on who it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wouldn't say it's rude.  There's a new meme I've been seeing on Twitter and on G plus for when when the power tech Naradi gather, they do a stack of the phones.  You tell everybody supposed to take a phone and put it in the middle of the table and and leave this leave.  You can leave the beeping and buzzing on.  That's OK. And the first person to reach for his phone pays for the meal.  Brilliant. Brilliant.  And you're never going to understand the stacking thing, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, well, you don't have to. It doesn't have to stack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They said you could stack it or you could put it on.  You know, and I like the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I've started using it myself just putting a phone out on the table as my own personal challenge.  But I was always hoping it would be like a jangle like I always thought it'd be like a jangle like thing.  Like if your phone goes off and you can extract it from the pile like phones, then like you can.  But then it makes you really, really want to read that email.  Oh, that's good. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's that's an additional rule we can add the Jenga rule.  We put it in a stack this way.  You do it. You have to do it like this.  And then if you can get your phone out without knocking on the wheel, you'd have half the stack.  I'm already there. I've already got a Jenga stack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would penalize people with really thick cases more so than Steve Jobs would even want them to.  That's true. That's a great point. Yeah.  They got the rubbery case. You can't yank out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People would start to be a market for slippery cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great.  The new Android phones are more slender so you can pull them out.  That's right. That's right.  What's your kid's behavior versus yours, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My kids yell at me because I'm so bad.  You know, I stopped doing Foursquare.  When I was doing Foursquare, the first thing I'd arrive anywhere like a restaurant, we arrive en famille.  And I have my phone out checking in and it takes 30 seconds or a minute and they yell at me.  They do not like me to do that.  On the other hand, we were at dinner the other night and my wife says to Henry, my 17 year old,  you know, we could see the glow of your phone holding in your lap does not does not hide the fact that you are in fact texting right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just means you eat at fewer French restaurants.  You end up eating at more like open air restaurants.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Al-Assad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kitty, Skrull.  You know, it is I remember vividly, you know, texting wasn't very popular here in the States until a few years ago.  I remember vividly about five years ago sitting in a square.  I can't remember if it was Italy or France.  I think it was Italy and watching people go by and they were buried in their phones because texting took off earlier in Europe than it did here.  And I thought that is really weird.  And now, of course, everywhere you go, people are buried in their phones.  That's all that you see everywhere.  I don't know what to say about it.  It's just the way it is.  And I'm as bad as anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, and I think we have to, you know, if we're going to be talking to Siri on the street, these are just cases where we're going to readjust and to tell people you can't change your behavior.  This doesn't work to tell you can't change industries.  You know, it doesn't work.  We are going through change and we're trying to figure out how to adapt to that.  And you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's rude?  This is what Tim O'Reilly also says that it's not about laws.  It's about norms.  Yes.  We need to pass norms.  Has he written about that?  I don't know.  I saw him speak at a food camp about it.  And I can't remember.  I think the context was probably, you know, soap or something like this.  But his position was the government and laws are not the solution to these kinds of things.  We've had norms for years.  You know, a lock on a door doesn't really stop anybody.  You can walk down the street in most neighborhoods at night and look through windows.  There are laws against both.  But really, there's the norms that stop people from walking up to the window and going, what's going on in there?  Right.  Right.  And norms are very effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I look back at the lies we told.  The first lie was, I didn't get your email because it was broken.  Yeah.  So we didn't tell the truth.  We had to find the white lie.  The next one was it got caught in a spam filter.  The spam filter's got that, right?  Yeah.  The dog ate your email.  Well, now you're not a priority in the inbox.  And so we're not really adjusting the norms.  We're just finding new lies.  But the lies catch up with us as technology takes away the excuse.  And so we've got to have the courage to say, no, or that doesn't matter to me, or you don't matter to me, or you're bothering me.  Or, you know, how do we find the ways to express those things in a way that we still consider to be civil?  Silence is one way, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Empathy toward other people being as varied as you are, I guess.  Empathy toward other people who, you know, either maybe don't want to get email notifications every minute on the minute, who only check their Twitter twice a day, you know, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can do what Dana Boyd did.  Dana has more than once now taken a complete email sabbatical for as long as possible.  So if you send her email, it will bounce back and say, I'm not going to read this.  I'm not going to see it.  You can't get me.  Right.  If you really need to find me, you can figure out who my mother is.  And I needed to reach her recently for something I won't reveal to the world and ruin it.  How I got to her.  Did you call her mom?  No, I actually did research.  I thought it was actually a violation of privacy to figure out, you know, what's her mother's name and where they live.  She lived in Pennsylvania.  You know, that's worse.  That's bringing your mother into this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what's really bad?  People now call my wife.  They call my home number and to get a hold of me.  And it's I told Jennifer, you're not my appointment secretary.  You don't have to get you don't have to help them.  Please don't.  And I get angry at people.  I said, don't call my home number.  Why are you calling my home number?  Yeah.  It's radio stations and others who will have the home number because I maybe I sometimes to do the thing from there or something.  But that's terror.  I mean, people get people get very annoyed when you're not available.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People go to the clerk of courts to find you.  They really want to get a hold of you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's so tempting just to disappear off the grid.  You couldn't bear that.  Would you?  No.  That's really why this is a discussion because we love it and we hate it at the same time.  Yes.  Yes.  CES is going on right now.  That's why we're doing the show on a Monday instead of a Wednesday.  In fact, after the immediately after the show, I'm going to get on the plane and go to Vegas.  Most of our team is down there and Google is down there.  They made a big deal about being down there and they're down there in a lot of different ways.  Of course, there's Android phones.  There's Android tablets.  In fact, we're starting to see a number of televisions.  LG just announced a line of televisions running Honeycomb.  Apparently, according to Charlie Osborne writing for ZDNet iGeneration blog, Google is paying vendors to put and paying them.  Yeah.  Google has struck Android in television sets.  According to NEO, Google has struck deals with multiple suppliers to include Android in the TV set.  Maybe this is what Eric Schmidt was talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this starts to, you know, we'll buy our way into TVs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it makes sense.  There's revenue for them in their long run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, how much would they pay, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm wondering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are TVs like Lenovo's is running Android 4.0, which I assume is not Google TV as you and Gina know it.  Right, Leo?  Right.  Right.  You have...  Honey...  Yours is not technically an Android.  It's a very particular framed version of Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it is Android, but yes, it's Google TV.  So, and in fact, that's part of the disappointment.  I wish it were.  I wish I had full access to the Android market.  But the issue, I think, is that the Logitech review, which is the one I use, doesn't have enough horsepower to run most of the...  I mean, you can't put Angry Birds on it.  It won't run.  I would guess.  I'm just guessing.  Right.  So I don't know what...  It says Android in this article.  Does that mean Google TV?  Does that mean Android?  I don't know.  I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So which is more powerful to have, Google TV or Android?  I'm confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's not which is more powerful.  I mean, Android has more choices because you'd have the Android marketplace.  Right.  The marketplace, right.  I mean, presumably, Android means Android marketplace, means some Google apps.  Google TV doesn't have Gmail on it.  It doesn't have Android marketplace.  It does.  It has a limited Android marketplace with just a few appropriate apps.  And I think that...  But that comes down to the fact that the processor in some of these devices is just not enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's also the other news is Marville, not the comic book company, announced a deal with Google.  And is showing a box at CES.  A reference.  It's a reference box.  Reference box, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Marville is a chip and a chip set that is used by a lot of kind of embedded products.  And by showing this, this Armada 1500 chip, they're basically telling people how to build it.  Now, it's a 1.2 gigahertz chip, which means it's probably fast enough to do a lot of the applications that you'd want.  The Lenovo product is Android with a Snapdragon, 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon means it probably could play Angry Birds.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I really hope that's a reference to sign because it's an ugly looking box.  It is.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Marville doesn't make stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Yeah.  No, they're just saying that you can...  And they want, you know, it's without a fan.  It's small.  It's cheap.  Yeah.  Low power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the point.  You know, it's basically looks like a Roku, doesn't it?  Yeah.  So I don't know what Google is paying these vendors.  I guess it could be as much as five or 10 bucks a device.  That would make it very attractive.  Well, it becomes really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just saw just now on Twitter that you can get the low end Nook for free with a one year subscription on it to the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  So the Times is giving away a Nook basically.  Or a low power to double it.  It's funny.  We said this... well, somebody is.  We said this would happen, that at some point the content creators would be giving away these devices as a reader.  Yep.  Why?  It's got to save the New York Times a ton of money not to have to print it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's the future strategy and it's the future revenue stream and it's a way to get new customers they buy out of cotton otherwise.  It's in the old days.  But there's danger here with Robinson.  When I worked at Time Inc., Sports Illustrated was famous for having the sneaker phone.  And people were buying subscription to get the phone, which is to say they weren't buying the magazine, they were buying the phone.  They wanted my football phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which means that a year in they cancel their subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  And Sports Illustrated was known to have a warehouse full of sneaker phones in some scandal of the circulation world at the time.  So the premium business can be a dangerous one.  Philadelphia newspaper has been giving away its own tablets with subscriptions and it's not working very well.  But that's, you know, who wants the Philadelphia paper?  And for the organizations that try to do this and think that they can trap you just because you get the device,  no, they probably can't.  So there's some danger here, but it's still interesting that it does say that's the future and that's where we had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we did see the Lenovo TV last night.  I think that they covered it when we did our live stream from the CES unveiled.  But we will we'll go over to the Lenovo booth and you have to be very curious to take a look at it.  Apparently it's running ice cream sandwich.  It's a 55 inch TV.  It's interesting because you've got computer manufacturers going to the TV business and then you've got Vizio TV company going into the computer business.  That's really now we're really talking convergence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, when the world says is it's yeah, who cares what the device is?  Everything is connected.  Right. It is clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I love the idea.  It's both sides thinking the grass is greener.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe that's it.  I'd rather be in the team.  But the fact that Lenovo is making a TV really lends a little more credence to the idea of an Apple television.  Yeah.  Of course, Lenovo is a big Chinese conglomerate.  They probably own TV manufacturing facilities.  And I mean, you know, I make they probably have a better end to end solution.  What do you think an Apple TV could be if you if you think like I am one of those people who just doesn't get it, who thinks Apple should not get in the TV business.  Although, you know, this Lenovo TV might make me think twice.  I just you know, it doesn't the TV is such a different business in the computer business.  How do you awful business?  It's a terrible map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Margins are terrible.  Yeah.  Change constant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a friend, someone I know in Buffalo who works for iLounge.  And the way he put it was that until Apple has a device that can that controls the entire experience from turning on your TV,  watching something, turning it off and knowing that when you come back to your TV, everything you would have wanted to watch is available.  He doesn't you know, he doesn't think Apple will do it until that is possible.  And as you all know, and as previously say on the show, content companies aren't willing to be turned into pipes like that.  So I don't think an Apple TV will exist until that is possible, until Apple can control the entire experience, you know, like as with an iPad from start to finish.  You know, on to off.  And I'd be surprised if it was coming out in the next year.  I think you're right, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we're all going to be surprised because I think it is going to come out next year.  But I just don't understand why.  It just baffles me.  So that quote in the book, the quote in the says we've licked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I've like I figured out the TV thing.  That could mean we've conceptually like that, you know, like doesn't mean it's a product.  Right.  The idea for the iPhone existed sometime before the iPhone was available as a device.  You know, supposedly that whole thing about the or I mean the iPad actually, supposedly they kind of delayed development on the iPad to do the iPhone.  Right.  And then the iPhone gave them their entree into the iPad market.  Right.  Once they figured out the phone, then they'd figured out, oh, we've also figured out the iPad.  It could be that type of thing where we have the idea for what we want to do, but it's not in place yet.  Right.  I think that quote is always has a lot of mystery behind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We shall see.  We shall see.  We're going to take a little break.  We are here.  Kevin Purdy is here.  The Purd Man.  Kevin Purdy on Twitter and Google Plus freelance writer and expert on Android.  Good to have you.  Thank you.  Gina in the White House right now.  I think Gina is she has she tweeted from the White House?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I look.  I've seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It would be so cool if she said, I would be in the White House right now.  They probably take your phone when you go in, right?  No, I don't think so.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember there's a guy named Rex Hammack, who's a wonderful blogging guy who runs a  custom publishing company in the South.  And he got a meeting with George Bush as a typical small businessman.  And he was tweeting.  He was not tweeting.  He was blogging.  There was no Twitter at the time, but he was blogging from leaving the office.  It was pretty cool.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We will watch carefully to see if she tweets from the Oval Office.  I've just been asked to run as vice president.  Anyway, we miss Gina, but Jeff Jarvis is here.  The author of public parts in this professor of journalism at City University of New York  and a man who is really on the forefront of the new journalism.  I like that.  Every decade has its own new journalism.  Well, you need it for a new century.  Yeah, this is journalism for the new century.  Okay.  We'll be back with more in just a bit.  Lots to talk about.  But first, let's talk about backing it up.  We've talked about the cloud all the time and the idea of I think it's got to be very  attractive of taking the data that's on your systems and putting it in the cloud so that  it could be safe, accessed and restored at any time.  But doing so is a little, you know, can be a little tricky.  How do you do it?  Do you set up an S3 account?  That's why I love Carbonite.  It really is a straightforward way to get cloud storage and cloud backup for everybody,  Mac or PC.  If you go to carbonite.com, you can see what I mean.  Try it free for two weeks.  You don't need a credit card, just the offer code TWIG, T-W-I-G.  They have the base Carbonite account, perfect for a laptop, is everything on your internal  drive for less than five bucks a month for $59 a year.  In fact, if you use TWIG, you'll get 14 months for the price of 12, so it's even more affordable.  That backup happens whenever you're online.  It's very carefully designed not to slow you down or your internet connection.  So it trickles the data up as changes are made.  It's always kept up to date.  You can see that data at any time.  You log on to your Carbonite account from any computer.  You don't have to install anything.  You just log on to your Carbonite account or on a smartphone.  They've got apps for iOS and Android or even Blackberry 2 or on a tablet.  And there's your stuff.  So it's cloud storage.  And should the worst happen, and by the way, disasters always happen, you lose the laptop,  you destroy the hard drive, or most commonly, you accidentally, human error, throw out something  you really needed, it's right there, always up to date, always available.  It's the best way to backup.  Automatic offsite backup for less than five bucks a month.  They do have plans for people who want to backup external drives or multiple computers.  It's all there at carbonite.com.  And use the offer code twig for any of those, the home, the home office or the small business plans.  And you can use Carbonite right now.  They say backup, move forward.  I like that.  You got to back it up to get it back.  Do it right with carbonite, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com.  Use twig as the offer code.  The easy way to do the cloud.  Speaking of cloud, I think it's almost now, this is one of those buzzwords that even if you have no idea what you're doing,  you've got to offer cloud services.  Lenovo, Acer, everybody at CES, this is the Cloudy CES, is announcing some form of cloud service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So last year's trend was Android, right?  This year is clouds?  I guess.  But who cares?  Who wants a Lenovo cloud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Dell's done this for a long time.  Apple, of course, has iCloud now and Microsoft has SkyDrive.  Google, I think probably does the best job of this.  I don't know if people really know that you can upload any file to Google Docs.  Do people know that?  Not generally, no.  Yeah.  I'll give you an example.  Somebody called the radio show and said, hey, I need a way to print my PDF, the acrobats barfing on it.  And the chat room said, well, just upload it to Google Docs and print it from there because they translate PDFs.  So Acer is going to introduce Acer Cloud on all Acer PCs, instantly syncs data across your PC's smartphones and tablets.  Lenovo's personal cloud will also sync data across PCs.  I don't know if it'll go to the Lenovo TV.  Oh, yes, it will.  It'll go to their K-91 Smart TV.  You can sync it to the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't imagine, though, the PC buyer who two years after they buy their $400 Windows laptop says, well, I really want to upgrade to Mac.  But on my subspaces, I can't think of a less loyal tech product than PC laptops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also, these guys are not software wizards.  The software interfaces on these tools is always horrible.  It's abysmal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So my poor mother's Dell desktop PC has the Dell cloud backup thing installed.  And man, that is not great.  Not good.  I lack for words.  It's not. It's very painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We never, you know, for years, I've always told my team when we go to cover CES, don't decide until you get there what the story is, because you might be surprised.  And often there are, although lately there have been fewer and fewer surprises at CES.  But this one surprises me.  I did not think cloud would be a buzzword at CES this year.  Tablets? Yeah.  Android? Yeah.  TVs, of course.  But cloud, cloud TV.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's some free marketing.  Get Dropbox to sign up with Lenovo and say, hey, if you buy a Lenovo PC, you get six extra gigs free on Dropbox.  Why don't they do that?  That's smart.  Eek's crowd to your brand.  I mean, find someone who's not device dependent and have them offer.  Or, you know, Carbonite or someone.  Anyone. Just don't make your own island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Dropbox is such a good brand.  Everybody knows it.  I mean, it may not be the best cloud service.  There's issues about encryption and so forth.  But that doesn't, you know, for most people, for your mom, it's just, you know, just do it.  Do it that way.  Don't make a Lenovo cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Part of this, you're right, Leo.  It's just the hot thing at the moment.  It's me too.  I didn't put this up on the list, but a report from Wanted Analytics that reports on recruitment says that there are 10,000 new job ads posted online the last 90 days looking for employees with cloud computing skills.  What does that mean?  That means that the person hiring doesn't know what the cloud is.  60, a 61 percent increase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Computing skills.  Yeah, I've got mad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  61 percent increase.  Hey, kid, you use Gmail all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've got mad cloud skills.  Well, good.  Now, you know, kids, how to get a job.  Wild.  So I guess Tom Hanks decided he was watching how Louis CK was doing the thing.  And he says, I got to get on that Internet thing, too.  He's going to do a web.  He got on a sub over the Internet.  Yahoo.  So I got a call.  Whoops.  Electric Tom.  You should have called me Electric City, an animated futuristic series he's been developing for years will premiere on Yahoo this spring.  According to Associated Press, 20 episodes, each three or four minutes long.  This is another me to play.  Right.  I got to have a web series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been trying this for a long time.  The story said that it's an animated series about the post apocalyptic better life, things he wants to say politically, which is which is great, which is fine.  So we want to do it originally with puppets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's called Electric City.  They originally tried it to do with puppets.  So it sounds like it's like circa 1982.  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What was that horrible show?  Alf.  And then there was Fraggle Rock.  Remember that?  Oy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was the ones going back to?  Oh, God, it was a space one when we were kids, Leo, our age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  Supercar and Thunderbirds.  Thunderbirds are a go.  Scary.  Yeah, because they all walked like this.  They were they were marionettes.  Yeah, it was ridiculous.  I don't know if this is a soft puppet or a marionette.  I doubt it was a marionette.  Although Team America, that's right.  Team America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure it's a dangerous generation.  Why?  Nostalgia ground.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, Leo, here's the problem.  He doesn't know who Alf is.  Oh, come on.  Oh, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had an elf from Burger King.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had to send my mom to every Burger King in Central New York to get one.  See, Alf was aimed at him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK.  Yeah.  Alf was aimed at him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then Fraggle Rock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fraggle Rock was for stoners.  Basically, right?  I think it was because it was originally on Saturday Night Live and it was like the weirdest,  like the bubbling.  It was the Muppets for stoners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Tom Hanks show, though, does it supposedly touches on some interesting ground about a  like almost like a more lock in upper level society.  We're above ground.  Everything's fine.  Everyone has great Internet.  I like that.  And underground, you know, there's all these issues with privacy and freedom of speech  and stuff like that.  But no one's seen a minute of it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I just I, you know, there's this whole it's conventional wisdom that if you do a  video on the Web, it should be four minutes long.  And if it's ten minutes long, it's way too long.  And I really wish that people would just do long form and stop.  Yeah, it's television, kids.  It's OK.  You can make a half hour show, Tom.  It doesn't have to be four minutes.  It's not even worth starting a four minute show and then I'll have a 30 second pre-roll.  No. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Felicia Day proved that with Dr. Horrible.  Exactly.  I mean, people love to watch that.  I like it, too.  And it's it's it's well, those are usually ten minutes, fifteen minutes, I think.  I think you can be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think well, all our shows are two hours long.  So I'm the wrong guy to ask.  But I just I think that that's conventional wisdom that I don't think is actually true.  And I think what you get when you do short attention span theater is you you don't get the audience that you really want to sell to advertisers is one of the reasons that the YouTube audience, despite the millions of views, is very hard to monetize because these people.  It's it's it's short attention.  I watch my kid watch YouTube.  You probably know the same thing, Jeff.  You know, it's they're not it's like epic meal time.  He's not going to buy anything advertised on that.  It's not it's not that's not there's no engagement there at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And why is Google trying to get more long form on?  They must know something.  Yeah, I got a big guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am starting to get more and more concerned.  Remember, we we did our year ender and I and I you know, you asked me what should Google do.  And it was completely off the top of my head.  I said they should spin off or get rid of YouTube.  And I'm starting to feel more and more that this is the case as I see you.  Did you read the article in the New Yorker this week?  No, I didn't yet.  There is there is a there is a article on streaming on YouTube's plans.  They call it streaming.  I see. I don't think of it.  I think of the live stuff that we're doing is streaming.  Yeah, it's not it's not really.  It's watching video on the on the Web, not live.  But they are really getting they hired this guy.  I don't know how he pronounces last name, but they are getting very aggressive about this.  And I just feel like Google, as we talked about last week, should not be in content.  No, I won't.  How do you Kevin, what do you think about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I don't mind if YouTube is the channel for which when the Oscars are on or let's say the Super Bowl or something like that,  if they want to be the provider of, you know, Web video for events and things like that, I think that totally fits their mission.  Because they get the bandwidth to do it.  They have the bandwidth, but it also brings people into looking at Google as a place to go for information and events and what's being talked about.  But I guess I tend to agree that I don't think that original content creation is something that they should be trying to do,  whether they kind of accidentally do it is another matter.  But I'm not saying it's bad business for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In fact, it probably is very good business for them.  I'm just saying it's bad business for me because of Google as being the arbiter of what exists on the Internet.  They have way too much power.  And so they shouldn't be making content.  That's a conflict of interest because they're going to, you know, I'm a feared that if it's not on YouTube, it doesn't exist.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And when you subscribe to people's YouTube channels, which is currently kind of the method for monetizing YouTube,  you know, which channels you see recommended to you, you know, if you like this, you might also like this.  That is a lot of power.  A lot of power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much viewership do you get for the network from YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if YouTube doesn't yank the show because of shootative copyright violations, it just varies.  Some of our shows get a significant portion of our downloads, you know, maybe 30 percent.  Most of the shows, it's maybe 10 percent or less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we guess magic gets more heavy geek.  It's less.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  iPad today is a popular show.  I think our Before You Buy show is going to be carefully cultivated for YouTube.  There's 19,000 views on a show that we didn't even put out as a podcast yet.  It was the rehearsal for our gaming show, which launches next week.  Oh, so.  So and then we do we had a couple of million plus view shows as well.  But we also have a very hard time monetizing it because you turn on that switch and then Google says no, but you got copyright violations and turns it back off.  So it's not it's not a real if you're not in the Google sphere, if you're not a Google partner and Google decides in arcane ways how to make you a partner, you you really are second class on Google very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's your that's the essence of your concern about them being content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think they should be in the content business.  John Seabrook's article is in this week's New Yorker.  It's called Streaming Dreams.  And it's the dream and the dreamer is Google.  It's Google and it's in its views.  Last week's Twig has seven hundred eighty five views.  So it's not a you know, it's not a big number for Twig.  The talking head shows don't do that well.  And it's it's talking with this guy, Robert.  It's Kyncl.  He's Czech.  So it's probably Kyncl or Kyncl who is the architect of all of this new content on Google.  Well Worth Reading is a very interesting article.  It scared the hell out of me.  Well, we tried to for instance, we tried to keep become partners with YouTube Live and they told us, well, you can't you have ads.  We do the ads, buddy.  Yeah.  Hey, let's talk about Twitter.  Last week, Rupert Murdoch tweeting now Alec Baldwin is back, baby.  I didn't even know he left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't? Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  After the airplane, he left after the Words with Friends incident.  Yeah.  So now he's talking about politics, conversing with his yoga teacher girlfriend and opining on Super Bowl picks.  According to Laura Hertzfeld writing at News Briefs.  W. I guess that's Entertainment Weekly.  Is that your old magazine, Entertainment Weekly?  That's you, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. Yep. Yep.  Long, long ago.  Jeff started that magazine.  Did we talk about Howard Stern's drunk dialing last week?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We didn't.  Howard, is this on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was on Twitter.  So Howard on New Year's Day, he actually told the full story on a show that he got a call.  The quick story is he has something like Google Voice.  So the message came in.  Paul is calling.  He knew one Paul who was the new boss he's going to have at America's Got Talent.  So he took the call and he said, Paul, this is great.  I'm really happy.  I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.  Boy, can you believe all this publicity we're getting?  And he gets kind of confused.  Silence is on the other end.  And finally the conversation goes on and he realizes this is not Paul, the British guy he's working with.  It's Paul McCartney.  Oh my God.  Calling to thank him for something nice he'd said.  Oh my God.  Longer the short of it, he thought, you know, that just made my day.  That was just the coolest damn thing to have a beetle.  No kidding.  It was great.  So he thought, who could I do that for?  So he wanted to call one of his whack packers, Mary Ann from Brooklyn.  And then his wife said, why don't you just drunk dial people?  Go on Twitter.  And so he went on Twitter and said, tell me your phone numbers.  And by God, thousands and thousands went by.  And Howard started calling people.  He spent three hours on New Year's Eve.  Oh, good on him.  It was really very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh my God, is that cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I DMed him.  I abused him on the air once to get him to follow me.  So he follows me.  I DMed him my number.  And then he said back on Twitter, I can't.  You're blocking callers who block their numbers.  And I said, no, I'm not.  You're screwing up.  It's not me.  And the fact I had.  So I missed a call from Howard Stern.  He tried to call you.  Tried to call me.  Yeah.  But it was very cool what he did.  It was very, very, you know, he's kind of shrugging.  Why do people think it's a big deal?  But it's him looking at the audience as a relationship, not just your product and realizing that relationship.  So it was cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So he actually tweeted, just tried the number again.  A message says you do not wish callers who block their number.  Jeff Jarvis always had problems.  That's because I said he always had problems with phones.  Great.  Speaking to so many of you.  Amazing how great the conversations were.  You know, my phone number, of course, has leaked out many times on the air here.  And many people have my phone number.  And every once in a while, it's like it happened yesterday.  I was getting in the shower and a guy called and said, Leo.  I'm being visual, Leo.  I don't want to know that.  Well, it was a blocked call.  And actually, I do answer blocked calls because some very close family members have blocked calls.  I wish they wouldn't.  And so I have to answer blocked calls.  So I answered the block call.  I said, hey, just really love the show.  And you can hear the show.  I'm sure you can hear the shower running in the background.  And I'm kind of normally I would actually say thanks.  It's nice to hear where you calling from.  But I said, you know, I was kind of brusque because I'm like I'm standing here naked.  You know, I so it goes both ways.  That does.  And I, you know, actually, I don't I don't mind.  I use Google Voice.  The number of people have is Google Voice.  So I can see if it's somebody I want to talk to or not.  You know, most of the time people don't block their numbers.  You're more likely to, you know, if I now I've given out the secret that if you block your number, I'm more likely to answer you.  You fool.  You idiot.  Hey, if Howard can do it, I can do it.  Yeah, but I was responding to the tweet.  He said where I'm surprised.  Actually, these conversations are pleasant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, he loved it.  His fans were because his fans can abuse him online.  But these were all really nice people.  He had a great time.  That's the secret, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All of the trolling is anonymous.  Yes.  As soon as it's somebody and you're really face to face with them, people don't mean things.  No, they were great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One guy he called one guy said, you a friend of mine is paraplegic.  You would really make his day if you called him.  And Howard did.  And he got the mother and the mother said, you know, come on, you're screwing with my son here.  And he had to convince her that no, no, really.  I'm Howard Stern.  This friend said I should call.  And he had a nice chat with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, Kanye West, on the other hand, has been tweeting in completely incomprehensibly.  This is a new this is going to be the newest journalistic meme explaining what the hell they're tweeting.  MTV News actually did an article explaining what Kanye was talking about.  He a 91 message manifesto.  Ye, Y.E., who is currently in London, went off on a gang of topics, including his women's fashion.  Oh, I guess they call Kanye Ye.  Ye.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  I'm so unhip.  He went off on a gang of topics, including his women's fashion line, the Grammys, his design ideas for the MTV Video Music Awards and his vision.  He must have been high.  Unorganized, but informative.  Yeezy put the string of tweets into context in his thirty ninth posts writing, this is just a train of thought, but figure it's better to read than train thoughts.  Somebody I have to find this.  It was on Google Plus did illustrations of these tweets.  I'm going to see if I can find this because it's very hard from anyone to imply that Kanye lives inside his own head.  Oh, it's just stream of consciousness.  Illustrate. I'm going to see if I can Google Kanye illustrated tweets.  Yeah, illustrated by a five year old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I bet it didn't affect his follower count at all.  I bet nobody people love it.  Yeah, people thought it was the most interesting thing in there.  He's like the horsey books of rappers right now.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The teacher said I couldn't focus.  I used to get kicked out of class for bringing dirty mags and drawing Nikes in fourth grade.  There is a picture of him getting kicked out of class.  I know this is not a very rapper thing to say, but I haven't bought a new car, a piece of jewelry in about two years.  Dear Kanye, we miss you.  The car store.  The car store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where he believes cars come from.  The car store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to put creatives in a room together with like minds that are all way doper than me.  You must be this dope to enter.  I'm not dope enough.  Oh, this is the one I like.  My dreams keep me woke.  Stay awake.  Yeah.  This is from the Buzz, which is a fun site about internet memes and stuff.  You must be this dope to enter.  Google.  Instead of kicking kids out of school for using their iPhones, why not promote it?  Allow kids to use search engines to do tests.  Who had?  So the Google search is who had the best video of all time?  OK, so now I've learned something.  We call him Yee or Yeezy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yay.  Yay.  Yeah, I believe so.  I'm so not with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So unhip.  Is our chat room any hip really?  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're much hipper.  They're very hip.  And of course, then you have the government, the US government saying, yeah, we can pull people off of Twitter.  And we have Joe Lieberman saying, you ought to get off Twitter because you're Taliban, which is not, by the way, an illegal governmental.  You know, it's not Al Qaeda.  It's not a terrorist organization.  You may not like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they just open an office somewhere, I think.  Yeah, they just open an office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there you go.  They did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet they want somebody to work on the cloud.  They're going to open their own cloud.  They'll be hiring cloud skilled people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, happy birthday, iPhone.  Five years old today.  Apple announced the iPhone on this day in 2007.  They didn't ship it till June.  But I will never forget that speech effect.  When Steve Jobs passed away, that was one of the speeches that was shown over and over again because it was one of his best keynotes.  The one where he says, you know, what did he say?  It's a phone.  It's an iPod.  It's an Internet device.  Phone, iPod, Internet device.  And then it turned out it was one device, the iPhone.  I'll never forget that.  I was sitting next to Scott Bourne, I remember, and he was like he was squealing the whole time.  He couldn't.  So excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't remember how much was known before the announcement.  How much leaked before the announcement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Scott thought it would be called iPhone.  Everybody was pretty sure Apple was going to announce a phone, but we didn't know what it would look like.  What do you think, Kevin?  What do we know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't.  I remember I was working in a newspaper and I had to write like a next day story for it.  And I don't think anyone was expecting the form that it came in, especially the one button thing.  No.  You know, one button and then all touch screen.  Although in hindsight, it's obvious, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But as always with Apple, oh, of course, because when you make something that is so, you know, is the platonic ideal of something, then everybody goes, oh, well, of course it had to be that way.  But at the time, we knew there would be a phone.  We were pretty sure there would be a phone.  There was no guarantee, but we were pretty sure there would be a phone.  Scott Bourne.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The phone before that, though, Apple had teamed up with Motorola to make this really cruddy, you know, Moto rocker phone.  Horrible phone.  Yeah, all it did was it kind of synced to iTunes if you hated yourself and you can only put 100 songs on it.  It was.  And I remember looking at the museum for the museum.  For those don't know, they have a collection of all the front pages for any one particular day.  I don't think you could find a front page in America that didn't have the iPhone reveal at least like linked to inside the inside the paper.  Everyone was caught so off guard by that phone.  Huge story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Any other stories we want to cover before we get to our tip?  Let's see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was there something above?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Talk for a bit.  I have to I'm going to run and get something for my tip or my talk.  I shall return.  Talk amongst yourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Talk amongst yourselves.  Oh, geez.  How's the weather in Buffalo, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Surprisingly warm, like global climate change inducingly fear warm.  It's snowed.  It snowed to the point where I had to scrape my car only twice this winter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kind of like that the whole city is is not miserable enough and that makes them scared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, like I'm not one of those folks who believe that like climate change can be based on how warm it is or whatever like this particular day.  But man, like I haven't pulled out a snow blower at all this year.  It's freaking me out.  It's freaking a lot of people I know out.  But yeah, it's it's odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what else was I going to see here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now you can plug your essay for Think Quarterly and explain what Think Quarterly is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think Quarterly is Google's kind of like McKinsey Quarterly.  They're they're kind of in-house thing.  They send advertisers and such.  And so they did an issue on speed.  They said you were to do something for it.  And I said, yeah.  And I thought about it.  I want to do a piece on something I've talked about here.  The idea that the change is not happening as fast as we think.  That is actually very slow.  It's only just begun.  And what does that mean?  It would be changed by the Internet and technology and society and all that.  We think it's this this this this volcanic huge lightning speed change upon us.  And I think it's actually very slow.  I think we've just begun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that was an interesting article, wasn't it?  I thought that was very interesting.  It was fun.  It was fun.  The speed.  Speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Based on I'm guessing.  I'm just going to guess that if you look it has a reference to Gutenberg somewhere in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or Habermas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or Habermas.  In terms of how long it took Gutenberg to, you know, for his ideas to actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bingo.  It's a little recycled.  I'll admit that, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here you go.  Tweak listeners, you get rewarded.  You get some private insights here without even having to read stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.  I could unfortunately I packed the thing I was going to get.  So I have to describe it.  I'll get to our tool.  But it's I'm going to I'm bringing it to Vegas.  So that's why.  Leo's magic box, people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a magic thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But let's start with you, Kevin, because you said that you at the behest of Gina Trapani prepared a tip for us.  We have we have the Google Plus guy here.  I mean, this is the king of using Google Plus.  So I hope it's a Google.  Oh, no, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's Android.  I'm OK.  No, you're also the king of Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My Google Plus tip is somewhere on the Internet.  You might be able to find a guide to using Google Plus.  Yes.  And you should buy it now.  You should probably.  It's an e-book form.  So I really I have a device problem where I'm always wiping my devices.  I'm rooting my Android five times a year, reinstalling operating systems for my laptops because I like to tweak things.  And every time I go over to a friend's house, I have to ask them for their Wi-Fi password.  And they give me this look that implies they've given me the Wi-Fi password for their house eight or nine times this year already.  Why do I have to keep doing this?  And even if you've taken your laptop to work, you know, the local Starbucks, your coffee shop, you know, you have the Wi-Fi password on your laptop, but not on your phone.  And then you get there and you wish you had it and you can't remember it.  So I found a really neat program recently in the Android market called Wi-Fi PC sync.  And that's Wi-Fi all one word PC sync search for you.  I have to scroll down a little bit.  I think the developer recently had to resubmit it or something.  I checked it out and basically it takes all the Wi-Fi passwords off of your right now windows.  Hopefully so smart Mac takes all the Wi-Fi passwords off your Mac or excuse me, off your Windows PC encrypts them, which I had to check and flings them over to your Android.  So you don't have to enter anything. I love it.  Nope. Every single Wi-Fi password on your Windows PC over to your Android.  And so therefore, whenever you go somewhere, you know, your phone hopefully will see the Wi-Fi network detected and connect to it automatically.  It makes me wish for like a service that was Dropbox like and did this for all your.  Oh, there's a good idea.  Yeah. Yeah.  Let's write that right now.  Yes. Just kind of pull out the Ruby book here.  But no, obviously not.  So if you have a if you have a Windows PC and you have an Android phone, this is the really great app that just, you know, will save you battery life.  Actually, Wi-Fi almost always does better on battery life than 3G or 4G.  So Wi-Fi PC sync in the Android market free.  Grab it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very cool. Cool.  I wish they did it on the Mac, though, because all my passwords are Macs.  Yeah. Yeah.  Oh, I want to I want to figure out how to write something like that.  That actually would be a great little thing.  You press a button that goes to a encrypted folder on Dropbox and then you could run it on your other devices.  I like that. That's a good touch.  That's a good touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see what I'm saying?  So we can start up ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I bet I could write that in five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff and Kevin talk amongst yourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll be right back.  Jeff Jarvis, your tip of the week.  My number of the week.  The week is four billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Piper Jaffrey says Google's mobile ad business will hit four billion dollars.  Wow.  This year, that for perspective is nine percent of Google's total revenue of 40 billion.  And but it's also from a perspective equals Facebook's entire ad revenue.  So just mobile.  And I think that that goes back to our earlier discussion on why would Google pay to get Android on TV's?  They're going to make money.  It's worth it for them to see that everywhere they possibly can and win the TVOS before somebody else we know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think that they consider TV mobile?  I think Piper Jaffrey might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think Google does, but I think it's non it's non computer devices, non laptop, non desktop.  I think it's mobile and mobile is, you know, mean, absolutely meaningless.  Is a tablet mobile when most of its usage is inside the home?  No, but it registers that way in these kinds of discussion.  Right.  The tablets are mobile.  It's not mobile.  Mobile. I have long argued on this show is a meaningless word.  It means, you know, local.  It means around me.  That just means it is with me.  And the TV is where I am right now.  And so that you OK, I know where you are.  You're in your living room. You're in your home.  This is what you're thinking.  This is the kind of advertising I can give you as opposed to knowing this is a phone and that it's out somewhere.  Right.  So it's more signals generated, more revenue, more relevance, more revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to say the division of the division of Motorola that Google bought was called Motorola Mobility and they make the set top box chips.  Right. Exactly.  So even more useless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A lot of people in the chat are suggesting that I instead of my pick tell you about this and I will.  It's called No Sopa.  It's a Chrome extensions getting a lot of press.  You probably already heard about it that when you visit a website like, let's say, the Motion Picture Association of America that supports Sopa, you'll get a big red bar on it that says this company is a known supporter.  Now, the only reason I'm not crazy about this is it's it's not always clear if this company is supporting actively supporting Sopa now.  Sopa is fact we talked about this on Twitter.  It's maybe a stalking horse for IP protect, which is the Senate bill, which is more likely to get passed while everybody's paying attention to Sopa.  There is an Android app that will also do this.  You know, it's fun to just just see the reason I worry a little bit about it is because Ford is widely accused of being pro Sopa.  In fact, Ford is not pro Sopa.  I'm going to actually have dinner with Alan Mullally tomorrow and ask him to clarify that.  But Scott Monty has tweeted and said that Ford never went on on the air supporting us or said anything supporting Sopa.  There was an older statement pre Sopa pre Sopa even being a bill saying we do support private public IP rights.  But so this is this is where I worry a little bit about this bar is I don't know.  You know, Ford is getting that red bar and I don't know where they're getting this information from.  In this case, it's kind of anecdotal.  It is not in fact the case that Ford supports Sopa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not just Sopa. It's protect IP. And then there's the new Darrell Issa bill.  Exactly. It is getting some support from some tech companies.  But all that really reveals to me is that once again, we're wrong to put the tech companies in the position of protecting the Internet.  We want to protect the Internet from all those parties, government and companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Right. And the thing I was going to show you, I wish I don't have it.  And I don't. It was actually I know.  So I was looking for a clip when I had the Nexus, you know, one of the things Nexus does is time lapse.  And I and I was doing a bunch of time lapses for my car.  And I was looking for a way to mount the Google Nexus phone, the Samsung Nexus, Galaxy Nexus into my car so that I could do time lapses out of the window.  And the chat room suggested a fantastic suction cup clip that is it was cheap.  I bought it on Amazon. And in fact, it's so good that even though I'm not just I no longer have the Google Samsung Nexus,  and it means I no longer have ice cream sandwich, even on my my old Galaxy S2, I want to when I do videos, I'm do some videos from CES.  I'm bringing this clip to see.  Yes. And that's why it's in my bag.  It holds any phone very gently, very securely.  And it's really fantastic.  Do you remember chat room?  I'm going to have to ask you guys the name of it.  I want to say the XO clip, but it's something like the XO clip.  And now I can't find it.  Somebody says GoPro.  No, no. The GoPros are those great little cameras.  But this is something that will hold your smartphone.  It works very well with the iPhone as anything else.  And it's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very specifically for ice cream sandwich Android 4.0 that does the time lapse.  It's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it isn't.  Yeah, it is the XO clip.  All right. Well, I'm trying to I'm trying to find it online.  Thank you. Chris is the guy who told me about it.  And I highly recommend XO Gear, XO Mount.  That's it. That's it. XO Gear, XO Mount.  And it is fantastic for holding a phone.  It's cheap. You can get it on for 16 bucks.  It's on Amazon for 20 bucks.  That's where I bought it.  And it really works really well for holding your phone.  It's very cool.  So it's just a little doodad.  But there are a number of programs, heads up displays and so forth that you might want to have on your phone.  And if you're using the ice cream sandwich time lapse, it's really great for doing time lapses out of your window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, but don't watch videos, people.  Don't watch videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, I'm going to confess. I'm going to make a confession.  I wasn't watching videos, but I did make a few Skype calls with the thing.  That's OK. Or Skype calls.  So I did a Skype call with Rick Salmon, who's a great photographer, and his video is there and he can watch me.  I'm driving along. We're talking. And he's clipped up there and he's watching me.  And the phone went out. The call went out. And he called me back.  He said, did you have an accident?  I had to call back to make sure that you were all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty funny.  My problem is I'll be on calls in the car and I've been me.  I will use words that one won't use on twig aimed at other drivers.  Yes.  Something I'm just a normal sentence that I'll say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd be afraid you'd actually switch from the front to the back camera and all of a sudden the other person would see like the road coming.  How you're driving. Yeah. Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's cool, too.  So this is, you know, it's a cheap little doohickey.  But it's the first one I found that really makes it easy to put your phone in your windshield.  And the clip just never comes off. It's really good.  Even on a dashboard or does it have glass?  Well, it's got some sticky. It's better on.  They say yes on the dashboard. I always put it on the glass.  So if the dashboard is not too pebbled, it works.  It works. You can turn off the bad synthesizer music.  They say, look, they're holding a 26 pound microwave.  No, come on.  Yeah, it's a pretty good suction cup.  Now I have to watch it.  I guess it'll work or they wouldn't put it on video.  They look around the office. What's heavy here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What can we look? We got a microwave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not even locked.  Look at that. It's lifting a 26 pound microwave.  Can your car do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does it make a good just general smartphone dock or is it only specifically for this shooting purpose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, basically it's got these nice rubberized clips that will hold roughly any shape like this.  So I've used it both the iPhone and the Android phone.  The reason I'm bringing it to Vegas is because I'm going to put it on the table and do videos.  It's like it's better than a tripod. How do you do a tripod on a phone?  So you need a clip. Anyway, it's fun.  I'm just saying. I'm sorry it's in the car.  Kevin Purdy's newest book. Of course, he wrote the Android book.  What is it? The Complete Guide to Android?  The Complete Android Guide.  Yeah, must have. And his newest is Google Plus, The Missing Manual, the book that should have come with the site.  Just came out from O'Reilly. Get it right now.  And I would have a copy in my hands, but I haven't got it yet.  I do have a copy of this. It's Jeff Jarvis's book.  Thank you for the plug. I appreciate it.  Great book. Public parts. And of course, his previous book, which is also a must read.  What would Google do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Tom, getting on the call shortly. Google's going to announce some stuff tomorrow related to Plus and Search and things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they're trading CES seriously. I think it's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, Kevin. It's going the way of wave, man. It's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I can update the ebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's some neat stuff coming. It's embargoed for tomorrow. Leo won't listen to embargoed stuff.  I figure what the heck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you listen to it and then we'll talk about it next week.  I guess I'll know because I'll be at CES. I'm actually about to get on the plane.  We began our coverage last night, but our next CES live coverage is the Microsoft keynote.  The very last Microsoft keynote.  Microsoft's announced it will not be going back to CES after this year.  Steve Ballmer will be speaking.  And there are very strong rumors that Steve might be showing some unusually interesting things.  Microsoft's keynote history is kind of checkered.  It's worse than checkered. They basically have never shown anything of interest.  Apparently there's going to be a Kinect Pro. I've heard rumors there's going to be a Kinect Pro.  They will have that new Nokia phone, which is actually going to give Android and iPhone a run for money.  The Ace.  Yeah, this is nice.

Transcript:  Nokia 900 slash Ace, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the Ace is the key, is the code word, huh?  Yes, the 900 is beautiful. I love the N9, and this is the N9 with Windows Phone 7, an actual operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The New York Times wrote a slatheringly long piece about how wonderful Windows Phone is and who would have guessed it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's better than you'd expect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the piece was like critics love it. Now what?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, one of the things apparently Microsoft is going to start doing, and this is according to Paul Thurado of Windows Weekly,  is offer spiffs, just as Google and Apple do to the salesmen and saleswomen in the phone stores to sell Windows Phone.  Because you go in an AT&T store, it's very hard to get them to sell you a Windows Phone.  They'll steer you towards an iPhone or an Android phone first because they make 25 bucks.  Yeah.  So Microsoft's announced, yeah, we're going to do this. So yeah, so exciting.  So we'll start that coverage of the keynote and Paul and Mary Jo will be commenting in the background at 630 Pacific 930 Eastern tonight.  Right after that, we go to the Digital Experience event, another one of those ballroom events where lots of vendors show up.  And Tom Mara and Sarah Lane will be hosting there tonight.  I'll pop in as soon as I get off the plane. I'm going to go right over there because they have a chocolate fountain.  I just want to bathe my head in it.  Thank you so much, Jeff.

Transcript:  I like listen.  Listen is OK.  I guess I'm not a power podcast listener, even though I'm occasionally on them.  But yeah, I like listen. Some folks like Acast.  Those are the ones I often hear recommended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm looking for a good pod catcher on Android.  Dog Catcher. That's a good one, actually. I know people like dog catcher.
