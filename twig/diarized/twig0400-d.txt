Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So  So much to talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have one priority before anything else yes  What we have to sing happy birthday? No way should we do that now? Well, I think I think Stacy should show her videos  All right. I think I think Google won unquestionably over

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Amazon what is we talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You would have to go to Twitter to see them and I'm not sure if you're prepared for this Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't use Twitter. You know that I'm a mastodon man

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're all in on mastodon  I don't know  I wouldn't be able to post this to mastodon but I did a comparison of the Amazon echo singing happy birthday to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh and Google home and they're somewhat different. Let's let's try it. Let's let's see. Here you go  Let me turn on the audio though

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Happy birthday if you'd like I can sing to you just ask me to sing happy birthday and we can celebrate this special day with song

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's no  sing happy birthday

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She's quite a nice voice. Oh just wait till Google goes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I  See a cheater would have been really impressive. Are those olives?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, those are pretty acorns that my daughter collected in that's nice a lovely crystal bowl, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well here in here in Petaluma the Indians the locals used to they lived on acorns  They would grind them up and we have lots of acorn. It's my birthday pestles pestles mortars and pestles  You can dig them up and that's what they lived on so grind it up. It's delicious

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's my birthday

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, happy birthday. I hope you have an amazing day

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sing happy birthday

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Happy birthday to you  Happy birthday to the most amazing person in the universe  Happy birthday to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow  Yeah, did a little auto tuning kind of stuff and Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I also enjoyed the most amazing person in the universe because I never hear that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that what you told it to go you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would say because I've taught it how to say my name  But it doesn't care. So it doesn't actually use that  Deeply  but um Tom  Tom's I don't know if it's Simonite Simonite over at MIT Tech Review. He's an editor over there  he told Google Assistant it was his birthday and he got a  Anchorman poster that said happy birthday Tom you beautiful bastard or something like that  So I mailed it to him it yet. Wow I am set to emit it  Google Assistant  Allows it to him. Okay  Whatever. I did it and let's see if it'll show you what it gave me  That's I was like that's also in Twitter, but it gave me happy birthday Stacey and it has this super purple pink flower  Cake thing. Oh cuz it knows you're a woman  Well, that's the thing. I think it just found a Stacey happy birthday  But Google normally thinks I'm a man because of the types of sites that go to and Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Could be either right you can't tell or you could be both and there's nothing wrong with that. There would be nothing wrong with that. I  Have found one celebrate gender dysphoria  Where is it I don't shouldn't have said that should I they shouldn't I shouldn't have said that I  Don't see this this reputed tweets because I've been searching Twitter  So I don't see this picture  Okay, but I do see an article you wrote for the technology review that I think is quite interesting  So one of the big stories this week is that plume is raising money a lot of money  This is one of the mesh Wi-Fi players twenty seven million dollars at least  It was going up and they interestingly that the lead investor turns out to be guests  Comcast  Comcast now I happen to like the plume  In fact, that's what we use at home now and it made sense for me because at $79 each  It can add up quite quickly to a very expensive Wi-Fi, but but but it works. So it's like, okay  It's $49 each. It seems like I paid more than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, yeah, the three pack originally was more I think yeah, but yes, so the the thing they're doing that's interesting  So there's like the traditional mesh Wi-Fi  Action that's happening and everybody's doing TP link just actually introduced some today. Everybody links is TP link

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Of course, there's euro which kicked things off  Whatever happened to luma luma never did ever come out. It did come out it it exists links. It says velop  Then the or be which isn't technically mesh the amplify which from ubiquity the company that really invented this way back when?  for enterprise  So but I after trying a bunch of them and I you know  I don't know if the wire cutters yet made their pick but I just said they picked the or be  Okay as the fastest and that was my experience as well. It was really fast, but it's not a mesh  But it's not a mesh. So they call it the best Wi-Fi mesh networking kit for most people  The net gear or be which is interesting. I got great results from the or be but I liked the idea of the plume being in every room  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They manage everything in the cloud  So what's happening there is it's they're really going to be trying to give you Wi-Fi as a service and have it truly adapt  To your home in ways that the euro might do with over-the-air software updates every now and then but they're gonna be doing it  Plume is gonna be trying to do it on the fly  So it's it's a slightly different kind of model

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're also cuter and you plug them into the wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you have less choice about the Google one did and that's why it fell over when some site with Google went down  It fell over

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You talk about the on hub or the Google mesh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Google the Google on hub where it it managed to brick itself and you had to  Restart it and we log in because it got a configuration from the net

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Two months ago, yeah, I do read I know now when you said fell over I pictured it falling off a desk  I do remember I don't remember the cause so but I bet you're right. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Jim Salter who you actually had on the new screensavers to talk about the various ones was test these network engineers  So you really tested these and he has the same conclusion I do which is there isn't one perfect one  It really depends a lot on your house. For instance, he says for a bigger house  The euros better because it's satellites could talk to one another instead of having to talk to the base and you can add units  But it didn't have the raw signal strength of the or be which I experienced or the amplify HD  On the other hand, he didn't he thought the amplify HD was the slowest of the bunch  So it's it's really kind of confused. It's a cute confusing space  But you have an interesting theory about why Comcast is putting so much money into plume

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, when I talked to plume CEO I met him here in Austin  Before they launched so a while back very smart man  what  He talked about is he wanted to be able to eventually charge people for  SLAs on their Wi-Fi essentially and the hope was that  ISPs would pay plume for this to manage all the Wi-Fi networks for them or they would pass that on to their subscribers

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  SLA stands for service level agreement you're saying a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  guaranteed level of service quality of service right because they can do all that in the cloud they can actually  It's it's software-defined so they can partition out enough bandwidth for your television for example and  that's really a compelling offering for service providers because a  You know when you pay for  Broadband and cable from Comcast you certainly want it to work on your television  But it also as they're bringing in all these devices in the home  They want to be able to if they sell you a doorbell  They want to guarantee Wi-Fi getting all the way out to your doorbell, and this is a good do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's one of the reasons I end up using mesh because I wanted my ring  To be accessible with out of the doorbell, but I but I like the idea of small  pools of Wi-Fi per room pools  Because if I look at my you know when I use insider or some other tool to look at my Wi-Fi the 2.4 gigahertz band  I'm seeing somebody's printer. We live we don't live next door to anybody. They're at least several hundred feet away  I see printers routers. I see all sorts of stuff because everything all the Wi-Fi gear now has been turned up  There's more power so but the 5 gigahertz bandwidth which doesn't travel as well doesn't go through walls  Well is clear is clean  So I like the idea of a 5 gigahertz router that automatically picks that channel if it needs to  And it's really all of the mesh routers do a good job of that much better  They're all all at least dual band summer tri band

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead Kevin so the 2.4 gigahertz has  Traveled with microwaves and water and things whereas the 5 gigahertz is cleaner for that so

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They travel further thing depends on what else is around well the higher frequency though is more hindered by things in the way, right?  I mean yeah, yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But depends what they make because basically the 2.4 gigahertz is a resonance frequency of water molecules  so if you're trying to rain or  Anything that has a high amount of water in it then  Just interesting is is that there's an issue in in San Francisco one of the I don't know which one is but one of the  Networking companies there uses Wi-Fi network bridges and when it's foggy the bandwidth goes down Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow well  But see that's why I like the the plume model as long as they can talk to one another and then create these little pools  of Wi-Fi  You're you're almost always next to the router because there's one in every room  So you're never more than 10 feet from a router which works quite well. I think so  So they their plan and I'm sure Comcast plan is  To be part of the deal like when you get a Comcast cable modem  You'd get it you'd get the plume routers that would be good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they actually Comcast at I think was at CES this year. They introduced a  New cloud-based Wi-Fi program that they got when they bought a company. I think was called power dog a  Few years back and power dog was actually a really early company doing better Wi-Fi before it erode before all these other guys  so  Comcast is thinking hard. I mean, you know we can talk about its regulatory positions, but from a technology perspective  They have really good engineering staff

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They need to because their business which was you know, the the old ditch digging business of bringing television into people's homes is  faltering in the internet era, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they charge you for the  routers every month

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean just the whole idea of oh I get my showtime from Comcast  That's that's going away now because of over-the-top. I'm looking at you know  I've been playing with YouTube TV we talked about it last week  But I just love YouTube TV and I could see this being for a lot of people. It's got a built-in DVR  It doesn't have a huge selection stations as we mentioned, but it's getting more  This is a really this is this is an example of where over-the-top is going  How long before Comcast just gets kicked out of the house except?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Their own I think they have a story on here they are talking about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they you know, this is one of those I I don't you know  I didn't really highlight this story because they said sometime

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe next year. I mean, it's like they own NBC you so they  There you know, their biggest challenge is gonna be making sure the FCC doesn't you know castigate them for it  But this FCC is probably gonna be like yeah, go for it. Yeah. No the fact that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. Yeah  Go ahead zero-rate all you want  So Comcast is gonna do an OTT service over-the-top service  Which is kind of weird in competition with itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not though cuz like it's a different my parents are probably never gonna get rid of cable television  But my daughter is never gonna subscribe to cable television, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why I thought YouTube TV was such a good play because that gets the YouTube generation, right?  Yes  Comcast has does have this stream  Already I have the Comcast stream in my cable box, but it's you can't tell us  I mean, how do you know it's the internet? I mean, it's not it's just in the cable box  Most people I would think would wouldn't like to get rid of Comcast if they had a better choice for internet service provider  They would so come as my point is that Comcast is smart to make itself a better internet service provider. That's  Clearly what's on the table?  At least that's my thought okay, we're boring everybody

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Interesting story from

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Forbes Google apparently actually this originally came from South Korea's Electronic Times is  Trying to make a massive  880 million dollar mega deal with LG to secure a large supply of what everybody wants these days  Flexible OLED displays. We know Samsung has a deal with Apple for 93 million displays for new iPhones  Displays for new iPhones  Samsung kind of has the lock on OLED displays and has for a long time  But what's interesting is these flexible OLED displays are used in you know, mostly bezel this phones  This is the future of phones the Samsung Galaxy s8 which comes out in a week week from Friday  Rumored iPhone for late this year all  bezel is screens and so when you look at the current pixel  It's gonna look pretty darn antiquated  Next to these new phones, so Google's probably smart to say how we get rid of this frame around the screen  The deal is not done though  But this is something that you might expect in a next generation pixel 2 or pixel 2 XL. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, I'm glad I waited to update. I'll wait for the fancy non antiquated phone. Look. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, I really prefer it not having a bezel is great the LG g6 is like this too. It really is great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just not sure about the rounded edge and how to hold it. Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  when the essay I have the essay next week, but  They aren't as aggressive. I think as the s7 was  Which all we really did go all the way around the essay does give you more of an edge because they realize you need to hold  it right people need  but it's nice because  Getting rid of the bezel means you can have a phone doesn't get out of control but a bigger screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's I think to be desired right and so what what are the cases just then cover the bezel right or cover the the a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Little bit of this is the s8. So if you look at the s8  Yeah, you know the edge they call it the infinity display  It practically goes off the edge  You can hardly see a frame on the left and right and then they were able to you know  Samsung finally got rid of its physical home key. So now they have just very small  I mean have to have some bezel but they're very small, you know for cameras and speakers and my camera something in that  Yeah, yeah, but they've got them pretty darn small  I can't wait to get mine and by doing that they are able to get a five point. What is it five point seven inch?  No, I'm sorry six point two inch screen in a phone the size of Apple's iPhone 7 plus  Which is a five and a half inch screen. So a lot more screen without increasing the phone size

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So have you guys seen we talked about have you talked about the centio no super book  super book  notice sent to you S E N T I O dot com

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Transform your smartphone into a laptop. Oh, well this  Yeah, so this is very similar to what this is what Samsung's doing with what they call decks for the essay  I've ordered one of those I'll get that as well  I can show you that in a couple of weeks and then of course Microsoft does it with something they call continuum  But remember was done first on Android with the atrix. Remember the Motorola atrix. Yeah, it was a phone that turned into a laptop  so the idea  This is a shell  I don't think this is gonna do as well as so the decks and the continuum are just docks  The decks is funny because you you put your phone in it  It charges it has a fan in it because your s8 is gonna get really hot when you use it on the desktop  And then I think what I'm really intrigued in it was Samsung has  Modified Android so that once it says oh you're on a 27 inch screen  it looks like it looked like a desktop operating system with a menu bar and and and that's more for a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Desktop, this is a laptop to travel with and get a larger screen. The reason I brought this up now is because  The effort to get ever more pixels and more space on your screen, but don't make it too big to hold at some point  Yeah, but you want to carry this is that device you use here and there and then you carry something else  Why not carry a laptop? That's what I'm wondering. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The I guess and by the way, this is a Kickstarter. So don't get

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that was that was my thing when I I upgraded my kids before I moved here. So I got the 15 inch Mac MacBook  I got last year's 15 inch MacBooks. I actually like having ports and a power to strike point destroy the device with but  Yes, that means I do have lots of pixels  I it is usable in that way  Whereas that everything all the other ones that are that bit smaller that didn't quite cut it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess the idea is if you're carrying around a modern smartphone, you're carrying around  desktop  quality processors and  All your data is on here all your connectivity is on here. So right why bother  Was it a second device?  That's why I like the dock because you can bring the dock with you and you get to somewhere else and you  All you need is a keyboard mouse and a monitor  I don't know if hotels are gonna sit on a plane though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This you can watch you can store the movie on your phone interesting. How much is it watch on this?  119 bucks. Oh, that's not bad. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it looks actually kind of like a Chromebook or yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And and it doesn't tether smart activity is your phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. That's the beauty of it  Three million dollars they raised  For the Superbook tune your smartphone into a laptop  Huh  Well, it does kind of make sense. Oh now they've got backlit keys  Extra USB port. Oh, this is funny. They've got a lot of stretch goals 1080p

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah for $55 more you you get the 1080p and we get that for sure, right?  Are you getting it? I don't know something I'll end up complaining about right one thing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Besides modifying Android so it fits better on a screen. It looks better on a desktop. They also got Microsoft to provide  Applications and Samsung's gonna do some applications that do windowing that do overlapping that do tiling they make it because that's one, you know  Anyway  Anyway, anyway  Anyway, let's take a break come back with more  Google home app is hitting in multi user support. Finally something that the  Alexis had for a while. I'm sorry. Yeah goes out for a while  The Google book  Search Burger King ads burger King ads  Facebook f8s coming up what we might be seeing. Oh and Jeff we got to talk about your new niche initiative. That's right  Yeah, well Craig. No, it's been so long since we talked to you Craig Newmark Facebook and Mozilla to bring integrity back to the newsbiz  And Jeff we roll in here every week Jeff. You're involved  Yeah, well we do that. Yeah, I did that we don't get 14 million dollars either  I'm just kidding  our show today brought to you by  segment  Now this is a little bit data geeky  So bear with me if you're not one of those people who's responsible for a website or an app or an engineer responsible for collecting analytics  segments a data hub a  Platform really that makes it easy to collect and unify and act on customer data  no matter where it comes from your website your mobile app your cloud platforms and  Then process it it's kind of like plumbing  so the way we do it or we did it and I think a lot of people there are you got a website you could start  putting stuff little JavaScript stubs in there for Google Analytics and  heat mapping and  Chart beat and use pretty soon. You got 50 different little little stubs in there  Because you want to know what's going on with your website  Well, imagine if instead of that you put one line of code your segment code and then everything is piped into  Your segment dashboard where you can graphically say where things go  This is the easiest way to do it and man you're gonna save a lot of engineering time plus  Your website will be more reliable. It'll be easier to use. It's a single API  You write code integration just once and it unifies all your data and performing analytics on any platform for market out mailchimp  Atlassian uses it Intuit uses it New Relic and Reuters some of the world's best companies you could choose from hundreds of partner integrations  Including the most popular apps for advertising analytics a b testing attribution. That's just the a's  with segment  One engineer one guy or gal could quickly integrate a new analytics tool for the data driven account manager  Another for the app happy marketer another for the data scientist who needs a unified data warehouse  And what's nice is if anything  Any of any of the services you're using is offline for a little bit  Don't worry segment will continue to gather the data and then upload it to the service when it comes back online  You can bring in your data from any source import horse historical data customize what ends up in your data warehouse of choice  It's the customer data platform both developers and analysts love  It's got a great API an extensive partner ecosystem and it's gonna save you a lot of time and  a lot of money  Integrating these tools and by the way your CEO will quickly will love the quickly deployed integrations  With Zendesk and intercom and that nexus and on and on over eight thousand of the world's best companies use segment  I bet you never even heard of it. I hadn't to drive growth and revenue  It's exactly what you're looking for try it free the team plan for three months when you sign up at segment  dot-com slash twitch segment  dot-com slash  twitch  So let's talk about this this new venture Jeff, it's  the tau  Folks are among the contributors. There's quite a few Craig Newmark Ford Foundation democracy fund  the Knight Foundation the Tao Foundation app nexus and beta works a total 14 million dollar fund and  What are you gonna do with and are you CUNY school of journalism graduate school of journalism is gonna minister it that's you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's us. That's us. That's that's me. So what are you gonna do?  so  This all started with Craig Newmark who gave us a challenge and said do something about this information  Disinformation and Craig as you know has been quite generous lately in the support of journalism  He's always been generous, but he's he's really decided to step up and and and give a lot of money to a lot of players  That's great Mozilla and pointer and  I think first draft and other places. So Craig's been doing great. So he put the challenge out to us  He came up with something that I'll describe in a second and then out of nowhere. I got a call from Facebook who said  What's up to we're thinking about looking for kind of a clearinghouse for doing more things about journalism  I explained what Craig had started and they said oh sounds good  Then along came forward and then we ended up with nine funders and 14 million dollars  We'll work on untrusted news I  Think that the opportunities we saw  Were number one  I think there's been too much discussion around just the platform is the publishers and we need to really talk about the public conversation  That the journalism is about informing the public conversation. We gotta figure that out number two  I think we need to bring more parties into the discussion other responsible and affected parties like ad agencies and brands and ad networks and ad tech  And PR and politics and so on  Number three  We saw the opportunity to convene people and bring people together so they could collaborate number four  I see an opportunity for a flight to quality. I think if you add up  the fact that we talked about this two weeks ago Havas and  Guardian and BBC and Verizon all dumped out of  YouTube advertising telling Google to get their act together and  sleeping Giants has gotten a thousand some advertisers to drop Breitbart and  Bill O'Reilly's advertisers are disappearing like horses over the  Horizons bill apparently and so is bill too  So I you know you start to add it all together and I think that finally advertisers are saying well  It does matter where my ad appears. It does matter where my money goes and I think there's an opportunity there  So we're gonna we're gonna fund  Much of this most of this money will leave CUNY and go out and we're gonna fund research projects and convenience  In New York and around the world  I there's one project that's already underway that I've written about a little bit which is about trying to gather signals about  sites of quality and disrepute to help platforms advertisers ad networks and ad agencies  Decide where to put their money and maybe cut off some of the air supply to the bad guys  I  Want to get some research going on how the conversation operates, so it's really quite an opportunity quite an obligation  And let me be clear here that none of the Facebook money goes into my pocket  and I emailed Leo as soon as this happened and  You know make sure that there wasn't a worry about conflict of interest with the show  I'll have to be clear about this as it goes  Final thing to say is that I negotiated we negotiated my Dean Sarah Bartlett and I Sarah's been on the show we negotiated  Independence without independence. I wouldn't have done this for a second  And so there's a governance structure that guarantees us independence and guarantees me independence. Otherwise, I simply would have done this but nonetheless  You know I debated about this but when Facebook  Well, you know when you yell at Facebook for two years and Google of two years and you say  Do something to help journalism and then they come knocking at your door and say will you help us help journalism to my mind?  How do I say how could I say no, so I'm grateful. We've got these resources. I hope I don't squander them  I hope we use them really well and focused and targeted ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's an example of some of the things you're looking at I mean is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so I think I think I want to understand better how the conversation occurs  I think we've got to do a better job of being transparent about the manipulation that occurs of the platforms and then of us  There's also talking about news literacy news literacy can be a condescending term  Like if you read our news your literate if you don't you're not but news literacy more broadly defined about  Recognizing that the public is part of the creation and dissemination of information and news matters  I also care about making media more public literate about getting journalists to listen better and  Understand the public better and I've talked about that in the show  I really care about new forms of news bringing journalism to the public conversation where it occurs  bringing news to Twitter and  And the Facebook in the forms that are appropriate for there, you know  Look at snapchat forces us to remake our news for snapchat  But otherwise Facebook says okay, here's a spot for your articles put your articles in there  I don't think that's sufficient. So those are the kinds of things that that will get going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sounds very cool. I hope you'll keep us up to date as as I'm willing to start new initiatives and so forth  It's a challenge  Yeah, it's a big challenge. It's a huge challenge

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's a lot of other great organizations other my favorite is an organization called first draft coalition  Which was funded at the beginning by Google?  Claire Wardle and her sister Jenny Sargent are brilliant at this  They did a huge fact-checking effort in the French election with newsrooms there. They're just amazing  The trust project which Richard Gingras has helped back  Is about trying to get metadata around sites  Dan Gilmore Arizona State does a lot of work in news literacy  So we we come to this not competing trying to help but there's I now have some money and resources to to try to help

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, you know it reminds me that the Pulitzers came out in last week and  You've got to be somewhat encouraged by the by the people who won Pulitzers. I mean ProPublica  you know  It's  Invested international consortium of investigative journalists from

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our former students were part of the daily news ProPublica project  But the best of all is David Ferenthal of if he had not won a Pulitzer

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, there would have been riots in newsrooms he wanted for his coverage of  Donald Trump's charitable  donations  New York Times staff, it's I mean maybe I guess some could say oh, it's the usual suspects  you know Peggy Noonan at the journal and but I  Think it's really encouraging when you read this. It's clear a lot of good journalism is being done  And I don't mean left-wing journalism, but I mean just good investigative journalism

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's be honest a lot of it is liberal journalism and I've argued the past on the show that we need more  Conservative journalism we need more journalism from the conservative worldview so that it can gain the trust of  That part of America being clear. There's plenty of other communities that also are underrepresented  african-americans latino-americans  LGBT immigrants women  lots of categories of America are underrepresented and  And thus aren't trusted they don't trust the media, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  um  Google remember Google  Remember Google book search  In fact, I think when we started this show that was kind of a hot topic some years ago actually  The project started I didn't realize this I'm reading Scott Rosenberg's great article on back channel about this  I didn't realize it started 15 years ago. That's amazing. And this was Google saying screw it. We're not gonna worry about copyright  We're not gonna worry about what publishers say we're just gonna stop start scanning  the world's libraries all the books  Because we think that's gonna add real value and then of course  Publishers sued a lot of famous authors said this is horrible  We talked about I know Jeff you were on in on a lot of these conversations about the authors

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He vovodina thin was also on the show talking about it at the time  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Google won its court cases took a long time  You know, they only won a few years ago, but the judge in the in the case ultimately  It was a decade-long legal battle that ended last year  Supreme Court turned down an appeal by the authors guild and the judge  Whose opinion it was not the Supreme Court, but the lower court judges opinion  It was said the public good is served  There's more benefit to society than there's a downside for authors and that's clearly the case  But it seems like maybe this 10-year battle sapped Google of its initiative on this it feels like  Well, here's what here's what Rosenberg writes when I started working this story  I feared at first the books is no longer existed as a discrete part of the Google organization  The Google had actually shut the project  down  When I started asking questions it closed up like a startled turtle  For weeks there didn't seem to be anybody around or available who could or would speak to the current state of the book  S effort and then he's saying he looks at the Google Books history page that trails off in 2007 blog stopped updating in 2012  So he said what's what's going on  There are still apparently some Googlers working on books search. They're still adding new books  Although in a much slower pace, he says than the peak 2010 2011  He interviewed a Google engineer who had worked on books for a decade and now leads the team  Stefan Jascovich we're not focused on shiny features and things that are very visible to users said  Jascovich it's more like behind-the-scenes work and perfecting the technology acquiring content processing it properly  So we can view the entire book online and adjusting the search algorithm  It seems like it's backburnered a little bit which is too bad because I think this is amazing  No, yes, Jessica. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead super powerful source of training type data for  teaching

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Computers how to interpret all kinds of things. I bet you that was one of the goals. That's interesting. I hadn't thought about that  Yeah, it's like just entering the world's knowledge into a computer and hoping it gets smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's how the IBM trained Watson. They send it  Medical specific data or lawyer specific data  So  Imagine literature data and what that what a computer could tell us based on that. It's kind of fun or scary

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know depends on the literature Scott Rosenberg quotes Stefan Jascovich saying the scanning stations continue to involve new  Revision these are the book scanning stations new revisions roll on every six months  LED lighting not available at the project start has helped so as studying more efficient techniques for human operators to flip pages  It's almost like finger picking on a guitar he says so we find people have great ways of turning pages  Where's the thumb and that kind of stuff? What a horrible job?  Feeding the books into the into the machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, originally they cut the spines off and fed them through that way, but Yikes  It'll be where if you're just buying a you know, a perfect bound thing that works  So there was one of the one of the gilbert is 45. I think has all the spine stuck on the wall  Like a fake bookshelf  Funny from when they were doing it that way they were cutting them up  Wow, but it depends on the books  it obviously if it's a an old book from a classic collection you have to turn the pages, but that was a way of  Taking a lot of stuff and feeding it through quickly  But then you know, there are there's two other groups that do this as well  Obviously, there's there's Amazon who have book search and there's the Internet Archive who have been scanning books for a long time  And continue to do it and have improving their search of scan material quite a lot recently as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wonder how much of you know the energy of this which is sapped by the court fight

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I sense that  This was happening in the early days of Google's relationship with journalism to where I think that Larry and Sergey cared and then everybody started  Smashing when they kind of said, okay  Enough we got other work to do Rosenberg right right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You'd think a Supreme Court victory would have meant a renewal of energy for Google Books rev up the scanners full speed ahead  But by all evidence, this is not in the case partly. That's because the database is already so huge  Jascovich says we have a fixed budget that we're spending at the beginning  We were scanning everything on every shelf at some point  We started getting a lot of duplicates today Google gives its partner libraries pick lists and says well, maybe they got everything  But there are plenty of other explanations for the dampening of Google's arder the bad taste left from the lawsuits the rise of shiny  Exciting new ventures with more immediate  I don't know. I always thought this was this was great and it  You know, it was obvious it would not impinge on book sales, but it would make the country help

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it would help you could find them. I've done all the time  I have bought so many books because I found it on search, right? Yeah, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Then you buy it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although I will confess  When I was in maybe high school and so this was like in 1990. Oh, hold on  1995 I remember downloading some book program and getting access to all of these, you know  They were public works. So I think I that's appropriate  Well, yes, but I spent  Hours as a kid basically there's a cheap student reading all of these books on my desktop. That's awesome, right?  That's fantastic. Yeah, but if Google Books had been around I probably would have just gone that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I say it's correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think in the Google Book Search  You can read the entire text of any book. I don't think you could you can read pay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can you can for the pre 922 ones

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think if you search for the for the orphan works or the non copyright works, but no  Copyright but not right nobody nobody claims them and that was the author guilds issue was the orphan works

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is stupid because you know, you want those back in publication, right?  The point is the cost of making digital edition should not be high  Especially if Google's already scanned the damn thing if they're gonna scan OCR it for you  Then then you can make a digital edition from that. Yeah, put it on Amazon long tail. Remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah  It's incremental income  Facebook is facing increased publisher resistance to instant articles. I did not know this Jeff, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now there's been some arder  Is what rubbing off is wearing off? Yeah, New York Times has quit  I think that's a negotiation ploy as much as anything. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How is AMP doing? I mean AMP is the kind of the open version of instant articles, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's it's funny. Each has its adherence  I think the instant articles is trying to increase because because Facebook can control  Monetization there you can sell your the publisher can sell their own ads but Facebook controls the opportunities  So they're adding a lot of ad opportunities. They're trying to pump up the monetization  AMP is a page that's out there the problem with AMP that I still see is the URL  This was and I've been I've been told this is a problem of web standards that to make AMP  Serve as fast as it does. This is part of your problem. They originally it does serve from Google CDN  It's content delivery network, but it serves under a Google URL, right? Because otherwise if it tried to mimic the  Creators URL then security would say oh that looks funny to us  And so there isn't a good way yet to fix that  So so AMP does look like it all comes through Google even though it's still the publishers ads and AMP has nothing around that  They're both a little creaky. I think they're both trying to  They're trying to solve problems that should be solved otherwise  I mean just with better websites. Yeah, we just screwed up the web and then in terms of instant articles  I do like it, but I've said to folks at Facebook over over the last year or so  Don't play to our worst egotistical instincts, which is that everything is an article  Make us force us like like snapchat to rethink the form of news  That's appropriate to the platform  I did see however honor if you saw today that there's a I guess I'll get some of the rundown  There's a new late version of Twitter. I couldn't get it to work based on progressive web apps, which is  AMP plus more functionality, which is really interesting to see that's the first effort. I've really seen her break out of the Google world  That's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The light Twitter is just mobile Twitter optimized a bit it was intended for low bandwidth phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh bandwidth, but it's PWA. It's it's still progressive web apps, which is an add-on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's not AMP yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an add-on damp that's a PWA is an add-on damp PWA

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So  PWA is  Initiative to have web apps that behave like mobile apps and it's led by the the chrome team at Google that they push it very strongly  AMP is a parallel thing there by from Google and they do they do it to operate well because you know that they've done work  But but PWA doesn't it doesn't have anything to do with AMP directly when the Washington Post demonstrated PWA

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was heavily using an app

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, yeah, and they've abandoned that one, which is kind of annoying. It is annoying because it was a great app

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so yeah, I don't know where it goes Leo. I'm not sure I think that I think what's happening with the New York Times leaving  Instant articles is they're trying to negotiate for more revenue  On the pages the thing I've heard from publishers is some publishers say this should equal what the web does my own site does  And other publishers smart publishers say no  It's new traffic and new revenue and it and it beats my programmatic ads and I like that  So it depends on your expectations to a great extent

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean the interesting thing for me has been seeing what ampers done to encourage newspapers to not be bloated in the first place  So they've basically taken  They've built the amp version and then they go wait  Why is our main site so bad compared to this and then they're actually able to get?  Executives to listen to you need to stop injecting you know gigabytes of junk into the pages for advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the other part you have the other problem is trying to get the advertisers to clean up their act  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I was a fascinating topic next clear  We got to move on we got to move on come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fit a minute on Twitter light so Twitter light is interesting so one of the things when I moved here initially I didn't have a  Local sim so I was using the T mobile you know throttle down to 2g bandwidth  thing and  When I was doing that I noticed how much better that that all these progressive web app and amp related things were than  Either local apps or the or the websites they didn't lock the phone up in doing near as much

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So even the local apps were slower than the progressive progressive apps or at labs that load in bit by bit from the net

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, well because you know this was true web apps a lot anyway because the web is designed to load asynchronously  Whereas a lot of mobile apps are effectively a browse that only works on one one domain  But they they don't have the sort of subtle asynchrony that that web apps do so they assume  There's a lot of bandwidth there  And they just sit there and lock up and take a long time to load and it's noticeable if I'm on that  Connection that the mobile Twitter site is way better than the mobile Twitter app  Like you know like significantly faster and more responsive

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For the first time ever an advertisement has intentionally triggered a voice assistant  Intentionally we do it by accident all the time now if you've got a Google Home go ahead Jeff put your Google Home up next  To the speaker  What's funny is this Burger King ad doesn't do what it was trying to do  So maybe they maybe they didn't expect it to work. They just thought it'd be make everybody laugh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're watching a 15 second Burger King ad which is unfortunately not enough time to explain all the fresh ingredients in the Whopper sandwich  But I got an idea  Oh, what is the Whopper Burger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow Wikipedia the Whopper is a hamburger consisting of a flame-grilled quarter pound beef patty sesame seed bun mayonnaise lettuce

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tomato pickles ketchup and sliced onion. Oh it did work. It didn't work

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I thought Google had okay  So here's what I hear this story like evolving and I feel like so played by can like conglomerates here, but they said  Wikipedia was edited to change the top section of it  Oh my god for a while and they were like to Burger King do it. Did someone else do it?  Okay, so was that prankster or Burger King?  The other thing then was that I had seen that Google had stopped that from working but clearly Jeff yours  Just worked. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so it looks like Burger King is behind the Wikipedia edit because  The line was added by somebody with a username fair Machado one two three  Burger King's marketing chief is Fernando Machado and he uses firma chata one two three on Instagram and a very similar name on Twitter  So don't feel like I'm being played you are being played but not by Google by Burger King

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is like okay so this this is why voice authentication needs to come sooner rather than later  And by the way the verge modified the Wikipedia entry and the Google home said the new entry

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, you know if I were Burger King, I'd be very nervous at this point. We should check read the other story

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, read the other story. Oh, yeah, I don't come far worse the one right there on the rundown. Oh, okay  So this is the clippings the whopper is made of toenail clippings. Oh my god  Because the Wikipedia was adapted and and voice comes from Wikipedia now they fixed it and I would guess Wikipedia's locked it down

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although oddly they've locked it with the promotional copy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course they did

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but Wikipedia doesn't take ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's very interesting it's not inaccurate. I mean the whopper and it's not made of nail clippings. That's inaccurate and so I  Yes, like if it said it's a delicious burger with lightly toasted sesame. That's true. It is just mere facts. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but by the way  Burger King got what it really wanted which is all this social media play. Welcome Burger King. Here we are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm better than Chipotle Burger King. You can buy an ad on this very show. We'll play your ass

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We'll eat burr. I'll eat whoppers if you want during the show  But isn't that interesting and I wonder if we'll see more of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That'd be a better commercial Leo. You're on your fast day and we start they start  Carson runs the whopper under your nose to torture you shaking

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Isn't that funny isn't that it it irritates like can

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it feels like yeah, we're gonna be like people were saying apparently  My when I did my little birthday thing they were like, oh you triggered my echo, you know, and I'm like oops  It's a it's a dick move to trigger someone's voice activated speaker intentionally. It is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Intentionally, yes enough to do accidentally. Yes, it goes back to Aaron Paul  Well, there was an Xbox ad where the actor from Breaking Bad  issued  some Xbox commands and quite famously because many people not many but probably many relatively I  Did had their Xbox hooked up to their television set and so  When he issued the command in the Xbox ad it took over the TV  And you no longer were watching the ad that was an unintended consequence  Like ad advertising. I think this is quite clever  I you know, I wonder what Google will do to keep it from happening again  I guess there's nothing they don't do you're right the one solution Stacy is voice authentication training

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or you could do like what didn't we have a whole I feel it in my hallucinating this conversation  But we had a whole thing about frequencies that you could play underneath. Yeah. No, we talked about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I annoyed everybody by playing a 5 kilohertz tone. Oh, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah show and everybody was good. Oh, yeah, you really pissed off everybody below a certain age

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It seems like this my new thing I pissed off everybody last week because I was so clueless about the Pepsi commercial

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey had explained it all to me and I was I was not the best the best user or best person to explain it. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think you did a fine job  And I I kind of stand by my well, no, let's not bring it up again  Leo just loves to shoot himself in the foot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So do you see the the data also right underneath that is the data on the Pepsi ad turns out it was a pretty effective

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, see that's the thing. I mean, there's no such thing as bad publicity. Oh  So where's where's that if you go down to the charts you go to the chart of people kind of like the Pepsi ad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So look at this Hispanic Americans  75% left more favorable than not black Americans 51%  White Americans 41% were more favorable toward Pepsi after watching the video than than before

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So all that it's kind of underscores my point which is all the outrage  That you saw on Twitter wasn't universal outrage. It was just nothing on Twitter is universal. Well, that's my point  Organizations to stop treating it as anything but just this, you know tiny little microcosm  Not so tiny 310 it's pretty big 310 million monthly active users is pretty big

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many people are in the US? Yeah, I know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Know I know. So why did why did they have Williams sell 30% of his stock? I asked you that  It crushed but actually a bigger question is why recently? Yeah last week  Okay, but he says I just wanted to cash out but here's the bigger question  When Adam Bain and Adam messenger left  They left 35 million in  Unexercised options behind

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but they were the options above water

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is this I was questioning the story because I was like were they worth anything or would they just have to wait for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe to be worth something. Yeah, I mean I've got a bunch of exercise options in technology that I've got  I  Know it's still vaguely exists and is still vaguely doing something. I'm not quite sure what  Excellent description  No, I mean, I don't know  I said I think it's basically coasting on the on the Google juice. It got from when it was actually useful  But that's probably a good thing. I mean, I think it's a good thing  I mean, I think it's a good thing. I mean, I think it's a good thing  I mean, I think it's a good thing. I mean, I think it's a good thing  But that's probably a little mean to say but hey, you know, I don't know them anything anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well the stock that they left behind obviously hadn't invested or they would have exercised it before they left  So they would have had to stay there longer to exercise it. I don't know what there's no no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it's vested you've still got to pay to exercise it. So yes  if they had options that the strike price was was  Above the current price then it would cost the money to get the stock  I understand that what 75% of them had not vested. Yes, but the thing is if they if they have vested you still

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Then they're not worth anything. I understand that point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You still got it. You've got to come up with a big chunk of cash, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The exact point you may have a tax hit that wipes out all your gains and ends up costing you money  Yeah, so this is why stock options like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not worth anything until they're actually worth something and then you better cash in as fast as possible and take your yeah  Tax it I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that is the right way to do it  The stupid thing to do is where you excise your stock options on the assumption the stock is still going up and then get the tax  Realize its liability and then sell them and then you're already screwed and that a lot of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  can't you  Won't a brokerage loan you the money to exercise if you sell right away  Yeah, no if you yeah, you don't have to have that cash here, let me write you a check so you can give me a bigger check

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, if you exercise and sell right away  Yes  Then then you could do that in one transaction right and then sell it and you put some aside for the tax and it works

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is a profit as long as you're not underwater  Which is far I mean, I don't know doesn't say what the strike price was on these options  But my sense is it wasn't underwater because they were worth something 35 million to be exact  Just had invested  What I'm invested they don't exist. They don't exist unless they stay there. That's the point by leaving

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's that's looking at a sunk. That's a potential something

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe that made him maybe Adam and Adam kind of had an idea that maybe that stock price wasn't going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could have been could have been the biggest indicator here is they're like, you know what?  We don't believe in this company  So we're leaving and we don't care that we're walking away from right a potential 35 million dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah a possible chunk. Now I should point out they made 14 million dollars between them  So they're not your good news is they can have as many whoppers as they want  US government ceases firing legal spat with Twitter. That was a fun one the  So remember the rogue alt USC is account  This is actually quite funny  it was a  Ret, you know, it was one of the many government alt accounts. It was  us  CIS is the United States citizenship and immigration services and the White House did not like the things they were saying  Now I have to admit  There's things said all the time on Twitter that I don't like but what I don't do is then issue a summons  The US Customs and Border Protection issued a summons and the funniest part is it was such a poorly written summons  First of all, it was backdated a month  It was like had the wrong date on it and said they had to respond within a you know a few days  But it was last month and then they apparently they cited US  Code section 1509  Which gives them the right to issue a subpoena?  To investigate the taxation of imported goods  They don't in fact have subpoena power having to do with Twitter and free speech or anything like that  So so it was a completely bogus summons which Twitter quite rightly not only fought but went to court and sued  countersued  with the help of the ACLU and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what the you know what when I ran local sites, yeah the  Summons as we got more than anything else were from police departments police chiefs  Trying to find out the IP addresses of the cops were complained about them in our forums. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't say that about me. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they with they they were informed  That  Summons probably wasn't such a good summons and they probably didn't have the best, you know optical  You know, it didn't look good for a federal government to try to get somebody for saying bad things about him  So they withdrew and Twitter voluntarily dismissed their suit

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't didn't we have an act on our books the was it treason and sedition act? Yeah, I'm 17 something

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's used often against hackers nowadays  It's still there it's the reason Edward Snowden can't come home. Oh  one of the one of the features of the  Sedition and treason act is that sure it was like you can't testify on your behalf. You can't I can't remember the deal but  We talked to Edward Snowden's lawyer by the way a fine episode of triangulation  Which is nominated for a Webby Award and I sure would appreciate if you voted for it  So watch that episode, but he talks I will now. Yeah  So  Yes, Snowden said I can't come back because I wouldn't get a fair trial and the reason he wouldn't get a fair trial is  Because the rules of this act from the 19th 18th century  Prevent him from mounting of you know a defense  Actually, I saw I'm sorry.

Transcript:  They're moving fast, right GS station is easy because

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They aim the microwave beam very careful

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See this this was my question. I was like, this is awesome  I'm sure it's gonna be gorgeous, but how the heck are they streaming 4k from space? I can't even get 4k

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you have a change of heart during your drag defense  And you actually want to give your seat to the United employee simply put them to sleep  Tuck them in and get off the plane before they wake up

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow  United Airlines drag defense by Brenner and Ryan Gracie if we talk about this this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This goes back I read this I put a link in the show notes  This was a very nice in it'll it'll fit with Leo your hatred of all things Twitter and kind of idea of lazy journalism  But and I did notice this too when I was reading the United coverage  There people couldn't decide if the plane was overbooked or if it was, you know  They wanted the employees to take the ride or what was going on. And so  This person broke it down  Talking to some aviation lawyers about what happened and really kind of excruciated the media for their coverage

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I don't think them. No, I don't it's been hot and cold

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has been really you know, you don't you don't drag people out of a plane like that  Yeah, we're some point there has to be a better way the way we there had to be a better way than doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nobody denies that United had the right to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the point though is if you're a journalist you have to like I totally believe you have to get beyond

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey this terrible thing. Yes. No, I agree. Yes, you're right. And that's that's that's fine for your first take on the PBS NewsHour  They that it was it was a very surface, you know, it was at the headlines  Yeah, and a man was dragged off United Airlines plane even mentioned that it was Republic that it was a United Express plane and  Anyway, it'll be fun to watch the lawsuit  develop

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right there there were issues there there was another plane on the other end that wouldn't have taken off and all those people would  Have been in convenience if that they hadn't got there

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, all of that's true, but there had to be a better way  That was there had to be a better way at some point gonna pay a huge price the very last  Several hundred million dollars in their stock price is not how a company operates  No, we don't treat our people that way the CEO finally after three days he said, you know, I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It took Sean Spicer more times to apologize  So I figure the new standard

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it just coincidence or I think we've reached critical mass of Twitter outrage because we got the Pepsi thing  We got the Sean Spicer thing and we got the United thing  It's this is this those are all happened in a space of a few days  Is this not gonna happen now from now on like every week? There'll be a new outrage

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is I I don't I still like Twitter. I still get a lot of great stuff on it  I'm not going to be switching the mastodon anytime soon because I'm not technically well

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wouldn't switch to mastodon. All right, let's talk about mastodon and Kevin marks it apparently which I didn't realize had introduced mastodon in  October on this show I actually went back and watched the tape  November so this is a  simply a Ruby on rails interface to  Something called Oh status and you probably you all know Oh status because we had an Oh status  Identica  server the twit army in 2008  Which I set up taking great pains with Evan Prodromo the guy who wrote identity  Identica became and correct me when I go wrong on this Kevin because it's your identity became status net

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Evan sold it and then they still own status on that. They just changed the name. Okay, he changed the name  Go ahead carry on so  Um  No, so status on net was was the company was trying to do to commercialize it with he was trying to make another Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He literally was trying to make another Twitter. Well, he made another Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He made you know, he made a thing that worked, but he but he built it on top of open source in the sense, which was  Interesting, you know interesting good work. So so Oh status was his name for the collection of specs that he used in it  Which are atom for the feeds?  Pub sub hubbub, which is now called web sub  And went to can recommendation in W3C this week, which is the way you notify people as soon as you've updated  So that's how you get the real time updates the push technology  Yes, effectively, that's the push technology and then the two other components  Two other components really commands two other components that were incorporated were web finger, which was a  It's a slightly over complicated way of looking up  Username at domain  And there was a protocol that was put together to to let you look up usernames and domains  That involves doing a fetch of doing three or four fetches from the site and doing a bunch of stuff to look it up  And then deciding where the domain is whereas actually just saying domain at username  Works on these instances and just easily but this was a  There's a protocol for doing that and unless you get a bunch of endpoints without fetching the page. So it makes us  It's one of these protocols that we've been doing  It's one of these protocols where we built this complicated thing and then we went that's more complicated  We need to be and it's it's sort of mostly rotted but

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but you never replaced it or did anything else with it you just  You let it lie there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is the thing about standards open source you you make a standard people can still implement it  You create an open source implementation because you're building on that. So so sorry. So status net at owl became  gnu social  which  Has been you know, it's been maintaining people of running instances of that for a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You told us about that maybe a year or two ago. In fact, uh, because of you  I signed up for one of the gnu social instances quitter.no, which looks just like twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is it so gnu social like core gnu social looks more like  A blogging system and the quitter thing quit.sc was the first one. They gave it this this twitter like skin  Um, which was built this was built  Four years ago, maybe and it looks like old twitter doesn't like current twitter  But it looks like twitter looked like yeah, 2010 which a lot of people like  Yeah, no  But also it it means that people who are used to twitter like stacy doesn't want to deal with this stuff can go  Oh, I know how to use this. It looks familiar and it kind of works  And then you go but it doesn't quite work the same as twitter. What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's some other big problem with it. Of course is as you can see i'm following three people four people one of whom is  Kevin marx the other one's cori doctorow. I mean, it's a very  It never really kind. I mean, it's it's very geeky and it was cool though. I like it and i've maintained my account  And then you told us about uh garg ron

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who yes, not his real name by the way, that's his handle. His name is eugene. Yeah, but he's um  So he built he re-imprinted it from scratch in in in a different, you know  He put it the classic ones in php and and runs the lamp stack  He rebuilt it in ruby on rail was using a react front end and his front end looks more like tweet deck  So the mastin front end has this multi-column thing going on  um, so you've got

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, you've got four columns you can see it here  Um, and by the way, it has a limit of 500 characters  So you know I stretch this to show how you can you can make a long post you can also put in images  It has some nice features. Uh  You can choose per post privacy kind of like facebook unlike twitter direct private to followers only  Unlisted does not show public timelines. You can also put in uh, you can also put in this a content warning  so, uh  Don't look at this  And then put something in there and then so this is really handy  in fact people have used it interestingly for political posts like you type  Politics and then say something political and people who didn't want to see it  Wouldn't have to see it. Yeah, so i'll toot that that's called a toot not a tweet and you see that the the tweet the toot  Here says politics and then show as a show more button. I like that the columns are home  This is this is the people I follow. This is like the twitter home column  Notifications also very much like twitter with some of the same kind of controls. You can choose what you see in the  Notifications column it's where you get interesting is in this third column kevin. It's the  The it could either be the local timeline or the federated timeline. Tell us about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. So so the way this works is um  So the first column is the people you've chosen to follow  The local timeline is everyone who's on the same instance as you are

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So well, we better explain federation and instances then yes, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um in a way it's like an old group blog from  2002 or so where we would all sign into the same blog and have a conversation on that blog because communication between blog was awkward  So you can you when you sign into a mastodon instance?  um you anyone you refer to with an app will be on the same instance as you and you can have conversations between them and it  feels like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Um, it's it's twitter if there was only one there's only one twitter. That's it. You're in that silo, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's also you're like, you know a lot of known runs this way as well. So  One of the things that known is built with with you with with with known is is doing this kind of site for education  Where you will set up a site for your whole class and they'll have a conversation  Within the site even though they connect outside the site as well  So it's a similar idea of giving you a sort of peer group to connect to  So the local the local timeline is the set of people who are on the same server as you  We've signed up for the same one so that the mastodon social was the was the initial one  That um, ujn set up but there's a bunch of other ones that we set up over the last  A couple of weeks that have different themes and different people think of it like email

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you could be on yahoo mail and you'd i'd be leo at yahoo mail. I could also have leo at gmail  Um, and and and they're federated so I can send a message from gmail to yahoo mail  So it's kind of like that, right?  So I so if I were just this is like local timelines just people on yahoo mail and the federated timeline  Is other mastodon instances how many they're thousand now a couple of thousand now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, i'm not sure exactly how many though. It's growing like topsy it became very  Populous a few hundred mastodons. There's a few hundred new social ones and they they interoperate as well  They federate between them not thousands. So the local timeline is everyone who's on who's on the same server as you and  What they're saying and then the federated timeline is  Everyone who's on the same server as you plus all the people they follow from other servers

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's not the total universe, but just people follow by people on your server

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, so it's like one degree of a friend of a friend, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's no way to follow the total timeline

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, okay. Well not without running a crawler. Okay. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could you get the fire hose? Could you get the whole fire hose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um, you have to  Theoretically, you'd have to subscribe to every user in every instance. Some instances are trying to do this. They're creating follow bots

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh, which go out and try to follow it's almost like crawling mastodon  They try to follow everything they can find and then that way you would your federated timeline if you're on that particular instance would would be  approximation of the total  uh, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know you could rather you know  I built the technology thing that did this for blogs  You can write a crawler that that crawls everything and tries to collect it all but  You're going to be investing a lot of my own servers to do that. Yeah, um, but the point of this is you can  So the way to think about this is you don't nobody can read the whole of twitter either  That that's an impossibility now in in 2007 you could  2007 twitter had a public timeline that was everything that everyone posted ever and it just it was one of the one of the choices  On the front page and they turned that off after a while because it would go past so fast. You couldn't read it  And it became unusable. And so what what the goal of the local timer is to give you  a subset of that and then the and also it's relatively cheap to produce because they're all on the same machine and then the  And the federated timeline here or the whole known network as they call it in in new social is one step beyond that  Step further, but if you go to a different instance, you will see a different, you know  Federated timeline because it depends on whose people on that instance are followed as well  So, you know you're you're on two instances so you can you can switch between it and see different things on those two

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why has I mean I guess there were a number of articles in the last couple of weeks  Lance ulanoff wrote one saying forget it. This thing's going to die  In fact, that's the obvious thing to say is oh we've seen this all before  Which we have  Of course we have I mean, so  So what and then and then another kind of straw man raised is well, it's not going to replace twitter  But I don't think that's the intent in fact  One of the reasons I use it does it has kind of replaced twitter for me  Because the conversations are very nice and pleasant and geeky and I have a great time talking to people  Um, you're talking to what five six people? Oh, no, it's more than that. But it's you know, it's it's not  Well, it's not you jeff and it's not stacey kevin's there  Yeah, there are I think a hundred a hundred some thousand people. So here's the thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I saw I saw dave weiner at the conference. I was out last week and I said dave what happened to blogging?  At the early early days of blogging. It really was wonderful  I met all these people who thought differently from me and from around the world  We all saw our differences and we all got along and yeah, we disagreed but it was basically civil  And dave said everything's nice when it starts right? That's why I like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fresh shiny new  Now there is it does have some features that might help with abuse for one thing  It's not it's not some faceless person at twitter that's deciding what's abuse right? It's the person who runs the instance  Yes, that's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can say you've got some separate control so you can set up a cuny instance and and make it about what what you're talking about  What your conversation is and you can decide who you federate with and who you show on the public timeline who you block completely

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So apparently there are some nass Nazi  Mastodon, you know white white supremacist nats a master instances, but nobody federates with them  So in effect, they have a nice local thing and you don't see it and they plot revolution on their own, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is this is what happened with quitter in the first place. If you remember quitter.se  Got a huge influx of users  For one twitter  Furore whatever at some point twitter banned somebody and the the sort of alt-right types said we need something better than this  They turned up a credit.se and the swedish guy who run it was like  No, um, actually i'm a communist and he put the  communist manifesto on the front page said if you want to set up your own alt-right instance  I'll show you how to do that, but you really shouldn't be on this one because you won't fit in  um and  There was a there was you know  Insta-pundit went there for a bit and there was a there was a sort of little rebellion thing going on there and then  Then they set up. Um, what's that thing called? There's some annoying like  frog themed  Twitterer like thing that isn't doesn't federate properly and is trying to be his own thing so that they ended up there instead  And you know, there are there are other  Social instances that have  Like a strong what they call their point of view is we are strongly free speech  and that they don't take into account that  Speech can hurt people and so that they  They're sort of anti-censorship in that sense so that they're they're in the sort of aclu at skokie  School of free speech as opposed to the that actually suppresses certain kinds of speech things  So there are instances that have different moderation policies  And then there are rules about who federates with whom and debate with who and what they're doing  There are rules about who federates with whom and debates about what's going on there  So there's there is a lot of that kind of who federates with whom drama going on as well  um the the the interesting thing that um  sadly muscle and social is that  Um, the people who turned up there and there's been influx of different group different groups of people  Um have spent a bunch of time saying well, what would it be like, you know?  the reason it's got these kinds of features of being able to put content one and things like that was that  um, you generally listen to the people who were who turned up and said  Wouldn't it be nice if we had this and he said well we could do that  Let me try that just see if that works and he spent a lot of time doing that kind of community management stuff  And listening to what people have built. I I think I linked an article  about this that was  What if I put this somewhere in the it's in the mass so we were thinking of doing for instance

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No agenda's already done one. Uh, adam curry and john de vorac's show. We were thinking of doing a twit instance  So the local twit instance would be people like you see in the chat room  Our hosts and so forth communicating and if you didn't want to see anything but that you would never look at the federated timeline  You would never follow anybody outside the timeline and you would just be in that little tight little community  You could peek out if you want and so it's kind of a nice mixture of private and public  um, I I i've i'm fascinated by it mostly because it's not siloed there's lots of other issues for instance  You don't own your name  In any respect which has actually been a good thing it's kept most of the brands out, you know  So the verge can register as they have an account on one instance  But there could be a verge on every single instance because because the namespace is the instance name  So i'm i'm at leo at mastodon.network, but i'm also at leo at mastodon.social and i'm also at leo  Actually leo laporte at twitter.no. I only use one of those but if I start a twit instance, I could also be at leo at  twit.tv  No, you post the one and you say on all the other ones you say follow me. Um, this is my canonical one  Wait a minute, you have multiple email addresses, right and you tell people which email address works

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there's imposters, but I don't yes, there could be imposters. There's no verification system. Yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the point is there is yeah there is you could verify this stuff i've built this you can do distributed verification  Um, you linked it between them with relmes and you can see which one is connected to the other ones and that's actually better than  A verification that depends on the site owner decide you could verify yourself

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's also an ad hoc verification system a number of us on keybase have used  keybase, uh  Things to ad hoc verifiers  selves  So you can verify that's leo because it's on his keybase page

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but this is the point. The point is that you have a username at a domain  Which is like having a blog at a domain or have you know, like having a tumblr thing with a username or it's like having email address  Um, what you don't have is a global namespace because the global namespace would imply there's only one instance  And so so which I like  This is this is what was annoying me about last year. No, since like you can't have a global namespace. This will die. It's like no  Actually, the things that don't have global namespace and things that don't die the ones that have a single namespace  Other ones that die and if you don't believe me i've got a i've got a page full of them at indyweb.org slash site dance  You know the the the the there's  So, you know the idea of anti-fragility  um  Anti-fragility says if you build something that can cope with bad things happening to it  It gets stronger over time and it becomes anti-fragile and the web is something that is anti-fragile. The linking is this anti-fragile thing  Yes, a lot of links break but overall the web retains itself people who have workarounds into it  um, if you build something that tries to protect you from that that fragility of the web of links  Um, and everything is only on one instance  And then what happens one day when that site goes down you lose a huge chunk of the web in one go  And we've seen that happen over and over again. We've had  Sites that that people build their lives on they get bought by a big company and then they get ignored and they die  You know if you want a nice example of that upcoming upcoming  Was this site where you posted events that were happening?  It was a community site. It got bought by yahoo. They ran it for a while  They got fed up and bored and it died and and then scott bio scott bio

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Andy bio scott bio is another guy and he bought it back  And brought it back

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he's relaunched it's actually up and running now. What's beautiful is apparently he had the old databases

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So he's imported all the old databases so you can go back and in time and look at events in the past

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that was kind of weird because  Because I made an event on upcoming for like when back to the future happened and now it's in the past which is like  That's kind of freaky  No, so so the point is that?  Actually what happens when you say okay? I'm going to build a site that does everything  you're creating fragility debt because it's it's only one site and it  Is it lasts only as long as you have funding you have interest and you don't get bought by somebody who then shuts it down  Whereas if you build something out of protocols the protocols can last longer than the thing itself and  mastodon is a good example of that in that  Ev evan built  What you know identical status net and put the protocol suite  And then decide he was going to do something else and he's built pump.io which is a new protocol and is a pretty better design protocol  There's a bunch of standardization work. He's been working on for updating this stuff  But the sort of protocols week and the code suite that he had  Has been sitting out there and has implementations running and has just got picked up by somebody else  So we have this thing that is  These these systems have been running for a while and suddenly it got popular in the last two weeks

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's kind of fun to have a community. I mean you wander into a community  It's like a party and so I think the concern about is this going to last or not last  Is really misguided if it's fun now do it  I've spent a lot of been spending a lot of time over the last week in it because it's fun. It's great  It's a nice nice group of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you know, there are people who still use nntp, you know, these protocols don't actually die

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How about mantan reese and uh micro dot blog?  Where's this because I paid I paid into that and I guess we're waiting for our invites to that  Um, that's kind of similar idea, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, well that's well that's that's built on the more of the indie web protocols as well  So that's built on micro powerband and web mention  Whereas which is the sort of the newer generation of these protocols and it's also built on  Websub as well to give you the real-time part  So there's some overlap between them and part of what we're trying to do what i've been trying that would be almost like having

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  your own  Blog be your mastodon site you you micro blog there it goes to your blog can be federated others can see it  So it's a little more personal. I mean almost like running your own personal instance that you're the only member of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and that's the interesting thing here is is this thing of running an instance for a set of other people  And giving them a place to to converse like twitter. Yeah  Yeah, but you can do you can do that. You can do that with blogs too. This was a thing that you did with blogs  Um, you know, we there was if you remember, um, those didn't scale well though

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because you can't have a thousand people in a group blog

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but these don't scale well, you know these things fall over at a few thousand too  You know  One of the reasons people set up new instances is because they've hit that well  part of this and I linked an article by um lexi that describes some of these problems, but there's a problem is that  um data mysql databases aren't designed to deal with networks and so  You get this sort of order n square thing that happens as you try and scale them up  That makes it quite hard to do and you know, you know twitter started the same way twitter started out with a rails app  That was using a mysql database and it worked for a while and then we all remember the fail whale by the way mastodon has its own

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fail mastodon, I believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it's apparently the fail. It's the mastodon being picked up by birds of course  um, but it's  but you know  Eventually you have to restructure things and build it differently when you're trying to scale to millions of users rather than thousands of users  um, and so  If you if you want them all to be in one in one site and want to be fast  You have to do a bunch of massive retooling and that's that's quite hard to do  um, whereas what what this this says is we'll build out so it works for a few you know, a few hundred a few thousand users  And then we'll federate between them and we've got some protocols that make that work. Is federation pretty efficient

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean it can handle a lot more traffic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um  There's you know, there's there's ways to optimize all of it. But the the point of the reason websub was invented was to  Sort of the classic blogging thing was I published my blog  There's a feed there and you check my feed every hour and see if I've posted something new  And that works if there's like a few of you doing that  But if i've got a thousand people who would check me once an hour then my site's going to be in pain from that  And so what websub does is reverse that and say  Okay, you register with the websub server when I post something I tell the websub server  And then it calls all the people who've subscribed to me and says hey kevin's written something new you you take that now  And so rather than you all going to my site saying you've done anything yet done anything yet done anything yet  Um at the point when I post it then calls you and says kevin's posted something and then you can update your thing quickly  So that's how you get a response to feedback loop

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you said this was  A version of uh, oh I screwed this up pub pub hub sub hub. I love it's my favorite name

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's called websub now unfortunately it is okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pub sub hubbub was much better. Okay. I was like this sounds like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That I can never remember the right order it uses pub sub hubbub, but it uses some other stuff, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so first of all, we designed to solve that problem it was written by  um brett and brad, um  Probably 10 years ago now, um, which was  The problem was as your blog gets popular  You it's hard to keep it up because everyone's polling you all the time to get your feed  And so they said well, let's reverse this  You don't post that often when you do post we'll we'll have a server and it calls the people to do that and they have to  Re-register with the server every day to make sure they're still interested  And so there's a there's a protocol for doing that that means you can actually distribute a you can get updates in almost real time  um and and  B you can cope with a lot of people relatively easily compared to them all trying to poll your original block  So that was the the pub sub hubbub model  um  And so that that's that's now called websub. Um, we've been taking through w3c. It's now a kind of recommendation, which is  the last thing before  Um becoming an actual official w3c standard  So if you're interested in this stuff go and look up that and and test against it with there's a site called  websub.rocks which lets you test your stuff against it  um  And mastodon passes most of the tests which is which is which is a fun part about this  Um, so so there's there's that protocol that's there the other two protocols that mastodon uses  Um, I mentioned webfinger which is a way of looking at addresses which is you know, it works  It's a bit too complicated and at one point the big sites implemented it and they're backed away from implementing it now  So we have to do something else. The other one it uses a thing called salmon  Which is a protocol for sending comments upstream  so that when um  I comment on something you you find out about it. Now. This is a protocol that is ridiculously over engineered  Because it was designed for you to be able to post comments without actually posting on your own site  So they had to only exist on the web which there's this whole  Back and forth about signing it and basically forming it and wrapping in xml. There's so basically the process is very complicated  um  We have web mention now, which does the same thing in a much simpler way, but  mastodon and canoe social built on this this older protocol called salmon  um, and  At some point we make we may help them, you know transition to something that's smoother, but that's that's that's what works  It does work  But it was it was always quite hard to implement and if you actually sort of walk through it  It's like that's way more complicated than it needs to be but you can make it work  Which means that's how you get to send the replies back more quickly  Because you're notifying people that the replies are happening. It kind of makes sense that you would have a global thing like twitter that everybody can

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go to it's like a news feed  And but but he also wants I think it's nice to have a local a local a pub you can go to where you hang out with  People and you meet new people and you talk and you have a little bit more elaborate conversations  So I don't think it's to replace twitter, but it's kind of cool  And garncron is actually using patreon to raise funds for it  And he's actually i'm happy to say he's got up to like three thousand dollars a month now on patreon  So he's he's able to make a living doing this which is nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, he's done  He's done a really good job of running an open source project and listening to people and implementing them the things that they say

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's been going on for a long time. I didn't realize you know  That's surprised me when you said on mastodon. Oh, yeah, I showed you this in november  I went oh I must have signed up for an account and sure enough I had and then never used it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure, but he'd been building it for a while before that. Yeah, but the but this yeah, you could see this is clearly a fairly mature

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Project you can install it via docker. The hard thing for the end user is  Under kind of you know understanding federation and the first thing you have to do is figure out which instance you're going to join  And there are all kinds of instances. There are lists of instances. Uh, so you can kind of some of them have a description

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was looking at those and I was like blah. I think you should join the witches instance

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which is sound we have to say leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Certain times of night. They're only open. They're only open at 8 pm. Uh, stay british time. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh excellent for half an hour. So you have to really jump right in a lot of closed ones  Yeah, a lot of a lot of closed ones because they're so busy

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they there are instances with unique designs unique flavors. I haven't you know, I joined a very  neutral one  By accident because I didn't know what to join  Well, you know, it's I wasn't immediately obvious. I just don't join when I can get you know how I joined it  I looked at what is he had two likes he had two xeon servers and he looked like he had enough horsepower  Not to go down every five seconds. That's there you go. That was it  I mean  It's kind of fun, I mean, um  I don't know how important it is, but it's kind of fun. I'm really looking forward to mantan's  Microblog I want to use that because now I have a wordpress blog and I will interact it'll work with my wordpress blog  So I want to I kind of want to use that i'm interested in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so  So the way to think about this and I you know  I've given you the sort of the big public sand wave thing before but the way about this is thinking about what public actually means  and  In the literary theory world they talk about every piece every work that's published has a public which the people who read that work  um, and that's a better way of thinking about than saying things are either public or private and the  You know, there is a public sphere which just meant there's a very small subset of people who read the newspapers and they're the public sphere  And everyone else doesn't count and what we have now is lots of publics that overlap to different degrees  so  We have the public of people who watch watch twig  and then  We have the public of people who read jeff's blog and they intersect to a certain extent  But they're different publics and the interesting thing about this model is that you're actually constructing  Layered public so you're building a public which is all the people in one instance and then you're building a slightly bigger public  Which is the people?  Who the people in that instance follows?  So it's made manifest this kind of sort of soft overlapping publics  Which is what we actually actually the way we use twitter with twitter. We all choose to follow a set of people  And then we also get a feed of the things that they retweet which is like the which is like the the next degree out from that  But it's it's not it doesn't have as hard an edge as this because it's not chosen by instance  It's just it has a softer boundary. So part of what this is doing is making manifest  The way that we use the web anyway, so I think that's a very interesting way to think about this. So  Um, you know  Obviously we want to be able to be able to move between instances and this delegate stuff in more than one place  But part of the interesting part that i've i've got back from people has been no, I don't want to connect this to twitter  I like this being a separate thing  I like it's being different public and because twitter is now so searchable  That means that people can come and invade your privacy directly by searching for things you're talking about and budding into you  Because twitter made the replies into this sort of sticky thing that you can't get rid of because every time you reply  Everyone you've ever talked to is included in reply  That that is one of the reasons this has taken off in the last couple of weeks has been  Reaction to that that sort of replyable feature of twitter  So a big catalyst for this was sarah young  Writing about this and saying i'm taking a week off twitter  I'm going to try something else instead and going to this and then running a very good article  About the it's that explained a lot of this and brought a lot of people in

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I i'm having fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm having fun. I mean it strikes me that there's there's if you look at twitter as broken  There's two ways to fix it. One way is  To go more open which this did which but but give you more control  Uh, but yet in the totality of it less control  The other way is to come up with a controlled twitter, which I kind of dread but kind of want at the same time  And I don't know which way to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you can have both  That's one that's kind of the point it's not mutually exclusive or many  Any accounts which well you wouldn't want to you probably wouldn't want to well you might okay  You might want to like for instance  I probably would keep an account on a twit instance and then maybe a more public account, but that's the point  It's flexible. You could do  You could do both  I don't know. It's fun. You should try it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, jeff and and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you stacy carol, no, I was just I was saying jeff we should do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's funny is there's a lot of people with old habits like people say like scobel says well  I got on and reserve my name like you could reserve your name. You can't  That's so scobel. Uh, so scobel. He says i'll see you in a year if it's still around  So there's there's a kind of a deep misunderstanding of what this is. It's not um, it's not twitter  It really isn't and it's not a twitter killer. That's nobody's proposing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except for those dumb journalists, okay. Wait, you guys have 12 minutes before i'm gonna leave and I have not heard you sing  Happy birthday to me yet

I knew that I knew kevin would be able to do a good job of that  I appreciate that. I keep trying  Well, I get it now I get it now and I like it I like it well enough  Uh stacey, you gotta you got a good pick for this is by the way episode 400  So happy birthday to twig to 400 episodes. Wow. I'm feeling very old

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't you close the audience? How many hours have you wasted with us audience? How many don't get i'm thinking about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not wasted  With friends if this were a full-time job and you're getting paid ten dollars an hour  You'd have eight thousand dollars now  Hmm, how about that?  That's pretty good. I owe you some money. I think stacey  Your pick of the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, send me an invoice. So my pick of the week is to address everybody out there who's asking me about light switches  that are wi-fi  and  Dimmable, so this is hard there. There used to be a lutron one or the whatever that you told me to get  Lutron is not wi-fi. You have to buy the hub to get it on your wi-fi. So this is a standalone for 50

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Dollars. Let me put it the right way

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the leviton de cora 5 wi-fi switch. There it is. It's 50 on amazon  And it again, it's a switch you have to install it  You do have to install the leviton app on your phone, but from there you can link it to your  Sorry your echo account and then you can use voice to turn this on or off. Wow  So that including amazon echo  Yeah, yeah nice. It doesn't come with an amazon echo. No echo sold separately  And it also has I should say a double faceplate. So it's white or almond comes in the box if you have a preference  um, it's it sets back to a neutral which is good because if you are  It won't if you have like connected bulbs, it's not going to break your  Bulbs when you turn it on and off, so that's good. The dimmer function doesn't go all the way down to dim  It doesn't go. Sorry. It doesn't go to off. So you have to hit the button  but that's  So that's kind of a downside and it also has these words on it, which i'm kind of like  Guys, we don't have to brand everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh man, that's on the faceplate the visible face. Yeah. Oh, that's a bummer

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That it is a bummer. So  That is my pick for y'all

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
