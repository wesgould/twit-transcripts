Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just hang out. I'm one question real quick. Yes. We jump in. Yes  What what is the Genesis behind singing Craig Newmark?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff do you want to explain that I'm not I'm not even sure I remember I think it was just that was the important part  Yeah, you told the joke of those you told us long great great new mark the the founder of Craigslist and still owner

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, there's only about eight people work there and amazing philanthropists. He's done on very well  So he's got lots of money to give away  endowed  The Graduate School of Journalism  So it's now called the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism and I think that's a CUNY and I think the joke was  That he really liked it to us to emphasize  Craig Newmark and so it started Craig Newmark and it got more and more eventually we started saying it  That's the origin of it. I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We need to rehearse three-part harmony. We have what you can't do it very well in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Zoom with latency. So what I've done is I've paused and I wait till they start singing and then I sing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the way we could do Craig Craig Craig Newmark

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But then we would sound like the three stooges

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, well it's fitting we kind of are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see the I just love this New York Times article I've talked about it a couple of times  I apologize if you watch all of our shows Google's plan for the future of work  This is as people come back to the Googleplex where or Google campuses all over the world  it was in the New York Times, but the best way to read it is on on the website online because they've  Created a bunch of animated GIFs to demonstrate. So this is the pod  That they're creating see there's the fun, you know, somebody finally bought this Google big screen remember this they promoted this  We have one. It's free. You have one. Oh, yeah  And then they're doing avatars kind of like we do avatars in their meetings and stuff. So the idea is  Board it was a jam jam board. That's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is just a regular worth billions and you sit on uncomfortable plywood plywood

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, maybe these are maybe way though these might be prototypes, I don't know so does that camera in the middle swing around oh  That's a good question. Or is it a 360 maybe?  That's the Google magic and I love how they made the the tube that hides the wires clear so it doesn't hide the wires

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It reminds me of something I  Yeah, I've just spent the last three hours watching oh shut up Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe you prefer this this is their camp sites on the Mountain View campus because this is northern California

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whether it's exactly Jason. This is just exactly like out of IO, isn't it? They just read purpose. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it really is very reminiscent. Actually, you're right. That's good stuff though the press area especially

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Adirondack chairs also, you know, you could make them you could paint them but no it's Google  So we're just gonna leave them raw wood the way it is  These are they took over some of the parking lots and turned them into little this is a Camp Charleston  They're gonna do this in London Los Angeles, Munich, New York and Sydney as well each camp theme name each each

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Meeting room has a camp themed name like so I'm thinking is there is there a person whose job it is to name things there?  I'm the master neighbor. I am the Adam of Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have met they have some very good facilities people and there are people there who are designers basically and that's the whole  That's that's clearly who did this is designers kindling is one of them s'mores is another  Canoe is another look. Here's somebody waiting to do something in canoe  It looks kind of lonely

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're close to my favorite part though if you scroll down a couple more pictures  I know I would save it the best for last

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the woman who does this by the way Michelle go on. Oh, here's the prize as you oh, this is good  You want this is here. This is the chair right into the tube that blows cold air, but you can control it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's to keep you safe. Yes, but what if you're follicly challenged?  Well, I don't I don't you can control it, you know, it may turn it down. It's possible sucks not blows

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. We're just assuming Mike it could be zips into the lines, which is fascinating, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you go to your car at the end. It's it zips in so you can move around. There's little zippers. Exactly Wow  Wow, very flexible and then this is the one you were talking about Jason now actually we should start at the beginning

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know how you triggered from the beginning because it's very

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anti-climactic when it first yeah, so close your eyes folks. So here's the deal. You're in your office and you want privacy  So you I don't know the button or what you send an email and a pro privacy robot comes the robot  In fact at the beginning of this video, which is coming up here. You'll see it and then it expands  It looks like it's got sticky jelly  It really looks like alien. It looks like the  Potty's body snatchers is what it looks like. It's a rainbow II cellophane now, maybe by the way  I should point out these people are moving faster than real time. So this thing is  Setting up a nixie clock. It's infinitely  slow  But does it's all the time and then it inflates and you're gonna have privacy. I think actually they call it the nookie wall

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know why I could have gone and grabbed a C-stand and a backdrop. I know this is so or just hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about I got this I got an idea. How about pulling a curtain across like in the hospital?  That's yeah, this would make but that wouldn't be googly enough door

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those options require a person to do the work and this is meant to eliminate that person as you know  All jobs are going away. I love the new

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I'm sitting there next to Jason and then Jason suddenly just decides Jarvis can't hear this  I'm calling the wall robot. This is that a get smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lower the privacy dome  wall balloon  Wall balloon come  Anyway, Google is getting ready for the future  Oh, this is a good one you go in and you swipe your your key card on here. See on the left  There's a little pad she swipes it and and and the everything adjusts to her. So the tables rising  Oh, yeah. Yeah, it knows her settings kind of like your car might if I was gonna say cars do that now, right? Yeah  Yeah, again, Google's really got to work on their cable food though. This is just not acceptable. What is that going on there?  Rerater would really mark them here. Look look at some of the stuff I've seen with with like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alex Lindsay's crew and office hours. That's that's amazing cable management

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm gonna be on office hours tomorrow, by the way, I know I was told agenda  I was told that the mic call is 640 a.m. My time. Yes, sir

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm, they're actually on they're actually online before that. Usually they're on there about about six  She's doing your PJs Leo. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Notice by the way that the the Google max hub  Changes to have hers content and her pictures watch turn to her dog, which is really kind of neat  Yeah, and when she goes away it changes back again, so, you know, I wouldn't mind that so soon forgotten. Yeah  Yeah, this is the new campus. They're building in Mountain View. It's that's the garden. We've talked about this years ago  That's what it looks like. Yeah, I remember seeing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Still under construction still yeah, I feel like every year we go to Google I O  We see like the next phase of this and it just kind of looks the same  It's like a couple of more bubbles hanging up in the sky, but that's about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of these days here's a team. It'll still be under construction. Everything in the team pod is on casters. So it's completely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Moveable they do you know this must be Silicon Valley sheiks all these open wires and and stuff because remember in the Facebook headquarters  Mark said don't finish anything just you know, like paint dribbling down the wall. Don't finish it all I just just that's the stick  That's the stick. Yeah makes it. It's you know what they they have to do. Let's make it feel messy though  Yeah, but this is young people. How much that matters for young people. They want you to feel like you're in a dorm room and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy, I'm sure it looks like what you're in. That's a good perspective. I never thought about it that way  younger people because they only people  35 and up are  Signing up to work at Google these days. They always said

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At Microsoft back in the day that they they call it a campus and they give it a campus like environment  Google always has with food your cleaning is done  Because you're dry cleaning like you can drop off your dry cleaning as you write  Because they want to attract kids out of school and they want them to feel at home because yeah  Obviously they're young people now everything you just saw is somebody a scooter X is pointed out  But I have a feeling the demo is gonna the final product's not gonna be any more  Nice effect. I would wire the demo better than the final product probably but you're not gonna get any of that stuff at base camp  No more  Hey, what happened at base camp 20 people left?  We talked about this last week. I thought it was a little gossipy to be honest Casey Newton blew the lid off of  Base camp just to recap if you didn't hear last week's show  It started because they found out that somebody had been keeping a list of quote funny customer names  Since the beginning of 2037 signals  Apparently nobody wants to say what the names were because they were so racist and insulting  That prompted kind of a call to Jesus. They there was a lot of discussion on the company's base camp is you know a  Coworking pit of software so you have chats in there and stuff and that got very heated  Apparently the guy in charge of product had been with base camp since almost the beginning since when it was 37 signals  Was conservative and would put links from Breitbart in there and stuff and I think that that actually is what happened  That might have been a trigger  Because yeah, if you read Casey's latest  he  Was saying things like there's no white supremacy in the United States and then a black team member who nobody  Everybody's declined to name said well, that's not true obviously and they got in a bit of a fight and  Anyway, they had an all-hands meeting last Friday. This is after we were talking about it last week  in which it just got completely out of hand and  Jason Fried the CEO said look if you guys want buyouts will buy out and 20 people took it including that designer far  It's so far out  Wow  That's still pretty gossipy  but I think it's not  It's it's is relevant to kind of  you know  Work workplace mores versus  Public mores and this actually relates to the Google thing because young people I think expect  Just because they this is how it was in the dorms and in college  To that these discussions should be held in that in the open and if they're acrimonious or acrimonious and us old types  Think oh that shouldn't happen at work  and I think there's a little bit of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Collision there. That's my that's the funny thing about this because this is you know, these are the young farts  Who are in charge who decreed this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jason Fried and David Hennemeier Hansen are no longer young farts. Well, but they're younger than I am and you are well  everybody is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You had a third of the company signing up to work 47. So depending on your depending on which end of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Telescope you're looking at that's either young or old depending on which end of the  Oddish so the all-hands meeting led to a third of the company quitting. It's not that big a company  So you think it's the youngs that are doing this I think Jason is considered by the staff  Older as is this boss is the boss

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you have that that denial stage in this stuff. No, no, no, no, we're okay. I'm not like that  Let me tell you how I'm okay. Oh, it's a problem. Okay, I'll fix it  You know, that's why I've been I lived that most of my life there, right?  I've you know, you learn these things. Yeah, and so the idea that a company could be not political  It's like saying technology is neutral  It's political  Yeah, this is political

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But at the same time you don't want these kind of bitter fights to go go on in a company chat where productivity is supposed to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Be happening. Well, we agree with that last week, right?  Yeah, you want to have a but you but you don't want to just tamp it down and say don't have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't exist that ain't gonna help. Well, I think that's what they were trying to do. That's what they did initially  Yeah, they were gonna bring in a facilitator. They said  I think that's what they said  But it just went all it went all to hell yeah  Singer who  Was the guy who said let me give you his exact quote. I strongly disagree  We live in a white supremacist culture. I don't believe in a lot of framing around implicit bias  I think a lot of that is actually racist  And this and so he said and you know  I've heard this this is very much like the James Daymore  Memo that circulated at Google and got Daymore fired at Google very often if you express a dissenting view you get called a Nazi  I have not felt this is open territory for discussion if we were to try to get into it as a group discussion  It would be very painful and divisive  And then  Jason free the CEO responded to that message with thank you Ryan  which  Got some people upset  One employee the black employee that shall remain nameless said the fact that you can be a white male  And come to this meeting a call people racist and say white supremacy doesn't exist when it's blatant at this company is white privilege  The fact he wasn't corrected and was in fact thanked  It makes me sick  This is a this is a culture this is a company culture that is that is rapidly dissolving this is not good and but the thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this the company that says we we can we can we can tell all companies how to work

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so there's some schadenfreude here, and I think that's one of the big story as people going see  They're not as easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I wonder how much of this actually did exist but was very unspoken prior to all of this right like it really seems like the  It's hitting the fan at this point around this particular  This particular situation  But I'm but I would have a hard time believing that there weren't at least some sort of indicators  Prior to this that the people that are leaving weren't unsatisfied in some way  Related to this in different ways that weren't quite as public and this was just like the tipping point to be like yeah  All right, they know the ethics here or the the ethical boundaries have been crossed. I no longer identify with this work environment

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm out of here. I can understand that you know I have to say they've been a full disclosure  They've been a sponsor. I've interviewed both David and Jason  The founders and I think I used to think a lot of 37 signals. I think base camp is great software  But clearly it's running a company in these days is just as hard as any other kind of  Social environment that we live in it's it's become so polarized and so angry that it's difficult  So I think that's what you say right what else can you say by the way Google?  Says it's saving a billion dollars a year  By not making people come back to the office  Yeah  They travel yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Travel budget with people going from the Midwest or Texas or whatever over here to the Pacific Coast that adds up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's all around the world and I didn't notice this in their annual report. We talked about their quarterly results last week, but then their annual report  They said advertising and promotional expenses dropped by 1.4 billion dollars in 2020  hmm  Now here's the thing. I'm glad Jason's here because this is gonna be very interesting  Sunar Pichai in the quarterly analyst call  Said we're ready this to kick back into gear right Jason

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, he amounts he announced some sort of significant  I don't know if it's product announcements or whatever, but he used the term significant announcements for Google I O and  Yeah, we were talking about this on all about Android last night just trying to figure out  Okay, does that mean the usual like oh, yeah Android 12 is pretty significant  You know just as one example or does that mean this is one of those IOs where they actually have  Some hardware that they consider to be a big deal or maybe it's a deeper integration of assistant with smart home  Like what exactly does signic significant mean in light of what we've come to expect from my own the last couple of years  So I'm pretty curious

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Normally saw it as market and speak because he he could have said pretty much the same thing about project trouble and everything else right back

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Totally so yeah, it could be light. It could not be you know  To him everything significant that Google does but I feel like when you come out in an earnings call and you say that specifically  Hopefully you're backing it up so that you don't get on the other side of this and it's like  significant, but you know they change the colors on Android and that's about all I saw you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or it could be IO where where it's stuff that they promise but two years later because I remember that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some people took it to mean well first of all I took it to be an admission that Google had slept through 2020  Understandably, but they really did they didn't do much in 2020 and that he was in effect saying hey  We slept through 2020  But we are waking up and get ready because Google I was gonna have some great stuff and a number of people have taken  That to mean that it might in fact be the pixel 6  Early right when does that come out Jason that would come out in October normally

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right and then we're also expecting the pixel 5a 5g which you know 5a would not be that exciting  No, that wouldn't be exciting, but it would be nearer to the normal time of release based on previous devices of a similar  Family so yeah, I'd be really surprised actually if they released the pixel 6 or at least you know  But what Google does is it's not necessarily that they release it. I could totally see them. You're right Google IO happens  Here is the pixel 6 we're beating all the leaks. Here's everything you need to know about it, and it comes out in three months  You know well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about a watch mr.. How that's after what we saw we're excited about that  The OnePlus watch and that price point that it had and it totally bombed according to mr.  How and everyone else they got their hands on it  He was like to see a watch and I would like to see what they offer up as mr. Jarvis mentions there is a  pixel book

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's what I think I think you're first of all we know the pixel 6 is going to have Google design chips  Already okay already big deal right things they can do with that  Yeah, right. I think that they did coast last year and that gave them time  To you know in sports they call it a rebuilding year  Yeah  And I think last year was the rebuilding year for Google and they gave them the time to really rethink what they want to do  With the pixel it's the strategy has been all over the map at first came out. It was a low-cost  Developer phone then it got to be a flagship phone then last year was a ho hum flagship phone  They didn't update this camera. They didn't do anything I  Here's my guess this they're going to announce and ship a pixel 6 with all new Google silicon in  At Google I O in a week. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  local I  It's gonna be I do all that it's gonna have a much

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Better camera, you know, there's still the pixel 5 didn't have anything different than the pixel 4  Correct. They're gonna have a much better camera. I think there's gonna be I think  The way put I said that to me sounded like  Stand back it's the same thing when Apple said spring loaded is gonna be our vet  I mean it was loaded had more stuff anybody delivered  I feel like Google and they need I also feel like they need to do this. They did. Yeah, they need a  Whip crack wake up call. We're back to work. We took this year. We did a rebuilding year  You won't believe what we've been doing. So yeah, maybe watch  Forget about hardware for a second

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Forget about hardware for a second and a strategic level because they keep on saying we're AI we're AI we're AI  What could they do from a larger product perspective that would be Wowie

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it's a I a I a I first start by keeping some of your best staff on that team. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They fired of course two people from their AI ethics Commission and as a result  one of their best people  Left he's now going to Apple Apple, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so what can you do with unethical AI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're finding that out every single day Jeff you can make a lot of news with that where new frontiers of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  evil AI man

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple said on Monday it hired former distinguished Google scientists. That's a very high-level guy  Sammy Benjio who left the search giant amid turmoil in its AI research department  He's expected to lead a new AI research unit at Apple under another former Googler John Jan Drea  He joined Apple after spending about eight years in Google a couple of years ago  so Apple's building this big AI team and  Google's this is this is the blowback from that really poorly handled AI ethics  Fireings, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't get me wrong. I I root for Google on this considering I'm in the Google ecosystem  So being able to have some AI that's gonna make day-to-day life  Better for me isn't my best interest, but they still got it get their crap together in their own house

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what? I mean, I agree always that's why I think it's so important that May 18th  And by the way, we will be covering that that's a week from Tuesday  We'll be doing Jason and I will be doing the coverage of the keynote which is starts at 10 a.m  Pacific  1 p.m. Eastern time and we'll be streaming that probably they say two hours, right Jason? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, would be surprised if it was any less than that. Yeah, probably about two hours. Yeah  Yeah, what you're saying about circling back to the hardware, you know the potential of a pixel 6  Release at Google I O I would be  Thrilled if that happened like I'd feel like Sundar Pichai is delivering if he made that happen if he truly showed  That Google spent the last year and like an introspective state and said hmm  What should we do to actually be taken seriously in the hardware game?  I think that would be great  What makes me believe that it's not gonna happen is Google is horrible about keeping secrets and I feel like at this point  This close to Google I O if that was gonna happen  We'd have at least some semblance of information about the pixel 6 whatever it is  I mean we know about the Whitechapel chip, but we don't really have a whole lot of  The kinds of leaks that we're used to seeing leading up to a Google release  Which are I know year after year show us Google just does not know how to keep a lid on this stuff  I feel like we'd see it by now  But maybe I'm wrong and I would love to be right because that would be that would mean that they're learning lessons  And I want to see that from Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know what maybe because they're not in the same place it's harder to leak

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, I still argued that they were leaking it themselves to the purpose

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now of course is probably part of that too is it because you know what you're right you're right Aaron  With Google all the Android stuff wasn't that excited anyway. Nope. They might as well have leaked it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right well, I have a question for you all with with with this being a  Google engineered piece of silicon that's going to be in place. Do you think any of the masses care?  Because even with Apple doing the m1 and just how powerful that spin inside of its laptop so whatnot  People still seem to just worry more so about the cache of the iPhone  so so  Do you think any of this matters?  Will will Google's be able to take away some of the market share from the folks at Samsung with their new?  Developments because I think all the people that are going to care are the nerds and geeks

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so Samsung is promising that I  agree Samsung promises, you know, it's it's the the laptop it's like the phone so the so you love the phone and  Everything you do on the phone you can do in the laptop and it'll handle your home and we'll handle all this other stuff  Google has never really done a good job of the secret system

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Understand home stuff all that right. I like so I disagree. I think the Google Nest home hub  Pod next Max  But that that thing is pretty good the little this thing screen thing the Google Nest hub max and the Google Nest hub  They're good. I think that  They've done pretty well with the Google Assistant in these various devices  Right. I mean Amazon is the king of the hill, but I think Google is a strong second and there's no third  I can't think of Syria's being third  You know, they acquired Fitbit which would lend some credence aunt to your idea that maybe they'll do a fitness watch of some kind  I would love to see that they fit they seems like they abandoned Android wear. I they're just no they're not I mean fossils doing well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With Android wear than they are right? Yeah, I mean most most everybody seems to have abandoned Android wear except for fashion brands  But I mean, you know just a hint of what to look forward to at Google I owe a couple of events  That are streaming from I owe and notably they are listed as showing off  Wear and not wear OS  So some people are wondering if that's pointing to you know kind of tying back into what you're talking about and we've heard a lot  Of rumors about a pixel watch we've seen leaked photos on that like that's it  That's a product that has been fully leaked in a number of different ways  And we're just kind of like waiting for that to eventually happen if they're going to such a ho-hum device

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, they just they're completely owned in this market  Totally totally agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's it would be hard for them to come out with a with a wearable that gets everybody excited  Especially have nixie tubes  Have nixie tubes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Watch will have nixie tubes that actually probably sell wet better than an Android wear watch. I have  Probably would sell better  The nest hub did show up at the Bluetooth sig running fuchsia  Yeah, that's interesting. That's the operating system. Google's been working on they've open sourced it  We know they've never really said exactly what fuchsia is intended to do  I  Mean it's been a long time since we've had a new opera. All right, could that be the announcement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Could they could they say we're replacing Android and Chrome the new OS what nest hub uses Chrome OS, I think right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe that's nice or at least the initial ones did I don't know if they stopped you  That was a bit of a surprise that they didn't use Android. They use Chrome OS  I  Do should might be an interesting play here

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently wondering what the heck's gonna happen with fuchsia  I mean and you know, they've been they've been putting out those little nuggets here and there if they were to come out  I Google I like a thing with fuchsia though  Is that I don't understand how deep that actually goes like I think this is interesting news  At the same time. This is fuchsia 1.0 as the operating system  You know on this listing is being attached to a piece of hardware. That's two years old  I don't understand what that means  Maybe that's like a placeholder for something else  Like I can't like wrap my head around what it means that they're doing that on a device has been out for a couple of years  But I'm very curious to see what fuchsia actually is  Leading to and if they can come out at Google I O and say alright  You guys have had an insane amount of questions and rightfully so here's what we're doing  You know everything all of your nest products or I don't know what their announcement would be  But at least at least there's some excitement there because we've it's been building  Towards something with this fuchsia OS that nobody understands at this point. Well, I know it's gonna be big because they have their own

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter hashtag now  So that means it's well darn serious, right? Yeah. Yeah, there it is. It's a little see little  I don't know that is about time. It's a custom hashtag icon, you know, you've made it on Twitter when you have a custom hashtag  Yeah, I  This is gonna be really really interesting Jason. We're sitting here. We it's possible that we'll go. Oh my god  Google's got their mojo back and they are firing on all cylinders. I honestly think it's much more likely we'll say well  Yeah, wasn't that special?  Okay, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I know and it's it's kind of like kind of like at this point. I've been conditioned into that position  I want the excitement back again. Yeah, it's it's kind of a we're being let down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know remember going to Google I own it was exciting and there was new stuff and you expected new interesting  Innovations, you know part of the problem is they showed things like that simultaneously translation with the pixel buds that was so cool  or the making the  Reservations of the Chinese restaurant that was so cool and then never delivered on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, or removing the fennel from the picture remember that the automatic  The fence of the chain link fence that never happened instead of doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They removed the head of photography and he went to Adobe. So  There's been a bit of a brain drain frankly, I absolutely that's a bad sign too when you see people leaving that usually means they don't see a  Strong future in their field at that company. Yeah. Well you brought up the pixel buds

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should mention these pixel bud bud a  series  Devices that you've talked about on this show in weeks past  Google messed up on the at Android  Twitter account they posted a promotional image for it like a big announcement, you know touting its fast  Pairing capabilities and then removed it ten minutes later. So so maybe that's the significant  Jeff Oh geez

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We finally have pixel buds that work they pay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fireworks we didn't say they played but they paired. Yeah, they pair exactly. That's all we promise

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was really wasn't that the wonder you lose the only great thing about them, right? Which is the the the UI

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I wasn't gonna say anything Jeff, but there's also a rumor. They're gonna put fuchsia on the pixel books  It's not gonna be not gonna make you happy at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it may be fine. Maybe better. I live love you to Google. I'm fine  Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean really all you all the operating system on a pixel book is unless you're using is a Linux platform or something is just  A holder for the Chrome which is where everything you know, the Chrome browser is the whole thing really, right?  it's funny because  Then there's this headline at  On the information which is very well connected as good reporters at booming Google search chief gives more love to product managers  This is you know, like Google's about to take off  They also broke the story that the stadia chief of stadia is leaving  And it is what stadia was what is that? Is that a thing where I think it's an it's a  P.s. Holden I oh, yeah. No  Six additional staff leave stadia to join Haven Studios  Jade Raymond was of course a big hire at stadia. Then when she left  a lot of number people followed her to Haven Studios, which is  What she founded after she left stadia. So  You can't look at stadia and think anything that except that it's over. I mean, it's it's over

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean the writing feels like it's on the wall  I don't I don't know what the end game is for stadia except the fact that that  Bad news keeps pouring out about it  And then the unfortunate thing is it's all  Confirms the bad the bad feelings that people had when stadia was announced as cool technology really very ambitious  But yet people immediately jumped on to the owl and this is gonna fail like all other  Things because Google's either gonna get bored or they're gonna mess it up whatever and it's like history has proven itself again with  Stadia, I don't know what the future holds for stadia at this point. All right, let's take a little break

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not me. Yeah, you can tell look at him  You don't know what's going on behind  It's a good hand. That is good. Wow. Look at that. Oh good  We blinked and I've been playing some Valheim in there. We're getting that set up for later this weekend  Well done play along yeah, you're very good I do that I do that when I'm playing Valheim except that my face look like this  We're getting close to a countdown T minus  258 two minutes of 58 seconds for a starship. This is a flight test into is this their deep space flight test John  same  Files miles up five miles down. It's the hard thing is the landing have they landed without blowing up yet  Then they blew up so that's kind of still blowing up  the good news is  There's no atmosphere really to be spoken of in on the moon. So you won't blow up from a explain  Go ahead and show this shot. This is what I love about this  The space starship is this this is this Elon Musk's SpaceX  Starship it's going to NASA did a deal with them to actually take  People to the moon what I love about it is how it looks like a 1950s  rocket ship like from a sci-fi movie and  When they land on the moon, they're gonna land like those rocket ships in a sci-fi movie. That's why they're practicing those landings

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no gantry around it just just like it like well on the moon there's not gonna be a gantry

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It goes up because down yeah, that's that's it NASA did a apparently was the low-cost leader  Last NASA turned down Jeff Bezos is blue origin and I think was it Boeing that had a  Bid because they were so expensive  One of the things that's really great about these  Tests is they have you know, Elon's smart. He puts good cameras on there John show the  Show it a rocket do we crash again? There you have there you go show the engines so you really get a good view of  Of that launch right before it blows up. I  mean not the not the launch the camera because the cameras right there and next to the engines and  The separation has been good. There's people out there looking at it watch and I would love to go down  Is this in Florida? Where is he launching it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's launched Texas from what it's launched  That's what folks in chat are saying that launch to the X

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're really way lagged. Oh man

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so I think that feed that you're seeing is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  SpaceX feed froze, you know, you can launch rockets but  When it's all about streaming that's another problem  Boca Chica, Texas  The day the earth stood still yeah boy that that feed is awful  You know, I think that probably means a lot of people are  Watching it right there's a lot of interest in this  As people are very interested in space. Yes, somehow we went backwards in the countdown. So I know we're not watching this in real  That's how you know, it's already Elon Musk froze Oh this is t-plus it's already so that's oh that's in I see it's frozen  But it's up in space. Yeah, that's not space. It's in the air  That is not that shot is not doing nothing, okay. All right  That's hilarious they need one of mine they need a nixie clock I think for the countdown  It went from 259 to 1 o'clock the clock  I  Didn't rub it with enough alcohol apparently  Is it now at the one as it says it's one as chop says this awfully low res  Oh, shut up. I  Think he's talking about the NASA. No, he's talking about this  Back already is it coming down already? No, I saw flames. Yeah, that's pretty quick, right?  I would love to see the landing if we can get the boy. That's terrible video. Yeah, it's awful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they put the money elsewhere it'll do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's actually really important. Yeah, I'm sorry about the clock it went backwards, didn't it?  It's me it's my fault. I said it weird. I have to get back in I haven't done any setting on the clock

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're gonna relive the last hour. Yeah. Oh boy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right about now. I was carefully wiping the tubes with alcohol  You like to go back. Oh there here it goes. Here we go a  little bit better video  Yeah, is it going down or up which direction we tell that is that the the horizon?  It's leveled off. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just I that planet sure looked flat to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently but speaking of the new pixel phone there is a rumor that it will have UWB in it  This is something that Apple's made a lot of with on the air tags the next pixel phone  Could hop on the ultra  Wide bandwagon along with Samsung and Apple Samsung and us get already using it  It's really a cool way to do a lot of things. You can aim at things you can find things  Samsung has their smart tags Apple has we're about to land their tags. Oh, let's watch it's going down  Oh  Boy that's you got it. Is that yeah, it's hard to tell it's hard to tell  Yeah, Boca Chica's got about five minutes before we know. Yeah  Looks pretty good. I remember last time there was a small leak that eventually  Caught fire, but this looks pretty stable  Awesome. That's important because that's what it needs to do on the moon, right?  And of course take off again afterwards, right nice very cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, UWB back to the UWB story from my understanding Michelle Roman from XDA was the  The person who got the kind of information from a source nine to five Google confirmed it  It was specific to UDB or so, sorry ultra wide yeah UWB  An API being created and so they were positing does this mean that the next pixel would have support for ultra wide  Yeah, oh interesting so so there's not really a lot of information then I don't know that it necessarily means that the pixel six is  Going to have that support  But it definitely means that Google is working on building the support into Android probably in a similar way to  What they did with foldables where everybody was kind of doing their own thing with foldables and then finally Google was like hey  We're going to make an official API to support these multiple displays and so that everybody's on the same page  So it could at the at the least be that for Android and at the most who knows maybe the pixel six will actually have  Support for it too, which would be good. It'd be current

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, here's an argument for there being a new pixel book Jeff Chromebooks dominate  That's a strong word dominate the global PC market  275 percent growth. I have to think this the pandemic has something to do with that and HP is currently number one  Yeah, sure  Look at the  Yeah, look at that graph. So this gray line is and it started at a q3 the big growth q3 to q4

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What we care about is connectivity in the web. This is the connected age. It's not that it's not the software age  It's not the it's not the software age. Yeah, you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, it's clear, you know even companies like  Microsoft are starting to look at  You know basically running the operating system in the cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why I wonder whether I mean it is  I'm not saying this fuchsia  But I I think that there's there's a moment here for some leaps in os  We haven't been there in a while. I don't know what it would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I have my moments with it, especially from a resources perspective

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you're trying to run a rocket ship on a sunday. I know not a rocket ship just a tank

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only negative on this is if you look at the top sellers of chromebooks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not the only ones that are trying to run a rocket ship

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Only negative on this is if you look at the top sellers of chromebooks  hp lenovo asus samsung dell  And others, I don't see the word google in there at all because they haven't had a new one in shocking  Really and and four years. Yeah, the pixel book go that was a couple of years. That doesn't count. That was a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that counts enough. It's a chromebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was their chromebook you want to I know you want a high-end chromebook. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis, if it makes you feel any better  Queen pruett's laptop was just totally on the fritz and I said  Don't you don't need a laptop just go get a chromebook. And so she did just go out and she happy  She is happy because it allows her access to the web just to do simple stuff on the web  She doesn't need to do a whole bunch of computing stuff. Just connect to the web use google docs. She's trying to  Run things with her plantastic potheads and that chromebook is totally fine. It was under 300 bucks  There you go. You see that's how you light room. Yeah, perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Perfect for that. All right when we come back, I wonder if you look at what's happening with android  And how they put more computing locally on on the phone?  Whether without having to get into a whole mess with windows and apple of installing software and stuff  Could you put more stuff locally on to a laptop to handle finally photos and videos?  The real thing missing here is photos and videos once you get that  Solved the chromebook. There's no reason I would argue unless you're programming unless you're doing specialized things  For 99 what you need the chromebook is going to be fine. Yep. I agree with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And when you say photos and videos, what are you meaning like a photo photo?  Video manipulation or just photo? Yeah, you really can't you can't edit video. Yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't I would love to have our students

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Switch to chromebook would be a lot cheaper for them. It'd be great and they could for everything except doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can do retouching but you're not going to do really hardcore editing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on photos and i blame google for this because uh, if you wanted to if you really wanted to support the  Pixelbook you'd make google photos have better editing tools  Yeah, right if they did that I think that then you could say you could point to that and say look  They'll store unlimited. Well, not unlimited  Almost a store a lot of photos up there in the cloud and they give you editing tools  They do all the other good stuff that google photos does that's all they are making an effort with it. They're trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, you know, they just recently added those sharpening then denoising tools, right? Those are pretty pretty significant tools  Remove fences

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, but yeah, so I haven't really used the editor that much have you used it at all and is it decent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I use it off and on on the phone for quick hitter stuff to put out on instagram stories something like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's about it. Yeah, how's the kind of strikes me as the use case for for the editing?  Because you've got professional anyways, that's what you're gonna exactly if you care that if you care enough  You're gonna jump jump into the light rooms and that sort of thing  Right. I don't know that google is necessarily paying, you know  Positioning google photos to be the solution for professional photographers either. I don't care as much about that. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I think there are people buying chromebooks either

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, but the people that are buying chromebooks should still have some decent tools though. I mean they shouldn't be left  That's what i'm saying. That's exactly right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly what i'm saying and that's up to google. So they have filters. I mean i'm playing with these filters. That's kind of fun  um  But where's the where's the rest of the editing? Is there any more editing anywhere? It was under that menu over to the right  Here it says this and then right there this menu right in the center

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There used to be a lot of different not a lot. It used to be more. Yeah a little drop down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go. Okay, so this is a lot of what you could do in light room in light room  I mean not  You know, I mean  It's pretty basic

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there something to be said for the quality of these particular adjustments in a in a program like light room versus what google's offering?  in the cloud at like like you as like a  Someone who's very familiar with that ant would would know that panel right there is very comparable to the free version of light room

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very comparable

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In some ways it's kind of got it's got more ai capability I like that skin tone. Yeah  um  Yeah, it's fun. I you know pop needs more than just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was you you bring up pop? That's like the go-to  Editing option of queen pruett. She she loves to pop her images up and the first thing she looks for is pop  And then she goes to social media because it does look pretty good with most of the things that she shoots and the filters

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know if you're used to instagram or  You know any photo app and on your phone. That's very much something like you're used to so  Auto does actually auto does the best job. That's actually a pretty good job with the auto  Yeah, yeah agreed. Yeah  Uh, all right. Let me uh, let's take a little break and uh come back  with more of the action so it looks like a  spacex  Starship landed and is hasn't blown up yet  Still standing so that's it. That's very successful. I don't want to jinx it. That was the thing. Yeah  No, I don't want to jinx it either. I want to bite you you have lower the expectations, right increase the results, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's gonna blow up. No, it doesn't hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by nereva, you know where people are coming back  Uh, the offices are starting to fill but people are still nervous and rightly so and they want to be careful and you want to  social distanced  Uh, it's going to change distance is really going to change  Meeting room audio as people come back and may require changes in room configurations  And that means usually terrible sound right? No, not if you're using nereva  Nereva gives you great mic coverage even when people are socially distanced in a meeting space  It's not nope. It's not beamforming beamforming performing systems need adjustments  Usually by an expensive technician  Uh, you might have a tabletop kind of system right now  But you know, there's one in the middle you're going to need multiple mics and then each one has to be sanitized between meetings  You may have to change how you behave in a meeting sit in a predetermined spot  Face in a particular direction. None of that's good. You want nereva  But what if there are better ways to get clear reliable audio?

Beast

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who is you know, what who is i didn't actually I didn't actually didn't put that in there jason can explain it  Well, yeah, so I mean i'll do my best to explain it basically, you know taylor lorenz. She's awesome  New york times she does such a good job of writing about  Just everything that's going on in the social world and especially, you know  tiktok and youtube and all that kind of stuff  She did kind of a feature on a youtube star who you may or may not have heard of called mr  Beast and I just saw jeff that you put it in there. I'm like, oh, yeah  I've seen so many of his videos because of my kids his whole schtick and  Basically, he's like one of the most popular youtubers at this point. I love how that like top spot is so fluid  You know a couple of years ago was pewdiepie and that was the name everyone knew  A pair prepare yourselves for mr. Old fart. No, i've been hearing about mr. Beast for months. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, i've seen his videos this he's the guy who gives away money

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's kind of his deal is he gets these sponsorships where he he um  Is given like a million dollars to give out, you know in some  Grand way where he just kind of goes out on the street and you know starts talking to someone and hands them a suitcase

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Full of money. So I was wondering where he got the money from okay  So people get sponsors give him the money because that when I saw it  It's like he doesn't say where it came from and it's like you have just a thousand bucks to give people randomly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the deal? Well, you know, he's also making an insane amount of money off of off of you know, all of these videos  He's he's figured out what works for the algorithm to get people to watch. I think he has something like  36 different people  Working for him. So he's got a full production arm  Always coming up with these new ideas, you know what?  Some of them are like, you know  He he isolates himself in a room for like 48 hours and he just has to be in there with absolutely nothing to do  And it's just a video of like him in a room and all of his friends on the outside just doing pranks on him  To try and you know drive him crazy over the course of 48 hours. It's actually pretty entertaining. I have to say like  I uh, it's it's easy to get pulled into it and uh  And not feel like what I realized in watching some of his videos is there's a lot of stuff on youtube  That I watch it and at the end like I just kind of feel gross like what did I do?  What did I just do? Yeah, why and and at least with his like there's a little bit of like a  You know, he's giving he's giving money to people. There's something nice about like the fact that he's truly authentically  Surprising these people with something that literally, you know could has the potential to change their lives in that moment  Yes, he's doing it because it makes him a star and it makes him more more, you know  Gets him more subscribers and everything but you can find in my opinion  You can find a lot worse on youtube than than it's so funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How what goes around comes around because radio stations for years have been giving away money to get listeners  It's it's not new according to the new york times. He started in middle school in 2012  and he  Apparently his one and only goal was to become a youtube star because he cycled through different genres trying to figure out  How to get the attention of the youtube recommendation algorithm. He played games  He commented on youtube drama. He uploaded funny video compilations  Did reaction videos for a while? It was a couple of years ago. He discovered giving away thousands of dollars  Who knew giving away thousands of dollars in cash to random people?  uh  Would be a recipe for success  Uh, he rebranded himself youtube's biggest philanthropist  He declined a comment for the story because there have been there's some cracks  In the armor one apparently  pushed a cryptocurrency scam that or scheme maybe not a scam that uh,  cost people  Money he promoted it and invested in it, but there some fans lost a lot of money  Um, and you know, I have to say that one of the problems with youtube  In a way is uh, it loans it lends itself to this exact kind of thing  Uh, which is you know here i'm just going to give you money. That's not content. Yeah, right  That's buying an audience  Although it ends up being content because it's interesting to see the reactions and then the problem is and this is where we'll see  How well he does it then becomes very difficult to top yourself?  And and people get tired and they move on and you have to find you can say that about all of the platforms  Whether it's tik tok youtube's worse any any algorithmically driven platform is going to be bad because  You know attention moves on the algorithm  Boosts you up very quickly. It can take you down just as quickly and then you get that desperation  Oh, what do I do to keep you know, keep this uh, keep this thing going. I've got 36 mouths to feed  Uh eventually gave back a million dollars, by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, he is i've heard of him, but I never watched any of his videos only reason I  Took a semi-interest was because he was from carolina, right? And he's a kid. He's 22

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, and parents like you jason like him because at least he isn't filthy. He doesn't swear  You know, he's not pranking people  So he's palatable  Uh, although apparently great way to put it. Yeah, he's palatable

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like I can I can stand watching his videos some of the videos that end up on the on the tv when they're watching youtube  I'm just like, uh like this  Just like nails on a chalkboard  And none of it is none of it is educational by the way, like I still don't know how I feel about like  watching for entertainment  This like hyper drive of uh of spreading money all over the place, you know  Like what is the value like what is like the the like ethical or moral value that comes out of that sort of content?  I'm not sure you know, I I certainly don't know the answer to have you youngsters ever heard of a show called queen for a day

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's exactly what he's doing. It's queen for a day. Right and and so it's it's poverty porn, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's it's oh you're all gonna feel good. I mean tv all media are made to make you feel better and superior to the rest of the world  He created the this in a way is that oh i'm in better shape

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's also he's also doing what a lot of these guys do  Which is you got to figure out where to put the money and how to keep the money coming in he's  He's done a lot of it's interesting. He's obviously a go-getter. He created a ghost kitchen franchise  This is the mr. Beast burger  That's that kudos for that. I don't think I think that's actually three of them. I don't think you're supposed to eat that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No  Who knows maybe that's one of those the topics of his video. Yeah, he uh, he opened

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says I literally just opened 300 restaurants all across america  But we only serve people through delivery apps  When a customer orders from the mr beast burger in midvale utah the food is prepared at a location of bucchia di beppo  Which is an italian chain. Oh, I used to eat there. Yeah, and then manhattan mr  beast burgers are made at handcraft kitchen and cocktails so  it's called a ghost franchise because you I guess but in in effect you just  Put a name on something that somebody else is is making. I don't know. He also  uh, um  Let's see has a mobile gaming app  He wants to be elon musk one day. He says how many times have I heard that? Yeah, right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I mean he's 22 and he's done a heck of a lot in a short amount of time at a young age like yeah  I gotta give him props for his entrepreneurial drive. Yeah, he's clearly that yeah, absolutely. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um  Pretty impressive mr. Beast  Yeah, i've been hearing his name for a while actually  Yeah, I don't know from whom but I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Someone who we don't know yet will out mr. Beast. Yeah, mr. Beast in two years  It'll be somebody else. Yeah, exactly. That's just the way youtube seems to seems to roll

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  YouTube if you if you want to watch um, I don't know you may not want to this but queen for a day  The videos are amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a sob story. So the you get to be queen for the day by telling the saddest  Story like, you know, my husband left me then the house burned down and now the kids need dental work  And the whole thing is is about watching these people and then they pick one of these right jeff  There were several on the show this show was started before I was born. Yeah. Yeah, it's really old at all and they give you you know  A maytag washing machine that washer right? Yeah, you know boy. I can now wash the family's clothes  Yeah, I wish I had a house to do it in. Yeah  All right  So this morning the oversight board decided what to do about donald trump kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, I don't know we sort of supposed to get a popcorn break for this get your popcorn

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So  Maybe you know and the former president had made noises about starting a social network  But you know, he's he's very add and it is I think eventually put something on his blog  Like he's posting a place. He started a blog  He's really he's really lost frankly without twitter  Uh, how important is facebook to him? I don't know. What was the uh, what was the decision jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't so the decision was was was I think odd. Uh, uh, the the legal twitter thinks it's nuanced and fascinating  I don't what they said was you were right to take them down. You were wrong to make it indefinite  You uh are not clear with your rules and you didn't have a bunch of rules and you didn't really  Enforce where this was and why it was and within six months we insist they use the verb insist we insist  That facebook come back  with another decision  so that decision could be in six months that um  It's permanent he ain't coming back ever which is what jack dorsey has done  Uh, just on his own authority without an oversight board or it could be that  Um, we've decided that he's performed. He's seen the burning bush. Uh, he can go back up  So it's a non-decision decision. Absolutely. So what they did was they threw the ball back  Across now the legal people say well it really showed how facebook, uh is inconsistent. Yeah, we already knew that and um,  You know put the put it back on facebook  They couldn't put this on the oversight board  Well, the oversight board shouldn't have taken the decision in the first place if they were going to say no  We're not going to they should have said that in the first place. So what's happened now what sets mean about this now is that?  um  It's it's it's a it's a vice it's a wedge  It's going to sit there for six months  And so you're going to have cancel culture whining going on from the right constantly waiting to see what facebook does facebook is going to  Be nervous as hell  um  And neither organization neither facebook nor the oversight board took the opportunity to discuss the behavior itself  They concentrated as the oversight board has been doing on a  Statutorial level of the really fine nitty gritty of it of like what he posted that day to my mind  I'll be politically here for a moment. Pardon me for this  The big lie alone is reason to take them off  And leave them off, but they didn't deal with that. They didn't deal with the bigger issues  They didn't deal with it  You know they had pap in there about how important democracy is but they didn't deal with the impact on democracy neither body did  So they both just punted in their own way facebook did take them down  They did something a little late in my view, but they did something  But then they punted to go to the oversight board and the oversight board punted back. It's like lucy in the football  And and again meanwhile I watch  You know people say oh mark sucker book's too powerful. He makes too big of decisions  Well, he they didn't make the decisions. Meanwhile jack dorsey changed the world immensely by saying this is enough  I'm taking him down and he's been down and it's been quiet and it's made a difference  It has been so in a way. I want a more authoritarian company. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting for mr. Jarvis. Yes you um in your thread here you said um  Facebook should keep trump banned because of quote his uttering  Present imminent danger to democracy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What exactly did you mean by that sir? I mean the big lie. I mean, I mean saying that an election is invalid  And saying that it has no value and trying to convince people of that  tears up  down a pillar of democracy  and pretty funny because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even though he has no pulpit anymore  It's like kind of on his own because there's no reason that he couldn't be  Putting out press releases and doing interviews and stuff  But mostly what he seems to be doing is wandering aimlessly around mara lago until he finds a group of people  And then telling him, you know, I won that election. It's all it was all a  It's a very strange  almost it is kind of  Citizen cain kind of bizarre and would be poignant if  If you were human, yeah, well, it's it's very it's odd. It's very interesting. Yeah  Is the florida bill this is kind of in response to what facebook and twitter did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Florida bill is so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody i'm sorry. You want to explain it first? Yeah, so this bill which I don't know if if desantis has signed it yet  Uh, it was passed  He wanted it. So I imagine he'll by now have signed it. It was passed by the florida house of representatives  By a vote of 77 to 38 and then I think the other house. Yeah, it was just  But the bill is  Nutty it says  Uh, if you're a social network and you de-platform political candidates, you're gonna you're gonna get a fine  Uh, oh, I guess it's in reconciliation right now  so  The bill is now going to the senate to approve the changes made by the house the senate version called for fines of  10 000 a day  for banning a political candidate  100 000 a day if the candidate was running for election  Then the house version said no, that's not enough. They they bumped the fines up even more almost more than double them

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't apply to temporary social media bans and it wouldn't apply to instances where the platformer of specific posts  That violate the terms of service  But any social media ban that lasts longer than 60 days both facebook's and twitter's bans have would result in a fine  I strikes me that this is a violation of the first amendment so clearly in my life. It's also an attempt to  Buy a state to regulate interstate commerce. So it's going to fail. It's just all around it  Yeah, and what's weird is they they they actually included an exemption  For any information service system internet search engine or access software provider  Operated by a company that owns and operates a theme park or large entertainment complex  Who's in florida? Oh  The exemption was included so that the disney plus streaming service isn't caught up in this  And and comcast and disney world. Yeah, right. Um, wow  It's just ridiculous. It's ridiculous. It's absurd  And it's they they say it's not about president trump, but it's it's clearly  It was stimulated by the ban from twitter and facebook  I can't imagine it'll see it'll hold up in court. I don't know what will happen. No way. Yeah, no way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a question. It's just going to show my ignorance on all of this. So and i'm okay with that  this ban of  Trump is essentially because of what happened. Um far as the insurrection or a collection of everything  So if the insurrection

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a good question because it  Yes, it's primarily january 6th and the insurrection. That was the last straw wasn't it was also the last straw exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. That's why I was on the ass if the insurrection had never happened, you know  Could we potentially still have to deal with him? No, and the funny thing is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that that that  We don't account enough for how even big titans of technology can become scared  And as long as trump was in office  Uh, look what he tried to do with with tick with tiktok, right? I think that they were scared of him  um, and and so january 6th, he was already defeated  And he was leaving office and he did this thing and so it was the moment  When they all could do it  Uh, should there are those who say they should have done it a year before  Or should have at least done it from november when he was claiming the big lie from then  But he was still in office and it was  They were nervous. They're scared

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Galia at that point they were concerned with retaliation, right? Right. Yes. Exactly. Oh we do this with a year left in his term  What is he going to come back with? It's probably not going to be pretty for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so it was it was the accumulation of carbon monoxide in the blood finally got here  So officially and I think it was more about that day, but actually it was more about the accumulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh  Somebody says instead of rosebud he goes around muttering cofeevee  I do wish I had a facebook account for this this one story  Signal and I I guess I wouldn't have seen these ads because they got  Immediately turned down by facebook. Actually, there's even a dispute over what happened signal, which is the the uh, encrypted messaging platform  Run by open whisper systems and moxie marlin spike the founder tried to run a facebook ad  Gizmodo called it the most honest facebook ad campaign ever created  the ad says you got this ad because and then it says something about you in this  Example case from signal you're a newlywed palates instructor and you're cartoon crazy  This ad used your location to see you're in la jolla. And so there are all these examples  Outstanding signal said facebook turned them down  And then cancelled their account facebook says no, no  Um, we didn't do that  They said this is just a publicity stunt by signal who never even tried to actually run these ads  And we didn't shut down their ad account for trying to do so and then signal says  Uh, we absolutely did try to run these the ads were rejected and facebook disabled our ad account  These are real screenshots as facebook should know  So, I don't know what really happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would trust signal a little more than facebook. There's got to be some sort of transaction record out there, right? Yeah, they could show the receipts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a great idea for an ad. Of course, it's exactly kind of ad facebook doesn't want anybody to run because it's essentially saying  Well, you see what facebook knows about you and is willing to tell advertisers come to signal stop using facebook messenger because we don't do that  And  Can you advertise a competitor to facebook on facebook using the information facebook provides advertisers?  I would have loved I would love to know I would love to see this ad just to know what facebook knows about me, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, is that in the terms of service to have ads has probably written somewhere possibly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, I think they could probably say no to anything. But yeah, that's i'm curious  There is a and again, I don't have facebook haven't had it for more than a year actually more like two years now  Um, but there used to be a thing you could go see what facebook thinks about you, right?  What think facebook thinks you're a republican and thinks you're this you can see that  Was that in facebook was at google? Yeah. No, it's in facebook both facebook. Okay. Yeah, i'm worried on facebook  Uh, I don't know is they still have that I don't know. I don't know  So that would have been one way to find out but uh, you know you have to be so they just simply the idea was they just bought

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  La Jolla residents who like lock and they bottle a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Showed up on a lot of individual ads highly targeted exposure. Yeah, yeah, just as every political campaign does  Uh, you know, they bought the targeted ads. Yeah  um  Facebook is going to give five million dollars to local journalists covering communities  This is a problem. Of course local journalism is dying in a lot of towns

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is part of their and full disclosure is my school might I think do some training for this or something. I don't know but  This is this is part of their journalism product project. I'm not involved in that really. Yeah, but they're they're trying to um  We talked about it briefly before but they're trying to create a mechanism and train  Individual journalists, but they're interestingly it's not just on facebook  They presume people will have blogs off off of facebook and podcasts off of facebook  But use facebook for community and promotion and that facebook is going to try to get some of these going to fill in news  deserts giving priority to people who are covering  Areas that don't have major news coverage who come from communities that have not been covered  And so, you know, we'll see what how far five million dollars gets them  I've long believed in the power of hyper local  But it's hard people it's hard work and people don't make a lot of money doing it and it's hard to find them  To train them, so we'll see how well it goes i'll try for anything when it comes to local news. We'll see. Yeah, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The cynical part of me says oh facebook's a small amount of money and this is a way to kind of revitalize their reputation among journalists  But frankly any corporation that does any kind of giving is doing it  maybe because they believe in the in the in the  you know, uh subject but  Just as much because it's good pr so, you know, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's no different than anybody else enlightened self-interest enlightened self-interest. It's still yes. And this is a campbell brown initiative  Yeah inside facebook, so she's a journalist and wants to see it  happen  and full disclosure  Facebook has given money to my school for various activities, but I make no money personally from any of the platforms

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh fcc has ruled that elon musk's spacex satellites can fly even lower  Uh amazon was a little upset about this initially  But amazon said its concerns were adequately adequately addressed by the conditions the commission placed on its approval  the fcc authorized spacex to lower the primary operational altitude for  2,804 of its satellites  from  1,100 to 1,200 kilometers to about half that 540 to 570 kilometers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lower than what i'm questioning for you. Yes, I mean to ask so like today with that launch  is there a map of where these little buggers are so that um  You know that that that is going to be a safe launch

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you don't fly into one of them? Yeah  Well space let me tell you jeff is a very big place big place. Well, but  There's more and more stuff up there, right? How do they do that? John?  It's all mapped they know where it's stuff is going to be  You can uh, you can actually go to a live picture of the satellites right now  And I guess they just plan the launch  It might get more complicated because you know things like a mars launch the window for that is is fairly short  And if you miss it, you might have to wait a year till the next time you can launch to mars  Do you want to do it when it's closest?  And so it may be that you don't have a whole lot of time to get around the satellites  But you know, they're moving around and I yeah  There is some concern  That with there you go  Oh, holy  Where's where's that from john? Is that google? It says google  Look at that. They're all but you see that line there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You need to get john a mic, I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's talking about that line above uh  Yeah, go go go go go up that orange line across  Let's see

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jammery gets on the mic there that those are all star links  Probably the recent launch and they haven't deployed their position yet. Yeah. Okay. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they get you know, they launch from one rocket 60 or more satellites at once and then  And then they have to fly in a position. So yeah, wow, look at that. Jeez. There's a lot of them up there  But yeah, no kidding there's hundreds and hundreds of miles between each one, you know, I mean, I know but

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it'd be i'd finally get on the rocket ship just my odds

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Talk so you're saying there's a chance  And uh, we're gonna have to turn around and go home. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I did i'm the guy who paid for skylab, you know, so  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he bought pizza for all of australia. What was the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  10 000 bucks for a beer hauler's helper  Bringing us the first pieces of skylab

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  stan thorton  So I didn't know that nuzzle  In our editorial meeting people said oh twitter bought nuzzle  And I said what I didn't know that nuzzle got sold to scroll. Yes two years ago kind of rescued rescued  Scroll which is this actually a very interesting company  Scroll and one of the things scrolls doing and i'm a subscriber to this is you pay five bucks a month and they distribute it  You got it. Yeah  They distribute it to partner sites as you're browsing around so scroll is proven  They say there's a new model for journalism 40 more revenue 28 more time spent 15 increase in page views  twitter just bought scroll  And getting nuzzle in the process I might add  Which I think is interesting. They're going to shut down nuzzle, which is too bad because I love nuzzle for now for now  But I get the feeling  That they might be planning something because remember they have also bought that newsletter business a few months ago, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. And and and so tony hale who's the founder of scroll who prior to that was the the head of chartbeat  That's tony hale. I know tony hale tony hale tony's great  He's a friend and tony believes deeply in journalism and and and in the case of scroll  He was just saying there's some proportion. It's not everybody. It's not going to save everything  But there's some proportion of your audience who would pay money every month to get rid of the ads  Yeah, and you capture them, right? Yeah, and and and they're using and they're feeling guilty as they damn well should about using  Um ad blockers and stuff and they get a better experience. Anyway, it's not not clued  And so he set that up  But what he said was that the twitter is the one he said for facebook and google news is come see comes out  It's not really part of their strategy if it went away  It wouldn't hurt them twitter is the one company for which news is critical to its strategy. So he believed this was a core  Marriage meant to happen and and I think it shows I'm really getting every day. I get more to be more a fan of jack torsic  Uh considering how he handled trump considering how he's buying this stuff and starting to do things he cares about news  um  He cares about expertise. I think there's interesting stuff happening on twitter. And so by getting scroll in and  nuzzle  you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well and that's yet as a newsletter kind of a component because  Uh, so what nuzzle is is a news site that is based on your twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Feed so you sign links from the links that people link to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right it aggregates those sign in with your twitter feed and then it shows you  shows  News from your friends news from your friends of friends news  You may have missed because none of your friends linked to it  And uh, I found it to be very useful. It's not it's not I don't use it just for tech  Because apparently based on the people i'm following they're very interested in politics as well  So it would it will look different for everybody. I would guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But imagine if you could have a different view of twitter where you don't just see the tweets  You see the nuzzle view of your twitter feed which is what are the interesting stories and twitter more and more once is forcing  You to read those stories before you you know, you're doing anything with them, right?  Yeah, so so that becomes an interesting way to do it and imagine too if you can have a one sign in  view then across  premium news sites from twitter  And you're signing you're subscribing to twitter and to tons of good news sites  That starts to be really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So then are are you thinking like with with this kind of in combination with you know  The the word that we've heard that twitter is working on some sort of a premium  Model like this kind of ties into that right or does right? I would imagine  This would be a component of whatever their premium model would be because when when i've thought about twitter as a premium model prior  It was kind of like what could you really do to the twitter experience that I would actually pay for but  That's a lot of added value there  I would absolutely pay for that and and actually when I think about it  And I mentioned this last night on all about android as well  There aren't a whole lot of services that I use as much as I use twitter  So if it really came down to paying for something  I would have to put my money where my mouth is I use twitter pretty pretty  Constantly I should be able to um to you know pitch in pay for the service

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think that that you know  Part of the problem jason  Is that it's hard to say what would be premium on top of yeah?  If twitter has to have a free layer or else it's right because it's it's its stock just went down because it's user growth  stalled a bit  though  Investors are buying the stock at the same time  um, so you don't necessarily you either charge for the core thing and shrink it  Or you cope with something new and so coming up with something and this goes to your thing and two the other day is  You didn't really want to commit to subscribing to the washington post  You did because we kind of brought me into it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And i'm pretty much going to get out of that trial because it hasn't really added any value

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um to my day-to-day consumption, but if you could get the occasional article from 20 different places that had value  Without friction  Would you pay for that? That's a different story, right?  Uh, and you can imagine through the nuzzle functionality getting links it could be it could be a hell of a draw a driver  of subscription  one definition or another  There's another company called uh axe oh, I forget what it is axe eight  no, uh, there's another company out there that does some interesting things in this model where where you  Um pay a lump sum in the month and you can choose when to use it  There's a few different models of what we're looking around this  By the way, we should give a a plug here to the amazing wonderful jonathan abrams  Yes, who was the founder of nuzzle? Yes, uh also, of course the founder of friends juror and hotlinks before that  Jonathan is one of those great unsung people who really is always just a little bit too ahead of the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But does great stuff. Yeah, I love nuzzle. I I use it  I'd almost be sad to lose it. Frankly. I enjoyed using it. I had a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  couple opportunities to co-host tech news weekly with mr. Howell and mr sergeant and and  It was nice to be able to pull that up and take a look at my followers that I know  Pay attention to some things that I typically don't pay attention to and be able to grab some interest and insight now granted  October november was a pain in the butt because it was all political stuff  But outside of that it was it was a great resource for some stuff that I had no idea what's going on out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And and journalists are screaming about losing nuzzle. They're just and it was trusted sources too, you know, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's a great it's a great tool for for journalism. Yeah, absolutely. I wonder if uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter might not have liked it because it honestly I used it more than I use twitter  I used it to scrape my twitter and I only read nuzzle  Uh, I wonder if that twitter would sure twitter would free you go to the twitter page

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of the day need to fix twitter then if that's the case because I went to twitter first  Uh, i've said before that twitter is where I got my news  But again if I was working tech news weekly that week  I wanted to get a little bit more than what I normally would get because I don't particularly care about  News the way other people do and when I go to my version of twitter  It's it's enough news in there for aunt pruett, but not enough for you know, you or mr  Jarvis or what have you so having nuzzle step in and say okay aunt you need to know more about this stuff right here too  Not just because your buddy  Posted it but your buddy posted it his friend posted it her friend posted it  So it's pretty important and take a look at it and and I like that about nuzzle twitter didn't really give me that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well for for me the difference, uh as i'm listening to you kind of talk through this it kind of it  Suddenly became clear to me the thing that I appreciate about nuzzle compared to an algorithm is the algorithm  On a twitter site that says this is news that you would care about is very anonymous  It's very much just like we think you care about this. Are we right? Here's the story  Are you going to read it on nuzzle? It was it was a very transparent  Approach to saying we think you're going to care about this because all these people that you care about care about it  And being able to to read to open up a news story and see all the people that I respect enough to follow on twitter  Uh commenting, you know about their views and their takes on these stories  It was just the the contextual kind of bonus out of that was just so much more  Satisfying to me than just going on a site and taking what it says it thinks I want to read

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jason, I think you're so right  Uh, and and I was talking to somebody else about a different business this morning  They were just calling for advice and i've been arguing that I think the next generation of the web is an expert player  And uh, you know, i've talked often to the show about my my covid twitter list of 600 experts and how much it's taught me  Um, and and twitter's been trying to build those expert lists and their covid twitter list frankly isn't as good as mine  Because they have a few turkeys on it  Um, and and so you can see where  A nuzzle slash scroll scroll for the big brands nuzzle for the kind of individuals  Could start to bring you an entirely different window onto twitter and now remember again jack's strategy  Of looking at the possibility of a federated open lower layer of twitter  Then the money is made like wordpress with the value you add on top of that layer  The recommendations you give the curation you do the the subscription models you you offer  um  The relationships you you you enable  Uh in social there's a huge new opportunity on top of that, but I think it becomes based in  The people you trust the people who are experts now that can also mean you trust the wrong people and  Idiots feed idiots, but that's the world  We'll see

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do do there's so many stories I want to talk about but I also  We're kind of running out of time

So writing became  the the requirement for an elite  and  Now it is writing everywhere, right? Everybody's got their hot takes out there. Everybody's got their blogs  Everybody's got it out there and now the machines will be able to do it  Incredible ways too. They've been doing it of course for sports stories and finance stories, which are how they structured  But now they're even doing it to a level of art  And writing is commodified writing is not a special thing anymore writing is not a big deal folks

They proved it and i'm kind of spoiling the article by uh, giving you the first paragraph of uh,  gregor kafka's famous  Book the metamorphosis and then giving you the second paragraph which as far as you can tell  Seems pretty  Right on and then they say except that that was written by an ai  This is gpt3 we've talked about it before right, uh the open ai neural learning  Network that can auto-generate text. It wasn't very good in the first few iterations  It's getting better. It keeps getting better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm, sorry. My hard head just messaged me what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't know sony made dslr's. I thought they were all mirror. Yeah way back in the day, but  They stopped now completely. They apparently were still making them but they've no longer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right when they got into that nx nex line  The smaller compact system cameras. They really started to take off and then you started to see the a7 line the alpha  Seven. Yeah, that's what I have. Yeah. Yeah, you have a7r  Their prowess really just took off especially on the video standpoint because they're so lightweight and the color science is really good  and they just been getting better and better and better and  Why not just just stick to what's working, you know, and they also have their sitting line of cameras

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pardon, do the mirrors die at some point does that whole technology go away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty much a dead tech everybody's moving more towards the mirrorless design because it's a lot more  No, I shouldn't say this. I shouldn't say a lot more because it's lighter  than the dslr body  because if you look at the  r5  and this  A1 that I just reviewed for hands-on tech  They're fairly light bodies. But when you put a lens on them, these things are still just as heavy as a dslr  It's just it's a smaller compact body. That's a little bit more manageable to carry around

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  While we're on photo, can we can I get and you're just your explanation of how the biden's look like giants and the carters  I believe that was a bad lens choice. Yeah bad lens choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So explain how that happens  You use a wide-angle lens you get lens distortion and they tend to make things sort of bow out  If you use software like lightroom  Lightroom has a calibration feature that will help flatten your image out to make things look a little bit more natural

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're on the same plane. I don't think I think that the biden's actually are giants and they and the carters are  That is not they're on the same focal plane there is no that's no lens issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I saw it looked like they were down lower down. Okay. Yeah, that does look weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh boy, it's just amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like they've gone to visit a home for uh munchkins. Oh boy. Yeah  But you do get smaller when you get older, um, you know, I wonder

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I have an idea now because if he was using say like a  85 or something it would be a lot more compressed. I don't know. This doesn't make any sense. I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I know  There's there's something about how the carters are sitting and the fact that the angle that we're seeing them  We're seeing the top of their legs as if it's a small

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Distance. Yeah, I think the president is actually uh kind of maybe is a foot or two ahead of roslyn  But and I don't know maybe jimmy's just that small because it looks like jill biden is exactly next to him. Yeah  Oh, wow  Yeah, I don't know the image as as you know what? You're not alone the guardian  Photo editor said the image is possibly distorted by using a wide angle lens and i'm sure that that's true  It may be it was so wide that even the small distance between them was enough to create that kind of strange

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was so funny much in twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you take your smartphone and want to take a selfie of yourself or whatever and the closer you put it  You'll start to notice like your nose would get big. Yeah, you know, and that's just the distortion of the lens  It's the same principle here, but I don't know this looks a little wonky  I'm thinking it was like a i'm thinking he was shooting with like a 16 mil or something like that  This something that's really really wide  and  Went and got it in the post and tried to compress it down. He ended still ended up with this  What's what might have happened in post? You're saying right? So probably still should have shot with like a 35 prime

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah  My favorite part too is built which is the kind of tabloid of germany  Uh ran the picture with a big headline on page on the on the front page saying  Honey we've shrunk the carters

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, it's worth reading the guardian article because they also include a lot of other famous  viral photos

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What scooter ads put in the chat is hilarious too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says the carters what do you say are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  here's where the car is really  And here is here is the uh, here's the  The actual photo before we touch  A lot of people a lot of people really uh didn't you know, this is uh, this is an example of fake news really distorting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're gonna get a pick of the week from you jason is a very talented musician  Uh, and this looks like something you might use in your music

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so, um, i'm i'm talking about this not because it's anything new necessarily. I think this actually came out  Uh, like a year and a half ago. My camera. Oh there it is  Here it is. It's the apollo twin x almost as cool as my nyxie clock  Yeah, I know. It's actually well not quite as cool. I don't need gloves to use it though. So at least there's that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  his heart

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Lord

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But uh, i'm kind of smitten with this right now. I got it. I don't know about about a month ago. It's an audio interface  um, the thing about the apollo twin x  Is that it's it's by a company called universal audio and they make a lot of hardware  but they also make a lot of really high quality audio production plugins and  What you get when you buy this kind of hardware this runs, I think this was 800 bucks  And then they they have you know, some that you can get that are more powerful they have inside of them something called a shark  Processor, which is I mean a processor specifically supports their own plugins  So in order to use any of the plugins that um universal audio has created you need their uh,  Their hardware to do it and so this this allows me  To plug in an instrument, you know either a guitar I can do you know mic inputs on the back and everything  And I can do something called unison, which essentially means that I can take  um, I can take models of real like classic audio hardware like the neve  88rs channel strip for example, like, you know these old like  Hardware outboard gear that it would cost tens of thousands of dollars for me to bring into my studio  Instead universal audio has gone through and they've done modeling of these things to a very precise level  And then they've made it um made it completely off board from the processor in your computer  So that all the processing is happening inside of this device and with no latency  So for example, if I wanted to plug my guitar in here and pretend like i'm plugging directly into that neve channel strip  I get zero latency when I do that and it's all modeled in real time  And it's just so cool to be to feel like i'm pulling up these, you know classic pieces of hardware gear  audio hardware and you know  And I know it's probably not 100 the same as having the actual piece of hardware on my rack  But it's about as close as i'm ever going to get and it really does sound  Incredible and having the lack of latency for performance, you know when you're doing music production  You want no latency?  Ideally and anytime that i've been doing this sort of like plug-in management for writing music  I've always dealt with latent latency and just gotten used to it now. I don't have to and it's like a dream come true  I'm loving it. So  It's called the apollo twin x by universal audio if you make music look for it. It's pretty cool. Very nice

Yeah, I was gonna say this is the mold  The matrix for a line of type so you can't it's hard to get the thing to focus  But you see those two little indentations on top there. Are you calling me a thing now?  Yeah  That's the letter h nine point and then these looks like a this looks like a um  Kind of a early pre-electric pac-man  These little teeth well these teeth are in a key pattern so when the mold would shoot down this would come out of the h  Part of the magazine that would go up and the printer could see on the other side  It says oh, it's an h you can see what the line was going to be the line got all  Created you got molded and then all these went back up on an elevator to the top of the machine  They went around and around and around this thing where when they when they when the teeth  Met the right pattern it would fall back in with the other h's  This was incredibly revolutionary  In the history of all  It was the last it was kind of the last big machine in the gutenberg age  So I just won a cheap auction on ebay to get a box of these. I wanted these for years  Nice. Oh, that's hysterical. So these are these are the matrices. It used to be called a patricks and a matrix  Right. The patricks was the stamp you do it which had the letter in the positive and the matrix was in the negative  It was the female  And so this is a matrix mold so so for the letter h line of types have been around since gutenberg era  No, no, no, it was the last  led hot lead  innovation, oh since  1890s  And until the 1970s
