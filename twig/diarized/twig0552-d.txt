It's array telling me you don't have to tell me twice. We could talk about anything you want  That's all sassy  It's the first time anybody's responded to the show open like that  Most of the time they say you should talk more about Google, but even Google doesn't care nowadays  Let me turn off this array and I meant I missed John Legend that was nice  But now I've got this array in my in my phone  That is Jeff Jarvis professor of journalism at the City University of New York at the townite schools. Great to have you  Stacey Higginbotham on the left. She is of course the host of Stacey on IOT the IOT podcast with Kevin Toffel Stacey on IOT  com for her newsletter and  The three of us make up the show aunt is because I don't want to over  I don't want to stress out the team  So we're gonna just do the three of us for the time being we can bring it back  Once everything settles in and if you watch the show and I know very few of you do most of you listen  But you'll notice it's a little bit of a different set set up. We're changing how we record our show  I gotta talk about Microsoft. I know this is the Windows weekly setup. I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah  Mean I loved hanging out with Mary Jo Foley, so I'm willing to do it again. Yeah, isn't she great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we we do this is how we used to do it in the old days in the cottage  I would sit here and we'd have Skype a source on a big screen behind me and I realized by doing that I can do  The switching so we don't have to bring more engineers in studio  That's one of the few jobs that can't be done work from home  Somebody has to be in here to push the buttons and stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So might as well just be me and for those who were recent to the show in the cottage Leo had  the switcher and the cameras and and the chat and everything there and it was amazing and it's just returning to I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Still do yeah, I don't have a big I used to have a little t-bar and everything  And now it's all virtual on the screen over here to my right  But you'll see me when I'm doing the show occasionally look over here because I'm picking the next shot that kind of thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just do it on a keyboard and a mouse over here. Well, Leo, you are very good at picking her pushing buttons

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am the ultimate button pusher. That's exactly right  so  Boy, there's a lot to talk about  Lots of things happening Google Google stuff. Here's the interesting thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead. Oh  It's like just to live up to the show  About I oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I oh which was initially they said well, we're gonna do it virtually will stream it now  They say we're not even gonna do that

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess the the reason is even to stream it you have to bring people together in a room and  We have a facility where you could actually we could actually do it for them if they  Give you that offer if you did I oh, yeah  Ha  We just we put the speaker in another room and I run the board and where they could sit here if you want to  Sit on my ball. It's it's here for you. So  Said we're set up to do that  But but if you think about it for a conference to do the seminars and all the things  I don't know. I think they could honestly I think they could do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they just what do you think that or was it the fear of no interest? Oh, they'd be interest. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I say I am I'm scheduled to do a virtual talk for a conference on in June and  Figuring out logistics. They're like, hey  You know, do you want to go into a studio to do it?  Do you want to do it from your home and I'm still trying to figure out like this is obviously not the most professional setting to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like an actual talk. Well, what that's the cool thing. We're all getting kind of used to that, aren't we?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they they're like, you know, they want control over the production  So then I would have to personally travel into a studio setting that they have to find

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yes, they need to give up on that. Look if MSNBC and CNN could do it why can't they exactly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody on MSNBC is in there and it's more human. So I just I just love it Twitter  The New York Times had an article in the tech section saying that it was bad  Etiquette for your kids and pets to show up on your conference call awful as I said before we went on  You know a dog showed up on an MSNBC  MSNBC shot with Connie Schultz Sherrod Brown's wife  I thought was great the dog went up to her lap is the way to shut up the dog was wonderful  So your dog should be on your lap  Doing the conference tell them to get human. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think so. I wouldn't want to give a speech with my dog in my lap  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doctor who with the cat was it was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that's that's the Mike Myers version, but you're thinking  It's not doctor who it's James

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ernst Stavros blow filled. Yeah, I can see you doing a blow filled  Thing with the dog. I would like that Stacey. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My dog would bite my hand off after a certain point. She doesn't like that  It's like oh, I do not want to be on your lap. It's unstable. It is interesting though to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  mainstream media which has always been kind of inauthentic and  uncomfortable with authenticity have to deal with this and  Don't we I mean, this is why podcasting why shows like this  Succeeded initially is because suddenly it was people who let their hair down and that you could see them in their normal environment  I just did a segment for good morning America where  Becky Worley my old friend asked me  Okay, what's your advice I said well make your bed  You don't have to dress up the set or anything like that, you know  I don't have to use a green screen, but but you know, make your bed brush your hair

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's the beauty of this. It's authentic. Yeah, plus I get to see what people's homes look like which I love  I'm a you know, it's I'm a voyeur Michael Beschloss  The presidential historian has the best I think it's as must be his home taste in office  What I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was very impressed by Anderson Cooper's house. Of course, he has excellent taste and the money to  He's a Vanderbilt. So it's no surprise at all that his house was gorgeous  You know, he was I think in his library or something. I think this is I don't I think this is maybe the the secret blessing of all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This to say so Stacy, you're not really gonna follow their orders and go into a place. Are you you're gonna you're just gonna hold tight

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're paying here you just gotta do what they say

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They are paying me. I mean, I think they're trying to figure this out in June is far-offs. We'll just see  I mean I do want to give a compelling presentation  I think it's hard to give a compelling presentation just like here  I am trying to talk to you for 40 minutes, which is how long I'm supposed to talk. Do you use slides?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you use any AV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tools I use slides, but I also I'm very big on stage I  You're not that articulate. I go I talk to the audience. I really try to make it's it's I'm very  I'm a speaker who likes to connect with the audience. So so that will be stand up you have a I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could help  We could help and and it's something I think it's so funny to watch  Mainstream media grapple with issues that we solved 15 years ago. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah  Yeah, yeah, well with some of it we've given up on clearly  but I like the idea of it being natural and real and you know, we see Jeff in his library and Stacy in her office and  Me and my Byzantine  doctor no layer

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's like a toy that's old-fashioned toy store or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't which is also really your office right this is my real office. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is where I live  But I don't do that much in here because I don't I don't really have a job  So the desk is clean  On this side if you were to see that side on the other hand is far from clean  It gets shoved over to that side  That's one thing that people can learn is that the like photography TV has hits a frame and you just control  What's in the frame? Oh here comes here comes a visitor a  Visitor from the east  We love seeing people's doggies  She was whining outside, yeah, no, it's fine just like you said Jeff is something where she go on your lap for a minute  Puppy who's a good dog. Oh, who's a good dog? Don't you honestly feel like this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Healing in some ways. Yeah, I think it is. I think you're right. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't want to I  Mean look, this is great tragedy many will die many will sick be sick  It's it's a terrific for the people who are losing their jobs. The economy is suffering  But I also I said this on the last show up. I'm gonna get heat for it  I feel like  It's kind of forcing us to focus on stuff that really matters instead of the triviality  That all of us have been it's almost God's way of saying stop looking at your phones  For one minute just stop think about your neighbor pet your dog. Damn it  Yeah, and and to see all of these, you know, the thing I always hate about network news is intentionally distancing  The whole thing about TV is and that's why they hate it when I did good morning America  She said can you put the microphone down?  I mean, it's like no I'm talking it. Well, I did but it's like come on you guys  Anyway that didn't air because the coronavirus I hear there's something going on so  Little air it'll air in another time. I hope sometime  I  Google finally did get a kovat 19 page up not the one the president was touting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Has anyone see every time I click on it? Oh, I got dog hair in my lipstick gross

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, that might be TMI  I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I  Haven't seen it yet. Every time I click on it. It's load time is way too long. I don't you're not missing anything here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me okay. Let me pull it up. I guess I  Have it on I have it on the wrong computer ever than the computer in front of me  Maybe is this it is a Google Trend page. No, maybe I have the wrong one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't it's the like when I go to my news section  Coronavirus  Kovat 19 get the latest information and it's just I click that button and it's just loading

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's one thing that is happening everywhere. We're talking about this earlier today  Microsoft Azure in Europe is struggling YouTube and many of the streaming  Services have had to cut bandwidth way down for that reason. I mean, it's really a  You know, this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Unanticipated traffic. Yeah, I have data. Would you like it?  Yes. All right. Hold on. I will get it to you. Here we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And here while you're while you're getting it and getting the hair out of your lipstick  Here is this is the Google's Kovat 19 information and resources  This is not the site that President Trump was touting which was the testing the testing site  That site is up. Also, it's from Verily not Google Verily is Google is Alphabet's health  Branch and it's just for Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. It's not a national test site  And it's talking about taking it nationally now, but it's pointless  Because you can't get a test  And you should probably shouldn't get a test unless you are in a hospital

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can all get tests test  Isolate track that is the only strategy is gonna work test isolate track over right now. We're only I say that's all we have  We we didn't invest in the tests. We don't have the mechanisms to track

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Germany the ferro lingeal swabs are made in  Lombardy Italy the masks are made in Wuhan China  It's not just the tests. It's the protective gear you have to use to give the tests  Of course if in a perfect world  Everyone would have a test you could isolate it you could contain it  But we're way beyond that point at this point at this point is, you know, I asked my doctor early on can I get a test?  He's what are you talking? Are you crazy? Basically said, what are you crazy? No, we don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Iceland if you're Iceland then you ideally we would test absolutely everyone and  Then you then you isolate and track of course the people who have it and that's the only way to really contain this and this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is gonna go in ways eventually we come back out again. We're gonna get it again. Eventually. I hope we do have that capability, but  It's more than just that having the tests available and it's a twist for Google or anybody to put up a site saying  Well, here's how you get a test is is silly because you can't there's I I'm gonna be a devil's advocate

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would actually like a test so I know if I'm one of the people who've had it and  Can then hopefully go back out without infecting people. Yes, of course. You want a serum test Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so that's a different test. I know I want a serum test but absent a serum test

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would love enough tests that of course you could get tested on the regular

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But right now because there's a limit such limitations on the stuff  the  Tests are giving being given most appropriately to people who are sick. Yes  And and that's I don't know how that when that's gonna change it. So making a site it would be foolish  To make a site that says well  You could get a test by are you sick? Maybe a site that helps you  Diagnose if you're ill or what or not and there's quite a few in fact this Google page has some of that  We were talking earlier. I got one of those  Smart thermometers are talking about a lot on the news the kinsa health thermometer and  It does it kind of does that it was originally in fact Stacey. You said your school district had that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so I actually talked to the CEO. I did an interview with him back in 2015. He was he was on my podcast  in the whole  They used to give the thermometers the cheaper version. They have two versions right two schools  They did it in Austin with a couple schools and the idea was when parents took the temperature  They could in the app like you're showing they would see like oh, there's a lot of strep throat going around  Here's you know, so you could look at that and say hey a lot of other people have a fever  Here's what it might be based on the reports back from other users. So it was like a crowd source  it was like ways for illness and  The guy actually has a great story he was like it was either Accenture or McKinsey  Consultant, but he ended up going to Africa and he was frustrated because he was part of one of the Clinton  I can't remember if it was malaria or not  Yeah, it was a disease initiative and he realized that there was absolutely no way to track diseases and that's actually why he  Created this so you could get epidemiology  Epidemiological information  Ahead of time so you could actually like remember when Google came out with their flu data and we were all like, yeah  That's useful and then the next year it turned out that it was not actually as accurate  right the temperature and thermometer was actually accurate so  that's why he did this and then  evolved into  Tracking this he does sell or Kinza does sell the data that they're gathering on a wide scale  They sell it in aggregate to advertisers. Oh advertisers. Oh, that's interesting  advertisers based on zip code and so what happens is you can say I want to advertise my  My Clorox wipes I  Snake oil whatever in the zip codes that are having problems right now. So they do do that, but it is anonymous

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That seems okay. Do you is that? Oh absolutely the New York Times did a story a year and a half ago  Getting antsy about it. And of course, you know what I said

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did let me ask you this stop stop  What if think about like companies like Facebook what if I  Looked at this and I said, hmm  I don't want to I want to charge higher insurance rates to people who are more more more sick who are ill or if not  Kinza data, maybe it's a smart scale. What if I want to charge  What if I don't want to advertise jobs to people in these zip codes because I know they're less healthy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So which is about our law, you're right. That's a problem. But the law that you deal with that law

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, and I just I want to bring that like yeah, sure  It sounds totally innocuous when you're like, yeah, I would love to as Clorox to be like, hey  There's this massive wave of disease coming your way  scrub up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, so there's some uses and there would be some commercial uses that would be less than I'm putting you in Bedminster  Is that okay Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where should I put you in it's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm in Basking Ridge. I can't have room for that. I barely have that's fine Bainbridge Island  I'm just gonna put New Jersey and Jay and then you had a problem with that. W.a and NJ  Maybe I'll do that. I'm working on our lower thirds or attractive  Stacy wah, that's the problem. Wah was the problem  Anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Germany is  The Koch Institute, which is not the Cox of coax of America. It's a famous old scientist  So it's basically the CDC of Germany. Yeah, they put out a call to hire five thousand  Containment scouts they call it  This is Germany the land of Dotton schutz and privacy and oh right  Yeah, and and so they're there they're they had ten thousand applicants they're gonna hire them and they're going to  when when they get to the point where they have enough testing and  You've said oh, yeah, I just got it and they say who all did you see in the last?  Well, yeah, he tells everybody we're gonna call everybody that's down them. No, that's way down the road from well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's now in some places in places where they've contained it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's this is where privacy gets in the way too. So so in various offices now, I'll make that anonymous  Some people are known to have tested positive or known to have had the symptoms not here  And what they're doing is they're saying to people we can't tell you who because of privacy and hip and all that  But if you want to get a test you've got to say who you were exposed to that had it  But you don't know because they won't tell you who in the office  you don't know how close your exposure was there's a limit to privacy and  We're reaching it and we're gonna have these debates right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So here's what I would like as part of this debate. I think that yes during a pandemic  We need to have track and trace becomes incredibly important  But yeah, and this is what I would love to see it needs to be of limited duration, right?  And while I acknowledge that this data would be incredibly useful for study later on  I think study of that data should only go to public health agencies and universities and there should be an IRB  component later to using it and  Companies should not get this data and keep it for themselves  So Google may want to use it and there may be a really compelling case because they could do better research because they have more  Money and funding and whatnot, but they shouldn't have it  And to use it you have to like pass stringent. You have to really show  Legitimate research interest I guess would be the way epidemiologists of all sorts are gonna want to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The tracking of how the disease goes. There's a there's one called

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's go back in time, let's talk about typhoid Mary  It's a good thing that typhoid Mary's privacy was not protected right here  This was a woman who was giving she was a cook. She was giving typhus to  People in New York, I think was New York City, right and they call her typhoid Mary because she was patient zero for a typhus  Epidemic it's important to isolate that person and I mean  Does she have a privacy right in that case?  I guess she does for you shouldn't have her name in the newspaper  But public health officials should absolutely know who she is and her employer should know. Yeah  Well, is it I mean, we're all typhoid Mary now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, no most of us we are not  We don't have testing I mean so  Ideally, we'd have testing so we'd all be like, oh, I'm a typhoid Mary

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I let's go to two new things here. So so two questions because I'm in my in my Twitter feed with all these epidemiologists  I'm reading about the data that they want and how they want it and it's fascinating  so  two questions one  I think it's Singapore now has an app  China obviously had apps  Israel is doing this now Israel's doing this. That's right. So in the in the crisis  How comfortable are we with having with being let's say required to have an app?  And you can see the negative side of this is  Who they have the disease but the positive side is oh, they're certified to have the antigens  They took the serum test in there and they're there they have  immunity and they can work  But you're you're gonna want to certify that in some way  What are the laws around that that we need to craft so that we can have?  more freedom as a result of this data and more  Helping for the data but restrict its use

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we need to make sure that this data is I would limit the ways it can be used to discriminate against people  so there are ways like  Being sick. Obviously if you're sick, you should stay home, right?  There are countries that are using that to like  Basically the China like green means you can go anywhere red means you can't right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The newest thing is the app says  Knows who you've had come into contact with

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right and that in saying that you've come I mean in some ways it matters like in your office  Maybe it matters. I mean they're also using

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In Israel they're using it to notice  Groups a lot of movement out of the house that they're using it to police work from home  And they're also looking for larger groups  You can see the value of this from a public health point of view should we?  The larger question is should individual liberties be put on hold during a health crisis

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They can be temporarily so I think temporarily and I'm not talking like sunset after I'm talking about a very narrowly defined order  That gets reauthorized every 30 days  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like the Patriot Act where we react right 9-eleven by rescinding rights forever in perpetuity  Well, right it does it does expire but it just keeps getting renewed a brief  So a quick sunset the difference there is you could reasonably say well, there's still a terrorist threat

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not I'm not I'm not done. No, Stacy's still going  Sorry, but yes  Right before our eyes exactly  So you have to define the steps that would say hey  This is in effect as long as X percentage of population is infected or until  vaccines or until like pick your  AB&C clauses there you would also have to say that that data that is collected through these apps  Goes into a lockbox that can only be accessed by people with the legitimate research interest  Because certain terms of handling right then secure handling and  That's what I would say and if you don't meet those kids great  You don't get access to this data  so if the police are like and I would even stipulate that  Like maybe crimes are happening in this time and maybe five months now from now the police are like hey  Remember that rash of pandemic looting's let's go see who those people were this could not be used for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with that. All right. Here's another question. Let me let me know up and up again  What if the government gave absolutely everyone in the country a  biometric bracelet and in a time like this required them to wear it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the good news is you don't have to because we all have smartphones, but okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In Singapore, I believe it may be Singapore  It may be Israel if you don't have your phone with you it tells on you  So I think you could probably put it on your phone and have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tattle on your behalf but biometric that would also check your temperature. I'm wearing your own to level

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the aura ring. This was a sponsor for a long time. This measure is a sponsor long enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could get one. Yeah, they're awesome and it doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right now, did you know that I am in the study with UCSF?  Every day I get from aura a questionnaire to answer for the UCSF  but besides measuring heart, you know the obvious stuff heart rate and exercise and stuff it measures temperature and  It gives me so I I am taking my temperature just because I want an early warning sign  But it will tell me is if I look at my aura I could show you on my aura app  It will show my my temperature going up or going down and that's also part of overall readiness  So I can look at my readiness and I could see my body temperature and if it starts and I by the way  I was wearing this I got sick  I think last year and you can see as as the illness progresses your temperature going up as your body  Corrects right now. It's a pretty it's holding pretty steady  So this doesn't this shows not your absolute temperature, but the change in body temperature day by day, which is oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. So this is a whole I'm now wearing my oximeter every night to sleep  Really? Is that for the a tip or well, no, well, it's for it's for  What do you call it? Oh sleep sleep apnea. Yeah, so I've been diagnosed, but I don't believe the diagnosis  fully and I'm trying to trying to judge what it is and  But it's fascinating to watch the o2 and  And see what the Stacy you've got more data on this. I can't I can't find any good resource online  It says what normal or expected is on this you talked about this before oh, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah for your oxygen  Below like oh, oh well that it's they're looking at variations is what they're doing  They're looking at it going down my temperature. They want to 92  92 is usually when they start going. Oh  That's not enough. I can send you off back. I've got a sleep study results and I can share

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really interesting. Cove it hit it at an interesting technological  Moments where we have we have all these biometric devices  We we have been working from home. We have the capability we have  Teams and Skype and and and slack and it's really and we and thank goodness  We have Netflix and Amazon Prime too. It's really an interesting moment in time  And I think it's very clear  That we've got a lot to think about and that's kind of I think this show is ending up talking a lot about that  I feel like that we have the opportunity  You know  Tests are nice, but what but if you knew fever if you know temperatures, you know, we wouldn't know what the disease is  But you'd see in this map does show  abnormal or a typical  Temperature increases so if I click the a typical button on this you can see there's some hot spots here  Like Weld County Colorado and much of Florida Florida is unbelievable and look where it is. It's on the beach  Right. Well, that's not much of a surprise right after spring break  You can also look at Louisiana and you could see that you know, there's gonna everybody's worried there's gonna be problems there. Why Colorado?  Denver, I don't know. I  Don't know  So but that's what's interesting. Maybe it's just a high see that's what's interesting is this is data that isn't  Related to testing or even hospital. This is this is you know, you could see

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is Kinza. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean it's any fevers. So that's right normal flu  COVID

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Strip, right, but they also they know what's typical because they've been doing this for some time and they know what's typical  so, you know  Yeah, we are having a particularly bad flu season. So that's somewhat of the issue  But I was the Brown in California and Washington. It's good. It's normal. It's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and so they know they're always feverish in the West Coast

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's actually  Less illness in in our county and that to me I feel like this is because in California we sheltered in place early  But I don't know. I mean, I'm not a scientist. So I you know, I don't know what how you interpret it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think we go back to it for New York versus New Jersey. That was interesting  You can you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is where not having a good geography there's Queens which is a hot spot and of course Manhattan  Here's Hudson County, New Jersey  Bergen County, but these are all green counties been our hot spot. Yeah, and so that's Manhattan and so you could see  Manhattan is  I'm in Somerset County. Can you go west a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Essex less more now down down  No, right there. So we're going to go west a little bit  No, no right there Somerset so it's a hot spot. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The illness trend decreased by four point four three percent so you're high but it's  Decreased to be worse used to be worse. I  Think what you're seeing a little bit in this is this shelter-in-place stuff working, right? Oh, yeah. Oh, absolutely  I don't know. I mean look I I'll leave it to  Somebody with better brains than me to interpret it, but I think what's interesting is that this exists  It's been around for some years

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What if it is being driven by a bunch of people who are worried about Kovac coming in and taking their temperature when they feel bad?  That's fine  because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because right well, that's why you need to have lots of them  You have to have lots of them, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You also need we need laws that say you can't get fired because your temperature was high you can't lose your insurance because your temperature  Was high we've got to protect people in those ways, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the challenge with that is people will continue to find new ways to infer and make insights from this data  So do you write laws that try to get ahead of each one of those actions before or after they start like doing the  database redlining for lack of a better term or do you  create  guardrails around how the data can be used in the first place, I think I think Stacy you build with principles

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rather than trying to anticipate every possible use of the data or hold it  You say there are principles and the principles are that you know, I think that sickness  should be  Freedom of keeping your job and not losing your insurance from illness should just be a principle and wherever the threat comes from  Then you're you're in better position because you set that principle as matter of law

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, I would also  I wrote about this  Last week in I'm gonna ask you to highlight it because it ties to what we're talking about  And this is if you go to my site Leo  It's and now is the time to build a connected medical device framework  The reason is because some people I really respect they wrote an article in nature  And in that article they talk about creating a five level framework for remote monitoring  There there's there's Kevin ready about Kinza. Yeah, that's great. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Agree with you a very good a hundred percent. I think that that is this is the opportunity  Right now I'm subscribing already. It's okay. I subscribe drop down

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know Andrew makes me keep it  Scroll down just a little bit because part of this is they have a connected sensor facts

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What so this would be something like a nutrition level this would be something you would see on on your device to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How it is and they're calling for so they're calling for five things. So  Validation so are there peer-reviewed papers and clinical trials for each device saying hey  They're measuring the right thing to like diagnose disease  The next level of the framework is security practices is this device secure the next is data rights and government  So who gets your data is that clear to people blah blah blah the final two usability and utility  This is important for like can like somebody who's not technically savvy even use this right?  Does your doctor need to be doing you know support calls and then price?  How does it price is really fun because depending on who pays for it the value really can  Can go either way right so you might have insurance companies interests ahead of a consumers interest in this case  But the point is like show people exactly what this looks like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From an article in nature is this being proposed

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so this is  the FDA on Friday basically said that  They're going to allow remote monitoring, but it has none of this in none of these  Yeah, and so it's a proposal by a group of people some of whom have worked for the FDA  Some of who are very good security experts very well respected. So this is a proposal  The article is so long you guys I know my article is long, but the nature article is incredibly long, but it's really  Excellent and it's how we should be thinking about this  So I encourage people to weigh in on this because I think it's  It's crucial. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There it is. Yeah, I would really love to see this in fact this makes so much sense  I feel like it's never gonna happen, but it's just so obvious right. It's such a great idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's not just a great idea  It's really necessary for us to build trust in this kind of system because you have a lot of people you're asking them to give  data that is  Deeply personal I mean yeah Jeff may have gone on the air talking about a fib  But if he didn't want to it's not like right he'd feel comfortable with that. It is kind of labels on food

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so much  Makes perfect sense to have it on medical devices  You know connected medical devices, especially

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I also read up from last week my Twitter list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, which by the way Twitter list I recommended on the radio show  I said everybody should go to Twitter comm slash Jeff Jarvis and yeah and subscribe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know through a bad email, you know through the UI so it's now up to more than 500 experts  and  I'm finding it absolutely invaluable the other neat thing that happened in the last week is Twitter came to me and asked for help in  Getting scientists verified. Oh  And so I've helped so far about a hundred of them  And  They're doing more and and because them but and of course some dorks have come to me and people out there don't do this  Hey, can you get me verified too? No, are you a scientist risking your life from doctors?  smart  I got people like I write about COVID

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  artists the worst example of this was a medium piece by a guy said well, I  Grow I my job is a viral growth hacking you saw this  Viral growth hacking so I know a little bit about how viruses propagate. So I'd like to spout off about COVID

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And medium took that down did they good they took it down as I wrote about this. I have a post about about expertise  Time for experts. That was the ultimate and just I have a quoted. I have that full quote in that post. Okay, it's  If you go to medium it's there that's right, we don't have somebody else to look this stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could do it man. I'm doing it. I actually you don't know this but I actually do do it  That's why I'm sitting in front of that big computer  Our TD does it I usually am pulling up this stuff as we go. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so yeah was a ridiculous quote from the guy and we said we'll find it real quickly  And and and and people went berserk but they didn't look at berserk about the medium piece  Medium took it down the New York Times had a piece by a guy named Davis who was saying oh, it's not that bad  Contrarian piece will be okay different methods that I know which even the president is now quoting and  The experts in my feed with berserk about it. Oh, that's why you have that feed. Yeah, cuz this guy  Where which which article that which article should be should just be if you go to medium slash Jeff Jarvis  I'm not a paying member of medium. No, it shouldn't be it shouldn't be  Hold on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe if I follow you so the experts I see it here it is time for experts. That's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so if you scroll down, there's a block quote  with that quoted  The I can also look at the facts here too, but the other one does people here I recommend  Oh geez

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Screw you have  I refuse to pay five bucks for medium. I'm sorry. I just won't do it  I  Pay a lot more for Bloomberg and I play a lot more for other things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I just won't I can't bring myself to pay for I just put the friendly. Oh, no, it's not that's the wrong one  Hold on. Don't worry about it. All right, I got it up so I can read it. Um, that was the point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you could read it that was the point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you're always faster than I am  So this is this is what the growth hack guys  I'm quite experienced at understanding virality how things grow and data in my vocation  I'm most known for popularizing the quote growth hacking movement in Silicon Valley that specializes in driving rapid and viral  adoption of technology products  That's when I stayed at is data  No, it's not here isn't treatment but numbers  You don't need a special degree to understand what the data says it doesn't say numbers are universal  Eat me  This guy was just awful medium took it down good  So meanwhile, the Times has one that has similar contrarian things and yeah, he used to be associated with Yale  But he's a sugar shill and he's a member of the advisory board for the California walnut board  Is he saying that more walnuts the New York Times chose to give this major thing which now the president and others are quoting  And so Greg guns Elvis who's a brilliant guy at Yale who's really at Yale  Consolidated  GONSALVES look up his Twitter  He just went properly Berserk on this and then on Brett Stevens who quoted the same thing and then on Tom Friedman who quoted  the two of them and  You have what they call armchair epidemiology epidemiologists. That's right Stacey. It's a hard word to say you stumbled before  Who just think it's numbers I can look at these numbers too and  Epidemiologists are just bloody brilliant and they they have experience that matters and we don't listen to people like me people  Listen to the scientists listen to the experts doctors  virologists  People who know what they're talking about journalists don't we find experts? Yeah find the people who matter and and and  We've gotten out there now. They're talking directly to the public on on the web. It's a wonderful thing  so one so one thing that this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It shows is that this is this is water cooler conversation and  We've always had this humans have always done this, you know  I talked to my buddy Joe and he says and we and we look we cut it's kind of like gossip  It's and it's how we deal with anxiety. It's how we look for information and avoid  We've always done this but now we have these tools that can make water cooler conversation  Give it more weight because it's published online and then  Unfortunately, we have a government where they embrace this they also like us share water cooler conversation  we expect them to have a higher standard, but they don't and  But I think is a natural it's human. I mean we do it to some extent we all oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but now you can call on the experts now  I can I can go on my list now and I can ask them a question  Can you explain that to me and they're busy trying to save lives and everything?  In their way, but they will take a moment to make sure they want people to get this right, right?  The experts are there and they're easy to find. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you sign up for Jeff's list and sign up for that was the whole point of that  You need this thing that kind of floats down  Andrew could help you and just says sign up for my list

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All my posts all my posts are also on buzz machine good so I put them over there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have to pay five dollars to read buzz machine.com buzz machine buzz machine.com. Thank you. I believe it's in your lower

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, oh so so the other day I went off my walk, which I'm trying to do every day now  I didn't today cuz I had too many damn calls  But I went for a walk and I'm walking along and there's a guy looks about my age who goes zooming by on a electric scooter  And then he comes back and he says are you Jeff Travis and  I said, yeah, and of course, he's a fan nice of you Leo of the shows  So George who works at audible came back by we had a nice little chat six feet apart. Oh, that's great our part  But it's a man, you know, we've lived a half mile from each other for  God knows how many years all the time I've been on the show and we didn't know it until he came by because we're opened up  So this is what you were saying before there are things we should take advantage of in this weird time  I should also steer you to a guy. I've known for years Vince Rassanella who is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Virologist and actually hosts a really good podcast that is very timely right now this week in  Virology he named it kind of and maybe even looks a little bit like the twig  Well, that's okay Vincent. I know each other. He is Jason. Yeah  Come on Vince, no, it's great and it's a really useful  So I don't know how well known this is I think a lot of twit fans know about it because you know, it kind of  Ran in parallel to a twit for a long time. But if that's all they're talking about. I'm actually and I bet you Stacy you are too  fascinated now by viruses  The viruses are very interesting the viruses are very interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Little beasties aren't they they are yeah, that's one of the reasons why I wanted to be a genetic engineer. I  Love I never knew what organisms. Oh, yeah. Oh man

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Biology was my first love. There is a great video which  Steve Gibson recommended it's a it must be German because it's a it's a YouTube video  that translates to nutshell and  I highly recommend it on the coronavirus and its mechanism and it's pretty easy to understand  Let me let me pull it up for you. I have it on my I have a whole Vince Rosenthal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I already I already had listen. Yeah, he's there. He's there. He's yeah, he's he's very good on the list

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I have a whole page. This is my my kovat 19 pages  Including our temperatures my journal of the plague year  Links and so forth, but here's this video  Oh  Yeah, I think you would I think you would like this. It's a check it out. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's German  Here, let me go to the YouTube page because I can see his you would you would recognize this word Jeff. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Kurtz Kurtz gesagt in a nice maybe a former student of mine. This looks like  This looks like the style of a former student of mine. No kidding. It's beautiful. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bacteriophages  Yes. Yeah, and he talks about you know, one of the reasons that coronavirus is so  Susceptible to soap and waters is so it is like I think all viruses it has a lipid shell a fat shell  And so that of course, as you know, that's what soap does is it breaks down fat  And so yeah, this is a really cute little video  I think suitable for the whole family because it's so colorful, but it's as far as I can tell very accurate scientifically and it  It's a really well done. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You see my favorite hand-washing video the black goo on the on the on the gloves. Yeah, isn't that good? Yeah, that's the best

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  So but but yeah, I've gotten very interested in this whole thing. And of course, there is some some speculation  Because what a virus does is it injects its RNA into a host cell?  It gets and tricks the host cell into transcribing it and making more of the virus  Thinking it's reproducing itself  There's some evidence that these that this this viral RNA has something to do with our own evolution that that without it  We might not have evolved or it's certainly it's affected our own DNA  so I think that's kind of there's it's a it's a more symbiotic relationship than one would think and  I find it fascinating. Yeah  Not all viruses have lipid membranes. Okay. Thank you and they call it  I didn't know this the corona virus the corona is the little spikes on the outside of the virus  That's why it flues a corona virus and that's how it takes the spike  It goes into the cell and says here have some RNA  That's my second crown. That's my it's a crown. It's a crown with spikes  All right back to back to Google  According to dr. Morbius your DNA is mostly endogenous retroviruses. So thank you very much  I  Amazons interesting what Amazon's up to actually there's this is that larger story which is  And I'm you know how I like to bring up philosophical  topics on this show  Some have said that the tech industry is  taking advantage of this and  Of course, we know the DOJ is trying to take advantage of it as well  That  This is an opportunity for the tech industry to become even more powerful. I think it was an editorial in the New York Times

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  even more powerful Amazon and Applebaum in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Atlantic I think the Atlantic. Okay. Yeah, it could be Atlantic's been doing some really good stuff on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, do you pay for them? I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they're put all their co-vids I praised them even though they saw my outside the paywall  All their co-vids stuff outside the paywall and that made me decide to subscribe to yeah, a lot of people are doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the Atlantic is spectacular. Yeah, Julia. Carrie Wong. It's in the Guardian  Which also is putting its  All its co-vid stuff. Well, it doesn't have a paywall  How the corona virus has created a governance vacuum the tech giant Amazon is quickly filling. It's calling up. I love this lead  It's calling up a hundred thousand troops extending grants to small businesses  Prioritizing essential goods and cracking down on profiteers. No, not the US federal government Amazon  It's doing the things that a government might do  And it's not just Amazon Walmart's hiring a hundred fifty thousand new workers  Which what she says is  It's less and less far-fetched to imagine the everything store becoming the only store

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is this is something I've been thinking about because I don't know about you guys but with Amazon having delivery issues  I just switched to target to buy some things that I needed. I'm not getting two-day shipping, but I am getting my stuff  Let's see. Yeah, Amazon's prioritizing only essential

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you want to get for instance, we couldn't order any cameras for hosts or headsets because they won't come till next month

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but I ordered something on target that will get to me on the 30th  So that's four or five days from now which feels totally reasonable  Yeah, not so bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm picking different retailers. So the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For a long time. It's true. My gut response was oh, I need this. Let's go get it on Amazon. And now I'm like, oh I need this  Let's go find it on another show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you worried that this will just increase the dominance of the tech giants and they will just take advantage of this or  I for one welcome my new boards and masters. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think they're being smart. I think there's a couple things here

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're being smart to be like, oh, it's gonna be a lot harder to hate us after we donate all our masks  But I do think that they're in a position to help  They're also in a position to profit from this and I think smart business dictates that you would take these opportunities as does  Compassion and I do think the tech industry likes to consider itself  Compassionate in ways that I don't think  Exxon Mobil deludes itself into thinking it is  so and they're losing money to I mean, so so there's a story in the rundown that they're gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lose it on the right word 44 billion in ad revenue. That's just versus the growth they were gonna have  That's just versus the growth they were gonna have  But they're but they're yeah, well they're losing the opportunity cost they're losing an opportunity at the same time Facebook is  Up and for all those who think I don't Facebook  Well, look where you need them now folks the traffic there is up 50%  Yeah, they people want to stay in touch just as this is what this is for and it's they're keeping their nose above water  This is a fine and good thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter but like Stacey in this respect, I don't use Facebook, but I'm finding many other ways  So it isn't it doesn't necessarily create a dominant force just like you using target instead of Amazon  I'm using FaceTime or  Or what's well, what's absolutely?  Still Facebook, but no there are plenty of other options and I don't use any of the Facebook tools and I don't feel less any less

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Connected although can I tell you the like probably a week ago?  Andrea and I were hiking and I was like dang it everyone should probably get a portal and then the BuzzFeed story about effort  Yep, you should get a portal and the fact that they're sold out the Facebook video portal. Yes, Leo  You could make bank getting rid of your poor. Where's my portal? I have two of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I let Burke take them apart, which means they're probably not  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the idea like when it came out  I did think the portal has some really interesting hardware like that using the AI to follow people automatically is really compelling  Yeah, but Google Duo now does that by the way, right?  but so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I do I do with my daughter because she's on Android. I FaceTime with my mom because she's on an iPhone  I don't feel like I need a portal you know my father who's 94

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who basically doesn't use a computer at all would never use a smartphone?  What's the best way to get them send him a?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google display or a Google display. Yeah, that's nest home hub max would be fine, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Either one of those and can I set it up here for him entirely beforehand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, cuz it's got to have a Wi-Fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I know his Wi-Fi password. No, it won't do it unless you're on that network you have  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't change my Wi-Fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Get right I did this actually to get into my Tesla once it didn't work  theoretically it could have  Change your SS ID on your phone to his home SS ID  Right and then change the password on your phone. Use your phone as a hot spot set it up as

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right  And it would just plug yeah plug in join his network  You'd have to hate have to have a gmail account  So you'll have to set up a gmail account for him, but then you call him via his gmail account same thing with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The caveat I will give you is do that the last step because I know that if I have left my Google thing  Unplugged from a Wi-Fi network for a long time and that was like two weeks  I think it was it did want me to reset it up  But I don't know how long that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  PS chops says it goes by MAC address. I don't think you're right PS chops because I routinely  Change routers. I'm trying different brands of of routers  I always give them the same name which is why my Orbi is now named plume because because it's always plume and  Even though it's not a physical plume and it doesn't it everything says. Oh, yeah  We're on the same Wi-Fi as long as the SS ID and password are the same  I don't think it's looking at MAC address. I know none of my dress  We did that's the test that did so didn't work. Okay, so it didn't work  My echo all my echo devices in my Google home devices will just  Kindly join them the network regardless of what actual device

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry my tune oven just got an update that I asked for I don't think they did it because I asked for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My thermomex would if I would turn it on but I'm too scared to use it so  I keep thinking. Oh, this is a perfect time. I'm stuck at home. I should watch all those videos  Let's take a break  Before Stacey hits me, you know, you can't hit me in this office. Actually, you're a little closer. You probably could  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was like I could sneeze on you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm more with Stacey and Jeff and just a bit but our first day word from our sponsor our show today brought to you by  Worldwide technology. It was actually  Worldwide technology has a soft spot in my heart. It was the last time I got on an airplane for some time  We flew out to st. Louis a couple of weeks ago to see their advanced technology center. I was blown away  So many people know WWT. It's an enterprise  You know consultant supplier for enterprise hardware and software and has been around for more than a decade  Lot of customers have been with them ever since the beginning because they're just fantastic  But over the last few years they have put together something that is like no other  Testing and research center in the world their advanced technology center. They started at 10 years ago  half a billion dollars in equipment  hundreds of OEMs and key partners ranging from the big guys the high-tech heavyweights like Cisco and VMware  to AI disruptors like Nvidia  They have some amazing stuff from Nvidia in there. It's really really cool. They're deep learning workshop  Well, I'll get to that in a second. So  WWT trusted partner been with you over the years  They set the atc up initially so that their engineers could spin up proofs of concept or pilot projects for customers  This atc is where there's and I met a bunch of engineers  In fact, a number of people came up to me said leo i'm doing this because of you  I used to watch you on the screensavers or whatever and I just I feel like I was at home  It was really really cool. We took a tour of the atc  They what's really cool about it?  Is they have all this gear and of course their engineers use it but you can too  You can too as a WWT customer they have on-demand and schedule labs or workshops  Like this Nvidia deep learning workshop hundreds of labs. In fact representing the latest in architectural solutions  To accelerate customers on ai and their machine learning journey a whole lot more  You can learn about these products before you launch  You could try before you buy if you're getting a system you can integrate it into your existing system to see how it works  Uh, you they have more than just these labs. They have  Articles and case studies you can find it all at wwt.com  Twit all the tools you need  To make a difference in today's very fast-paced enterprise  world  Lab as a service is something they started this past summer  It's a dedicated lab space within the atc where you can perform your own programmatic testing on anything in that vast ecosystem  That half billion dollar ecosystem and because it's virtual you don't have to go to st. Louis nowadays. That's probably okay  You don't want to get on an airplane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be yeah, they get they get the carpenter build a little box  For the nest hub max  I do that with my mom  What I like to do is uh, she likes to be in the kitchen while i'm cooking  So i'll i'll set up the uh, I use the echo show. She has an echo show  And she's like just sitting there and I could talk to her and i'm stirring this stuff and it's really fun  Actually, that's who I should do the thermo mix with  She'd be fascinated by that. She introduced me to the queasy night 25 years ago, or you could do it with stacy  I could do it with stacy  She would just she would say out of my way to steal it from you. She'd say out of my way. Let me at it  All right moving right along let's see that we kind of drifted

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We drifted really we started with i.o and then we we went we drifted

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  um  amazon prime video  Netflix and a lot of others. Oh, I had data for you. Yes data

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me but now I have data for you  um, so  this is  like come to me data, um, so this is from the  Frankfurt the frankfurt's internet exchange is the largest internet exchange out there. We were talking about how

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  azure microsoft azure is struggling under the load in europe. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so since the outbreak of the covet 19 virus they have seen a 100 percent increase in  Video conferencing traffic. So that is just video conferencing traffic  They are also seeing video conferencing providers take more ports in their exchange. So boosting capacity  Overall average data traffic has increased by about 10 percent people are online more and longer  uh cloud fair cloud flare has reported a  20 to 40 percent increase in internet traffic  For the us when I talked to comcast last week, they were doing okay  They were like we build for peak now. We're seeing peak for longer times, but we're still it's still okay  Um, I know that I read a story in wired that quoted dane jasper talking about adding capacity, but he's our guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's the ceo of sonic net our uh, our internet service provider. Love dane

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what's happening is a lot of in most isps they have  capacity upgrade plans already so what's happening is  Usually they anticipate it being you know  They do it when they hit a certain percentage of capacity somewhere between 60 and 70 percent usually what happens is they're reaching those capacities  More frequently and upgrading but they still it's not it's not like a scramble. They just implement the plan again  So it's going to cost them more but it's not like  They're running out of internet if that makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's it's so weird to think of it  But of course like everything at some point you run out of internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean at some point they will run out of servers. We have I mean if you look at the places where we're going to see  Where there's theoretical slowdowns you have the subsea cables right now  Like x percentage of many subsea cables are dark

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know telegeography is a lot of dark fiber out there. We could in other words we have room to expand

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so you would add what you would add is like, um, god, what are those things wave wavelength?  Uh, there's oh, I cannot think of the name of the equipment that you put at the each end of your subsea cable to add  More capacity on those actual fibers that are dark  You're literally lighting up that cable  Um, you add capacity by adding servers  In the big internet exchanges, for example, you can add servers  At your central office so you can add it kind of locally  um, so there's still  There's still capacity you'll see like for residential broadband  You'll see your engineers from your isps if it's cable what they're going to do is something called splitting the node  that is where they go out to your premise and they'll  Basically cut in half the number of households that are served by each  note

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, no, no, that's good. They have enough bandwidth though, right? Oh, all right. I see  So what they're doing is I know sorry cut my bandwidth in half. What? Yeah, jeez

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they cut the number of houses on your node in half  So half as many people are using the same capacity in that case. That's what that's what they they split the node

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's how they do it. Oh, that's interesting. And then they bring in more to the head end  for the other half

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they they bring they bring another piece of equipment out  Right to serve those other homes. So  There's these big cabinets and i'm sure you've seen them  um around your neighborhoods and the telecom cabinets or the cable cabinets cable cabinets are usually those uh,  Boxes that are stuck in the ground  and so that's where this  This splitting the node in the cable case is taking place and in the telecom cabinets  Is it your d slam?  Your d slam, I believe it is your d slam. I was like I was like it's been a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love the d slam. That's all about the d slam

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's where they're  That's where they're they're basically adding capacity. They usually slot in new cards and then they hook them up  I I don't want to get into like because  Depending on your your network architecture, it's a little bit different but and i'm not a super expert  I'm obviously not somebody out there at the cabinet, although I do bug them when I see them  I'm like, can I look inside and see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you doing right there? What's that? What you doing? I do that too. It's so funny. The cable guy hates me  I do exactly what do you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for a while  Tye water actually knew who I was and they would like either decide to talk or not talk to me depending on how they felt

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's hysterical  Oh, that's oops. I didn't mean to press that button. I turned you blue  Oh like a smurf. I turned you blue. I didn't yeah you want to be blue again?  Oh, not not that blue not that smurfy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, so yeah, I don't understand about this is that turns you all blue

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm clicking things for just don't mind me. Don't mind me little knowledge dangerous thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, um, but we all use the internet like crazy at work. Isn't isn't isn't there a  Concomitant decrease in use  Um and and companies make all kinds of huge use. I don't understand why there's problems throughout europe  Is it just?  Nighttime in netflix. What is it? Well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean there's there's a couple things so schools for example being online and taking your in-person meetings  Into the virtual art are different, right? We're all making more video calls. There's people at home

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think one thing offices do is everybody goes home and then they all are running hangouts or something  24 hours. Well 12 hours a day so everybody can be together. There's a lot more use, right?  and that's why netflix and amazon prime and uh,  YouTube are cutting the bandwidth that they're using  Uh on their streams in europe. I don't know why europe is so  Why aren't we more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I I wondered about that. I'm guessing  There's a couple things europe doesn't have a lot of cable operators so they don't have ms as many mso's they also have  In many places their fiber does not extend as far  So they've got like fiber to the uh node as opposed to fiber to the premise and when you're dealing with dsl and copper  Um, it's very hard to upgrade  copper there's there's big limitations on that and we're not going to get into that science, but  So I think that might be an issue  The other thing I was going to say is your work networks and your residential networks are different  so  think about  When you're provisioning a network if you know, there's a multi thousand employee office space  You're provisioning way more capacity for that  Network and you can't because there's still physical infrastructure that it has to go over  So like the nodes I was talking about the actual copper wires or fiber  You can't trans it's not a transferable  The bits are not transferable. I guess that capacity right? Right. Right. It's a residential or a so it may cause

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  localized problems. It's not it's not like it's a loss of all  Capacity in europe and I don't know what's happening. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then there's upload and download speeds. So that's the other thing with video  Most most residential connections are not synced like they're asynchronous  They're asynchronous asynchronous. Is that what the word i'm looking for there? You've got  You know 300 megabits download, but you only have asymmetric. Yeah asymmetric. Thank you  It's like what is the word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're right. I've used it before. Yeah asymmetric

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so when you're doing things like video you actually need a much more symmetrical connection  So you've got oh, that's a good point limited upload. That's right. Yeah, because it's all about the upload  So so those are I don't specifically know what europe's issues all are because I haven't I haven't covered broadband in europe really much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also had an interesting conversation with a with a german yelling at me on twitter  Because I I thought when when maracle announced her changes she limited  No, no meetings of more than two people. I thought oh wow good  Turns out that was in outside  You can still go to work. You still go to the store. Wait a minute. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Outside but inside it's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Inside well, you should exactly wrong. They're not but you still go to work  You still go to stores exactly wrong. I was I was making fun of it and I said come on  It's ridiculous and the german you don't understand. I know germany better than you do jeff. Well, of course you do  You're german. I'm not  um  And and we just don't have the computers at home and we don't have the mechanisms  Be able to work at home. That makes sense the way you americans

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's been a struggle working from home schooling from home in the states  But maybe not as much as it would be in other countries. That's interesting  Yeah  Hey, watch me do something really fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh in europe has bad wi-fi. That was the other thing. Oh, because their buildings that's kind of a blanket statement  Sorry, their buildings are older and have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't screen, you know, i've been doing it this way for so long  Yeah, okay. They set up a bunch of macros for me years ago in the keys. So I don't even know  How to do it on a board?  No, actually the board's easier because there's buttons and stuff and I could  This way i'm having i'm having to click stuff with the mouse this alarm, but let's get to the  change log  And we start with pigweed  Now I have to say this change log is put together by karsten, so let's learn together. It's an open source collection  Of embedded targeted libraries or as we like to call them says google  modules  faster developer development for 32 bit micro  Controllers the source codes at pigweed dot google source dot com  pigweed, uh  Will I guess if you're I don't?  I don't know. Maybe it's for raspberry pi, uh, or

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just say it's for the internet of things and then you can punt there you go. It's iot. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't you call? What is it?  It's iot, of course, it's pigweed  Yay  pigweed passed  Uh new google podcasts, uh redesign on the android and it's actually what happened is they put it out for ios  And they had to make a feature parody on android. So now you can finally download auto download new shows get new episode alerts  It's very clean. It's very nice  If you use google podcasts, I think you will be  Very happy google podcasts updated and I immediately put it on my iphone and it's it's really quite nice  I'll show you you know, it was going to be my pick of the week, but i'll show you a little bit later  um if you use android go  Then you might be interested in the new google camera go which runs on android 10 go edition  So if you have a uh, uh inexpensive smartphone  Hmd is the company that's manufacturing nokas these days. They announced a nokia 8.3 5.3 and 1.3  The 8.3 and 5.3 are regular android 10  But uh 1.3 is running go edition and they have updated  The go camera go the whole point of go is it's designed for less expensive handsets that may not have as much oomph  For instance, the nokia 1.3 is running the snapdragon  And uh, but you can still do things like portrait mode, which is which is pretty cool  So if you have an android go device  Take a look at the new android  go camera  Google is removing kody from search results  That's a that's a feature takeaway  Cody and vlc both removed from google search

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Search

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Following a copyright complaint from a turkish pay tv star service digi turk  They used a dmc to a take down take down and removed urls from google search  distributing sports content  The download page for kody which is an open source media player. Yes  Admittedly is sometimes used for pirated content, but not always  um  Searching for kody in google will still show the links to the official site, but it actually blocks the download  That's weird that a turkish company could do that  worldwide worldwide that's  A little little disappointing google  Vlc was on the list google flagged those urls is incorrect. And so they are still in the search results  It's not clear if this digit this uh, this turkish  Company targeted them intentionally  Because in the past the group has accidentally included one of its own urls in the takedown in fact, they've done that twice  Okay kody should be back a vlc is back kody should be back google photos has added  uh text selection prompts on mobile and  Upload origin information on the web. What the hell does that mean?  I don't know  So you can now  Oh, this is actually good. So in the past a lot of these texts on on these screens weren't you couldn't select them  But now you can which means you can have lens you can use google lens to search it. That's good. So  That's actually a huge a huge deal  Copy text from image will appear when google detects relevant content  So there there it is you can see in this image on the left you press copy text from context from the image  It'll copy it and let you do a lens search in it. So essentially giving lens access to more  content  That's a minor minor update in photos, but still a good one  We uh another covet delay chrome and chrome os. I mentioned this earlier are going to skip version 82  Skip or delay  There will not be  version 82  They're gonna go right to 83. I guess  They're gonna ban it makes no sense. Well  Yeah  Or they're 82

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're gonna call x except whatever the room whatever the roman numeral is for 80 83

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there was a canary version of 82 that won't be a um l x x x i i

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like it  So here's what google's gonna do we will abandon current m82 branches which are in dev  Remove in for support and stop testing merges to the branches will not push any new m82 releases to dev  We will stop stabilization for beta. We will move dev channel to m83 asap  We will keep beta channel on m81  Skip m82 when m83 is ready to be promoted. That's what you'll get on beta and then eventually that'll make its way  to release  I  Guess this is because of covid

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what they said originally was they were gonna they were into this because of covid  Yeah, because because I think people not be in the office and security and stuff is what they said at the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so bug bug fixes security fixes other updates to chrome and chrome os  Are going to be delayed and in fact don't look for 82. It'll go right to 83  I  Don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing  But it is in the changelog googles ai helps robots navigate around humans in offices

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We said our iRobot  our Roomba  Robotic vacuum cleaner to work in the middle of the night, which as it turned out was a bad idea  We'd go off at 2 in the morning and then it would invariably there. It just turned out. There was one  Sideboard that was just high enough for it to get the lip under  So the camera got under it, but the rest of it couldn't and so it would go boom  And I would wake up every night the first time I haven't scared me hearing boom  Thank God I was what the hell is good somebody trying to get in and then I'd find the little Roomba  Little room, but trying to jam itself under the so hard. It's trying so hard  So I picked up the little room by I said no no little Roomba put it back on its charger and turned it off  next morning next night  Okay to a.m. Boom. Boom. Boom. I told you this story  So after that happened a few nights, I put it away, but instead of putting it back on his charger  I put it right under Lisa's tire  Her left wheel hoping that when she backed out in the morning  She would put the little Roomba  Out of its misery she found it  Put it back, but it's eventually been relegated to the garage  so maybe now that the Roomba can steer around humans and and  atager's  We can bring him back into the house he's been housebroken you saw by the way a little video there  That's actually part of our news Google's extending  Contracts for temps by 60 days, which is really great. I think the temptation for a lot of companies is just your attempt  We'll let you go  But Google is gonna do the right thing and they have the money to do it  I think a lot of companies don't but Google has the money to say yeah

I presume  streamed  These were GD's these were announcements are gonna be for GDC. That was that's been postponed to August  So I  Don't you know if that means something to you good happy Google open stadia makers program for indie game developers is about time  I think that's a really good thing  So if you're an indie game developer, and you want to be on Google streaming stadia platform there. Here's the opportunity  To do that it's you have to be developing in unity  29 2019 point three  So there's a little limitation not just any game  Google play GPU driver updates in development for the pixel 4s 10 and note 10 I  would speculate that that has something to do with  stadia  And and the announced Android GPU inspector Google unveils game servers in beta for hosting global  Multiplayer games and this is something Google could do really well because they obviously they have global global network  centers  Right now when you play a game you pretty much choose a server near you  But these servers are designed to take the workout of hosting massive multiplayer games like fortnight or call of duty and to do it globally  Which is pretty cool. I think it it brings the world together when you can shoot somebody from another country  Google's travel search. Thank you for laughing Jeff highlights travel advisories and airline cancellation policies  This was a problem for my son  He was trying to find a way home from home. That's right  He was half the way around the world and he was typing in and it didn't in any way tell him well  You could book this flight, but you won't be able to get off  For instance he found a flight that flew through Taipei and it didn't say he found out he was fortunately  He was smart enough to look at the travel advisories, and it didn't say oh you could fly to Taipei, but they  You'll just have to fly back to Bali  He finally fancy yeah, so what I'm leaving in the 28th three days  He's gonna he found a flight through Tokyo, and they're gonna let him transit in Tokyo come home  He'll have to self quarantine. I think for two weeks when he get home it gets home, but at least we're gonna get him home  Wow, yeah, so this is buddy, but if you use Google he was using the Google travel search  He says it's really frustrating. I can't tell  You know if this flight is is gonna be if I can if I can book it  So now they'll have travel advisories

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right there on the search as they should as they should yeah, I don't actually do you search for your flights in Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz you know it actually works pretty well the Google  Google flight thing is really good. I use  Things too, but Google's is quite good. They bought ITA so they have all the information. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean I because I'm a I'm a prisoner of United  Who I hope will extend their their frequent fire  Policies major first word a problem is is wishing for your status to go on but anyway I  Search there first, but if I want to know what's all going on or the costs are all that I just in the search bar  I just put in flights EWR to  ORD the state and boom there it all is it's wonderful and because you're a United flyer you can even add

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll do it right here. You can say  You can add United to the search that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it will show you those and it's it's a really good by the way that flight cancelled

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, sorry Jeff. You can't go to Tokyo. Sorry  But that no, I think it's really good and then you can you can you can click on what airline is your son gonna fly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  United oh  So they are still flying that route because they were they got rid of all  Long hauls and they put some back

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe that's the case. Let's leave out United. See how he's gonna get home  Potential impact. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  Well, anyway, he did end up using this and actually I think he I said, you know, we we have a American Express  Card you could use their travel  Their America's best travel agency to do it and I think he ended up doing that  I spent some time on the phone with him as they they didn't really even know where you couldn't fly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He said yeah. Well, I think it's changing all the time. So it makes sense. You'd be like, mm-hmm. Yeah  It was and if you remember when we shut our borders, oh sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the Google change log.

Transcript:  Thought this was a very good story  Maybe we can wrap up on this one because this is a deep philosophical conversation and I have a feeling we might get  diametrically opposed points of view, but I really thought this asked an important question from wired

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I know what it's gonna be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't we just ban  Targeted advertising aren't all so well aren't all the woes of the world ad tech  Surveillance capitalism, okay driven by this desire to target advertising  If we just said you can't you can't you just have to buy ads in the old-fashioned way  Yeah, like billboards and mass media or podcast ads or TV  ads  Wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't you I mean first of all everybody agrees targeted advertising doesn't work all that well  I mean all the ads okay, it's sanitizing time before Jeff gets in this argument  I just I did my communist joke and I I should all sanitize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then I have to use my hand cream because my poor hands

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Delicate hands are getting really raw. So is this is this a non-starter?  I mean I probably is a Congress is never gonna pass a law saying you can't do targeted advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  First not now and nor should they I wrote a piece some months ago about this  Now I do my hand cream. It's gonna be my back of my hand a ritual

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Make sure you get those cuticles Jeff. There's no manicure  How to do this, I don't know where I'm gonna get my mani-pedi

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Without targeting we end up back at pure mass media with irrelevance and and  Treating us all the same and targeting is not a bad thing  There are small companies that were able to start because they could have efficient targeting they could they could you know sell you  the weird stuff we buy as geeks because because otherwise they'd have to just buy CPM and we get nothing but junk ads and  Junk content and the same is gonna be true political campaigns to a  Movement or a small campaign can start efficiently because of targeting and it gives us more relevance and targeting is not evil  It's not our job as a society to make advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  more efficient I  Don't think that benefits society  and I think that it's very clear that the the  Detriments of targeted advertising are extremely clear. No, they're great. No, it's created a surveillance economy. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Calm down just calm down  Surveillance society is Rickus surveillance is when the Stasi goes after you and you're gonna end up in jail for 40 years  And nobody knows where you are. That's surveillance. Don't don't diminish  I'm not saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Self-censorship what about not performing as you might because you know people are watching you at all times  Yes, and I'm not talking about innocent like I'm not talking about like not punching an old lady in the face while you're walking  No, you got a dance like nobody's watching  But being leery about what you say or what you talk about much like people in China they self-censor all the time. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With jails and guns is gonna come after you. That's what I'm saying  You don't finish that versus somebody showing our government

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  our government is in and so I  understand targeted advertising being frustrating and  Surveillance capitalism applied to there may seem a little over-the-top a little bit detrilled  but but  There's legit concern about surveillance capitalism because the same sort of surveillance technologies that give you targeted ads  Also can be co-opted for like geofencing warrants and that is a problem  So you've got to understand like how do we get how do we deliver targeted advertising which is I?  Don't know if it's entirely innocuous, but it's not to the level of the Stasi  Coming to your door and putting you in jail for 40 years  But the tools are the same and there's nothing in our laws right now that allow you to like  Say you can use this for this but not the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your problem is the law your problem is not the advertising your problem is not the data  Your problem is the misuse of the data for which we need laws

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just ban targeted advertising Google makes 60% of its money on search ads that's fine  You can buy you can you you're a candidate you want to get to an audience is searching for you know  You know I don't know thousand dollars a month for life you can buy that but you can't collect information  It's created Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Meet mass media. No it is killed media's no killing media. No because media were

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's killing media people don't surf the net anymore suddenly  There's all these paywalls and there's all this mess because because advertisers say well  I want to do the advertising that knows is ever demanding  The hands doesn't it kind of nice well this one's good  It's everyone hand sanitizer spray with in coconut and lemon and it not only feels good  It smells good.

Transcript:  What about many patties you can't get those either?  That's okay, I'll send my chauffeur to the store  I  Know I think we should get rid of targeted advertising  I think this is a very good proposal that would eliminate a lot of  harms in the society without  Please Jeff. What are we gonna lose really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're not gonna lose anything you're gonna go back to you want to what you're gonna get  You're gonna get the worst of ever as far as advertising alone just advertising just period advertising  You're gonna get the worst of advertising you're gonna get clickbait. It's already bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, our advertising is not targeted it's targeted only because I get a star books

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Advertising to me with used books that I actually care about because they know that I've shopped in a books. It's a wonderful thing  You just didn't want us to fight that's all you just wanted us to fight I know you're playing no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like I'm sincere. I like this proposal, but but I I know it's a non-starter because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Congress I would also say that you and all of media should have figured out how to create things. I have I don't do targeting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do you are targeting by your nature, but that's not an illegal form of targeting  I'm not collecting information about our own of us illegal  Well, I would like it to be illegal to collect information. Is there your audition? Yeah, you're just jealous Leo  She's jealous. No, because they're gonna put me out of business because I refuse to do the kind of  audience data collection that  advertisers have come to more and more expect and so because I can't compete with the big giant ad  companies that collect data like Google and Facebook and  Ultimately Spotify we will be out of business because we don't do targeting. That's a harm you hadn't considered  But it's a it's a real harm  I don't think we've gained anything by targeted advertising at all and I think we're gonna lose a lot more  Including well most of the newspapers in this country

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And because I've been yelling at these newspapers for years that they should have come up with first-party data  And they were too stupid to because they kept on insisting  I'm not the only in person to them Google kill the newspapers and magazine. No, they didn't know they didn't know they didn't they they gave we  ripped off  Those advertisers for years and years and years

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Giving them terribly inefficient about these advertisers who cares their pain for the media that are paying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are we gonna do a commercial in a second? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Save this for after the commercials  But I think our advertisers get value for dollar. They wouldn't come back if they didn't  But but increasingly they're gonna say well  we only want to target 25 to 54 year olds with 150 thousand dollars in income in the Pacific Northwest and  At that point we're gonna say well, we can't help you  What you're gonna get is what you what killed blogging and killed the beautiful worldwide web that we had you're gonna get direct insertion  Ads on podcasts that are targeted at you, but are not personal not not host read not endorsements  None of the kinds of ads podcasting does and you're gonna get a lot of small  podcasters out of business or they'll have to make it a hobby and Spotify and  And I heart media are gonna dominate because they collect information about their audience. I think this is a great law  I wish they'd pass it. I know there's no choice, but I wish I mean we should have this  It's it's I see I think the harms you describe are minimal compared to the harms that are already happening including but that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Market interference, so what you want what you want is you might as well move to Germany what you want is government protectionism for your business  Sorry, no, I'm not asking you got to compete. I'm looking for government protectionism for my privacy. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I am asking for that look not privacy you're the ones who brought up the consequences  I'm not talking about the consequences unless you want to the harms imagined imputed are real  I but I am talking about a very real  Specific  Prohibition on collecting private information about people. It's what's made Google and Facebook so powerful

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also what's made them highly relevant and useful and valuable really. Yes, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook relevant. Yes. Yes. Yes  Really  On that note  Is there anything I missed any story we missed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hello you guys this is gonna be a double pick because then they arrive  I'm gonna show them to you but wise is now offering their wise fitness band for  2499 W. Why is why see those guys the camera people the camera people the smart camera and sensor people  So they've made an activity tracker looks like a Fitbit charge, but it has built-in madam a over the Bluetooth on your phone  and it has the ability to control your devices plus a full color LED screen and  Let's see what else Oh activity tracker blah blah blah. They also launched a scale and  The scale the scale was notice  The scale is only  1999 what amazing it does not right now  it sings with only Google Fit, but it will sink eventually with Fitbit Apple and  Samsung's health app and this scale does a lot it measures the  Traditional like body it measures weight body composition from there. It can you know detect water rates?  lean body mass  I'm really excited about bone mass as someone who has osteoporosis in her history. So I'm like, ooh  How does it figure out bone mass? I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm gonna guess it has to do with the conductance  Testing right so they they you know, they have left foot right foot  They send a charge through your body and that's how they do a lot of this stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. Yeah, that's how they do like water in your body and that's how they pick like your fat versus muscle  I wonder how accurate that is. I don't know but I ordered both so I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Man they are amazing the price points that they set  Are ridiculous about their $20 for a smart scale. I have the scale does

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's eight dollars eight ninety nine to ship it. So you're looking at actually twenty nine and the band is 25 bucks  Yeah, that's so I picked up both of those for basically sixty dollars. That's and  That's crazy because I remember I bought the UA health kit like four years ago that is now defunct in 2014 or 2013  Twenty, I'm gonna pick another date 2016 is when I got it and that was four hundred dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so the nice thing about the band it works with wise cams  it's got a smart home functionality, so you could use it to turn on lights and  As wise smart home functionality. So yeah, it's not Amazon's well, it's using echo though. Well, it is yes  You can use Amazon's echo. Yes, so that would be their smart home as well, too, right?

They are just unfortunate because I had to pay tax when I ordered it. Yeah, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I get the feeling that they're just sourcing Chinese

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here there so their business model is their former Amazonians  Their business model is to source the hardware from China run their software over  Tiny tiny margins and get a lot of users to buy more and more of their gear. Well, I'm all for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have the camera as we find out how the cat was being. Oh, that's right  Anything else in the wise line that what else in the wise line going back even that do you like best?

So if a door you can set it up  So if like the back door opens your camera will start recording  So  Those are some options for you  I actually set up one of the motion sensors in my jewelry drawer  And so if you open my jewelry drawer, I can get a notification if it's not me
