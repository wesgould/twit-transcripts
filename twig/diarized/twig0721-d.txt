I mean if if my  Wife is inspired, but we just right now we're we're in France Spain in Italy  Mexico Morocco and we just added El Salvador. So  that's a place where she knows everybody because she was born there and  And we've traveled there, you know  Oh  I think the Tasmanian experience is is has to happen has to it has to happen right?

Transcript:  Well, I've never been to Europe  Really? I've never been yeah anywhere in Europe  I've been overseas to places like Thailand and the Philippines and places like that  But I've never been to Europe and we've decided that next summer probably about this time next summer. We're going to Rome  Definitely to Rome. We're gonna visit Padre. He's gonna stoke us out already in contact with him to  Explore the catacombs and do all the fun stuff  It's kind of a perfect opportunity to take our girls and go educate them on what it's like  You know, we've taken them traveling. We just went to Costa Rica  but I think this is like next level where we go to some place with just this insanely rich history and  Show them, you know something that they're you know  That we that none of us have ever experienced all of us together  I know that while we're over there, we're probably gonna want to go at least one other place  We don't want to jam-pack it with like five different places. We want to do like maybe two places really deeply  so do Rome Italy, maybe go to a different country right around there and you know pick something and  Spend a couple of weeks over there. I think that's our plan. So that'd be great. Switzerland would be nice  Mmm, that would be nice  Yeah, so many the problem is there's so much there's so many options, right?  It's like how could I even pick just only one more? I want to see them all I want to go  you know so many more places than just one other place, but

Start time: 636.06
End time: 667.56
Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Really looking forward to it now that we've decided we're going I mean, you know  the thing is that that Rome is a gigantic city and  and it would be also nice to go to another Italian place that is not urban and  You know, for example the Sicilian countryside would be nice northern Italy is super nice Milan  Venice etc. So yeah, but the options are or you have so many options  I know it's gonna be fun hanging out with Padre. We'd spent the day with him once in Rome and that was super fun

Start time: 668.48
End time: 699.42
Speaker: Jason Howell
Transcript:  Yeah, super fun. Yeah, he's been saying it for a number of years like hey, man  If you ever get out to Rome like I'm your man. I got you covered and you know, I told him authentically like yes  Someday we'll make it happen. And finally just probably like a month ago  I was like, you know if we're gonna do it  It's got to be like soon because we don't know how much longer he's gonna be there and also, you know  Girls like my oldest is 13 now. It's a couple of years before she's really doesn't want to hang out with us  We gotta get this in now like

Transcript:  Does your 13 year old like fashion  Yeah, she's pretty fashionable. Yes. She like Milan and you should go to Milan. Oh, and she'll freak out  It's like they Milan is a city of fashion. Yeah, like Palo Alto is a city of technology

Start time: 717.24
End time: 754.50
Speaker: Jason Howell
Transcript:  No kidding, I mean that makes sense what I what I passively know of Milan over the years, you know  But that's that's great advice. Cool. Yeah, I'm super excited  We got a lot to plan but uh, it'll be a lot of fun  If you're out there, of course, we will swing by and say hi  But I don't know if you would randomly be in Rome at the same time  But we'll certainly I'll be in touch and let you know when we're gonna be out there  Cool stuff. And by the way, we have Google News and reddit news. We do just real quick  We were talking about news and we're talking about a gastronomad just to get it in there gastronomad dot net, right?

Transcript:  Gutenberg parenthesis dot-com. There you go. See we like to get our plugs in at the beginning Gutenberg  dot-com gastronomad dot-net and that's the show. Thank you everybody  Actually, we do have some news there there's a good amount of Google News in here  Do we start though with reddit reddit is just man. This this whole saga is just crazy right now  I'd like I'm a I'm and I'm gonna admit like I'm a little sad because  and I'm sure you know Leo and you Jeff and others have already kind of had the opportunity to talk about this a little bit but  You know, it was not very long ago that I stopped my interaction with Twitter  Like I really don't do much of anything with Twitter anymore the sour taste of my mouth and the further  I got away from it the more I realized and not really missing it that much. So I'll just keep doing this thing  Reddit though has been a constant for a very long time  And it's not a constant in my life that I'm like I'm sharing a million different posts on a million different subreddits all the time  It's been more of just like something I go to  to learn and to get the the  Get a really nice take on on what's happening right now and how people feel about it  Which is I guess largely what social media is about but I can't explain why it's different in my mind and my experience  To something like a Twitter or a Facebook reddit has just been a really enjoyable thing for me every community

Start time: 844.42
End time: 863.58
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Do you because I don't use reddit enough does  What's the structure of reddit that fascinates me that I hope is a model for the future and until now  Is the idea that the moderators and the communities have control over the culture of each community independently?  Yeah, do you sense that difference as you go from one subreddit to another?

Start time: 864.46
End time: 901.38
Speaker: Jason Howell
Transcript:  Sure, I mean I definitely you know  I probably follow 30 or 40 different subreddits and they all have their own different, you know rules and everything  I think that's one of the things that I actually do like  I think you've kind of put your put your finger on it is to a certain degree  subreddits feel like bulletin board systems to me and  That harkens to a day, you know when I was much younger and this like magical idea of like, oh wait a minute  There's people over there talking about this thing that I also care about  I'm gonna call up that BBS and connect to it be part of the conversation and you know  Even if there's only like ten people there like we're ten people that love the same thing and so we talk about it

Start time: 901.44
End time: 903.90
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It brings it back to the scale of humanity. It's really nice

Start time: 904.08
End time: 983.16
Speaker: Jason Howell
Transcript:  Yeah, and I kind of get a little bit of that vibe when I go into subreddits  Like there's a community there that's really excited about talking about Google Pixel phones or there's a community that's really excited about  Oh, this is this is a great one about power washing like I subscribe to a subreddit  Where all it is is people sharing like really satisfying power washing videos like that sounds ridiculous  But yet every time I see one of those videos pop up in my feed  I stop and I watch it because it's just really satisfying and here's a whole TV show  So why not totally I mean I can't do that, but I also understand I suppose  Yes  So so it's so it's sad to me to see that reddit is undergoing kind of a similar moment to what Twitter  Kind of you think is gonna last year. That's that's what it feels like to me  I mean, it's certainly it's it's shaken the foundational kind of feeling that I've had about reddit of being like, oh, yeah  You know what? This is one of the good places and now I'm seeing the CEO just being very man  I don't know  it's just like the way he's talking about the people who have have  donated their time to manage these these subreddits it just feels very I don't know what the word is but  He's just very angry and well, this is his job. So the CEOs the CEO is Steve Huffman

Start time: 983.18
End time: 1056.80
Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  He's one of the co-founders and his perspective is roughly as follows  Reddit is not profitable and  It's also because of the structure and other things. It's an excellent source of data to train AI  So all of these companies are just hoovering up all this  Very well well organized data and using it and making a lot of money off of it  So they're making money off of something that we're providing for free and we're not profitable ourselves  So we need to make sure we charge money  For people who are making a lot of money off of it  This entire so that's his perspective. Here's the other perspective. I guess you might call it my perspective  Here's a guy  Here's a guy who is a content site and it's also a social networking site, right? So  The content is all provided to the company for free by volunteers  The social networking part the moderation and the organization is all provided for free and  He's not profitable  Like how is it like whose whose fault is it? The reddit is not profitable because we because the advertising

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Model around interaction has always been crappy

Start time: 1061.26
End time: 1122.84
Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Well, yes, but let me look at the cost advantages  So here another component of this is that there are all these third-party apps  So his perspective is all these third-party apps are just accessing a site receipt for free my perspective is  People are also donating and voluntarily donating  application programming  expertise  Your absolute couriette's like why couldn't reddit make a good app their apps are terrible  And that's why people do in third-party apps. And so to me  Every part of this story points to Steve Huffman as a failure as a CEO  They should be highly profitable. What they're running a website, right?  Where moderation and content creation is all for free?  And so it's like how do you you know, you've got to be able to make that profitable even in the wonky ad market. There's  Gotta be ways to do it. I bet there are a lot of CEOs and potential CEOs in Silicon Valley who could make it profitable

Start time: 1123.88
End time: 1125.66
Speaker: Jason Howell
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure someone like

Start time: 1126.98
End time: 1235.16
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  the yeah  And again, I'm not a big ready user. So I I don't know but having I mean  And I don't think it's best to full disclosure, but reddit was bought by my old boss Steve Newhouse in advance  I didn't get any piece of it  But I know from my days working for advance which believe Steve Newhouse believes strongly in  interaction in forums and  comments and and conversation of a  Moderation does bring a cost in addition because you got lawyers and all kinds of stuff B  There's never been much of an ad market around that because advertisers are scared of public voice  They're scared of a lack of control  They're convinced by media companies that you've got to be in a controlled environment of media content  And so that's really pretty crappy now  Yes ads have been on Twitter but Twitter didn't make it either  Ads are on Facebook, but Facebook controls it more as a mass structure with more use of personal data  So yeah, they're probably ways to do it. I'm not sure how many of those ways you'd like  So I don't know how well to judge  The failure I think I think how much failure in this case is more about bedside manner  Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'd agree with that. You know, it's one matter if we said listen folks  We all love this thing. We've got to align our interests  We've got to get ads on the apps so that and we can share revenue and we got to do this  We got to do that  But we got a pull together not unlike what's happening at this company even at difficult times around ads  around twent  And and and you know start a club and and and start other mechanisms  So yes instead he attacks the people who provide this tremendous value for free not smart

Start time: 1235.96
End time: 1312.74
Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Well, there's the PR aspect of it which he's failing at but there's also the you know, he's basically saying okay  These big companies are making money  Using our API for free and and taking all this data  Okay, where's the proposal to have a tiered?  Payment and free payment for API access. Well, why why isn't he charging open AI?  You know a hundred million dollars a year  Charging an app developer nothing because that benefits the community and having maybe a couple of tiers for  advertisers people, you know, because a lot of the advertising on reddit is kind of like quasi-advertorial they look like  Legit submissions. It's you know, Twitter's like that a little bit of with their advertising. I  mean, why is nobody holding his feet to the fire about this the ridiculous notion that because  big companies are using the data for free that  Committed users and moderators and app developers also have to pay the prices that they would charge Google for example, right?  Yeah, that doesn't make any eye  It's it's a it's a it's a it's a feels like a logical fallacy of some kind. I totally agree because  These companies are making money. The people are not making money also have to pay doesn't make sense

Start time: 1312.82
End time: 1403.58
Speaker: Jason Howell
Transcript:  That was a big part of my confusion early on in this little saga little this major  Reddit saga where the API switch, you know was was looming and third-party app developers were basically  Led to believe like reddit saying hey look, we're not gonna hold your you know, hold you out to the or put your  What is what is the metaphor? I'm looking for  Whatever it is we're not gonna throw you out we're gonna pay attention to you  we respect you and don't worry about it and then when the  When the announcement comes that okay, so here's here's the actual details the details are so far outside of any sort of realm  of bully of like  Reality that no third-party app like yeah, technically  Yes, you're right if a third-party app wants to pay you millions of dollars they can continue doing the thing  So I guess you got that right, but no third-party app is gonna actually do that. And so that felt very  Very much like a fallacy kind of like what you're saying Mike  Yeah, go ahead you go I was just gonna say that one thing that I don't understand  You know when we're talking about like reddit needs to make money and they make money off of ads and how can they make?  More money off of ads. Why wasn't never?  Considered or maybe it was and I missed it  But what why can't third-party apps have the ads in them too?  Like sure continue doing it but we need you to respect our ad platform and serve our ads to your users  I mean that makes sense to me  I'm sure any of the third-party apps probably would have been open to that if it meant they could continue to exist

Transcript:  Or you could do pull an apple and say okay, you can have a third-party reddit app  You can sell ads on that but we'll take one third of that that would still be a good for app developers, right?  Yes, have an additional source of ad revenue  They're just I don't I see zero creativity about the problem of not being profitable  Just like okay, let's just not let's just go out there and just fundamentally understand that the product is  The volunteer moderation and the volunteer content creation that is reddit  that's why people go to reddit and to to to sort of like pick a fight with  With that with those those people those communities is just it's it's really ridiculous. It feels so much like Twitter where  You know the people it's not quite as venal an owner now  That's true. That's absolutely true, but it's it's that that you know that that  war is still happening and and  You know for the for some for somebody at the top running the place to  Fundamentally misunderstand what it is. He's running it feels very similar in that sense  Even though it's a completely different scale the other thing I think

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jason to your point before is  I'm and I don't know anything about this  But I'm just guessing that they had a sense of what they would charge for the API and then along comes open AI  and and  Copyright I was just writing about this for something else copyright holders are  Seeing you know the little dollar signs in the cartoon eyes going around thinking oh, they're using my content to trade their systems  They're going to make a fortune  They're not yet  And and and I'm owed all this money because it's copyright Rupert Burdock and Barry Diller are screaming about this already  You owe us money. You can't use our content. Well a couple things about that  One is I think it's fair use to learn from existing content  They don't record it. They don't replicate it. They just learn from it. I also think that what comes out of  LLMs is transformative  So that fits the law in terms of fair use so I'm not sure there's a bag of money to be had there  I did an event this last week with  Barrelsman's investment fund and I moderated two sessions on AI  And one of them it's Chatham house. So I guess I can't quote. I always hate what I hate about chat about  I want to give credit to someone but I can't unless I ask permission  So a person I was talking to they are said that he would advise  Yeah, the legal battle is gonna go on forever  But go ahead and negotiate now because you want to just get on with your work and come up with some stuff and just act  Like you got to and do it, but I think what happened with reddit in part was that huge dollar amount of their API  They knew that that LLMs were using them to train on because it's really valuable. There's tons of content. They've got an API  It's kind of great. Your Twitter does it anymore  Facebook never had in this way  So they do stand alone and the values open access to those models but to to charge the same value  to Sam Altman and  Volunteer who made an app that expands your value in the marketplace is wrong-headed. Yeah, totally

Start time: 1603.54
End time: 1714.34
Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Absolutely. The other thing that bothers me is that when you notice when you run a company and you notice  that companies are using the data for  generative AI purposes and  Your response is we're gonna charge everybody a ton of money  Just so we can get those that is the first thing I would think of if I was running it  Would be why don't we use it for generative AI imagine  Imagine a search engine based on reddit data  It'd be killer. There's so much good information on reddit  Yeah, that information there too, but exactly the beauty of reddit  The bad information gets gets dumped to the bottom and the good information on the whole gets raised to the top  you could wait the the  The the the this the cred of the data of the information based on the community  So the the thumbs up data would rank higher in how the generative AI worked  And you'd have a really great would not be like what we're seeing out there with other generative AI  Attempts at search engines where it's you know, everything's kind of treated equally to a certain extent  No  You could use the the fundamental nature of reddit  Which is the user moderation and the the crowd sourcing of the value up or down?  To weight the value of the content that's used to construct the one true answer you get from the from from a generative AI  Based search engine. It could be the greatest search engine ever built  I don't I don't hear those proposals coming out of reddit and this could be even a separate site that would compete directly with Google search  Etc  Where's that proposal that could be huge? That could be a huge business and it wouldn't presumably bother the reddit community  So, I don't know. I just I'm just the lack of

Transcript:  That I'd be really surprised if suddenly the CEO is like, you know, I realized it was trash-talking everybody. I'm really sorry  And which I think is at least the beginning of what would need to happen to kind of start undoing  The ill feelings that a lot of these moderators have I think it's it just kind of permanently changes  changes it and some of those people are gonna get out and  New people will come in and they'll adhere to the new rules whatever the new rules are because you know  The CEO has definitely talked about  instituting new rules to make to give moderators less influence less control and  Yeah, like it's just he's also trying to

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Change the rules a bit so that it's easier to vote out  mods that are not  Playing ball with the company, right? So so there there changes afoot  Where he's trying to to make that happen?  It's a real problem that reddit isn't a public company because there's no board of directors that can fire him  Right and well, that's what they're trying to watch what they're trying to get to Mike is he's trying to go to an IPO  Yes, I know but this is this is gonna delay it by who knows how long well, that's that's a really great

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let me disagree with you Mike  Being a public company is in the end what Borked Twitter  Because because there was no  Decent stocks right and night ridder and other companies  Right because there wasn't a stock structure to enable a beneficent leader, which is why I think Steve Newhouse in the end  in the case of reddit  to do things  Steve bought reddit wholesale then put it back out there  So there was equity so that the people who were doing it could  Raise up and now they're trying to get to an IPO to do that. But public market is no panacea

Transcript:  Well, but if you look at Twitter, for example, you know, obviously Elon Musk made it private  And now he can't be fired  with his record of bumbling and failure and the billions of dollars the tens of billions of dollars of valuation  Lost at least 20 billion dollars of valuation lost  He would have been fired in a public company. I mean he just the it the degree to which he is failing  From a financial point of view from the point of view of a board of directors  He would have been fired and they'd put somebody else in there. Of course, he did hire another CEO  But he still owns owns a place and makes all the decisions. But I you know, I agree that it's not a panacea  but  Steve Huffman should be fired and I don't see how that's gonna happen  Given that they don't have a  board of directors who accountable to shareholders

Transcript:  What is what is the impact that we see of this on this kind of?  Looming IPO. I mean I would imagine a situation like this isn't great for  For the the possibility of an IPO in the near term or or does it or will this convince certain?  Potential shareholders that like oh, hey, you know and someone's really running the company that that has our best interest in mind  So maybe this maybe this elevates the IPO  possibility I

Transcript:  Mean I think that one of the ways that mods are are protesting is they're making  Subreddits that are in fact safe for work. They're designated them as not safe for work, which means advertising won't won't be displayed  Which means direct if it's done a scale the company loses a lot of advertising dollars. So they're taking a hit  Financially, you know, of course, it's not a public company. So we don't get all the details  But surely they're taking a big hit in advertising dollars. And so that's gonna give  Potential  Investors pause  It's also a source of trouble and controversy that's gonna give them pause. So yes, he seems to be acting in a way that is  He's being assertive  Toward the cause of  Revenue and all that kind of stuff, but it's a bumbling kind of assertion. It's a wrongheaded kind of assertion and  Ultimately, it's just creating controversy and problems  For reddit, which is not appealing to to potential investors  So I don't think there's gonna be any serious talk of an IPO  anytime in the next year at least and  Probably more than that. I mean, I just don't see  How they're gonna get to the point where oh, yeah, this looks like a great money-making  Business that is gonna just soar and grow and become this gigantic thing  Which just seems to go counter to probably the you know, the driving force of the company

Speaker: Jason Howell
Transcript:  The driving force of this change to begin with the word I was trying to look for earlier when describing Steve Huffman and his actions  Around this was contemptuous. I feel contempt  Coming from him when it comes to talking about the moderators of this platform that had been doing all this free work for him  and I think that's what really poisons me about this whole situation like oh, you know kind of like with with  Elon Musk and Twitter there were things that Elon was doing that made me not want to touch Twitter because it felt dirty and now  I got this contemptuous thing happening over here with reddit and I just I don't want all my social networks that I care about  To just go away like where what am I gonna do? You know, I guess I I just don't use them as much  I I actually fired up my  My very untouched tick-tock account earlier today because I was like, you know  There's a lot of stuff happening right now that I care about a lot of stuff in my life and here at Twitter  And I'll talk about it later and everything but like I have no  Place outside of shows on this network where I can really kind of talk about this stuff on a passing day-to-day level  I used to do that on Twitter  I don't really anymore because I don't really want to do it in that way and I was like well  What if I use tick-tock the way I use Twitter? So I'll just try that and see how that goes, you know  I don't know where it's gonna go. But anyways, that's that's my plan  But then something's gonna happen to tick-tock. This just seems to be the way of the world with social media right now

Transcript:  You know my hope my dream has always been to have one social place  That's why I loved Google Plus so much back  Yeah in the first four years of Google Plus and now I find myself once again spread out across all these things  I am on Twitter still I'm on blue sky. I'm on sub stack notes. I'm on t2. I'm on  Something else. I mean, it's just it's it's really a bastard on it is a bummer. That's it on. Thank you. Yes. Thank you Macedon  It's really a bummer and it's it's just a lot of work to go from one to the other and switch so much work  contextual gears to engage in these  Conversations and they all have their own syntax and one great place. Yes

Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know and I guess the flip side of that, you know, I can I can kind of hear  You know, I don't know how if he really would feel this way  But I can kind of hear Leo's voice in my ears right now being like well  That's that's good because then you're not putting all your eggs in one basket  And you know, you're not giving one company or one entity everything that you're doing and you spread it out  But I mean it's exhausting is what it is from my perspective. It's hard enough to just update  One place let alone have to you know  Just have it locked in my mind that I got to go to all these all these places one  To even check them and then to to do  Content or posting or whatever it is and all the different syntaxes that they require lights. It's exhausting  I just don't have that space in my life

Transcript:  So I post I post a lot what I in the morning when I go through the news I will  post stuff in  Twitter in blue sky and in Mastodon  Occasionally on LinkedIn if it's appropriate same stuff. I'm not because I'm trying to spam anything, but I just want to I'm still trying to learn  what the  Interaction is gonna be in each place and they're so unpredictable  Because  Really weird something that I think oh, you know Mastodon is quiet the Mastodon is the one where I get a lot of interesting conversation  and  Blue skies still pretty light  Twitter still surprises and I think Mike for your businesses. I think you have to be on Twitter

Transcript:  Yeah, it's worse than that. We have to be on Instagram  you know, my wife runs a Instagram there because  Outside of the US there there's a huge number of people who only use meta products  They only use Instagram what's app? Yeah and Facebook and so  They've never ever go to Twitter any of these other things  So my my wife takes one for the team she she holds her nose and goes on Instagram  But but yeah, it's exactly what you're saying Jeff  I do the same thing and I'll often post you know, if it's super techie  I'll only post it on Mastodon and and and  T2 or something like that if it's if it's super political maybe only Twitter and blue sky  But sometimes I'll post the same exact content on all five and  Then I'm surprised it just completely blows up on one of them and goes nowhere on the others  Yeah, so I'm not really sure what's going there. I'm hoping it eventually that one of these social networks will  Demonstrate to me that that's the place where I want to spend all my time and I'd be happy to cancel my accounts on all  The rest but so far they're all kind of they're all kind of out there  And each one is unsatisfying by itself.

Transcript:  For our comfort blue sky, which you know hasn't been federated yet  Just just said yesterday that they put up a sandbox environment for Federation is now ready  So I think I think proof of the pudding there will be how federated it becomes and how independent people can be  That gives me some hope also the other thing I like about blue sky is that they  They don't really have customizable algorithms so much yet as customizable feeds  But I like the idea of being able to for someone to come in and make money doing it. Let's lesson for me to from reddit  And give me an algorithm that recommends the kind of stuff that I would want and goes to that effort  I think there's opportunities for customizable  Federated worlds around both mastodon and I hope blue sky will see I hope they do it right

Start time: 2370.68

Transcript:  The frustrating thing is that blue skies using the app protocol and instead of so they're not you know currently  Going to be federated along with mastodon and all the rest. So that would be killer if they were  You know if I could interact with  If I could interact with  Twit dot social and all the people on mastodon and and that fed a verse  I'd probably just use blue sky

Transcript:  I think that once they they get their Federation act together  It's more possible to imagine how that might happen, and I don't know anything but the same count when we had rabble on  You know who works in Federation at an early Twitter and so on he  As I remember argued that there was some benefit for competing  Protocols that they can improve each other and learn from each other and so it may be too soon for everybody to get behind  Just activity pub  Maybe there's a benefit to having another protocol that has some of the functionality. We don't have I don't know  I don't know enough to judge that but I still have some hope here and again  What we said before you said earlier Jason about about the feeling you had of reddit being like a bulletin board. Mm-hmm. I  think we got  Everybody got too much  Greed for attention in their eyes of wanting a mass audience  I want Twitter even though even though nobody has all the Twitter. Nobody has a whole Facebook  No, two people see the same place for either place  But we get the sense that mass had to matter and scale had to matter  So if we can get back down to right size to human size and recognize that if if you're suddenly talking to  500 people somewhere that's amazing. That's like having your own auditorium. That's just great  And you can meet all kinds of interesting people and you can have interesting conversations and that's wonderful  You don't need 50,000. You don't need a hundred thousand. You don't need five million. In fact, that's absurd  So to rescale our social expectations of the Internet I think is important is part of how we're gonna  Make this right again. And then also the asset  Involved isn't as attractive to nihilistic  Narcissists like Elon Musk or to your point Mike, I don't really know enough but let's just say  incompetent executives like Huffman  You know, I think the potential is to keep them honest

Start time: 2512.80

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. And you know one of the one of the draws for a place like Twitter is  You know JLo can go there and have a hundred bazillion followers. And so you want to reward  The people who will bring a big audience and bring a lot of fans bring a lot of readers bring a lot of viewers  Whatever it is for the people who really do need those big big audiences  I mean, you know, Anderson Cooper is not gonna be happy with five talking to 500 people  He talks to him to a million every night or whatever it is  Numbers are and so you want to be able to attract those people but at the same time you don't want it to be this  Winner takes all system. I mean, I think that's what brought down dig which I think is more  Comparable to to read it for example. Yeah, I mean there was a user their name. Mr. Baby man  Remember mr. Baby man and every single thing he posted was on the top of dig every single time and he just  Determined what the content was of dig  almost single-handedly and nobody else everybody wanted that kind of  reach but it was  The whole thing was kind of weighted against you  This is kind of the one of the things that Steve Huffman called, you know called called  longtime mods landed at Gentry because  They're holding on to their spots for lots of time  They have they have more authority over the other mods of their of their of their subreddit and so on  so  this is one of the things like moderation that social networks really have to about power out a good system for and  You know, you don't want to winner takes all system. You want people who to who?  Consistently post engaging content to extend their reach and people who almost never go or the who are lucky lose or whatever  Kind of to sink to the bottom or whatever  There's got to be a better way to do it. And and so hopefully hopefully some of these social networks will figure that out

What have you got to lose bit warden comm slash twit?  That's bit warden dot com slash twit we thank bit warden for their support of this week in Google  Okay, so let me scroll up here and see what kind of googly stuff we have. Oh, yeah the Google domains thing  this  Gonna be fun  Going along the the road of you know  Can we trust the big the big technology companies that we've that we've grown so close to over the years and Google?  Time and time again, man. They just keep reminding us. You can't trust us to hold on to something that you love  That's that even might be a success, but maybe not to Google's metric of success. Whatever the heck that is, but Google domains  getting the axe and  according to ours technica  Selling its domain hosting business to Squarespace  This is gonna close or it's expected to close anyways in third quarter of  2023 eight years  since it was launched and I mean a lot of a lot of people a lot of companies relying on this now suddenly  Gonna go and you know go in the hands of Squarespace  So Google's getting out of it. And what do we think of Squarespace? I  Mean I yeah, I mean I have a site on Squarespace. That's that's my main thing. I have a site  I like the site, but beyond that I don't know I have several and

I mean they they they're very good in certain things in fact  Gastronomad.net is a Squarespace site and one of the reasons we  Use it is because we use their e-commerce for people to sign up for experiences  So it's all very integrated into stripe and so on and it works really well  They have some nicely designed templates and so it's a but but they're there and they have pretty good tech support  I should say better than pretty good. They have good tech support. They're a little slow to evolve. I think it's  fine for them to have  This this service what's once again disappointing is that there  Google has this thing that people are using they're happy with it. It's associated with workspace  people who bought into Google stuff are once again being kind of  Shafted by Google in this case not closing it essentially selling it off, right?  And it's just once again, it's just so confusing about why Google does these kinds of things why sell it?  They strap for cash. It was profitable. So that doesn't make any sense  It just it just doesn't make any sense to keep  Pulling the rug out from your most passionate users who follow your lead do what you say  You know, they roll this kind of stuff out the big fanfare  Everybody gets excited users go rushing in to use the service and then later Google just says nah  We're we're we're not gonna be associated with it anymore.

I'm on a podcast called as we can Google  One of the reasons that I that I liked Google and trusted them in the past was that these were things that just made you  Feel good about Google. They were worth doing is that purpose in another world?  We call it branding right it just had a it was a in a world that was filled with sleazy promoters the  URL world the domain world. Thank you  I'm thinking myself the word I could come up with  The domain world was filled with with yucky places who will said, okay. Okay, we're gonna come in  We're gonna clean it up. We're gonna do some decent decent price boom. Boom. Boom  We're gonna run profitably as you said Mike and it was great and now just to drop it  There's just no trust you them for anything, you know at some point are they gonna get rid of Gmail?

Why are we gonna continue trusting Google?  Why why would we do that at a certain point? We're just kind of crazy if we do that because we know it's gonna go away eventually

Wow, Apple's users are super loyal  devoted to the Apple cause and one of the reasons for that is  People know for sure they're not gonna suddenly kill the iPhone. They're not gonna suddenly say  Oh, you know what? We we made a mistake getting into the Apple TV business. We're just gonna close all that stuff down  They are smart about doing it  Let me try this out on you. Let me try this out on you. You know hearing you say that

They make android phones  But then again, they really license android out to everybody else. Yeah, they've got gmail, but it's really about you know  enterprise stuff they have enterprise  SaaS services advertising is all b2b  And now that they own the marketplace both ways  It's really about advertisers and media back and forth. Is it no longer a consumer company and brand?  Well, the reason you're asking that question is because it's

Transcript:  Unknowable it's confusing. It's a confusing point if you look at a company like Microsoft  Okay, Microsoft  has clearly  Nearly completed their pivot to becoming an enterprise company and they are so successful  If you look at the valuation of technology companies, of course, you would expect apple to be at the very top  Of valuation, but if you look at Microsoft, Microsoft is number two right right behind apple  Microsoft is number two right right behind apple  Microsoft is almost as valuable as apple which is stunning to me  But they've done it by being pretty clear that they're about business and the enterprise then you have google  Google has you know, they sell a smartphone then they don't now they're selling a smartphone again  Then they buy motorola then they spin off motorola  Then they have the they have the they they have the laptops and they want to do laptops anymore  And and then they buy nests right and then they get rid of net, you know  They don't get rid of nest, but they they sort of don't do much with it  uh  You know this if they wanted to be an enterprise company, okay  Like once and for all get rid of nest stop making  Consumer play. I mean they dominate education for example  Uh with with chromebooks, uh to a very large extent  They're just so confusing and if they wanted to  If they if they really wanted to  Do the kinds of things apple does  They would have one messaging  App instead of 13 or 12 or 9 or 15 or whatever it is. They have nobody knows. It's unknowable what their messaging  uh products are  They would have one that would be google messages or something like that  And that could be the catalyst that would bring people into all these other things  But no, they they just they can't seem to get control of themselves  themselves  They're like, so what do you think teenager?

Transcript:  I mean  It just seems like time and time again google can't coordinate between itself  To get everybody on the same page to know like like all that I could think of when I was when I was listening to you  Mike and and thinking about the question  Is like I don't even know that google could answer that question  I don't know that google it  understands  Exactly which direction is going for I think google to a certain degree which is all of these different departments  You know doing many different things they want to be everything  And they want to be everything for as long as they're tasked to do that until  Suddenly they get recognized for the work they did over there  I'm talking about like an individual like product manager or something like that  And suddenly he or she gets transferred over to this other thing and then that thing dies on the vine because there's no more  person there to vie for it it as a company it seems like a lot of their efforts are not  Executed with the company in mind. It's more like i've got this really great idea  Okay, you do that and they do that and it gets successful, but it's not like it's not considered this big major success for google  It's a major success for it. And then once the person that champions my team is gone  Then that it falls apart and  As a consumer as a user of google, it's just kind of exhausting at a certain point  It's like there's only so many times I can put my faith into this product and then have it  Disappear on me again, and I think yeah, it's a fascinating period because because

So now it decides to go ai  Um microsoft  um  Is kind of I think ruining its consumer products by throwing ai inappropriately  um  google is screwing all these properties that we cared about  it's really  Interesting to figure that out apple and i'm not as you know  I'm no apple fanboy because I think that they got out of the advertising business just because they failed  And privacy became a bug became a feature, but they have to stick close to the consumer  um  You know if you look at media companies media companies except for little ones like this aren't close to consumers  They're just selling they're the ones who for whom you are a product because they're selling your eyeballs to advertisers always have been  There's not a lot of truly consumer  customer based  Companies on the internet out there now that we think about it now that we're discussing this I hadn't thought of this before

Transcript:  And then people assume apple is but really apple is very successful in the enterprise as well and in business markets  And they don't they don't draw this huge distinction between those they basically say, okay. Well iphone is just the best phone  That's what they would say it does good  It's the best phone if you're an enterprise user or if you're a consumer, right?  And so that's that kind of idea has worked well for apple, but yeah, you're right  There are small consumer companies, but but many of the big companies have realized that the business market is the is the better  Business and of course it is a better business. It's easier. It's a hell of a lot easier  It's it's great to have a government contract rather than trying to sell individual units at best buy because that's that's that's really problematic  but the thing the thing about google I think that um, just to reiterate and kind of uh reframe a little bit what you were  saying jeff is that  I mean, uh, uh, uh, uh, jason is is that google?  Nobody's in charge. Um, nobody's in charge  the  the the individual departments are just  Doing their own thing and again contrasting against against uh apple  Steve jobs created a company where he was the fascist dictator  He personally  Was in charge all the way down and he decided what color blue the translucent lucent desktop pcs would be  Personally and he kind of handed that over to tim cook and tim cook  Is a kind of a dictator where sundar pichai who's both the ceo of google and and also alphabet  He's just kind of uh, I don't know. I don't know what he does  But he but but he just lets the kids run while he lets the inmates run the asylum  And and we get the result that we get plus the incentives at google are all messed up  You get bonuses and incentivized for launching  Products, but you get very little benefit within the company politically or salary wise  by  Really improving constantly improving being  Dedicated to the users of the product and seeing it to evolve to be better and better and better  They don't incentivize that so it doesn't happen  And then these these products just sort of languish in obscurity until they're finally killed  And they do it year after year after year. Nobody ever says, you know sundar pichai never stops and says, you know  Maybe there's a better way  Uh, they just keep  fumbling along  with this conspicuous  Reputation as a company just kills this and kills that and kills everything and they keep doing it as if they're  I don't know. It it feels like they're almost trolling us  It does if you think they try to do something about their bad reputation  They don't seem to even be aware of it somehow. I mean the reader thing

I mean it was a long time ago at this point sounds right  It was a decade ago  And that was one of the earlier times that I remember going  Whoa, if readers on the chopping block like nothing is safe  You know what I mean? Like if you're getting rid of reader  There's probably not a whole lot that google wouldn't be willing to get rid of like that was just very surprising to me  Here we are a decade later and I mean go to killed by google.com.

You're like, wow, that sounds great  I totally would have used that if I'd known about it if I knew about so the most recent  The most recent thing is they're killing off album archive. This is on the rundown. Yeah  This is a this is part of the insured of occasion of google photos  the first big betrayal was that when they when when vick and dotra rolled out google photos  And all that stuff it was unlimited photo storage. And so everybody said wow unlimited free photo storage. That's amazing and everybody poured  You know gazillions of photos into google photos and then some time went by and they said, you know what?  We changed our mind. We're going to start charging if you're over a certain amount  A total betrayal and I personally felt betrayed because I recommended to so many people  So many readers that they used google photos because they had had this unlimited free photo storage and now they're killing off

I don't I use albums a lot but but I but it's  It's it's a feature in there that I believe that some people really use  And so I I think that it's uh, you know, I from what I understand you can put an album into into archive status  so, uh, and then  And then it's not deleted. It's just archived. It's sort of like

That's probably the only photo that I know of of me being a dj  Uh back then and then I have photos from hangouts which are just I mean  Is exactly what it says right the number of really old hang like photos that I obviously shared with different in different hangouts chats and that's  Like I didn't even know this existed until I got that email

Look at that  I'm going to use that for whatever reason  and uh  It's just uh, it's just incredible. I that they that they  like what is the benefit to google of  Of doing this how many of their users are not really getting you know, who don't listen to twit watch twit twig  Right or and don't get you know the verge or whatever and won't know about this  They think their photos are safe and sound and in june or july, whatever it is  Uh, it's going to be just unceremoniously  July 19th  Discontinued discontinued. I guess what you're gonna piss off some people and why yeah, why piss off everybody?

Start time: 4090.06
End time: 4162.58
Speaker: Jason Howell
Transcript:  What what is the benefit? Um, I guess what comes to my mind right now is  Is is google just too spread out like do they just have their hands in too many different things when I compare google?  And apple obviously they're very different companies. They have very different strategies  but when I think of apple the mental image I get is a very kind of  honed  Track of of devices and services. They all work together. They all fit together  They're they're they're in the same they're going in the same direction they're traveling on the same road together  And then when I think of google, I just think of a million different things shooting into a million different directions  It's a sky full of of fireworks with you know, different colors shooting in all different directions  And that's that's google's strategy and like apparently that doesn't work because they kill so many things  I appreciate and have appreciated that google  likes to throw spaghetti against the wall and see what sticks and you know, that's that's created some really interesting and fun and  enjoyable  Products and services that we've used over the years, but it's also created a lot of grief and i'm just like  Maybe maybe google just needs to like  Narrow your focus do do less things but do them better instead of doing everything and failing at them all

Start time: 4164.14
End time: 4259.84
Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  well, the thing is that that  it's it's actually just  Feels like apple does only a few things apple does all the things that google does for the most part  Uh, for example, they have incredible ai but instead of just having this ai sort of out there in the wind or having  You know 25 different ai products that you can use i'm going to go use an ai product  They build ai into their ear into the front where you already are  Right in subtle little ways, right? They they have a photos  Uh app  Right. They have they have all those things except they they're all in the service of these hardware software platforms  Like the iphone ipad, etc. And so there's a focus of clarity. There's a hierarchy of  Of of importance and what they're ultimately trying to what apple's ultimately trying to do is thrill the user and keep them locked in  Right. I mean the only reason I never use android phones anymore is because I love this watch so much  It only works with an iphone, right? So they they sort of hooked me with this watch, right?  But the watch works with the  Phone the apps work together  They all work with the ipad that works with the with with the macbook pro that I use and it all kind of works together  There's a there's a intention to make me the user very happy with with what i'm doing  And I give them way too much money as a result. Whereas google is just they don't even think about the user  It seems like they're like, oh well, we can do this. We have the technology to make this product. Let's make it  and then they throw this product out there and then there's a  You know  After the fact there's a an attempt to integrate them. Yeah, but right after the fact exactly

Transcript:  Yeah, and it's just they they just it's a badly run company. It's they they are the  Uh sundar I said it before in the show and i'll say it again sundar pachay as the steve balmer  Of google, so is there any company you like today mike?  Well, I think I think uh, well, I don't know, you know, I I think apple is doing well apple certainly, um,  Uh  Get it doing well financially. They certainly get a lot of money from me and my family  um, but yeah, that's a  There are a lot of good companies the thing the frustrating thing is  All of us have wanted so badly to love google for so long. Yeah  Right, and and I really really really want to want to be on google's side  I used I loved what they used to be  and uh, I love their whole attitude and I know that they  The sort of uh, the scrappy  Uh entrepreneurial try everything kind of attitude is is a little bit uh passe these days  It's not a good way to run a company, but I would have hoped that they would have evolved and and used their their  advantages  uh to to evolve into the new era and and sort of uh  Notice that it's it's a good idea to have  You know one or two messaging platforms instead of 11 or 12 and it's a good idea to have one or two  AI chat bots and not a whole bunch of them or whatever right and I I I was really counting on them to to do some amazing stuff  You know, I I was a pixel book owner. I thought okay. This is this is a platform  And it's going to keep getting better and better and better, but but no  Uh, and so it's you know, I I have to call it like it is they just they just disappoint  They disappoint their users. That's what they're that's what they're good at. That's that's what they're good at right now

Start time: 4364.94
End time: 4399.08
Speaker: Jason Howell
Transcript:  Wasn't always that way but it certainly feels that way and has for a while in my opinion. I find myself wondering  What would google be like if sundar pichai was replaced by a different ceo if a new ceo  I don't even know who that ceo would be but if the ceo was to come in and say all right  Fresh eyes, it's it's tim cook. It's uh, such a nadella, you know level of like  transform transformative  Um  Fresh look at google if some new ceo was to step into that role  Soon ours out that ceo's in what would what would google do that?

Transcript:  So I think I think part of part of what I think is really interesting  In fact, i'm about to write a piece of a chapter of the next book about that kind of goes into that  And it occurs to me the heading for this part that i'm going to enjoy writing is it's time to demote the technologists  Right. We needed them to kind of build stuff  What would you think about it?  If you were gonna, you know, go back to i'm sorry gutenberg moment  Uh gutenberg was in charge because he knew how to set type  At first right but before long he was replaced  By publishers and editors and others who got to the core value of what printing delivered  If you're going to start  Uh facebook today and we're going to start a service. We're going to connect  Lots of people in the world. What would you who would you put in charge of it? Not a technologist  He put a charge of I don't know a sociologist or an anthropologist or a psychologist  Or something else  for google  from a consumer perspective  Who should be in charge? I know this is what i'm about to say is absurd but i'll say it anyway a librarian  Maybe even a journalist an educator, right? What's the value?  On a consumer perspective there as a corporate perspective, of course, it's an advertising company number one  So maybe you put it in sales, maybe philip  Who's the c chief revenue officer?  Of google philip schneider no philip or something forget his name  You know, I am frantically googling I can't find his name right now  You know or  Twitter it should be a talk show host  I I I know i'm getting absurd  But the point is that when you decide what the essence of the company is that's what what determines what the leadership should be  john hoffman

Start time: 4511.00
End time: 4631.46
Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Uh looks no somebody else i'm thinking of philip. Yeah, so that's it. So again, i'm i'm  I apologize for talking so much about apple, but that's why tim cook should learn is this sorry. That's why  Steve jobs put tim cook and as his successor because tim cook is an expert  probably the world's leading ex  Expert at complex manufacturing  Of electronics at a massive scale  his job before he took over as ceo was organizing the manufacturing of  tens of millions of iphones in a short  period of time  right the first time using you know, a  taiwanese company based in in china  and  He's really good at that and they recognize that that's really the core thing apple does  That's the hardest part of what apple does is manufacturing  uh  very complex  Electronics products at a massive scale  And and I agree with you entirely and and sundar pacheco is the wrong person for that  But again, I wouldn't even know what that is at google. I don't know what their I mean, maybe yes  I don't know. Yeah, right  Um jeff just see I will say one thing i've been i've been uh crapping all over google a lot  But I think one example of a success story  is google maps so google maps is is a  Is an app that competes directly with multiple products including with apple apple has worked so hard  to  To make apple maps as good as google maps and they have been unable to do it  And you know google maps isn't perfect, but it's pretty amazing. Yeah continues to be amazing and they haven't  Yeah, and they haven't failed on it  Uh, you know again there i can think of several ways that i'd like to see it improved  But I also can't think of a single other  Application that's anywhere near as useful or as high quality as google maps

Transcript:  So even though we're going to talk about google getting sued but gannett sued google  this week  And editor and publisher called me for response and the more I thought about the more I thought ridiculous  So gannett is is charging along with various ags along with other companies that google is an antitrust in advertising  And there are legitimate issues to look at we talked about this in the show last week that um  What google controls both?  the uh buy and sell side of advertising  Then that has an impact  Um, but as I thought about it  Gannett, I don't know. I don't know where you guys have near you. I have I have a gannett paper right near me  It's crap. It has been for years gannett is a monopolist  Gannett bought up nine news brands in new jersey basically everything they get their hands upon except advance my old employer  and  Cut the newsrooms and cut them to crap and act like a monopoly and they're accusing google to be a monopoly to blame  Google for their problems is disingenuous as hell  Because gannett just didn't advance they've been the one of the least innovative companies out there  and least quality companies out there and so  Part of the problem with attacking google, which I kind of get I I I don't we weren't we weren't attacking google before we were  disappointed in google  The problem is that as long as google is one of the proprietors of the internet and people attack them  That affects our internet and it just pisses me off so full disclosure is that  Google has contributed to the activities at the school. I don't get anything personally from google, but  jeez  Gannett really?

I mean they're not after a remedy that I don't believe the amount of the lawsuit has been published  but but you know imagine if let's say uh, uh  google only had 50 percent share or  30 percent share  the  Status of gannett would be exactly the same. They'd be if google disappeared tomorrow, right? They'd be they'd be just screwed up meanwhile

So next week  uh a bill called the  Cjpa in california the california journalism protection act which is like the jcpa which is the federal version  Which these the these these as you say mike these other big companies and these lobbyists keep trying to push through  Is trying to blackmail google and facebook to pay for the privilege of linking to their news  And acting as if news is so valuable to them where the truth is facebook which doesn't walk away from news  Google might walk away from news in canada  Um, it's the old protectionist bad media industry and i've kind of had it with them  I signed a letter last week to congress about the jcpa  Joining in a protest about it because i've just i've just had it with my old industry.

That's you know, the main  Role that they have is that they they're driving people can go in and just search for things and it's like oh  Here's a link to this article and you're like wow, you know, I keep linking to the washington post or the atlantic monthly  I think I should subscribe, you know, because i'm always like linking to these places  And so on we know these dynamics and we've seen this play out in other countries in spain  And elsewhere where there have been there have been these uh, these sort of misguided attempts to make google pay  to drive traffic to media sites and it's just it just seems kind of uh,  Uh, obviously bogus  That is not going to help  Media organizations evolve  Uh to to to to meet the challenges that that they face right now  And uh, it's it's just going to it's you know, they're just looking for money and uh, i'm sure they'll get cheerleading from their their  Shareholders, but it's just not anything that I I that makes sense to me at all

Transcript:  So it's a google phone as a pixel phone and an iphone talking to each other  And of course the pixel phone is going to end up better off. There's like six of them and they're dorky. So in one  the uh iphone runs out of battery  And another one the iphone runs out of battery and google phone lays down on top of it  To charge the iphone because it's one of its neat features  And the iphone says what are you doing on top of me? This is why i'm bringing you back to life. Oh, okay. Thanks

Transcript:  Um, they're very weird. I mean they're they're weird. They're they're silly  The one that I saw was the one where the iphone runs out of battery and uh,  You know, they're they're each talking in their  In their ai voice so, you know, uh, the iphone has a seery like I don't think it's actually seery  seery voice talking but it's you know, very stilted and robotic and the assistant voice and everything and  It's kind of like their puppets, right? They're kind of like shaking and talking to each other and and everything  So it you know, it's cute on one hand, but I don't know there was something about it  That was like, all right. All right, cool. That was it actually  The one that I saw was a little bit longer than it really needed to be it was like seriously  Yes, that's cut this down to like a 30 second gag and maybe you've got something but this thing's like a minute and a half  No, no one's gonna watch watch this thing. So I don't know. Hey, I I did I did find it interesting though  that um that google is  Obviously firmly in the point fingers at apple in public, you know ways  to prove it's  You know, it's good and apple is not and whether you agree with that or not  Like we're seeing that more and more from google. It seems to be kind of their playbook  We saw it a lot with the rcs thing that continues  To go on where google keeps calling out apple in different different public places to say hey apple  Almost like they're waiting for the throngs of people behind them to be here. It's like hey everybody. Let's pile on apple  everybody  Come on  Everybody like exactly help me here. You know, I just don't know that it's helping  I don't know that apple will be swayed by the uh, by the people

Transcript:  It's like when will ferrell decided to go streaking and back to school and he thought he'd get everybody streaking down the street  But he was just pretty much just him by himself. That's exactly it  You know that that that whole campaign of of google pointing fingers at apple about  About the second class status of non apple, you know trying to get them to to support rcs in messages  Right at apple messages  Was so misguided apple has been for the last 10 15 years  In the perfect place to have the messaging platform  They could have the perfect cross-platform messaging platform they could put it on into android they could have but no  Instead they totally fumbled that ball again and again with having all these  Different platforms and then they would kill this one  But they still have a different version with the same name and I don't know how these work together and then they have rcs but these  Phones have an rcs-based messaging platform, but these don't and nobody knew what was going on  Nobody knew what was going on. I you know, I said it earlier in the show  Imagine if 10 years ago google said we're gonna have one messaging platform. It supports rcs. It supports  apple  Users, there's an there's a really great apple app that connects directly  If you are if if you're an apple user and you're tired of of seeing people who are not apple users show up in some sort  of second class  Place uh, then you use our app instead of messages  They could have totally owned that market and they screwed up  It was only their failure that led to the situation. They were complaining to apple about about rcs  And so that that was that's a perfect example of you know, it reminds me of the reddit thing  We have the ceo of reddit blaming the mods when in fact he's failing to make the company profitable to be innovative to to to monetize  uh  artificial intelligence data collection  so  you know  We I think the theme here so far is that  And the thing that reddit and google have in common is where's the leadership? Where's the vision? Yeah, yeah, you just don't have it

Transcript:  Yeah, because I don't know that the finger pointing is necessarily going to work  No, it's not  Yeah, I mean I guess the mac versus pc thing was was iconic for for apple back in the day so  It's not like that hasn't worked before but I just uh, yeah  I don't know  I don't know. I would love I would love though. I was reminded of this even just a couple of days ago  My my daughter was at a swim camp  and uh one of our  Her friend's mom was there to pick both of them up and you know  Saw my saw my daughter swim, uh swim race at the end of this four day long really, you know intensive swim camp  And she recorded it with her iphone  Which I realized when she sent me the video via text message and the video that I got was like a the size of a stamp  and when I blew it up like you  You could vaguely tell that there was a swimming pool in the image  But that was about the level of detail that you got  I'm just like I can't just I can't believe we're still here where you know how many years later  I'm getting a video from an iphone and it looks like it looks less than garbage  It doesn't even look potato like I could hardly you know, it was blue  It was like it was like five large blue pixels was the was the entire content of the video  And uh, jason, can I ask you a too soon question?

Yeah, i'm gonna stick with android. I have no reason to to bounce off of android  Dude, like am I making an end, you know to the end of life?  Allegiance to google on android phones. No, like i'm i'm open to whatever I need to use at whatever point  But i'm not  I'm not in a position right now where i'm like, okay great  Android shows done. You're not you're not saying oh i'm free at last to use an iphone. No, I actually really love my android phone  And I have continued to love my android phones and sure there are things that you know  That annoy me about them from time to time, but there would be things that annoy me about ios from time to time, too  Yeah, not to mention like my family mostly is on android. I guess my my older daughter  Uh, she got her phone  You know, she's 13 now she we gave her the ability to have a phone and I basically said i've got a drawer full of phones  Baby, you can just pick one  And it's yours and she's like well, I want an iphone  I was like, okay. Well, i've got a free phone here  It's yours if you want it if you want an iphone you gotta buy it and she bought it  She saved up her money and she bought one and she hasn't she's very happy  So I can't say we're an entirely android household. She has an iphone, but I give her full props  I was like a shiv to the heart  My own daughter, I don't care. I don't take any of this personally. You know what I mean? Like it's a phone  I know my daughter got a windows machine on my phone as she you know, if anyone on iphone does  It's just they don't talk very well to each other and that's what really pisses me off when when you're when you're when when she's

We you know, we had a talk about like, you know  She's she's also very  emotionally  mature and very very dialed into  Just being a kind person. She's a very kind person  and so we talked through these things and and really kind of I tried to imprint on her that like  You know  It's silly to see someone's bubble come through as green and to think that they are anything less than you and she's like  Oh god, why are you even telling me this? I know this like it's totally ridiculous  So, you know, maybe she's telling me what I wanted to hear but I truly believe that you know  that  If she was going to go down that road, hopefully i've given her the tools to not suddenly, you know  Be that kind of user because I think also I like I like that

Transcript:  Uh chromebook that's cruel. That's cruel. Give them something to kill in a couple years. Yes, exactly  Chromebooks chromebook x will it's probably a good thing. They're going to have a bunch of specs to  to uh to to aspire to for manufacturers so a certain amount of ram a certain quality of camera  It's going to be optimized. You know the the kind of guaranteeing that'll be good for video calls zoom calls, etc  uh, and um  minimum processor configurations, so it's it's it's a it's a it's a new standard that  uh hardware manufacturers will have to  Get to if they want to charge the higher price of the chromebook x. I think it's in general. It's a it's a good idea  Right now it's more nebulous. You know, there are high-end chromebooks low-end chromebooks  And uh now there's an actual material  tier that uh that  Consumers can can rely on to provide a certain degree of quality and that manufacturers can aspire to to to sell in the higher  Ache on so I think it's probably a good thing

Transcript:  I mean the the original pixel book I have to say that was a  It was a fantastic machine. I always loved loved working on that that computer  Um, and and I think my experience with that  Opened me up to the understanding that a higher end  Chromebook deserves to exist because that was a really wonderful  long-lasting performance  Chromebook. Yes, it's it's a browser computer  But still like it felt premium and it was enjoyable to use for that reason and sure it's not for everybody  but if you want to buy a high, you know a high, uh,  High spec'd probably more expensive chromebook x

Transcript:  I gotta say that I don't know if uh  You guys have talked about uh, the company sightful and its space top device  On this show or or or other shows on the twitter network  Sightful  This is a this is a direction i'd love to see  Google go in with chromebook. So sightful is an israeli startup that used to be called multinarity  and they  Recently released, you know, I don't know a thousand units  It's kind of like a beta program type thing of a device called a space top what they call an ar laptop  So basically what this thing is is it's a device about the size of a laptop, but instead of a screen it has  augmented reality glasses  That I believe are tethered  And so it's a it's unlike  apple's  ar product, um  This doesn't do all the things  It just gives you a virtual screen and a big one like a hundred inch screen floating in space in front of you  and then you run the apps it has a kind of a uh, uh, uh, uh,  customized  Operating system, but the operating system works like  A chromebook so it's all they're all cloud  Apps, right? It's not it's not it doesn't run windows or or any sort of desktop operating system  It has its own operating system runs cloud app. So you can run gmail all those kinds of things  I would love to see google get into this because it's a really great idea now the way that they've done the space top is  Is very clever. It actually has a port for plugging in a physical  display  But it doesn't come with a physical display just the glasses so you can use it as a regular  Device in your home office or in your workplace and then you can pick it up and you can go to starbucks  And you can use the goggles and you have a hundred inch screen

Start time: 6135.74
End time: 6211.59
Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  So it's the bottom the bottom half is like a regular laptop  It has ports like a regular laptop for for peripheral devices it uses bluetooth like a regular laptop  It connects to wi-fi like a regular laptop. The difference is the default mode is you put on  Ar goggles and you have this giant screen in front of you. And so  This would be a great  Direction for google google should have launched this product and they launched this before  apple launched the vision pro and of course the vision pro has the feature of showing you your  Your mac os  Applications floating in space, but it also does all these other things as well  That are more high and more  3d kind of  You know magic leap type stuff  But I love the idea of a cloud-based device like a chromebook that has  It's like a virtual laptop with a virtual screen. It's just very efficient. I think in terms of processor power  In terms of the low cost you could have in terms of the educational  Capabilities of having this virtual screen. We're entering into an era of augmented reality  And I would love to see chromebook go in that direction  Wouldn't that be amazing?

Transcript:  Wonder how high like  I think as  technology like this is dependent on  The screens that you're looking at being high res enough  That thing that that text that you're probably looking a lot at isn't isn't going to fall apart do you happen to know  like the demos seem to make it seem like like it's not a big deal, but  You know that it's sufficient as far as that's concerned, but I wonder how that actually works, you know

Start time: 6241.62
End time: 6305.88
Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  None of the none of the ar units are as high def as the vision pro that apple announced  But they're also not thirty five hundred dollars, right? And um, and so so these they're selling these at two for two thousand dollars each  And they're probably low  Much, you know much lower res than the vision pro, but  People who have tried it in person say that it's good enough and you can read text on it and you can do all those kinds  of things  Uh, and that you know, the the the the reviews of the hands-on reviews have been fairly positive  The biggest problem with with with this is this kind of a low power device  It doesn't have you know, it is battery operated, but the battery life is very low like I don't know just a few hours  Uh that kind of thing  But uh, I I really believe in this this idea of of of having a virtual screen  Uh within an optional physical screen and I I think it's it's ideal for google  But again, they're off in the weeds on this stuff and this is done by this tiny israeli startup  Is the first mover and it should have been google, I think

Start time: 6308.62
End time: 6365.80
Speaker: Jason Howell
Transcript:  Yeah, if only if only they had uh, you know  whatever, uh capitalized on their early early to market with a google glass and uh,  Taking that somewhere. I mean they were obviously too early. Um  But but they were there first I would say they were they were the major player that was there first  So that definitely accounts for something and now we're starting to kind of see the fruit the fruits of that  Happen now. I think it's still kind of though  You know at least in my mind it still needs to prove itself like even once the apple vision pro comes out  You know, I still am not entirely convinced that that's how I want to compute all the time  You know what? I mean? Like I don't know that I want to be an advisor  But maybe that's just because I haven't done it like maybe it would be great  Certainly find out two thousand dollars for that early access. That's interesting. Yeah, it very well could be great

Start time: 6365.98
End time: 6482.26
Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  But the the the big difference is that you know, the problem with google glass to a certain extent was that it wasn't  It was augmented reality, but it wasn't yeah  Uh, it was a head heads up display if you move your head the screen moves, right?  Whereas with the with both apple's product and the siteful product i've been talking about  The screen stays put and you move your head you look at different parts of the screen  That's the kind of ar for general computing that  Is makes a lot of sense and the beauty of this concept is that you know  uh  HoloLens and microsoft hololens and uh magic leap spent so much time figuring out how to anchor  Virtual objects in 3d physical real real space, right? You they they demonstrated  Characters stand not only standing on the table but hiding behind the table, right?  You have to map a 3d environment apple's vision pro maps the 3d environment  This product dispenses with all that the need for all that technology and it has its anchoring point  As exclusively being the laptop itself, so they have built-in hardware  Well, that's neat. I like that the screen to to anchor there and they don't have to map your 3d space. There's no mapping  It's just something that floats in space over the laptop  You can move it forward and back and stuff like that  but it's all it's all based on where the laptop physically is because they have some technology that that that tells the  Virtual space to to to sort of center itself over the laptop  And so, you know, I love the efficiency of that. It's a it's a new idea and it's not going to go anywhere  Unfortunately, because it's a tiny little israeli company  But I think uh, you know  I think google should buy them immediately if they're not with a year at least  You know within a year of launching a product like that of their own based on the chromebook operating system  So I I just I would love to see the vision pro have a lower cost  browser based competitor

Transcript:  I mean if if I said yes, then i'd be a total hypocrite because my youngest daughter is 10 and she loves  Uh playing in vr. I don't let her you know, she doesn't get a ton of time in vr  But yeah, absolutely, uh, and she started when she was nine. I mean screen. It's another screen. Yeah, totally  You know, but it's but it's been really interesting to watch her  Interaction with vr and how naturally I guess vr in a sense is supposed to come, you know  If they're doing it right, it comes naturally regardless  But you know, there's a what is it vacation simulator and job simulator?  And one of the joys of my life has been watching her  in the living room in like job simulator in the uh in the uh convenience store and because she's like  She's there, you know, and so you're just we're watching i'm watching her in the middle of my living room and to her  She's like, oh i'm just gonna go. Oh hot dog's done  Okay, yes one second sir, you know, it's like it's like she's playing with so I don't know I can't explain it  It's just it's so fun to watch her  Uh go into vr. So do I think that it's it's too low. No, I don't  I mean at the end of the day, how do the parents feel? You know the parent the the age requirement  Does stipulate that um that the kids will need permission from their parents to use the headset  I'm i'm not entirely sure how that's done. Does that tie into my meta account and then I grant access?  Probably so something along those lines, but um that makes sense to me unless there's some sort of like health  Reason, you know the reason that a kid that's 11 or 10 years old should not use it because their eyes are developing  And I feel like i've heard  Mixed reports as far as that's concerned. I don't really know exactly what the what the actual answer is there

Start time: 6639.08
End time: 6684.74
Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  And also it's a it's a benefit that the platform that meta has developed is not very compelling  To which I mean is not particularly addictive  Yet if they were really successful that they would have worlds that you just have to live in all the time in which case  Very very unhealthy for 10 year olds to be hours and hours and hours inside that world and in fact, you know  Social networks itself facebook itself. I believe the the age limit is still 13  Yep, uh, i'm a little creeped out by the idea of you know  Here's a company that's desperate for users and so like I know we'll go after younger kids  And I hope that's not a trend where all these things are for teenagers and and older  They're like well, let's go below the teenage year because then we'll just add a million people to the roster. Yeah

Transcript:  Well, yeah, I don't I don't know their their reason for doing it. What I do know is that i'm not alone  I have friends who also have kids who are definitely in this age bracket and they're using br  So the kids are already using br  um  So then it's like okay. So then is meta, you know, I don't know what their intention is necessarily  I would agree with you if that's their intention the hook em early and then you know  They're they're addicted for life sort of thing. Like I don't like that. That gives me an icky feeling but again  Ronald McDonald model  You know  My kid was already doing br  so if there's maybe a more official way, but I mean at the same time as I say this and I think about it like  It might just be easier for me to still do what i'm doing because like I don't care if she logs in under my account  She's not she's not managing an account that has any sort of longevity of her data or anything  She's just literally putting on the headset and going I want to play that game and she plays it for half an hour  And then she's done and that's what that seems to me way easier than creating an account worrying about the the data transfer  And what you know, what are they logging and what are they not logging and everything?

That's where I think being too young  You know in air quotes becomes kind of a sticky situation because this is like a full-on social  network in the sense that you know, I am standing in a room filled with  10 to 15 other kids who are on their headsets and some of them, you know are saying stuff they probably should not be saying and  Like what are the controls around that?  And of course you can go into rec room and you can set these controls that I as a parent can  Can set it and say no mic access. No, you know, you're not going to hear anyone else  You're just going to be able to gesture to them and everything  but there is a whole other dynamic there of like  This this perception of personal safety and protecting them from yes from those things that can be challenged

It feels a lot more immediate. It feels more personal  It's it has it has the potential to have an actual  kind of um  Impact on on you on it on it.

Yeah all that  100 um  How about the eu making user replaceable batteries, uh mandatory in 2027 when I read this  I had to pull out my motor on a droid  Let's see if I can pop the back off of here because if you remember back in the day  You know swapping out your battery used to be used to carry three of them with me.

Transcript:  Yeah, why are they concentrating on this now? Number one batteries last longer  In a day the last longer period they're smaller and designed into smaller units in ways that make them smaller  It just seems like it's a five-year-old battle that they've suddenly woken up to yeah, that is a good question

Start time: 7051.98
End time: 7069.58
Speaker: Jason Howell
Transcript:  I have no idea why they're suddenly cluing into it now other than  it seems like the eu recognizes  chum in the water when it comes to  Yes, uh big tech and uh and pushing through a heck of a lot of requirements and stuff and this is just yet another one

Start time: 7070.32
End time: 7210.18
Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Which now I can't I can't speak to the specific  Reason for this but I can  speak to the general idea that the eu is  Almost as prone to lobbying and so on as the u.s government  So whenever there's this big push against google or big push against  Whomever is usually the competitors of the target that are pushing the eu to go after that target  so in this case  You know this would be a disaster for apple especially uh, they would be less willing big time  uh to to have replaceable batteries and so  Uh could be google behind this could be any number of uh of companies, but it's usually uh lobbying the the eu  is a is a great place for for that kind of lobbying because they  Don't have a kind of computer science mindset when it comes to government action  They just think well  It's the government's job in society to set all the rules that and they  They diminish the role of norms. They diminish the role of private organizations  They diminish the the the role of consumer action and consumer choice and they just say well  Cell phones should have batteries. So we're just going to create a law around that, you know, that's how they think it's a it's a  it's a political culture  that is a very uh  Extreme in europe and doesn't really exist in in a lot of places to the extent that exists in europe  uh  It's unfortunate because the eu is such a huge market and they have some you know, they're deciding  Oh, you have to have a usbc cable and you have to have replaceable batteries. You have to have this and they're designing products  That that's true evolving quickly and they they're taking choice out of the hands of consumers  If I don't want a phone that doesn't have a replaceable battery, then I won't buy one  Right that that's you know, my sensibility as an american is that that's how it should work  right and uh  But you know, that's how they are  But they have so much power and so much weight and they are so unaccountable to to european citizens  That uh, there we are. They just they they  Decide that they're gonna they're going to be designing consumer electronics products

I think it's called  But it's basically just it's finding these little things that elon musk does  Uh related to twitter and it kind of exposes them because we you know, it's it's all  much of what he does is kind of lost in the soup, but he  He does this thing that is just so awful  where he'll  comment on a blatantly racist  Homophobic  transphobic or  antisemitic  tweet and he won't  He won't support it so so much as as go, huh  Somebody else makes this outrageous claim about you know, oh fowchie is conspiring with uh with I don't know  The martians to to to like, you know sort of set up these prison camps or you know, whatever it is  And he just he's like, huh like as if he's saying that's interesting.

I didn't do this do that  Why do it he's changed twitter's algorithm so that he gets  All the attention that everything he tweets is is is the highest ranking highest  uh, uh, you know most algorithmically boosted, uh  Stuff that's on twitter and then he uses it for that  Just to troll people with this non-committal  highlighting of  of of really oftentimes really ugly and objectionable  Uh tweets that other people that normally most of us twitter users would never encounter  Uh, I just it's just awful and I think he uh, he deserves a big  a big thumbs down for for that  Impulse that he has

Transcript:  Excellent, thank you very much for the horns  uh, so  A little grab bag of googly things that have happened in the last week or so ios chrome  So if you have uh, if you have  ios, you've got the chrome app they're going to be integrating little google maps and calendar and translate basically integrating some of  uh, some of google's other services into  chrome on ios I suppose that is a big deal for those of you on ios to  to have that but you know what I always see these stories and I I put them in there just because  I don't want it to always seem like the only google  That I put in the changelog has to do with android. So there you go  There you go ios. Is this a big deal only you would know because I don't use ios, but  There it is. Uh, what is project tailwind? This is an ai project tailwind is very interesting

Start time: 7702.36
End time: 7786.21
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We saw it and you saw it you were there for god's sakes that uh, and i'm so jealous. You were an io  but basically  The way to think about it is that you have a whole folder of stuff and you can say tailwind makes sense of this  Oh, that's right back  And here's what's interesting stephen johnson who's a really well known author who's written all kinds of amazing books  um  I gotta remember what they are  Is actually working on tailwind he wrote about this. I put it in the rundown a couple weeks ago. We didn't we didn't get to it  but he's written um  extra life and  enemy of all mankind  And farsighted and wonderland and how we got to now and future perfect steven's a brilliant author  And he's been working with him on this. So it's the it's the perspective of an author  Saying I have all this research. I have all these files  I have this stuff and it's whether you're an author or a company or whoever  And being able to use tailwind to help you organize it is a really interesting use of ai because it's not making crap up  It's trying to make sense of the crap you have  Okay, so I can't wait to get in on it and they haven't yet because I was saying to steven when he when I saw this  Oh, hey steven, uh, nice guy here. Let me in they haven't let anybody in yet  Because I signed up for it immediately as soon as we saw i.o  Um, but i'm really excited about tailwind  Well, this is going to be a real boon for people on twig

Transcript:  Uh hosts and guests on twig where you can have a rundown and sometimes  Where you can have a rundown and sometimes some of the stories on the rundown are very simple straightforward. Some of them are incredibly complex  And this would be an opportunity to put in five or six articles  into a folder  From the rundown and just basically have tailwind  You know, give me a summary on this and what's the consensus on this and who are the players or who would do it?  That sort of thing, you know, it's very nice on a podcast to be able to call up  information, you know and  You know  chat tbt is worthless because for this sort of thing because it's its most recent  Content is from what 2020 2021 something like that  whereas uh, some project tailwind can be  Something, you know news that broke an hour ago  You can drop into a new folder and get chat tbt like answers from it  Or get some sort of high level clarity about it  Which is great when you're running your mouth on a podcast. So this is going to be a great feature for that

I'm going to put a bookmark on that talk about that in a little bit  But what this reminded me of you mentioned google i.o. I realized I haven't been on this show since I was at google i.o  right and  Thought that you might appreciate  Uh at least while I was there I got to check out, uh the project, uh star starlight star line starlight  What is it the with the booth where you sit down and the booth? Yeah, yeah  In front of someone on the other side. Yeah, and yes exactly the three-dimensional kind of in the box  of a zoom conference thing and it was awesome  I have to say it was one of the highlights of my time there because I was really curious about it when they announced it  I think the year or two before  Um, you know, it just kind of like it checked the boxes for me. I was like, oh wow, you know virtual but  But in person like it feels like you're there. So it made a difference  Oh, yeah, it was super cool. I mean it wasn't perfect. But I mean there there was a part like I think what was weird for me  was that  There is no camera that is facing you directly right the cameras are all around and they're kind of stitching together this 3d  Uh image of you for the person on the other side  But when you're sitting there, I mean you're making full eye contact with the person on the other side of the screen and they are  The right size there's dimensionality to them  the way that the booth was set up had this kind of like  The bottom of the tv screen because obviously it is a tv instead of it looking like a tv  They put in your peripheral view this like curved  Uh, I don't know this curved platform that blocked the bottom of the tv  But it was curved because it helped to kind of tie in with the three-dimensional view of the  The person that you're looking at almost like they were like right on the other side of that little  That little platform thing and just the whole experience was just really compelling and really convincing to my eyes  At one point he held out an apple to me and like I really felt like I could grab that apple  I was like, whoa, you know, and then we did a fist bump and I didn't feel the fist but  I felt like I should you know, it was just it was really cool.

Transcript:  The killer thing about starline by the way is that it's it's something akin to  apple's  vision pro  Concept when you're doing a sort of 3d facetime where they map the other person's faces map that becomes an avatar  uh  But this is without glasses and in both cases  Very crucial you make eye contact with the person you're talking to. Yeah, so this is one of the problems with  zoom right now  In addition to the fact that you're looking at a wall of people if you have 12 people on the call  There's 12 people looking at you  Yeah, and then when you're talking to people you're looking down or you're looking somewhere else besides in eye contact a very important  Psychological for people so these these virtualizing avatar based technologies that enable you to look somebody in the virtual eyes  Is going to be much more comfortable and this whole zoom fatigue thing is going to someday be a thing of the past

It was almost  Like it was comfortable and familiar like I don't have problems looking people directly in the eye when I talk to them in person  I know some people that makes them feel uncomfortable to do that for extended period of time  I don't really have that problem  But when I was in there, I noticed I wanted to look away at times and I think part of the reason was  Because it was a screen and it wasn't a true like in-person representation  It just felt so different from what i'm used to when I look at a screen  That's something about the guy who was hired to do this job

See this is the problem  They've changed the damn name of this thing so many times. I don't even know what new news is  Has it always been google wallet, I don't know but it was at some point so it is again  There we go  So confusing. Um, oh, I mean, I don't know if this is a change log worthy  Um, or if this is even where it went but uh pixel tablet reviews have uh,  That the embargo lifted a couple of days ago and I I just thought it sounds like the majority of people are  Are kind of like mixed bag with this thing like really the guardian gave it a rave  Some some excellent reviews as far as it being a pretty solid tablet device  I think some of the criticism comes in the fact that google  Is see appears to be marketing this as yes a tablet but also a smart home controls device  And I think some people who are reviewing this device see it as a smart home a replacement for their current smart home controls device  Or their smart display like a nest hub display  um, and they're not the same like they do some of the same things but it's not a  Apples to apples comparison as far as what they can do and how they do it  And so I think they're let down by the fact that hey, this should be a better  smart hub than it is if this is how google is positioning it so  That seems to be what people are disappointed about if they are but I mean I I had some hands-on time with it at google i.o  It's a nice feeling like I don't have it in my hands now  I didn't buy one but the device feels really nice like it like it's got a nice kind of uh soft  Uh touch to it. It's very curvy. So it's comfortable to hold the way it snaps into the magnet  Base is super satisfying. It just like  snaps right into place that magnet catches it and the pogo pins attach so  It's interesting. Um

Start time: 8351.78
End time: 8365.82
Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  It feels to me like it's it's like a smart display that can you can just pick it up and use it as a tablet, right?  And um, and that's kind of a nice idea. It's also got a really good price  It's like 500 bucks 500 bucks with the base which I think is really important

Start time: 8366.24
End time: 8432.76
Speaker: Jason Howell
Transcript:  I think if I had heard 500 and then the base is only 129 dollars be like no way, but yeah, it's included  Thankfully, that's kind of part of the kit. So  Um, yeah built in chromecast  Yeah, I think maybe maybe the confusion or the dissatisfaction is like what is this meant to do  First is it a tablet first? Is it a smart display first and depending on how you buy into it?  That you could either be happy or disappointed based on how you enter into that because if you're entering into it as a smart display  Replacement you might be disappointed by what you get  Um  And then we've got the pixel fold shipping date apparently slip in a little bit  I don't know that this is is this a  Official word from google that these things are are slipping june 27th  Was the same day that verizon provided?  Uh not starting until june 20th. So oh, okay. So then does that mean that it's  Shipping out. Oh, no, I see  That's what it was originally supposed to be and now it's slipped to june 28th and july through july 7th

Transcript:  So so different different types of phone form factors  That have come out there have been multiple screens where like there'll be a folding phone with a screen on the outside  So you have a big flexible screen then you have another screen  these screens  By themselves and also the electronics that support them  Contain all kinds of toxic metals all all the things that you know make smartphones  An environmental problem but far more of them and what we don't know is how long do they last?  Uh, we we're we you know, we don't know for example do these folding  Screen phones last for five six years  Um, they're always being folded and bent and stuff like that or do they have like half the shelf life of a  Of a standard phone. We don't know my guess is that they have a much shorter  Life, they're much more likely to be damaged to wear out all that kind of stuff  And there's a lot more screen real estate and in some cases there's yet another screen  There's there's a giant screen and a smaller screen and all of this adds up to the idea that  You know smartphones are already problematic but these folding screen phones and extra screen phones  Are like twice as bad for the environment  Uh or more even even worse than that because they may not last nearly as long  They might not be as repurposable and they have a lot more of the toxic metals  Inside of them that that that all smartphones have so I don't know time will tell yeah

What what cities is that coming to I didn't open it up amsterdam dublin florence venice  Um already in new york city san francisco london tokyo los angeles  So, you know, they're focusing on oh and plans to support 15 cities in total. That's berlin las vegas miami paris seattle san jose  So they're expanding this but that's neat. I will look forward to using that  we were talking about maps as being one of those apps and services that  Is usually just you know google knocking it out of the park and doing really cool innovative things  It's one of my absolute all-time favorite apps  For for android, so i'm always curious to see what they do there  and then finally  um  trying on clothes with  google's ai it's a new shopping feature so that  I'm assuming you can

Transcript:  Basically how it works is is that this is I believe that they're going to roll this out to retailers. So nordstrom  Other retailers will have it and basically what you do is you pick from a menu of body types  so  You basically find have all these you know dozens and dozens of models that have you know short tall  Big small all that kind of stuff and you pick the body that most closely resembles yours  And then it's a platform for the retailers to essentially  Uh capture the image of the actual clothing inventory that they have in their inventory  and then the technology takes that and  makes the fabric  Hang on the body it clings in the way clothes would it it moves and folds and wrinkles and all the stuff that the way clothes actually  do rather than being this paper doll kind of thing that just kind of  Uh holds holds a two-dimensional image of the clothes in front of the in front of the body so  It sounds like they're doing all the right things  To reach the kind of nirvana  We've been talking about for many many years of being able to virtually try on clothes in a compelling way  And so they have uh, they're rolling out with a number of partners that are going to be doing this and it's this could actually be a really  interesting  Application of technology that helps people shop online and it'll be a real boon for online sales of clothes.

Transcript:  Fantastic, I have a very very simple one that ties into the first story we talked about which is reddit  a lot of uh a lot of mods  on reddit are  protesting  By various means one of them is they're duplicating the subreddit on other platforms  and this is happening at a fairly large scale and so  Somebody has created a website called sub.rehab  Sub.rehab now. This is a place that tells you where your favorite subreddits have gone  So they may be discord servers or some other kind of site, but it takes you through all of the  Uh the subreddits that have moved somewhere  in I guess uh alphabetical order and you can find the ones that you like, you know are  Anti-work are apple etc. And in some cases these uh,  These subreddits have gone to multiple places and in many cases they're duplicating  Kind of the look and feel of the subreddit. So they're they're trying to to to retain  In some cases as much of the functionality of reddit on these other platforms  As they had on reddit itself. So this is a great place if you're a  Reddit fan, this is a great place to go and find out where  Else besides reddit you can find your favorite subreddits

Start time: 9080.92
End time: 9100.44
Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  And I think there's been a lot of porting as well, but in either case  You may find your favorite  Subreddit is closed or I'd say for work or or affected in some way  But you might be able to find it  Via this site and and engage with it and and be a continue to use it as you did before but not on reddit

Sorry for you folks who are on audio, but you can go to it at your leisure  And so some he comes up with logos that look like wildflowers. It's just design trends. Well, they're called blow blend  um, what's the uh,  another one is um  Spirals  Uh, this doesn't work so well for audio. I realize uh wire forms ball caps  What was the name fills which is just names filling a space in different ways  And so the guy goes through he's obviously a logo designer and a consultant  Uh, but he goes through all kinds of logos in a year and it is fun to see  The trends that exist. So that was all nice and simple

Speaker: Jason Howell
Transcript:  Yeah, a little nice little carousel pretty kind of  Swapped through them and it quickly flashes through the different examples of each each type to give you a sense of what falls into that category  uh  Yeah, there you go  And oh and and it dates back. So you if you want to you go to 2009 check out the trend report or even 2000  I think it goes as far back as 2003  2003 boy those logos those are dated actually I saw tivo in there it is dated  That was probably a cutting edge logo back in 2003 was the tivo logo  The little tv with the eyes and the arms and everything  cool stuff logo trend report, um, so my pick I think I just wanted to  make mention of the fact that last night's  Episode of all about android was the last episode of all about android, which was  Definitely bittersweet. Um, but we had a wonderful  wonderful episode we actually  for  For a number of years now on the show this recurring theme of a hall of fame  For android kept coming up and we had joked around time and time again about someday in the future  We're gonna do an episode that is, you know  The android hall of fame we're gonna do it right and blah blah  Well, it only took ending the show for us to finally do that. So it's a very long  long episode  but we had I had a ton of devices out on the table and we  you know compiled a list of some of the devices that we thought would deserve to be in the android hall of fame and we  Kind of debated all of them and anointed our hall of fame, uh winners as far as that's concerned and then  You know said farewell to the show and  Got a little teary got a little emotional primarily because we've just been we've been doing that show for 13 years  And uh, it's a I mean I can speak for myself  It's a show that's been near and dear to my heart for that entire time  It's been a total fun hang session with some really great friends all of us talking about something that we care  passionately enough about to talk about it for 13 years week after week every tuesday night and uh  You know, it's it's worth watching if you haven't if you haven't checked all about android in a while  I think it was I think we did the show justice with our episode last night  I'm really proud of the way it turned out because I think it was just a really fun  Uh look back at android not necessarily the show as much although we had a little bit of that at the end  But um, I don't know, you know worth saying goodbye to a show that's been on this network almost as long as i've been here.

Speaker: Jason Howell
Transcript:  What's going on? Oh my god. No, um, it's just all about android all about android  You know the numbers had been lagging actually  I think this is an interesting topic for this show is I think just in general smartphone as an innovation smartphone as a thing  To be passionate about interesting, you know 10 years ago  Like we were looking when I was looking through past episodes and like my favorite years and everything like that  2013 was actually a really great year  There was tons of innovation happening in phones google was was firing on all cylinders with android  There was a lot to get excited about because there's a lot that we hadn't already seen and there was plenty of  Innovation still to be had and i'm not saying that it's completely tapped out when it comes to smartphones  But I am saying that it's pretty ubiquitous at this point. Everybody has a smartphone. Everybody has a side  There's not a whole lot that companies are doing now with smartphones that are very surprising save for maybe the foldables and  You know other things some of it feels kind of gimmicky like we've got to we've got to innovate  So let's do this thing. I don't know, you know it  I don't know. I I just feel like the passion around smartphones has kind of dissipated a little bit  There are other things that people are getting that excited about in different directions  And I don't know that it's necessarily smartphones the way it used to be and I think that showed in our numbers  over the last handful of years  so not a whole lot you can do about it i'm i'm convinced that we  That we were creating as strong of a show there at the end of its run  Than we ever had you know what I mean? Like I know we had very smart people  We had as much fun if not more fun than we've than we've had and that's always been a really big marker that show is  We're together to hang out and be friends and make jokes and also talk about this thing that we all kind of unite on which  Which is the android platform and I think we did that till the very last episode. So

Transcript:  Great show. Thank you. Jason. So the very well done. Thank you. I I really do appreciate that. Um  Just to reiterate i'm not going anywhere. I'm here at twit at twit. Um my plan now  Um because leo and lisa, you know, they didn't want to kill the show  But it just seemed like it was time  And they also wanted to kind of like challenge me like okay. What do you do if you're not doing all about android anymore?  What do you want to do?  And I mean like without even thinking I knew exactly what I wanted to do. It was like I want to do an ai show  I want to do a show that's focused on ai  Um, I don't know how that's going to materialize. I know the thing that i'm not as interested in is like  Platform like a panel discussion show about the news and events happening in the world of ai  What sam alton's doing now? We don't care totally like like I think we cover that on the network  What I talked about earlier, um, and I made mention of this  Just a little bit ago was in tailwind when you were talking mike about kind of using that technology  For producing shows  That's the kind of stuff that really intrigues me  How can we as people as just everyday people not people who know how to  You know the open source community know how to hack together these ai generating systems or whatever  Maybe some of that of course  But how can we use what is available to us in the world of ai?  To improve our life or to make this part of our job easier or to create images, you know  I'm a horrible graphic designer  But I can create things if I know the right words and the right prompts to do it  Like it's opening these doors that I don't think we have to be scared necessarily  About it with the the potential of ai to take our you know  Take over our jobs and ruin the world and everything like that. I think we're going to be okay  How can we use these things to do some really cool things in our lives to?  To I don't know to find more satisfaction in in what we do and how we do and all these things  So that that's what excites me and that's what I think i'm going to kind of focus my my efforts on

Transcript:  I know I know I would love to do that and I will definitely be in touch with you jeff because I know you've  You've mentioned wanting to kind of be involved in something around ai  With twit and you know  The opportunity is here now. Uh, it wasn't before I don't know that leo and lisa were  Were as willing to start a new show about ai prior. Um, but with all about android no longer  Now I have the time and the you know the ability to focus on starting something like that up so I will be in touch  Absolutely  We'll see if anyone has any ideas of what you would love to see out of an ai show  I would love to hear from you jason at twit tv  Let me know because i'm i'm all ears. I'm i'm in development stage right now and i'm starting from the beginning  Which is a little intimidating because there's a lot I don't know about ai  But I think that's the fun is to do a show where I learn about it with you, you know  And we can learn about it together. So  Anyways, that's my good work, sir. Thank you  Um, and thanks for all the support all around. I've just had so much support from people today  So it's been really wonderful to hear that  But we have reached the end of this show and it's not going anywhere.

Transcript:  Okay, so so as as you mentioned earlier, we do gastronomic experiences. These are  exquisite food and wine and  gastronomic  Adventures of which you cannot even describe. They're they're really fantastic. They're all sold out this year  For the rest of the year except for we have a room for mexico city  So I would like to invite everybody to do that mexico city, which is happening november 13th through the 18th  Just one week  And then we have a brand new one. We've never done before in january in al salvador al salvador  Is an amazing beautiful delicious tropical country and that experience is happening january 20th through the 26th  It's gonna be relaxing. There's gonna be a lot of beach time. There's gonna be a lot of  uh  tropical rainforest  Exploration there's gonna be a lot of eating and drinking and having fun  so I'd invite everybody to to join us on that the other quick thing I wanted to mention simply because  We've been talking a lot about both ai the future of ai and also how?  Advanced technologies affect children  Anyone who's listened to the show before knows that my son kevin has a company called chatterbox  It's a it's a smart speaker that kids put together themselves  Then they teach it what to say and in the process they learn what ai is and how it works  And he's been preaching the gospel of preparing kids for the future of ai  For many years long before chat tbt or any of this stuff  But now that now that the sort of the ai world has crashed into mainstream culture  People should know that  chatterbox now supports chat tv t in a child-friendly way and also  Uh the the the image version of that, uh via stable diffusion. So kids  Uh, as you know stable diffusion is done all with voice with text prompts  With chat with chatterbox they can children can create a skill  and then generate images with voice so they  Tap the button on the top and they they give the prompt and they get back the pictures  And again, the purpose is not to create pictures  The purpose is for them to prepare to live in the future that they'll actually live in which is a future where ai is utterly ubiquitous  And so i anybody who's an educator in the school system or a parent  I would I would encourage you to go to hello chatterbox.com and check this out because this is really  um, this is how we prepare kids for the future of ai not by banning it not by  uh  Pretending it doesn't exist but by getting kids  Hands on ai the hardware the software all of it and letting them know what it is  So they're ready for the future that's super cool
