Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Great to see you too.  Happy Wednesday.  From San Diego.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, you seem chipper.  I guess Edda is sleeping through the night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My wife did the late night sleeping.  So I got a full night's sleep.  I feel great today.  I feel like a new woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You never appreciate sleep so much  as when you have a newborn baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Every other day I get a good night's sleep.  Good.  That's awesome.  I know that feeling.  But I'm doing great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yay.  Also here, Jeff Jarvis.  Jeff, like me, probably hasn't had a good night's sleep  in years.  No.  The kids grow up and then you're just old.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's no longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't blame the kids anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's like they trained you to wake up.  And then they grow up and sleep till like one  in the afternoon and you're up at 6 AM going, where is she?  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My wife still gets up earlier than I do.  But I go to bed a lot later than working.  Last two nights, last two days, I was at work from 7 AM  till 11 30 PM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, man.  And you've got stamina, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that your professoring or is it something else  that you're doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just stuff adds up, events.  I did a talk last night for a new company called  To Gather, which enables authors to organize their own events,  which is very cool.  So I was going to say, no, it was a wonderful thing they did.  So I was there.  And then the debate came on.  I rushed to get into my car, which I parked in New York  so I could listen to the debate.  I realized listening wasn't good enough.  So I pulled off on the turnpike at a rest stop,  which is a depressing thing to do in New Jersey,  and watched it on my Nexus 7 the whole time,  sitting there in the parking lot and tweeting  like some kind of crazed fool.  And so I get home late.  I'm still wired.  And I'm to bed late and up at 5.30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To Gather, sounds like, Ted, you proposed on this show  the idea that authors could sort of organize their own book tours?  Jeff, so it's kind of like one of your ideas come to life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is very cool.  When they get depressed, they say, well, we look at this blog post  you wrote.  We say, well, this guy says it's a good idea.  Yeah, it's a very cool guy who worked on the prior Mars edition.  Expedition and wrote a book about it, or really wrote a book about it,  and was embedded in it.  And after his book tour and the mess that it is,  he decided to start this company called To Gather.  It's a cool name.  And they have, I think, four or five employees now.  And they're enabling authors to either sell books or get gate fees  or do it for free or go with companies to these events.  And we talked more about other new ideas last night.  It's very cool.  It's very neat, yeah, to see something like that come alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of Mars, we have...  What a transition.  Coming up next show, Triangulation,  we are going to talk to the lead scientist on the Curiosity Mission.  Coolo, coolo.  Yeah.  That's a great interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a great interview.  I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So exciting.  Yeah, thank you to, I think it was Karsta Bonda, you got that.  So thank you, Karsta.  Nice job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Next week, I'll have Felix Baumgartner, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're trying.  We talked to, actually on Twitter on Sunday, right after the jump,  we talked to Scott Gillies, who was the production manager,  the guy who got the video and all the stuff.  Because that was, to me, that was the most amazing.  You know, falling out of a balloon.  I mean, brave, but it's really the achievement was all the technology around.  It was pretty amazing.  So, Scott, in fact, if you didn't hear that interview,  it's in the beginning of Twitter from last Sunday.  Scott Gillies was, I can't remember what his exact title was,  something like lead production manager, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You just mentioned that event, my palms start pouring.  I know.  I confess, when I was up visiting Twitter, that, now I'm admit this to the whole world,  there was a barrier between me and getting to Twitter,  which is my fear, my worsened fear of bridges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you get like nervous when you're on a bridge?  Are you afraid it's going to collapse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or I'm going to go over the edge or something.  It's vertigo, right?  But it's, and it's weird.  I never liked them, but I've gotten worse in the last couple of years.  And so, and the anticipation of knowing that I had to go over the Golden Gate  to get to you, Leo, you matter so much.  Oh, wow.  Leave? Yeah, it's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's an interesting, it's a phobia, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you get dizzy, Jeff?  Do you actually get dizzy or does the vertigo is just the kind of the fear, the height?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to breathe deep to not like my fear is that I'll pass out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, right.  I never passed in my life, but.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And besides that, Doc.  First time ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, it's earthquake country.  So were you here in 89 when the bridge fell in?  I shouldn't bring this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I, Leo.  X-Nay on the.  Never mind, I didn't say a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What bridge? What earthquake?  I'm not going over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There hasn't been a good news.  There hasn't been an earthquake in New York City in about 150 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem when you when you're from the East Coast  and you come to the West Coast, like one of my family's big arguments was like,  but there are earthquakes there.  Yeah. Like, you know, so I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe there's a fairly hefty fault going right through Manhattan.  I may be wrong.  But but historically, Manhattan is not free of earthquakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's been.  Son Jake said he experienced his first earthquake in Boston.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, this summer there was an earthquake in Boston.  Is that weird?  So just want you to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's this week in our neuroses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Let's talk about Google.  And we're going to start with our new feature,  Gina Trapani with the change log.  The very old change.  Well, hey.  It really is overdoing it, I think.  Beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that is such a cool intro.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So every we decided we started this last week.  And thanks to who who did the intro, the intro

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  audio was made by Jesse Weisner.  And then I made the video and you did that.  Thank you. Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very cool. So we decided that we don't we talk about Google,  but maybe we should just every week summarize all the new stuff  because there's always something new from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's there's always new product updates.  Some of the minor, but we like to run down the list.  This week, we've got drag and drop up to upload folders  in Google Chrome to Google Drive.  So you've had the ability to drag a file into Chrome  in order to add it to your drive.  But now you can drag and drop an entire folder.  You just have to use the latest version of of Chrome to do that.  And of course, you can use the Chrome desktop app as well.  Android Jelly Bean 4.1.2, it's the incremental upgrade.  We talked about last week it was rolling out over the air to the Nexus 7.  This week, it's rolling out to the Nexus S and the Galaxy Nexus.  It's mostly performance updates to build improvements, bug fixes.  But the one change you will notice is that the home screen  and the lock screen will rotate into landscape.  Oh, right now, it's just.  See, Jeff has it. He's showing on screen there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I got it on my Nexus 7 yesterday, I think.  I was. Yeah. So I haven't got my Galaxy Nexus yet,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but should be coming out to the Galaxy Nexus.  This is why you want a Nexus, folks. Right.  I've been tooting the Nexus horn horn for a while now.  You get all the new stuff sooner.  Google Street View increased its coverage by 250,000 miles  and its biggest update yet.  They also doubled their number of special collections.  New Street View coverage in a bunch of different countries,  Macau, Singapore, Sweden, Thailand, Taiwan, the US.  If you go to maps.google.com  slash Street View, you can take a tour of their new stuff.  They've got a cool little dynamic page there that Leo is showing us.  And finally, our friend Matt Cutts introduced a webmaster tool.  This is more for web publishers than developers,  but kind of interesting in the link economy to point out.  It's called Disavow Links.  If your site has been linked to by sites of ill repute or spammy links  and your site is suffering from, you know, search engine ranking,  it's getting ranked lower because it's got these spammy links  and you haven't been able to get those links removed from those sites.  You can actually go to this tool, disavow these links.  You can upload a text file of domains and URLs  where these bad links are coming into your site and say, hey,  we want nothing to do with them.  And there's a nice video from our friend, Matt,  to explain disavow links a little bit more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Gina, is there any kind of automated way  to let you know who the bad linkers are so that you can kind of  is there was a very manual process?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this hasn't happened to me, but I think as a webmaster, like you do,  you will get a notification from Google, like if you've been demoted  because you've got links from sites that have been, you know,  who reads their email? Come on.  I don't know. I'm not sure if it's an email notification  or if it's like a Google Analytics notification or what.  But I believe that webmasters are this hasn't happened to me,  but I believe that you are notified when you're suffering  from demotion because of sites of ill repute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because all your all your users say, I don't see you on the Google anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Well, right. Where did you go?  So so you do get an idea.  If I think those sites do get pointed out to you, if they're particularly bad.  Hmm. But I get I get the impression  this is a fairly manual process right now.  I mean, you literally you have to make a text file and upload it to this tool.  So you have to care of me paying attention in order to use this tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we also have an alternate open from a guy named Alter.  Itai Alter. Should I play it?  Well, here I have it. OK, let's see it.  I like that. That's a little more classy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not. It's not saying the other one is a little.  That's the outro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have an intro and an outro.  You can easily do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where's the first one is more like a TNT video, right? Right.  And remember, this is the show that begins with the two.  It's a more classy kind of a show.  It's a more classical kind of a show.  Yeah, I don't know.  You know, it's genius. Well, let's check it out again.  Now, of course, the problem with this one is if you're listening  only on audio, all you hear is boom, boom, boom, boom.  You don't know what's coming.  The other one at least says, do you want to hear it? Yeah.  Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little Shrekky. I like cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I particularly like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People who are listening can't see, but there's a there's a change log.  And one says that there's a bug found in Leo salad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I'm having soup today.  I think from the audio audience,  probably the trumpets is probably the better choice,  because at least as Google change log and there were audiences, mostly audio.  Yeah. Believe it or not, still, it's changing.  You know, it's very interesting to watch.  It's like moving.  It's like a locomotive slowly taken off from the station,  watching the video start to climb frost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's going to be exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And some of the shows they have iPad today is mostly video, I think.  I can't remember.  But, you know, the good news is that at least it's going that up, not  go the right direction. Yeah.  But we do have to I have to constantly remember.  And it's not an easy thing because I'm seeing it.  That there's people who most of our audience who's just hearing it.  So I got to God bless you. Everyone. God bless everyone.  Your cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just to answer Jeff's question earlier about whether or not, you know,  the message from Google is if you've ever been caught up in link span,  you see you'll see a message in Webmaster Tools about unnatural links  pointing to your site.  We send you this message and we see evidence of paid links,  link exchanges or other link schemes that violate our quality guidelines.  So you do get a notification in Webmaster Tools about the sites  that are linking to you that are considered spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you know that Google Guards, its top secret data center,  was Stormtroopers.  There's a little now we could talk about this because Google has kind of thrown  open the doors are beautiful pictures, but there's also a street view now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of a Google product.  You're connecting to one of our data center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the Lenoir North Carolina data center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a look inside and see how they work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This a video, but you could do this by hand.  I don't know. I didn't find the NDA.  It's not that secret, apparently.  In the Wired article, it's great.  They talk about first the first Google data center,  which was in San Jose at the Exodus, was the Colo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what a mess it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is not a mess.  This is a model of engineering.  It uses the water pipes.  Yeah, I love that.  In the cooling system, the water pipes are Google colored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if it's in the video or not, but it's on the site.  I put the link up to the site as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really anal geeks plus lots of money equals beautiful, beautiful data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you want to data, you know, cooling is everything.  In fact, they talk about the vast amount of power used by data centers.  It was something like one and a half percent of all the electrical power  in the US is used by data centers.  Look at the stack of hard drives.  They're destroying the hard drive with a giant drill press.  Because they don't want anybody to know what you've been looking for.  This town, before it became known as the data center capital of the US,  was a famous for furniture making.  All that North Carolina furniture came from there.  So there's big spaces.  Yeah. So Urs Holzer, who is the engineer who designed these data centers,  was had never before designed a data center.  He was on leave as a computer science professor at UC Santa Barbara in 1999.  There you go. Look at the wires.  This is the slideshow on the Google site.  There's all the hard drives.  When his new employers, I'm reading from the Stephen Levy article in Wired,  when his new employers took him to the Exodus Server facility in Santa Clara,  Exodus was a co-location site or colo where multiple companies rent floor space.  They look at there. There's the colorful cooling pipes.  Google colored. I just you know what?  The first thing I think of is somebody had to paint all those pipes different colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, it looks like a jungle gym.  It looks like a playground.  It's like that bike there. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's cage sat next to servers from eBay and other blue chip internet companies.  But the search company's array was the most densely packed and chaotic.  Brinn and Page were looking to upgrade the system,  which often took a full three and a half seconds to deliver search results  and tended to crash on Mondays.  I think Matt Cutts mentioned that once.  There was something that happened and they never figured it out.  But Mondays, it was just everything would crash. Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hmm. Because of a spike in traffic, search traffic or it was probably a memory leak of some kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's just one day's is when you is what you do.  You never put up a new version on Friday.  Maybe maybe they were just popping up new versions on Mondays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The spiders were extra busy.  Exodus was a huge mess.  It's a later recalled and the cramped hodgepodge would soon be strained even more.  Really, they had they were ready to launch AdWords.  I mean, just the growth and I'm thinking about Facebook to the growth of these.  We forget, you know, when you have 800 million or now a billion users  hitting your servers, that's a lot of servers, not just a lot of bandwidth.  That's a lot of hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's mind boggling, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was Google the first to get to such scale with just doing pizza boxes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the generic I think Google.  I remember vividly when Google published the first pictures of its.  Remember the modular thing they were building in containers  and they didn't put they didn't enclose the servers for cooling purposes.  They didn't have them.  They were just kind of sitting open.  I think it was Google that did that first. Google. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, their approach was to never spend a lot of money on high end stuff.  Their approach was always to design for failure and use a lot of cheap equipment,  but but have a ton of redundancy.  So if one went out, it didn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google made advances in this actually great article.  If you're kind of an if you're kind of a data geek,  the article in Wired is great.  Water cooling issues and.  This Google's notorious for getting the lowest possible.  Energy usage, a perfectly effective, a perfectly efficient data center  would get a score of one.  Experts considered a two, meaning that half the power was wasted  in heat and other stuff would be a reasonable number.  Google gets about one point to very close to perfect efficiency.  It's kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was the first time we've ever been allowed to see. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Inside a data center, they treat these like their top secret.  I'm not sure why, really.  I don't know why either. Are they terrorist targets?  What would you learn by seeing that?  Yeah, I know.  Doesn't show you how to get in.  Of course, the the the numbers are mind boggling  when you realize that that Felix Baumgartner jump on Sunday  was viewed by eight million people simultaneously on YouTube.  Not only a new record for streaming video, but it broke the old record.  Just kind of like Baumgartner broke the old record by a factor of 16.  Yeah, the previous record was half a million during the Olympics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's not forget that there was some complaint that one guess is that a lot  of that was served or optimized through Akamai.  Right. It wasn't all Google.  Which is fine. I mean, it's only a small way to offload to closer closer to.  Right. CDN.  Table terms, the head ends of the nodes and to get it distributed out there  is just a better architecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, Google scale is part of their competitive advantage. Right.  I mean, that's how many other companies could do it.  Could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is Amazon as good at scale?  No, I guess it's different, different kind of scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember talking to an early Amazon engineer.  Where was that? Oh, it was at a food camp.  He was like employee three.  And he talks about the day they moved the Amazon servers.  He threw it in the back of his car  drove across town and he said, as I was driving,  I'm thinking I have all of Amazon in my trunk.  Couldn't do that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Scale is better in a different way, you know, for optimized for what they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, Amazon sells scale, you know, they they they they sell Amazon  and EC2 and I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they do that, right, because the holiday time, you know,  like they have all the scale that they have to be ready for,  you know, the one month or two months a year and people are buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's interesting. That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then the rest of the time, it's sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how CompuServe got started.  Really? H&R Block used a lot of computing power during tax time  and it was unused the rest of the year.  So they said, well, we should do something with that.  We've got these mainframes. What do we do?  And they started CompuServe.  That's one of the first online services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What happened in April, though, when they did need that power?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or in Christmas to EC2, I guess.  At some point, it becomes a business and you don't I don't know.  Yeah. But that was that was a whole idea of the early days  of computing with time sharing, right, that no one user would need a mainframe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Oh, right. It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Back in the old days. Now you need I got a mainframe in my phone.  And that's not enough sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I ran sites for my last employer for advanced, we had them in this horrid,  haunted building in Journal Square, Jersey City,  which a recent employee called Urinal Square appropriately.  And they were in a horrid, dank basement, an old press room  that nearly flooded all the time.  And one tech director I hired who didn't last very long,  we had a heat problem.  So he went off turning off all the heads of the servers.  And then he decided to turn off a couple of servers.  So he turned off all services.  This is my tech director.  I was there was a bad day, awful day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what what would be cooler than Google's North Carolina data center?  Their Finnish data center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, structure that's already there.  The climate in that area and then design some they're using seawater  to really make the most efficient cooling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we can now blame Google for global warming on the sea.  Yeah, exactly.  Boiling the ocean for everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why not that? It's their fault. Blame Google.  Let's take a break.  We got some actually hard news.  I just I thought that'd be kind of fun to do some pretty pictures and so forth.  But first, let's talk about speaking of pretty pictures.  How about some music?  How about Ford sync for dot com slash technology?  If you you know.  I have an app which I really love, it's free app on the iOS.  I think they have it for Android, too, where you can try Ford Touch,  the my Ford Touch on your phone just to see the UI and play with it.  And that's one way to take a look at what Ford sync can do.  Sync lets you control your media player with voice commands.  And it's so sweet.  In fact, I was curious.  I connected my iPhone five up.  I finally got an extra lightning cable and I connect my iPhone five up.  All Ford sync vehicles have at least one, sometimes two USB ports  plugged in the USB port, plugged in the lightning cable into the USB port.  The iPhone five, just like the iPhone four, I can control it.  I can browse it. I can use on the screen on my  and I can call for anything by voice, which is amazing.  You can browse your music collection.  This is just not iPhone.  I mean, almost any phone, Android, iOS.  You can browse your collection by genre, artist, album, song title.  You can ask for a playlist.  I want to hear the rock and you know, album rock all with voice commands.  It allows voice activated control of your media player.  It'll even play a list of music you're in the mood for.  If you like the song you're listening to, you say play music similar to this.  And it will. It's very smart.  You can voice control music no matter how it's stored on your smartphone  via Bluetooth streaming on a USB drive.  If you have an MP3 three player like an iPod and iPad.  iPads great example, you use Bluetooth or connect the USB cable.  And here's a nice feature.  If you have sync with the available sync with my Ford Touch and HD radio  technology, you can use iTunes tagging.  You like a song you're listening to on the HD radio, you like a song,  you say, take that. And when you get back home, iTunes let you buy it.  Best of all, Ford offers sync on every 2012, 2013 Ford vehicle sold in the USA,  including the 2012 Ford Focus.  Now, that is awesome.  That is really awesome.  I've been asking people to tweet, we've been getting a lot of people tweeting.  Somebody sent me an email yesterday saying, hey, who do I tell  if I bought a Ford because I heard about it?  I heard about sync and I said, well, you could tell me or you can tweet it.  And I've been seeing lots of tweets from people said, yes, I bought  I just got my new edge.  I love my Ford Escape.  I just got I just got sync.  It's really cool.  Tweet it. Let us know.  You can also add at Ford in that way.  They'll know that you listen to the Twitter network.  And if you want to know more, Ford dot com slash technology,  if you want to see it all in action or I got a better idea,  go to your Ford dealer and say, I want to test drive not the car,  the Ford sync that put you in a car, but bring your smartphone  so you can test drive the sync as well.  Go further and afford Ford dot com slash technology.  So. I don't know.  You're going to explain this to me.  Turns out reading somebody's Gmail.  Doesn't violate a federal statute.  South Carolina Supreme Court last week decided accessing someone's email  without their permission is not a violation of the 1986  Stored Communications Act because the email is in a cloud.  Which counts as electronic storage and is not specifically not.  Protected by the act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Stored Communications Act  apparently requires it to be on a hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the problem with making laws technology specific.  Right. It's just it's just absurd.  And but the same goes the other way.  The fact that our our email is not as protected as our physical mail  is another substantiation of how wrong this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this came up in a case.  It looks like it was a divorce case where a woman basically hacked  or guessed her husband's security questions, like suspected him of cheating,  guessed his Gmail or Yahoo Mail security questions, got into his Yahoo Mail account,  found messages between him and his lover and gave them to her divorce lawyer  to use them as evidence.  And then he sued her back saying that that was that that violated  several laws, including the Stored Communications Act.  So this is this is pretty interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is an idiot Supreme Court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Frankly, here's here's what this is.  1986, right? This act was written.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but let me read you and you tell me  the code defines electronic storage under the SCA  as any temporary intermediate storage of a wire or electronic communication.  Incidental to the electronic transmission thereof and be any storage  of such communication by an electronic communication service  for the purposes of backup protection of such communications.  The judges found that because he had no other copies of his email,  they could not possibly have been a backup.  These guys are morons.  Yeah, I just say it.  We declined to hold, the two judges wrote, justices Hearn and Kittredge,  the retaining an open email constitutes storing it for backup protection  under the act.  I think this is not a new law we need.  We need new judges. Yeah.  This guy never used mail in his life.  Obviously, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's a hard book.  It would be the same as saying that it was written at a time  where it was never put on a floppy disk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, like back in the day, you would download your email from your server  and it would be deleted from your server and it would now exist on your computer.  And that would that would mean that you had retrieved your email  and now it was on your hard drive.  But that's just not the way that it works right now.  In the day of the trash 80, it was on a cassette drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's on it. Look, it's on a hard drive somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the intent of the law?  The intent of the law is it's stored somewhere.  But the storage, it could be in a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the storage, it could be, you know, virtual.  I mean, a solid state drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, a solid state drive.  It can be a memory. It's a storage.  It's electronic storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the absurdity. Yes.  Morons. This is the problem.  Do not write laws to technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me just say there's going to be an election in three weeks.  If you do not vote, you do not deserve to be a geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hear, hear.  Seriously,  over sicker and stick it on your bulb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if this guy had pop like had had downloaded a copy of the right  email to one of his devices, so he connected to Yahoo Mail  through a client on any one of his devices, he would have a copy,  a personal copy, and this could be could be considered a backup  because it was a different copy. Right.  Oh, man. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's far off.  But Pirate Bay just announced they're in the cloud cloud,  which is hilarious because what they what it sees is the inability  to go seize a server. Right.  That's where this is. Where's Waldo? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Obviously, as we just learned moments ago, the servers are somewhere.  Yes. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The servers are somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just follow the yellow brick pipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's a it's irrelevant.  It's irrelevant where they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So just I'm just pointing out, you're going to get to vote for your  your member of Congress.  You might get to vote for a senator.  You're certainly going to get to vote for a president.  All of those people have some influence on these courts.  These these justices are appointed by the president  and they are approved by Congress.  So get out there and vote and ask your candidates,  hey, what do you know about electronic storage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Define backup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the cloud, Congressman? What?  I wish last night in the debate, somebody stood up, said,  Mr. Obama, Mr. Romney, please define the cloud.  We need somebody to do that in one of these debates,  just so that we know which one gets it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it's true. I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably neither. But  Romney will say, I think I bought it.  Romney's going to say, I'm a businessman.  I know what computers are. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's his answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I know it's full of clouds.  And President Obama say, you know,  I feel your pain.  Oh, I give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know how tough it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know how tough it is.  Let me just tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He always starts with the empathy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Romney will say, I keep things in binders.  Binders of women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Binders of clouds, binders of hard drives.  That's it. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I keep it. Who needs a cloud?  I've got binders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, dear.  But it was it was a matter of minutes before women in binders  was a Tumblr feed.  It took no time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, my God. So great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what did Romney say?  This was in the question about the equal equal pay for equal work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He didn't have enough women.  He went and demanded someone bring him binders filled with women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. He went to women's group.  And he had he he looked at his applicant pool for his administration.  And it was all it was mostly men.  And he said, we need to have more qualified women applicants.  And he went to a group and they apparently handed him binders  full of women's names who were qualified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So literally before the debate was over, binders full of women dot Tumblr dot com  not only was started, but was full of examples of binders of women.  It is the funniest. It's every Internet meme.  Here's one Romney to bring them all.  And then the darkest binder them.  Here's a cat with binders of cats.  This is this is what the Internet's good at.  Alas, this doesn't help us much in cases like this.  This supreme this supreme court in South Carolina,  which apparently doesn't understand how storage works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, you know, if you go back to Ted Stevens, does the mockery of him and tubes?  I hope it makes a difference.  I think it made a difference.  Some of the somebody other politicians at some point said,  I can't be made fun of in quite that way.  What the F was this about? What is this tubes thing? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was a state supreme court, not the national.  There's a federal law, I think.  Yeah, they were ruling on the federal law.  But of course, it was a state case.  He could be appealed.  And not that I have any hope at all if it were appealed,  that the US Supreme Court would have any clue what was going on either.  The technology is moving too fast.  I mean, the whole point of government, government in the US anyway,  is designed to be very, very, very slow because the founders believed  that a slow government was and kind of unempowered government was safer.  If this were a dictatorship way around this, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you write laws to principles, right?  You that a lot of communication defined  vastly as private communication is like physical mail or email or whatever.  And it has principles around it.  So it was just a badly written law badly interpreted by judge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. It was too specific.  They didn't need and maybe in 1986, they need to explain what storage was.  I don't know.  But I think you're exactly right. Right.  To the principle.  And then the justice can look at modern technology and see what the intent was,  as opposed to saying it's Talmudic, right?  Yeah.  Google is creating now they got Nexus phones, they got Nexus tablets.  How about a Nexus call center?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is interesting.  You think Google is going to get into the business of customer service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so this is a job listing  for help desk level one for a confidential client  who recently unveiled a new Android tablet.  I think we all know who that is.  It says in the listing, the location is Mountain View.  Nineteen dollars an hour.  That's pretty good.  Full time, six month contract option for extension and or permanency mid September.  Phone and email support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's pretty expensive real estate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mountain View.  Yeah, that's where Google is.  I know why they put them in Mountain View.  I see around the world.  There's probably three people.  That's the problem.  Yeah, that's a very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think we mentioned on the show last week,  I think you mentioned the famous story that Larry Page said when  when someone came to him and said, we should we should answer this user's email.  And he said, no, right.  Don't get started.  But now that you start getting money from people, you have to have customer service.  You have to cost comes.  This is the thing, the fight I have with paywalls in newspapers.  People say, oh, but a paywalls, it'll solve all our problems.  No, two costs come when you put on paywalls.  One is marketing and the other one is customer service.  And it's not cheap to get money.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to tell you about the Comcast, my Comcast story.  No, I tweeted some, you know, I was having some I'm still having  you know, it's not even like Comcast is mean.  It's just that the whole system is broken.  And I was just complaining, I was venting on Twitter.  But they watch Twitter like a hawk.  Like if you want customer service, complain on Twitter.  Don't call a customer.  You can't even get a human.  But if you if you tweet it.  So I've been getting calls and I'm sort of ignoring them  because the last one was Sunday morning at 8 a.m.  I was asleep from the Comcast executive.  Pure pure something, they have some like the executive offices of Comcast.  And I think it is because it's someone with a Philly accent.  But it didn't seem so much like so.  So what you would expect is, oh, we're so sorry.  What can we do to make this right?  We value you as a customer.  Let's what what are your complaints?  It was no, it was like, hey, she literally said you're paying thirty  nine dollars a month, you should be happy.  I think they now want you.  They're now calling you to get you to shut up.  Not to fix it, because they can't.  Broken, they can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this whole idea or and your follower.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm sure she knew my cloud.  Influential, influential person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, what she didn't know is that what HDMI was, but she did know my cloud score.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think I think this is the problem of, you know, Comcast was actually  one of the first companies to really respond.  Comcast cares.  Frank Alliance and he was like alliance who did great job.  He's now left to go to a bank, a city bank.  Well, it's like the worst world.  But Frank's a very nice guy.  He's written a book about all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And when he did it, it really was.  And I had some experience of this.  So sorry, we're going to fix it.  We're going to make it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I was a senior vice president of the company who would deal directly with customers.  Right. And now when the bureaucracy opens, there's some kind of, you know,  somebody Leo's law created that the larger that bureaucracy gets,  the meaner and more intransigent and nastier it's going to get.  If you are a cable company, you must act like a cable company at the end of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't even know if they want to be mean.  I think what they want is wanting to stop tweeting.  And but but by the way, I immediately tweeted that.  But but that's what's changed.  That's a little shift.  Instead of saying, how can we make this right?  We're sorry. We want to give you a good customer service.  I think they realize we can't.  It's like Google. We can't.  So let's just get them to shut up.  What just you know.  And so she was saying things like I said, well, you know, I ordered two HDMI boxes.  The guy came with one component box, no HDMI.  She said, oh, well, no, we don't do HDMI boxes.  I said, what are you talking about?  I've had HDMI from you guys for years.  I have what are you talking about?  I think it was really to get them to shut up, get me to shut up.  But I think that that's probably what's going to happen.  What's going on now is they can't really.  I mean, it doesn't scale.  You can't give you can't.  What are you going to watch Twitter and everybody who claim every look at Comcast on Twitter?  It's all complaints nonstop.  They can't fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they could fix it by doing, you know, but reinventing the business.  I mean, the best way to get you to stop tweeting is to help you out to fix the problem.  She just got me to tweet more and mention it on the show.  Tweet more exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know what?  Now I'm going to get more calls from that 800 number in Philadelphia,  which I now have blocked on my phone  because I don't want to talk to them.  They're not going. It's not getting better.  It's just right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, that is the worst thing when an airline or a phone or cable company says,  let me explain. Yes. No, no.  I don't want you to know how you're screwing me.  I don't justify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't rationalize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't need that.  But this idea that Google is setting up a call center,  I mean, one of the things that Google's really stunk at,  for the reasons we talked about last week, is customer service.  I mean, it's really hard to get a hold of someone.  I mean, just in the two years we've been doing this show,  I've gotten a handful of emails personally from people who have had their  AdSense account shut down or they're locked out of their Gmail  and they've posted in the forums and they've looked at the .py help files  and they can't there's nothing they can do.  They can't get ahold of anyone at Google and they come to.  And I'm sure this has happened to you guys.  They come to me sort of begging like,  do you know somebody there is there any way that I can get my stuff?  And it's this it's a little frightening to think, you know, if you're not  if you don't have a big platform like we have the privilege of a big platform  that you're using a free service.  And if something goes wrong that you don't have any recourse  and there's there's no customer support that's reliable,  that you know that someone will get back to you.  So I often wondered if Google could literally charge for support.  You know, it's like, here's our free app.  But, you know, if you call us, you know, it's going to cost you ten bucks  and you can, you know, get get a human.  I mean, in this case, of course, they're selling next devices  that are providing customer support for this device that they're selling.  But what's the support?  You know, what's the support solution for free for free web apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that are advertised to be hard, though, if you have no tradition  of customer support, no tradition of communication with customers  to turn on a dime and say, OK, now we're going to support hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And support, it's it's tough.  Yeah, it's a horrible job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is it is because I know that it's costly and people are exhausting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People are mean and yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they say mean things to you on the phone.  But speaking of speaking, Larry Page speaks.  Remember, he lost his voice in the summer.  Still don't know why.  But he was a zeitgeist in Paradise Valley, Arizona.  That sounds like that was an event, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you see, by the way, I'm going to say it again.  What do I have to do?  Write a kiss ass book, be on a show all about Google.  What do we all have to do to get invited to the.  Huh? Huh?  I mean, Scoble got invited.  Scoble got invited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why didn't you get invited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know. Yeah, Jarvis should be there.  He wrote the Google book.  Hey, I wrote a Google book. I should be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, yeah, we all do a show on Google, but I don't want to go.  So that's OK. You can invite them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do the show from there, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Invite them. I'll do a show from there.  Sure. Whatever. Actually, Trey Radcliffe, did you see the pictures?  Maybe that was just on Path.  No, I think he published what there he spoke and did an amazing zeitgeist  talk with gigabits of pictures around him.  Let me see if I can find the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just saw he was going to do that.  I didn't see there were any pictures afterwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll see that.  I just never know if this is Path only or where did I see it?  Or was it? No, here.  So the Google Venice Plex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's on plus, no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  Plans that Google, let's search for Trey Radcliffe.  He gave a talk. I'm pretty sure it was there.  At the. At the site, what is zeitgeist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's for their business partners and they come in and wow them.  OK, so it's their little private teddy thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But isn't it also the name of their like search trends,  their yearly search trends report? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But so this is this is Google with giving the zeitgeist of the world  to these powerful mockers.  So they had Sean Penn there, Hal Varian.  Sean Penn? Yeah, Sean Penn.  God knows why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, he had a 16000 pixel screen.  It is it is, in fact, on on his plus page.  In fact, you can watch the entire video.  That's the Nexus 16000, in other words.  Here's the this is a picture from Scobel of all.  So he has Trey is talking about his photography.  All his images are showing up on these screens all the way around the zeitgeist.  Isn't that awesome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And with with the brilliance of the photos in his HD photography,  that must be, oh, must have been double.  Must have been gorgeous.  And Scobel's there. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Scobel's there.  But he's probably there because of Raxby.  Well, I don't know.  I don't know.  Anyway, those those talks, I guess a number of those zeitgeist  texts are online at zeitgeist minds dot com.  And there's Trey, the wonderful Trey Radcliffe giving his.  Talk, wow.  I guess the pictures are moving behind him as he's talking. Wow.  Cool. Yeah.  No, you're not a customer.  You you don't. That's a sale.  It's a sales event, in other words.  They have interesting people.  Larry Page spoke in a raspy voice.  It's been more than half an hour talking about things like him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think in there, we can listen to his voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said, I want to tell you about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is. I'm in the olive oil business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are not going.  Sorry, stop me now.  He he spent more than half an hour talking about antitrust.  The flap over maps, the map flap, by the way, trademark Leo Laporte.  Twenty twelve.  The Apple map flap.  I think why? How do we miss that headline?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Combining those two topics, by the way, I went in and I searched yesterday  for an address in Dumbo in New York on just plain old Google.  And the first listing was MapQuest.  Whoa. Yeah.  And I just did another one before the show to see what happened.  It was the second listing.  But MapQuest is right up there.  And you know, you wonder if that's not getting ready for the old antitrust  call, which they're getting not only from the FTC now, but of course, always from the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really because and truthfully, the right result would be the Google map.  I mean, of course, that's what you want.  You know what? MapQuest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And again, there's nothing wrong with that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but you're right.  People will look at that, say, well, Google's giving their own services priority.  And that's why I've always thought Google  should search should be somehow separated out from their other businesses.  I don't know how you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I was talking about to Jeff about this in the pre show.  But if anyone watches The Good Wife, it airs on Sunday.  It's a really good show.  But it's a you know, it's a legal drama.  It's all fiction.  But this week's past episode, which was called Two Girls, One Code,  which I will not comment on, but they wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a little that's a little nudge nudge wink wink to the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  It was actually about a startup founder by these two women who was demoted  in search results and they were suing the search engine.  And so they covered sort of search algorithms as protected speech versus,  you know, trade secrets.  And it was it was a pretty it's actually a pretty tech savvy show.  Sometimes I can't tell if the show is making fun of techies.  Of course, they had the like requisite chubby like white guy blogger,  you know, who wrote a review with, you know, without checking any facts  of the software, you know, so they kind of they kind of poke fun at the tech  community. But it's also pretty I thought it was a fairly smart rendition  for a Sunday night CBS primetime show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People people are more knowledgeable about technology.  That's what's that's why these these judicial rulings bug me,  because normal people understand that when you have mail in the cloud,  it's stored in a hard drive. They're not idiots. Right.  People understand technology much more than they ever did before.  So, interestingly, Larry Page talked about that very thing.  He was Mr. Page also, this is from an article in The Wall Street Journal.  I could not find a video of his talk or I would run it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mr. Page also. Oh, 30 percent year, 10 percent better  every year batteries to work with.  And, you know, car engines don't get better.  I tried to get out of Google, but they keep pulling me in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chad, thanks for showing me up.  I said I couldn't find. I'm sorry.  So, no, now we hear his voice.  And it's a little rap, but, you know, it's fine.  He said, and maybe you can find maybe Mr. Smarty Pants.  You can find this portion of the talk.  Mr. Page also made several comments that reflected the arguments  Google has used to counter claims by competitors  that it has increasingly pointed web search engine users to Google's own services.  Google Places or Google Plus.  Rather than sites run by competitors like business listings at Yelp,  Page noted that when Google Maps was introduced  and automatically began to show up as the top search result,  if people searched for information about places, quote,  we had the same kind of criticism, he said.  People said this map quest.  No one uses them anymore.  Now I'm sounding like Christopher Walken is the guy. Yeah.  He says so he said exactly what we just said.  Nobody uses them anymore.  And yet now they are showing up as results.  Huh? He said, when people search for Sony digital camera,  they're not looking for links to other search engines that compete with Google.  I think you want product information.  You want to buy something.  So I do think they have a good argument whether they want to make that argument  in court or in front of the Department of Justice is another matter.  He did not say whether Google would introduce a Google Maps app  for the iPhone and iPad, as everybody asks him Schmidt, everybody.  Um, we obviously, he said,  we obviously love to serve users on different platforms with maps.  And we're excited that other people are starting to notice.  We've worked hard on maps for seven years.  That's that's good.  So Sean Penn, you're right.  Ken Chenault of American Express.  Was there just sounds like a good event. I'd love to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, unfortunately, we've lost our our in that Google Karen  Wicker is now at Twitter, but she's in it at Twitter, which is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good end.  It's a good end.  There were some leaked screenshots of the new Google Maps app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shall I show them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, let's look at them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they're from Ben Guild dot com. I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're pretty blurry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a coder and a mobile designer.  They're really blurry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're really blurry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can see that's an iPhone, right?  You recognize that in the upper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's clearly an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's LTE. And then he says, get excited.  That's all he says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So not surprising, whatever, not a standalone app.  And it will be optimized for the iPhone five.  And hopefully Apple won't not approve it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be funny?  There's no way they're not approving that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, after the last flap when they didn't approve it,  which Google app was it? Yeah, it was Google Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They got a letter from a senator. Right.  You don't want to mess with them.  Duck Duck Go.  How's your duck duck go experiment? Go, go going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good. I'm still I'm still using it.  I don't really think about it.  I changed my search shortcut and I still use it.  There are times when I have to switch over to Google  if it doesn't find something.  And I obviously use Google for news and images and maps.  But yeah, I'm still using duck duck.  Oh, I got a thing for the underdog.  And I think it's just interesting to see, you know, what  what another search engine can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're talking about the filter bubble.  They did a study with some 131 volunteers  and asked them to search for three terms, abortion, gun control and Obama,  and then compare the results.  They made a video out of it talking about Eli.  Pretty good filter bubble. Yeah.  So it's interesting.  And that's an interesting way to compete, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, right.  They're saying, hey, you know what?  Google's not giving everybody the same results.  You're only seeing the stuff that you want to see. Right.  Not the stuff they're actually looking for.  I know that Jeff doesn't love this.  Jeff doesn't like the filter bubble.  I knew you would have something to say.  Even when in the same country and when signed out of Google,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you get different results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you use Google applications, they collect your personal information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, come on. All right.  I guess. Yeah.  Yeah, it's a bad Google collecting your personal information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's called relevance.  I don't want this.  I drive down the interstate and I see the same billboard everybody else sees.  That's not good. I don't want that.  I don't want the same three channels that everybody else has on TV.  I love the idea that we now get things that are tailored to us and our needs.  I I'm not part of a mass.  I don't think it's a wonderful part of America to be treated as a mass.  It's not the natural state of being.  It's a temporary state of being that only existed from 1950 on,  1955 on till about 1996.  It lasted for 40 years during the age of television and mass media.  So I I argue with the idea that getting the same thing  everybody else gets is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in the in the old days, the fuller brush salesman would come to your home,  say, is the lady of the house at home and talk about your needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right. Give you a brush to have a general straw over that good  cracker barrel. They knew the initial report like your salad without bugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, they're tracking me again.  That does go ahead, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Commies go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know. I think it's important to question this, especially in this political season.  I mean, it was really interesting to me to see the people that I follow.  And I and I think I like to think of myself as someone who makes an effort  to follow people with different views, to see, you know, all of my people  sort of say the things that I thought about the debates this week.  And so if the guy in San Francisco searches for Obama and gets,  you know, the L.A. Times is a result, a top result.  And the guy in Texas searches for Obama and gets Fox News as the top result.  Like that seems that doesn't feel good to me.  I don't love that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As it's habit, Gina. Right.  It's it's it's the way what we were used to and what mass media,  my colleagues said was the right and proper way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Was to everyone should get this one thing. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think what you have to do is break out of that.  And then you're right. That it can be good or bad. Absolutely.  And then you can.  But I think that just because it's the way we used to do it doesn't make it right.  Jay, I was with I was at a really interesting  meeting this morning at Digital First Media with Jay Rosen, who  two of us are with Emily Beller on board of advisers.  What a team. I like you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah, we still want to do a media show with you and Emily and Jay.  Be wonderful. Wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So anyway, so, you know, the journalists ask about the old objectivity thing.  And Jay said that in the way only Jay can,  that he has thousands of people on Twitter who are conservatives  who don't like what he say, but they follow him.  And I said, right. Maybe think about it.  I thought, right, if everybody was in an echo chamber,  then no one would ever argue with me. And plenty do.  Right. So people do seek out other opinions and seek out other views.  And, you know, I think that there's a new app.  I was going to mention later, but I mentioned now called Circa  that just started some Ben who of cheeseburger David Cohn,  who's a really, really bright young news guy and some other members of the team  started this one. And it's the beginning of right now.  It's CIRC. But it will start to get you through assets and paths of news.  So just just this level alone, Gina, if you come into a story  and you read it every day, the fifth day you come into the story,  it's not going to give you the same background paragraphs  because it knows you already know it.  So it's going to give you a more expert view.  So if you look at it that way, right, is that a is that a filter bubble problem?  No, it obviously reduces a redundancy in my life.  No, it's different. Oh, yes, it is.  That's it. That's it.  Right. So it reduces a redundancy and an irrelevance in my life.  Right. And this has been put in just political terms of,  oh, you're only going to see liberal things, Jeff, because you're a liberal.  You know, and and and and Eli in his argument, and I think he made it on the show,  was that he blamed Facebook for not showing conservatives.  But of course, the reason they didn't show the conservatives is because  he never looked at the conservatives in his list.  So it was his fault.  He's the one who who showed his way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should should Facebook or Twitter or Google force you to see stuff  you don't want to see because it's good for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or right. That's the old editors view of the world.  I'm sorry, Gina. I'm now you raise a simple objection.  Now I'm I'm. No, no, that's that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I go ahead.  I know I I hear you saying I hear you saying  I had people tell me that they, you know, unfollowed me on Twitter  because they didn't agree with my political views, which I just think is dumb.  I mean, what why? You know, I think it's important to listen to other people.  I relatives on Facebook who I couldn't disagree with more.  And it's very tense around this time of year.  But but it's important to hear the other point of view.  And I agree that, you know,  an app like Circa and I actually haven't tried it out yet,  but I like the idea that it would know I already know this.  So I'm going to show you information that you, you know,  that you don't you haven't read already. That makes sense.  I don't think that collecting personal, you know,  personalized and search results is a bad is a bad idea.  But I don't love the idea  that people don't understand how it works.  I still that that example in the video of, you know,  the Fox News versus the L.A.  Times, depending on, you know, where you're located  and what other things you've looked at.  It's still listening about that, that that that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, but I stay right there for a second. Right.  So is that a problem of principle about  personalized search results or is it a problem of execution  about how it's done?  Yeah. I mean, yeah, that could.  Yes. I think is that it's the responsibility of Google  to give you everything it wants.  I would disagree with that,  but I think that I would say it a little bit differently  and say that I would value a search engine  that would expose me to would be the opposite  of what we're talking about, that would expose me  to some of the things that I'm not otherwise exposed to,  not the mass of what everybody has.  That's not valuable to me. Right.  If it recognizes that, OK, Jarvis, you've seen this again  and again and again and again.  You've never looked at this story from the Telegraphs view in London.  And so we're going to pop that in for you so that we expose you to that  and choose to.  So it's the opposite of giving you what you expect,  give you sometimes where you don't expect.  I could go for that. But that's not that go.  That's not the idea of what Eli says.  We all have to have the same thing. I don't want that. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hmm. Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo, you're with Jarvis on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But well, I'm not.  I also agree with you in the sense that I I just don't think that it's Google's job  to feed us our vegetables.  Ah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's an issue of execution.  You don't feel like it's their job to say, well, you know,  we're going to throw in a couple of conservative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should give you what you want any more than you should go to Denny's  order the Grand Slam breakfast and they put a piece of broccoli on the plate.  That's not what you ordered.  So it might be better for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A go go duck would do the opposite.  It would be personalized.  It would listen to what you do, but it would choose instead to throw  throw you sources you were not asking for.  That would be the opposite way to execute on duck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's an interesting problem.  Maybe you could fuzz it, Gina.  You could do some fuzzy logic or no, I know.  Maybe if you do a box on the right that says, by the way,  you want the opposing viewpoint, look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. The apposite.  Well, you guys had Clay Johnson, who wrote the information diet on triangulation.  And he talked about it when he worked on the Dean campaign, the Howard Dean campaign.  They were just convinced that he was going to win.  It was so clear and obvious to them.  They were going to win because they were all surrounded by, you know, people.  And I see that kind of, you know, I think all the people who are voting, you know,  were on the team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I live in Northern California.  I can't understand how Obama could possibly even not be.  It couldn't be close. Exactly.  And I'm sure if I live somewhere else, that would be pretty obvious.  It's pretty obvious. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's the kind of thing that that concerns me is not having a realistic view,  a broader perspective view on what's actually going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with you. I just whose responsibility is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On principle, but disagree, I think, on the execution.  I don't think the duck duck go is the solution.  It's like the argument about serendipity.  There's two arguments about serendipity that I hear.  One is that editors give it to you because they're in control of that.  They know what you don't know and they'll give it to you.  I think that's wrong.  The other one was the serendipity is randomness.  And as I said on the show before, I think serendipity is unexpected relevance.  So somebody with similar interest to you found something interesting to them  that you may not have found. They find it for you.  Well, that's an exposure to something.  And the system of humanity works OK with that.  Twitter works pretty well. It gives us serendipity.  I don't want irrelevance. I don't want randomness.  I don't want editors controlling what we all see and call it serendipity.  I want some soups of knowledge about me and what I know and don't know.  And I think that we can far, far better execute on that problem.  And then we would agree about the principle.  And maybe we could find a new ground of execution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's probably why of the two choices I proposed,  which is a box of a view, opposing viewpoints or just some random fuzzing,  random fuzzing is better because the truth is it's an illusion  that this opposing viewpoints is really giving you the other.  It's not a coin. Right.  There's a huge spectrum of viewpoints.  Here's the danger. It's the danger we see in media.  It is it is curated, even if it pretends not to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you look at global warming in media, you see too many stories that say,  well, but other sides say when it's ninety nine point nine nine percent  of scientists to two point one percent of crackpots.  And by putting them both in the same story with the same length,  it gives you a false equivalency.  There's a danger in that, too. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and let's say, you know, you searched for Obama  and you got a box that said, what about Romney?  But what about the libertarian candidate?  What about Roseanne Barr, who happens to be running in the state of California  on the Peace and Freedom Party?  What? I don't know if you've got Roseanne Barr on your ballot,  but I was shocked, shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Roseanne imitation, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't. I'm grabbing my crotch right now, but you can't see it.  Gina has it on her ballot.  I don't know if you do, Jeff. Look on your ballot.  No, I don't. Roseanne Barr is running for president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow. She she didn't like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good bumper sticker. Roseanne Barr is on my ballot.  I don't know what it means.  But that's the point is that you can't it's anything.  The notion of objectivity is artificial.  So serendipity is the right word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. So Google is trying to give you relevance, a different insert.  Right. They're trying. That's what their goal is.  That's all they need to do. That's their job.  But that's what they say they want.  That's what you're getting there.  So, yes, DuckDuckGo is an alternative.  I would want for someone to play with something else,  you know, push Google and show different kinds of quality in a different way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's definitely a lot of room, I think, here for for improvement.  And I think this is a fascinating, really discussion of who decides  who decides who decides who you vegetables.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's not editors, right.  Editors believe that they serve you broccoli.  That's their job. They're the broccoli chefs.  And and they believe and I just heard this with a couple of others  just the other day. We tell you what's important.  No, not so much.  I did I did a panel Monday night at Museum of Modern Art.  How is this for classy?  Swanky.  That really is. I was boy, I was out of my league.  Paula Antonelli,  who is one of the curators there, the head of R&D, had a panel about curation.  And I've talked about cure.  I've over talked about curation in journalism.  It's overused now.  But she wanted and I wanted to do a panel with her a couple of years ago.  I never got around to it.  And by God, she did it.  And she had the head curator of paintings and sculpture at MoMA  with Maria Popova, a blogger who curates the web with Tor.  What's his name? He's a he's a big hip hop music producer.  And me, the poseur in the group.  And so the discussions you get to with things like that is, well,  if you have a curator, what is that curator doing?  Is that curator giving you authority?  Is that curator a gatekeeper?  Is that curator opening things up or closing things down for you? Right.  And that's the problem with editors thought that they could control.  They could control your view of the world.  I celebrate that being gone now, getting, you know,  just something just for you is too far the other way.  There's some kind of middle ground.  And I think Google would argue that you could do it algorithmically to some rule.  DuckDuckGo says they get it by getting rid of the algorithms, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. I mean, but this is I completely agree with throwing out the curator,  the editor, but kind of the promise of the web and a page rank  and of search results is that you're going to get the results which reflect  what people are writing about and saying online.  So the mass, you know, the aggregate becomes the editor.  And that idea I really like, right, because no one is deciding for everybody,  but everybody is deciding for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That has a filter bubble, too.  And the conventional wisdom becomes the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's true.  And wasn't that what the web could do for a while?  And Google constantly tries to get to say, OK, that was fun.  But we want to give you what's relevant to you.  We want to know where you are.  So we give you relevant results.  Circus says we want to know what you've already seen.  So we give you relevant results.  It's not the whole web picks it.  And indeed, if the whole web, I mean, that's what Steals all the time is  he's he's he's changing it to get rid of the draws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's been it was really trying to do, I think, right,  is to figure out what you want and give you that to what your intent.  And so they're an advertising company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. I mean, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's also better search results.  If I search for pizza, I don't want to find pizza in Brooklyn or San Diego.  I want to find pizza in Petaluma.  So what's wrong with it trying to intuit?  You see, when we take politics out of it and we say something like pizza,  then it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It makes a lot of sense. Absolutely. Right.  So I think it makes a lot more sense in some in some areas than others.  The politics, though, issue is.  You know, is what I just don't think it's up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's if you say, well, Google's job is to intuit  what I'm looking for.  It is to do that in every realm.  And it's not Google's job to say, oh, and by the way, you know,  you really ought to consider something else.  And how would you feel if you I mean, I think you I think  I think what we're saying as liberals is, well, we really ought to  get those right wingers to see some besides Fox News.  But how about how about the other shoe on the other foot? Right.  And every time you search for, you know, Obama,  you got Fox News. You wouldn't want that. Right. Right.  So I think it really I think it I think it's I think really all you can ask  Google to do is intuit what you want and give it to you.  And yes, we should all eat our vegetables and we should read other sources.  And I agree with Jeff that we're that some parts of the web work that way anyway.  I mean, you can't go on Twitter without seeing opposing viewpoints.  I don't care how much you cultivate your feeds.  That's true.  I was I had such a great time watching the Twitter during the debate.  And it was that's going by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just flying by, just flying by.  It was like a chat room on a big day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was a chat room on caffeine.  Well, we're right. So, Gina, if you if you, Gina,  if you come in and you search for Java.  You're not a barista, so you don't want coffee.  It knows what you write about technology, so you don't want Java for dummies.  Right. You want to know to give you good sources.  However, you define that things that you're likely to click on.  That's a pretty straightforward rule set.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When it works well, it's great.  When I called Comcast with my Google voice number,  which has an area code in Baltimore, they gave me the Baltimore Comcast  affiliate and and I couldn't get any help  because they knew I was in Baltimore, even though I'm not.  So when it works, it's good.  When it doesn't work, it's not so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. But I mean, if I were to search for Romney's record on on equal pay  for women, I would probably get the page on BarackObama.com  that explains, you know, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could resist.  There's binders full of women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's binders full of women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'm so thin in my maiden form binder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so sorry. I wasn't going to go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't have to get political.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, everybody knows I'm a loser.  One of them lefty liberal from Northern California types.  Google, however, this is this will drive other people crazy.  If you turn it on, you can search your Gmail across mail contacts,  Google Drive documents and calendar appointments.  You mean Google can see all that stuff?  Of course they can, you nitwit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the privacy policy consolidation, right?  Yeah, finally said, hey, you know, there's one singular privacy policy  and it applies to all the different products and they can be integrated.  This is Google just wanted to be the one search box to all your  and meanwhile, and the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you do have to opt in.  In fact, if you see, I don't know if this is your tip, you know, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's not my tip. I think it's an experiment.  I think you have to join the field trial, they say, or the field trial. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's Google dot com slash experimental slash Gmail field trial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twenty seven nations sent a letter to Google  demanding they change their privacy policy and separate,  which would then not enable this functionality, which we want.  Hmm. But where the from, I won't say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The EU did win the peace prize.  I don't understand how that can happen, but OK.  Yeah, they sent said four months to amend your privacy policy.  Or face disciplinary action at a national level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To the woodshed with you, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sometimes I just despair.  Yes.  Let's see what else. What else?  What else? Jelly Bean is coming to the Samsung Galaxy S3 the next few months.  Geez, I'm glad I got a Galaxy Note.  Next few months.  Poland has it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And why it takes so long.  Should we talk about a Tom Violent Acres?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you talked this to death, Leo, on your other shows?  You know what? We have not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the first time we've brought it up.  I probably will bring it up on Twitter, but I've been saving it just for you.  Wow. And the story is actually in process.  It's breaking because Reddit just defended him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep. Well, right.  They defended his right to free speech, free free speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, that was a leaked memo, so I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it was a leaked discussion on a forum from the current head of Reddit.  But, yeah, two two points of principle coming out in their view.  I think there's a third.  But the first is that he had a right to anonymity.  They don't like doxing.  They don't like outing anybody who is anonymous.  One to however Reddit was wrong in their view to block links to Google.  Hey, you want free speech?  You don't want I mean, Gawker, you know what? Gawker's free speech.  I would say there's a third question going on here, which people are really  talking about, is that Reddit has to decide what its culture really is.  Yes, there's free speech.  It's anonymity.  But you your government should respect that.  But a private entity can decide whether it has standards or not.  And censorship for the New York Times not to put up pornography.  The New York Times can say we put up what we choose to put up in our space.  And that's what I put up.  Well, I want to put up my blog.  I don't put up everything.  No one should force me to put up everything.  And so, you know, I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe, you know, can I give some background before we get to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Should we describe what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's a guy I'm not going to say his name.  He was outed five days ago on Gawker  as a pretty virulent troll on Gawker, who is on Reddit,  who is both celebrated on Reddit by a lot of people,  was given some power, it looks like, by Reddit.  And but had was creating sub subreddits about, you know,  sexy pictures of underage girls,  creep shots, for instance,  pictures of women unaware that their photographs have been taken.  Some pretty creepy pornographic stuff,  pics of dead kids, for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pictures of dead teenage girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so Gawker revealed who he was.  He lost his job as a result.  He his wife said, Oh, it's OK.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's got an interview on CNN, I think tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the guy's a creep, at least from what I read.  I mean, and again, that was Gawker.  So who knows? But the guy's a creep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't hear it all by what he did on Reddit.  It it it reds out the the creep meter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I mean, it's pretty horrible.  And but then there's more to it because  it sounds like sometimes he was setting up these subreddits to kind of  move traffic.  He was being used by Reddit to kind of control the creep factor on Reddit.  Now, we've got to point out Reddit's owned by Condi Nast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My old boss has had full disclosure. I still work with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I mean, this is a very prestigious mainstream media outfit here.  Now, they've left Reddit pretty much alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Reddit just hosted an AMA with President Obama.  I mean, Reddit has had some seriously mainstream events happen on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Alexis Sohanian, the co-founder of Reddit, is now running a bus tour  across the middle of America to defend the Internet and speech,  all of which are wonderful things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's running for my old job, president of the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Reddit has done some amazing things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love Reddit. And in fact, I didn't really know much about this.  See me underbelly. It sounds worse than 4chan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's it's pretty awful. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I believe value is free speech that people can say that protected speech.  People can say what as long as it's not illegal.  So, you know, he would set up this this the subreddit gel bait with,  which was pictures of underage girls in revealing outfits, bikinis or whatever.  These are pictures that he found on Facebook.  But if there was actual child pornography, like, like, you know,  explicit child pornography, illegal child pornography,  he would help moderators take that down.  So he had this kind of uneasy relationship with Reddit where he would just toe the  line, just push, push the envelope as much as possible.  Keep it legal, but just horrible, hateful content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He he told Gawker, I just like riling up people in my spare time.  He's a he's a classic troll of a troll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, definition of a troll. Yes.  And if you compare that once it once he was outed to his  blog and his Twitter feed is the fraud of this is, oh, I'm Mr.  Nice Guy Next Door Neighbor and blah, blah, blah.  It was the anonymity that provided the cloak for his true trollishness to come out.  But what do you do about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, if he committed illegal acts, that's different.  But it sounds like he skirted illegality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. So I don't think the government should go after him.  But I think Reddit has to decide whether it has standards.  Yeah. Right now, the only standard is everything.  And that's the right to do.  They can do that. But then I will judge Reddit accordingly.  And I will say that it is a haven for for trolls and scum buckets.  Right. Whereas. Right. Right.  Go ahead. I was going to say.  No, no. And so and so just as he yes, he had a right to try to use his anonymity.  But so did a reporter, even an overwritten over the whole story, have the right to come  along and say, well, I'm going to tell you who this schmuck is and let everyone decide  what they think of him. There's no there's no, you know, the problem here is we  we have to protect speech.  We have to protect anonymity as a protection of speech for people who are vulnerable,  for whistleblowers, for people who live in oppressive regimes.  That's all important.  But just because anonymity exists and free speech exists doesn't mean that you are  freed from responsibility for our reaction to your speech.  So I can stand on the street corner and say homophobic or racist things.  I'm allowed to do that in America. God bless America.  But you can walk by and you can call me a schmuck for doing so.  And well, you should. That's what this is about to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he should be allowed to continue to do what he's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I think the Reddit has to define its own standards of civility and it has.  And I don't very much like those standards of civility.  And that's a problem. So Reddit does wonderful things.  It's a platform to do great things.  It doesn't want to be in the position of censoring.  So it makes the standards simply illegality.  So if you come on, that's right.  It's choice. That's right.  It's choice. But so so if they can't do it,  so if they came on and they had maybe they already do, I don't know,  but a horribly homophobic, legal, legal, but awful, homophobic,  screaming bad words about people, awful things, outing people who don't want to be  outed, making fun of them, subreddit, let's say that exists.  They can.  But what do I think of Reddit as a result?  I think that it's not terribly responsible.  And maybe it's the old fart in me coming out.  Gina, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I completely I completely agree.  I mean, one of these subreddits was  pictures of men beating women, right?  So, you know, that's so so you have to look at Reddit and say Reddit's decided  that it's more important for them to protect 38 year old man's anonymity rather  than protect 16 to 19 year old girls who posted a picture of themselves in a  bikini on their Facebook page to put those photos in a totally  hypersexualized content context.  Sure, he has the right to do that and Reddit has the right to protect his right  to do that, but that's a community choice.  Like that's a choice that Reddit made about the kind of the way that they're  going to run their community.  I honestly I have a totally different view now.  I mean, is that a community that I want to be a part of?  Not not really.  And that's a choice that they made.  Like this isn't this isn't a legal issue.  You know, it's not legal free speech.  Like this is Reddit is creating this community.  They're creating this space and they're deciding what's important to them.  What are their values?  And their values are free speech over over  this kind of just absolutely odious content.  That's their right to do that.  But it's up to everyone else to decide whether or not what they think about  about that. And I mean, you're outing him.  I mean, the Reddit is, you know,  Redditors are outraged that this guy got doxxed, you know, that he got outed.  And how dare Gawker, but Gawker, that was a journalistic.  You know, you know, their rules don't extend to other communities on the Internet.  Gawker can do whatever they want.  Reddit can do what they want. Gawker can do what they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he didn't do much to protect his identity, by the way, he was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, he did not. There are pictures of him at Reddit meetups.  It wasn't that hard for someone to track him down.  But it was such an enormous betrayal to the Reddit community because this is,  you know, anonymity is so important there.  And that's a fine within the Reddit community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, you know, this is so any any forum and Reddit is basically a forum.  And I've run forums, has terms of services and has the right to post them  and make their own decisions on all the forums I've ever owned or run.  We've banned certain kinds of behavior, including all of that,  and moderated it quite heavily. There's no I mean.  Yeah, I what is has Reddit or Conde Nast responded to this in any way publicly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm I'm I suppose I should disclose my old boss,  you know, email me about it like a year ago, kind of asking my advice.  And I don't even know what I said that because it's a very tough thing.  I believe in free speech. I believe in anonymity.  But I understand the openness of a platform.  I get all that.  And I don't think that at the time I understood where the boundaries are.  What this whole episode has done is just it's just like when  what's his names devices all got hacked and we saw a ha.  Somebody pushed it too far and we know where it goes.  And now we have a discussion about it. The discussion is valuable.  Too bad somebody got hurt in the process. But the discussion is good.  I think it's where we are right now.  I didn't know where my lines were now, but I think but I think my stance  is what Gina just said is that fine, they can do what they want.  No one should stop them. The government shouldn't stop them.  No one else should stop them as long as it's legal.  That's the whole point. Legal is legal is legal.  But we will now judge Reddit and not just its platform, but also,  very importantly, its members and its community.  Yes. The base of the company they keep and what they do. Right.  Now, so if you're Reddit and you and the value you have is your platform  in the openness, which is absolutely true, in which God bless.  Cunning asked, they have enabled. Right.  It's a very unmediated thing to do what they did with Reddit,  to allow it to be free, to allow it to be that.  So the problem I have here is not the platform.  It's not the technology at all. It's not the ownership at all.  It's not the management, except for what they did with Gawker links,  which I think is important and stupid. And they even know that. Right.  The judgment here is of the users atop the platform,  the community that has taken over Reddit, that has done wonderful things  with it in some ways, but then tolerates and chooses not just to tolerate,  but to protect this behavior.  OK, go have your party somewhere else. Thanks.  I'll have my beer over here. Yep, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's all about community values.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we should just stop using Reddit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, that would sound like a boycott.  And I'm not saying that if something neat comes up on Reddit,  will I not listen to it? OK.  But it's it's what I say on my comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let me put it this way. Many of our shows use subreddits.  So is that is it?  Are we now guilt by association?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's hard to say, right, because right, it's a big community.  There's lots of redditors.  You know, so you can't.  It's tough. I'm not I'm not a huge redditor.  If I was, I would definitely question whether or not those values reflected  my values, whether or not I felt comfortable being in a community  where pictures of women being violently beaten, like where that's OK.  I don't I wouldn't feel safe in a place like that.  And I actually I wouldn't want to do a full on boycott.  I'm going to run into Reddit links.  Reddit has done some amazing things, as we said earlier.  But, you know, I don't know, Leo.  I don't know if you should move subreddits.  What shows do do use Reddit to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TNT uses it heavily, but many of the other shows do.  We were talking about using subreddit for Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we had we've already grabbed all of the all of the  subreddit locations, so you be.  Well, I'm going to move slow on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can tell you that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What would you? Well, that's that's a very good.  That's a very good case in point.  Right. We reckon we admire the technology.  We admire the openness.  We now see this right.  I think there's two things here.  I think one is that if you were a Reddit user, you know, there's no.  Law within Reddit that says that the troll protectors have to win the day.  Right. If it is truly a community, then members of the community  can stand up and say, whoa, no, you're right about that.  We're going to we're going to change the culture of Reddit  based on this, this this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we're going to learn from that's not what happened, however.  It was quite the opposite.  You know, a lot of the Reddit communities was upset that he was doxxed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Precisely. And banned, you know, links to Gawker, etc.  But is that is that a statement of what the community is?  Not necessarily. People can speak up.  So there's there's kind of a  militancy in the other way that shuts down those voices who might say otherwise.  So I'm not a Redditor.  And so I'm just going to stand back and say, as I say to my people,  in the comments of my blog, if you're anonymous, I will pay less attention  to what you say. You're free to be anonymous.  You can say it. You might have a good reason to be anonymous, but just know  I have the balls to say what I say under my name.  If you don't, I'm going to judge you less.  I'm going to pay less attention to you.  People don't like that.  But I'm just telling you the way I judge it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so now when Gawker published the headline that  say, I think Gawker kind of doesn't like credit when Gawker published  when President Obama did the AMA on Gawker, the Gawker headline  was President answers questions on what was a racist teen  photo site.  Something like that. Right.  Which I thought was a kind of a joke.  Maybe not, though. Yeah.  If Obama had known what was going on and or his campaign,  probably had known what was going on on Reddit, it would have been very smart  of them not to have anything to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, someone in the chat room said, hey, Gina, you know,  there are lots of pictures of horrible things all over the Internet,  but you don't not use the Internet because of that.  And I mean, Reddit is a huge community and this is kind of the seedy underbelly,  the subreddits, right.  And do you just toss out an entire community or just write on?  Yeah, but you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not the Internet.  It's a specific site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a specific site that has community moderators, that has leadership,  that lays out what its values are and what can be done there and can't be done there.  So that's that's why I'm judging a little more in terms of whether or not to boycott  or try to change from within.  I mean, this is the question of every kind of change, right?  You either you either work from within and try to evolve  or you toss the whole thing out and try to start, you know, start fresh and start anew.  I'm not an active Redditor, so it's hard for me to say.  I you know, this is Reddit has enabled some amazing things.  It's also enabled some really horrible things.  I mean, I'm sort of horrified.  You know, I'm just super sensitive to this stuff now, especially because I have a three  three work week old baby girl.  But it's like I just can't, you know, I just have no tolerance for for this.  This kind of, you know, stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The point you just made, I think I think it's I think it's a really interesting  and right point.  Isn't the difference between the Internet argument, the Reddit argument,  is technology versus a community?  Yes. We have any problem with technology, right?  We don't have problems with technology. The Internet, we know that the Internet  does enable bad things. That's not the issue here.  The issue here is the community came along and not just defended  and protected this schmuck, but also then cut off the free speech of others  and the right of their readers to learn both sides and to act on that.  And they acted dictatorial within that community.  And that's they can do that. They can take it over.  It's a kingdom.  But the problem we have there is not with the technology.  It's saying that if that's the community you guys want to have, OK,  you can have it. But not for me, thanks.  And that would be a shame. But it does need things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And, you know, the community is also a reflection of its leadership.  I mean, you know, that there was there was a private memo  that was published that we have here in Rwanda.  I mean, one of one of Reddit's kind of the CEO, I think, says,  yes, we hate this kind of content, but we protect this person's right to post it.  And also said, you know, we shouldn't ban links to Gawker.  That seems, you know, that's a bad idea, although apparently  moderators of different subreddits have they can decide to ban Gawker  links and the community leadership or the people who run rather the company  to don't can't can't have any say about that.  And that's just the way that they've decided to structure the community.  But there is leadership that's structuring the community and leading the community.  And the community, I think, is every community, I think,  is a reflection of its founders and of its values.  And those evolve over time.  But there are people at work, moderators, people in positions of power  that help, you know,  grow the kind of values that they want to see reflected in their community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it like somebody asked a good question, is the community of Reddit  like the community of Facebook?  Facebook, by the way, would never allow any of this. Oh, no.  I don't know.  Yes. Twitter is like Twitter.  There's definitely reprehensible stuff on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the here's the argument. Facebook is not run by its community.  Red Book is right. Reddit is run by its community. OK.  Right. And so again, what we're judging is the community.  And again, I would I feel bad.  I don't like to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  It does great things. Most of it's wonderful.  But when we want to associate  twig now is the question with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm not going to.  But we were not going to do this.  But if the more it looks like 4chan, the less interested I am.  And but we make that choice, those choices we make all the time.  And that's I don't have any problem making those choices.  It's just not even censorship or it's not even having an opinion.  It's just like, I'm not going to stay away.  I'm just going to stay away from that because I don't want to get in that.  Admired in that on me.  And I do love stuff.  There's plenty of good stuff on Reddit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's not a topic.  It's hard because as a as a Reddit user and I do use Reddit a lot,  there's definitely OMG, Chad.  By the way, Chad Johnson.  There's definitely a sense that, well, this is them.  This is the other people on Reddit.  These are this is a different subreddit that I've never been to,  that I've never participated in either.  And and well, I mean, I did know that these these things existed on Reddit.  It was it very it feels very much like, oh, that one really loud,  annoying kid is bringing down the whole class, like the whole class is getting  punished because that one kid over there.  And the only the only  reason that this gets bigger than than just, oh, that those people over there  are being loud is because of the community running, running the all of Reddit.  So now that loud, annoying kid is also the teacher of the class.  Oh, boy. And and that's that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, boy. And I'll tell you, once communities start going in one direction,  it's very hard to there's a lot of momentum  behind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this guy is not representative of Reddit.  We understand that.  But should Reddit be protecting him or trying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, so let me do the devil's advocate truly here for a minute and turn it around.  If if we argue on this show against walled communities,  if we complain about the control that Facebook or Twitter  puts on what it does on behalf of its brand, if we want things to be open,  then Reddit is a substantiation of openness.  And if if Reddit says there is no community control of the whole thing,  there is no management control of the whole thing, then, yeah,  the crap comes along. But that's the definition of openness.  Now, the problem is that Reddit proved itself hypocritical by banning  the links to Gawker because then it did do centralized top down control  and it chose to do it against reporting as opposed to against near child pornography.  That's where the real problem comes in here.  I think before we all knew there was crap on Reddit.  I think before we all knew there was crap on Reddit.  Not as bad as this.  Pardon me. But I think the problem was the hypocrisy of the of the Gawker ban  in this. So so Chad, to your point, it's a big platform.  It's open. No one controls it.  Thus, everyone controls it and they all can do what they want in their own worlds.  And that's the secret of its growth.  I think that'd be a different story.  But what we saw here was an outright protection of the scum bucket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. The Gawker ban was the biggest misstep they could have ever made.  And if if they're if they are trying to defend the community or trying to dispel

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  part of the community and merely saying, oh, yeah, we probably should have done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so. But what should they do going forward?  Should they defend free speech?  Should they allow subreddits that are not illegal but but distasteful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would argue that you almost need a conventional.  If this is a community site, you almost need a constitutional convention of Reddit.  You almost need to say, folks, let's hash this out honestly.  Let's not make this as if it's a as if it's a done law of our universe.  What do we think, people?  And the problem is the loud voices that now say, no, no, no, protected all costs  are are hurting the Chads of the world who say, no, wait, wait, wait,  something good going on here. You're ruining it for us, all of us.  I think that if you're truly a community, then act like a community.  And it's maybe not a democracy, but it's something close to it.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. A constitution of Reddit is it seems like the only way to say,  here are the lines that that cannot be crossed.  They have no terms of service.  I believe they do. But but it's just it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They probably say you can't commit an illegal act.  Could I post, you know,  cracks on Reddit?  Like software cracks, software cracks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could I could I do anything?  I mean, I'm sure that there's I'm pretty positive there's a good torrent Reddit,  you know, that that sure there was there was there was a crack code

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that was put on somewhere, wasn't Reddit or was there's dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.  That's right. What did they think of that?  At the time,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they pulled it down initially, it was very controversial.  And then everybody in the world started posting it and dig  and they could no longer pull it down. Right.  So they gave up what they say here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, maybe that's what it would say is, you know, hey, you you,  Neanderthals, any effort to control this thing will fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So don't try.  I guess what the what the issue really is, is Reddit is a new kind of beast.  Yes, it isn't a forum that somebody's running.  It isn't the Internet.  It isn't Twitter. It isn't Facebook.  It's a new kind of beast.  And we don't really know the rules for that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like it's a platform.  And unfortunately, the platform, you know, it's not a platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't moderate it. It isn't a platform.  There are people running that platform. Right.  People own that platform.  It isn't an open platform.  I think that that's one thing it's not.  It's not used that if some people are saying in the chair, it's used net.  It's not used that it's owned by it's a commercial entity owned by a company.  So it's not used net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And someone in the chat room pointed out that Reddit,  the organization did not ban Gorka links that moderators, individual mods.  Yeah, individual mods did. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, no, no, no.  I thought I thought that the head of Reddit confessed that they had  they briefly did it system wide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My problem is that that article in Gorka is referring to private  discussions that are not public in Reddit, and I don't know if those are accurate or not.  OK, and because we haven't heard a public statement from Alex  Ohanian or from Reddit or from Conde, we don't know anything.  There are private statements that have been published by Gorka,  but we don't know if they're real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Alexis on the board, I don't think Alexis is in management anymore.  OK, left management.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't think it's I don't think it's quite a platform, but I don't know.  Maybe, you know, I'm not I'm not an expert on Reddit.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That view then this goes back to our Twitter discussions.  Then are you saying it is impossible to have a privately run platform  that anything privately owned is necessarily walled at some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're responsible.  If you're kind of asked, frankly, you're responsible for every single thing  that is on your servers as Reddit.  Now, you can say and I don't think it lets you off the hook to say,  well, we let users create their own subreddits and moderate them.  Fine. But it doesn't mean you're not responsible for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what if it's a federated architecture, right?  Which we talked about the Twitter alternatives on BOR app.  That's different because different that is open.  So if somebody takes over an app dot net and does their own instance of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and puts up pure crud app dot net has no responsibility for any more than,  you know, Evan, but Dromo does for anything on status dot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No word there, but she comes this great thing for horrid porn.  Is there not so is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, maybe I don't understand, Chad.  Is that the case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but it feels like I think they feel like that.  I don't know. I know.  What I'm saying is simple users may feel that way because anyone can make

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  our corner of the net.  It has nothing to do with Conde Nast.  Exactly. It's run by somebody else and nothing to do with anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. And so that's why you're seeing the community get outraged,  you know, because they feel like this is that was their subreddit.  I know one else had.  I I would be after this discussion, I would completely agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that their mistake is not covered by Safe Harbor, by the way.  Reddit is not.  Reddit is a publisher, right?  There's no there's no question that Reddit is a publisher in this regard.  Jeff, is it?  Well, that's I mean, if there's safe harbor, then there then they would be right  to say, hey, we don't we just like YouTube says, hey, you know, we will honor DMCA  takedown requests if there's something violating the law, honor that.  But otherwise, we're not responsible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It gets fuzzy when when the moderators of Reddit, who are at some of the highest  levels, start to moderate all of Reddit.  That's when it gets really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there is that is that capability exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm unaware if they pulled that link systemwide  or just in the subreddits that were affected.  I have not done my research on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is Reddit like WordPress dot com or is which in my in my belief is not a publisher  is is like YouTube or is Reddit more like a forum where they're a publisher?  Or let's put it another way, Leo.  No, no. Is Reddit like WordPress dot org?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no. Is Reddit like WordPress dot org, which is truly a platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It isn't because no, no, because we know that because it's all of Reddit's content  is hosted on CondeNAS servers. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So WordPress dot com being similar in that sense would say what does have standards?  Right. I don't know. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but absolutely. You're not going to see child porn on WordPress dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, child pornography is illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, OK, you're not going to.  Well, OK, that's a good question.  I mean, Tumblr is an interesting example.  Tumblr is a common carrier. There's lots of porn on Tumblr.  There's stuff as bad as anything on Reddit.  But we don't we don't blame Tumblr for that, because when you go to a Tumblr,  that's somebody's responsible for that, not Tumblr.  They're just providing a platform. Is Reddit like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Blogger has stuff too that to someone is offensive.  It's not offensive to me. Right.  I don't know what their what their line is, but there's naked people on Blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so this is really a question as is what is Reddit?  And I think that part of the reason there's we've lost Jeff.  We'll get him back. No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just trying to get myself on pixelated. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so part of the problem is there are different points of view  about what slash are means and who's who's responsible.  And see, I think of it as a forum, a massive forum.  Yeah. But it's a forum to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would say that it's more of a blogger or or a word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it's a blogger or WordPress, then that's different.  I don't think you could have this.  You wouldn't say I'm not going to use I'm never going to use Tumblr again  because of the stuff that's on Tumblr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But unfortunately, what happened was it'd be it'd be like saying blogger said,  well, all links to this across blog across blogger have now been taking  down. That's really is where they blow it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No community of blogger.  The blog, each blog is individual.  Maybe that's the argument about a subreddit. Right.  But but there is no community of blogger that comes together and says  and sets rules for all of blogger.  There's no such thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to table this discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We personal publishing platform versus a social news site.  I always imagine Reddit like a social news site. Right.  Right. Like a meta filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because you have one account on Reddit.  And that's it. And you have the whole Reddit.  Unless some well now, but people have to let you into these subreddits, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they private? No, they tend to be open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can go in. So one account.  So to me, that's a forum.  That's not blogger. That's not WordPress.  That's a forum.  You get one account, a Reddit account.  You're on CondeNAS servers now.  There's a ton of content.  I think people are fooled by the scope of it.  It's so big, it looks like the Internet, but it isn't.  It looks like WordPress.com, but it isn't.  It's one place, one forum with a lot of horrible stuff on it.  And I can tell you, if I ran that forum, I would be responsible for it all.  And as soon as they pull sitewide, pull links to something,  they demonstrate that fact.  They say, oh, we do it. They had not done that.  Yeah, they kind of they kind of muddy the waters there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You did a lot, right?  That's where that's where it all comes down to me.  And it shows the capability if they've not done.  Let's say they hadn't done that.  Let's say all that happened was  Redditors like crazy yelled and screamed and protected and cursed Gawker.  And it would be the first and whatever.  We'd have a very different discussion when we what would we say then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is owned by CondeNAS.  I'm sorry. Somebody's saying their sister companies.  No, sorry. Wrong.  They're given a lot of autonomy.  CondeNAS owns them.  Can fire every single person there.  Could shut it down tomorrow.  That's that's not true.  They have mods, just as we have chat room mods.  But I don't think that lets them off the hook any more than I'm off the hook  for what happens in the chat room.  You are legally.  I'm absolutely on the hook for what happens in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're you're you're off the hook legally.  I am. Yeah. Section 230.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So to 30 is I was going to say really, Leo, that's not good.  No, I think I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm morally, if not legally on the hook, I'm morally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no. You want section 230.  It's our it's our first time because section 230 says  it's the only surviving part of the DCMA.  And I'm not sure what you're saying.  Yeah. And it says that you are not responsible for content  that is created on your site by someone else.  And the reason that Congress, even silly Congress, did that  was so that if that weren't the case, if you were responsible for everything,  you would allow no conversation because your liability would be too high.  This is what allows take down.  This is allows free speech on the net.  So section 30 is very important.  You are not responsible for your chat room.  You choose to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's your right to do so. I correct.  I'd say I do stand corrected.  Reddit was spun off in effect from Conde Nastin 2000  at the end of 2011 and is now a part of advanced communications  with zones, both Conde Nastin read.  So I stand corrected.  So it's so I should instead of using Conde Nastin, I should use advanced publications.  Just the which is the parent company, the parent company.  So their sister companies, you're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Again, full disclosure here is that I worked for that company for 12 years  and still consult on some basis for one of its divisions. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I work for Gawker, obviously, for many years as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I know I have nothing to do with any of them  and never plan to. I work for Leo.  I don't. And Chad is my minion.  Chad's on Reddit. I don't know what the right answer is.  I'm not pretending to know what the right answer is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All I think you've heard from from Gina and me  is that this caused us to judge the community by its action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is an implication that we can't figure out yet.  We can't crock yet. But there there  there is.  It goes around, comes around.  There is an implication to your actions.  There's responsibility to your actions.  And the community has spoken by its actions in a way that does not speak  well for them, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, to me, I don't use Reddit heavily, but Reddit's like, oh,  it's that community that does those great AMAs. Right.  That's like kind of one of the things that I love about Reddit.  Oh, also, it's the community that protected that creepy guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like that. It's just I should also point out as somebody just did in on Twitter  that if you go to Gawker dot com slash up skirt, it's just as bad.  So talk about calling the kettle black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this is the other question.  God bless him. Gawker is a troll as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. That's the funniest thing of all.  Yeah, takes one to know.  And so I understand why people on Reddit would say, well, screw you.  I mean, Gawker, screw you.  And you're out in this guy and you're the you're as bad as anything.  And we have this great community and it's of real value.  And yes, there's a seedy side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a difference between posting Lindsay Lohan, new professional  photo shoots, which got posted in magazines and pictures of young girls  who were just took an Instagram shot of themselves at the beach  to show with their friends, you know, to share with their friends.  I mean, there there is a difference.  And, you know, I mean, there's, you know,  but I agree that Gawker is professional troll.  It's a tabloid. And this is it does take one to know on.  And of course, this is this was all about attention.  And this is a huge story for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But to be honest, I mean, I think I think this was  a legitimate story and a real and look at the discussion it raised.  So, you know, I just don't know what the answer is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think I think for our Reddit probably, we know what it shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It shows how much good where the goodwill Reddit has.  Otherwise, it'd be like, well, God, get rid of that.  I mean, there's a lot of goodwill for Reddit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about this is a solution for them?  This is I thought about this this some some long time ago.  You say, OK, there's a Reddit brand.  There's Reddit stuff. It's pretty much open.  If you're going to run something that we think is slimy, you know what?  We will federate the software. You can run it.  You can call it Zedit and we'll open source the platform  because there's really no business model anyway.  And yeah, you can you can use it and you can do it.  And we don't control it then.  We're not responsible for it then morally or legally or any other which way.  You want to do it. OK.  But we do have standards here at this community.  And those standards are upheld by a community that has a voice  in how that operates and isn't intimidated by a few members.  And we'll figure out what those standards are.  Now, that sounds like Pollyanna time.  And let's give you the Nobel Peace Prize.  But it could turn around to well, where is the line?  What are the standards?  Who is to say is a naked picture overboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Is it naked? Apparently, I didn't know this.  Reddit software is open sourced and you could run your own Reddit.  You couldn't call it Reddit, obviously, but you could run your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And to finally bring this all around, I've been talking to people in the chat room  who I also know use Reddit and have been following this story.  And they say the subreddit moderators were only banning the article  on specific subreddits. So it was not site wide.  So if the subreddit moderator had a problem with this, they would  they would ban it from their subreddit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, not an illegitimate problem.  They were saying this this is different.  This guy's being outed and we we protect anonymity.  And that's our kind of one of our core core values.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so they asked the admins to do it site wide and they said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, but this article outed this guy's and he did lose his job.  Right. So not that I want to defend the guy, but I'm just saying  if your core value is freedom of speech and anonymity needs to be preserved,  then that's what they were they were acting and according to the core values,  even if they felt it was reprehensible.  It's very complicated. It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is. This is quite a story. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. All right. We had a good conversation.  I don't know what the answer is.  Well, we'll we'll table it.  We could talk some more about it next week.  And the chat has been a great conversation in the chat room,  our subreddit in the chat room is going crazy.  Yeah, the chat room is going nuts.  Great.  Let's take a break. Come back with our tip, tool and number of the week.  I am going to talk about this ginormous phone.  But first, a word from Squarespace, a great place to put your website,  squarespace.com.

Time for our tool of the week, Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tip of the week, two factor off for Google accounts.  I know Leo and Leo, this is like one of the few things that you and I have ever disagreed with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I use it. I use it.  I just suffer with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You use it and you suffer with it because it's really a pain in the ass to use.  You have to enter this verification code every 30 days and you have application specific passwords  and you got to install the app.  And for someone who has multiple phones like you do, that's a total pain.  It got a little bit easier.  And I just noticed this myself last week.  I'm not sure how new it is, but Google has added this idea of trusted computers to two factor off.  So the next time that you verify, you have to sign in with two factor off with your verification code.  There's a little checkbox that says trust this computer.  If you check that box, that means you won't be prompted for your verification code every 30 days anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that mean on all of the apps on that computer or device or just on the Google website?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I believe it's just the Google website.  I thought they had that already. So this is new.  So, yeah. So, well, they used to have remember this machine for 30 days and you could check that.  I see this is forever.  This is this is so so basically you check trust this computer and you do that on across your different devices.  And if your phone gets stolen or if you're wiping your computer and selling it or whatever, you go into your Google account, you can you can manage that list.  You revoke it.  You can revoke that trusted computer.  So it makes two factor off just a little, little bit easier to use because you just don't get that get prompted every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And I love Matt Cutts tip, which is once you get the barcode, because the way you get Google Authenticator working on your phone is you scan the barcode and that phone is now can be used with Authenticator and your Google account.  I'm going to and I'm going to do this now that I got all the phones.  I got my iPhone 5. I got my new Galaxy Note 2.  I'm going to and I'm going to take and I'm going to my iPad.  I'm going to take pictures of that same barcode.  You could take multiple devices.  So I'm going to do it one more time.  Ah, yeah.  That told us that last time he was on.  You weren't here, maybe.  I don't think that's right.  He was.  She wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So wait, you take a screenshot of the barcode and then you could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Or you could just wait there and get all your devices and keep take keep and making Google Authenticator work on all the devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, nice.  I got to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because I want to Authenticator on more than one device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  Me too.  And that was one of my problems.  Just having it text me codes every time.  That was so annoying.  Yeah, I'll do that.  Great.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you print it, does it continue to work?  So they're saying they printed it or save it as a screenshot.  If it continues to work, that's great.  I just thought maybe once you close that window that that didn't work anymore.  Okay.  Good tip.  I turn it on because of course I want to be safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But your point about application specific passwords being no better than just a regular single password.  Worse.  Worse than mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  16 lowercase letters or case insensitive letters.  That's number.  Mine's much better.  But that's fine.  It's still good enough.  It's good enough.  Jeff Jarvis has a number or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's go with this one.  Glassdoor did a study of the average base salary for software engineers.  Not surprisingly, Google came out number one at $128,000.  Again, that's a base salary.  Facebook near behind $5,000 less at $123,000.  The national average is $92,000.  Amazon up in I guess cheaper.  Seattle at $103,000.  Apple $114,000.  IBM is the bottom of the barrel at $89,000.  That's because you have to use COBOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's because you're old.  You should get paid more if you have to use COBOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Defensive IBM.  I've got this before.  I got a message this week from Jeff Schick, who is Howard Stern's tech advisor.  And he has put in an IBM Lotus social network into Howard Stern's operation.  So they're managing based on a social network now.  Which you can imagine using a Lotus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I don't think it's fun.  What's that new one that we want to try that was a  Pick, Mac, Break Weekly pick yesterday by Renee Ritchie?  I want to try that.  It's a it's oh, and I can't remember it anymore.  Chad and I said we should try this and then we forgot immediately forgot all about it.  Chat room will tell us before I can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't remember either.  Sir with a CH I think it was made by that one guy who made that other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It did the thing and he was really famous.  Glass board.  Glass board.  Okay, is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was made by the person who made Campfire and no, no, no, no, no, it was made by someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, glassboard.  This would be better than Lotus Notes for Howard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it is glassboard.  Good.  We were right.  Yeah.  Or chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I want to try this.  Android, iPhone and on the web.  And it's like Campfire.  So it's an internal social network for you.  Private social network for your business or whatever.  Free.  Well, maybe it's not free.  There's it's free and premium, freemium, but it's pretty good for free.  We got to do I think this would be good.  Now we have Rosie.  We have our own Wiki.  The repository of something.  Rosie stands for something of everything you ever wanted to know about Twitter,  but we're afraid to ask.  My pick is my new phone, which I'm sure people are getting tired of hearing me sing its praises.  I finally broke down and I ordered the European unlocked version of the Galaxy Note 2.  You remember I love the Galaxy Note, but I replaced it with a Galaxy S3,  which are replaced with the iPhone 5, which I've now replaced with the Galaxy Note 2.  This was all planned obsolescence every two months, new phone, needed or not.  But I actually love the size of this.  It's 5.5 inches.  And I'm going to just show you a couple of things it does that you will not believe.  For instance, it has windowing.  So when I press and hold the menu button, a little side menu pops up and I can,  let's say I could put maps in this one and I can put, let's see, Chrome up here.  I don't know why you'd want to do that, but now I have a window with Chrome in the maps.  Or I can put you maybe want to use the S note because this has a great little stylus here.  So I can drag now the S note.  I've got a window on top of the window.  Or I can drag the S note into it like this.  And then I have, let's close that.  It's very confusing.  Okay.  S note is cool because this is a pressure sensitive stylus.  It does handwriting recognition.  It does a pretty good job.  Very fast.  1.6 gigahertz quad core processor and two gigs of RAM, which I'm not sure which makes it fast,  but I bet there are lots of RAM certainly doesn't hurt.  A beautiful screen.  It is not as high a resolution as the original note.  It's 1280 by 720 instead of 1280 by 800.  So the pixels per inch is actually lower than the original Galaxy Note,  but it is not a Pentile screen.  And so you might say it really is higher resolution.  It's just, it's a gorgeous, bright, easy to use LCD screen.  What more can I say about it?  I just, this is, if you, if you have fat fingers like I do, you need a big phone.  And, and, and this is it.  Now it looks like a pocket check, Leo.  Yeah. You want to see me put in a pocket?  I got Captain Kangaroo pockets.  Just, it goes right in my breast pocket right here like that.  Easy. It's plenty of room.  In fact, it's no wider than the old Galaxy Note, just a little bit taller  because they go edge to edge more on the screen.  I really like this.  As an old person with fat fingers, it really solves my needs.  It does not flicker in real life.  That's just an interaction with our cameras.  I'm not sure why that's doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The windowing is crazy.  So is that wild?  Yeah, it's kind of the tabs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The note tabs do that as well.  It's, it's something new that Samsung's doing with some of their newer things.  What else do I want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. I, you know, I saw the commercial, there was a commercial or at some point it was like,  well, you can text while you're watching a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's kind of weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Would I ever want to be texting?  Yeah, I would have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would have last night when I was watching the video in the turnpike rest stop.  Oh, okay. Yeah. Watch the debate on window and tweet the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I'll tell you, there, you know, people laugh at a stylist,  but the idea that if somebody gives you a phone number and instead of breaking out the keyboard,  I could just write it and it's easy.  I mean, I can read my own handwriting and it does have, this is really weird,  but it has actual text recognition.  So I can also do it.  I don't know how good it is.  I think it's pretty good.  See five, five, five, one, two, one, two.  It's actually pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is there a place on the phone to keep the stylist or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. And in fact, there's a nice little feature that if you leave the stylist behind, it beeps at you.  And if you never use a stylist, you never even have to know it exists.  It fits very nicely flushed into the case and is nice and firm in there.  Stylist is much improved, by the way.  Their ergonomics are much better than the Galaxy Note.  One reason to upgrade the button is easier to push.  It's got a soft plastic S-Pen now is really, I think, nice.  Look, if you want a big phone, this is it.  And I think it's a great phone.  Running Jelly Bean, which is nice.  So Google Now, look how nice Google Now looks on the big screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's amazing is that one of the first tablets to come out was Dell doing a five inch.  Yes, and it was terrible.  It was, but they had the right idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it was clunky and big, but it was the right size.  I like this size a lot.  Yeah.  So, you know, I have to say this is my now my daily driver.  I gave up on the iPhone 5.  Too hard for me to type on.  I've nicked the heck out of it.  I'm going to wait till I can get a case for it for one thing.  It's nice, but it feels old fashioned.  It's my parents' phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm loving my Android stuff.  You're loving what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android stuff.  I tell you, with Jelly Bean, Android has really become a base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the other thing.  I went last week and I bought, unfortunately I had to return it because it was a broken  open box unit, but I bought a Chromebook.  And I'm going to go back and do it because I really want to see A, what life is like fully  on Google Apps and then B, is for an educational purpose.  You know, would it really be usable to teach students?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should let you know, I did order a Microsoft Surface tablet and I will have it in nine days.  26 that arrives along with the keyboard.  So I'll show you the following week on Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it really change?  Have you played enough with the early versions of Windows 8 that it really changes?  You don't have to go searching for things and doing all the wacky stuff you have to  do Windows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no, it's worse.  No, no, no.  In fact, I think Windows users are going to be baffled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if you're a Mac user?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You haven't been on Windows in a year.  Then it won't make any difference.  It's just a different interface.  It's very different though.  I think the problem, and I just saw a usability test with Nielsen Norman where they said the  real problem is there's a lot of mysterious commands, hidden mouse movements and things  that people just don't get.  I think sophisticated users might like Windows 8.  It's certainly grown on me, but I have a feeling it's going to be really problematic for a lot  of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're also doing something very interesting, which is that they are including news in  Windows 8.  Yeah.  And so they're licensing content from major media companies.  They have editors.  They've hired people.  They're working on this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think they're really, this is a tablet.  Even Windows 8 is a tablet.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm going to say I went to Best Buy and I played with a touchscreen laptop for Windows  8 and I do like a touchscreen laptop.  You'll need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll need it.  You'll want it anyway.  You won't need it, but you'll want it with Windows 8, I think.  And that's why I got the RT tablet.  I'm really curious as to how that works.  There's very little RT software, so I don't know what that's going to be like.  I hope it doesn't join the Playbook and the Zoom and all those other bad tablets that I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do want to try that keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, come up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll come up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Sounds good.  Gina Trapani, you could find her.  She's easy to find.  Smarterware.com, I'm sorry, .org.  .org, yeah.  And thinkup.com.

Transcript:  And of course, here every Wednesday afternoon, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Great show, as always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My favorite hour of the week.  I really enjoy the conversations we have.  I do too.  Me too.  I learn a lot.  Not only from you guys, but also from the chat room screaming at us.  This is easily the show where I learn the most.  Thanks to you, Gina, and to you, Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's saying something, because you've got some great shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  I work with smart people, and don't tell them I said that.  But I do learn a lot from the show.  Jeff Jarvis teaches journalism at the City University of New York.  He's also the author of What Would Google Do?  and his new book Private Parts.  You can read his blog at Buzz Machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this week, I'm not pink, but I'm pixelated, and I apologize.  Oh, I don't mind the pixelation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're taking it much more seriously than I am.  I hate it.  I like to see myself crisp.  We should also mention Gina has a show on 5x5 at 5x5.tv called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In Beta.  Yeah, with Kevin Purdy.  We do it on Tuesdays.  Check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I want to talk to both of you about doing more shows on the Twitter network.  We'll be in touch.  Did you get your raise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, did we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I shouldn't have said anything.  I'm going to dance down my bell box.  It's not like jump up and down.  It might have been a pleasant surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whatever you give us is a pleasant surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the show's doing pretty well.  So we just thought what we do, we just every quarter or so we adjust the  host fees just because we want to reflect the revenue.  Can I quit my day job?  Yeah.  No.  I didn't mean to get your hopes up there.  It's a buck 50 and a Chipotle gift certificate.  I can bootstrap my startup.  No, I didn't say raise.  I said raisins, raisins.  I'm sending you all dried fruit and a free playbook.  Thank you, Guyver and Kevin in Dublin for those jokes.  I have joke writers in the chat room.  If you want to join us, we'd love to see you at 1 PM Pacific, 4 PM Eastern time.  That's a 2000 UTC on Twitter dot TV, but you can always get audio and video downloads.  After the fact, our on demand versions are always online at Twitter.tv and wherever.  And her podcasts are aggregated.  Thanks for joining us.  I'll see you next week on Twig.
