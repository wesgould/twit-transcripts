Time for Twig, This Week in Google.  I'm going to start with Jeff Jarvis because no one knows how long he's going to last.  It looks like you're in a funeral parlor for one thing.  Is that the coffin behind you?  Is this awake?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's going on here?  It's awake for bandwidth.  I'm at the Postal Vision 2020 conference in Washington, DC, looking out on the Washington  monument as we speak.  And I have no bandwidth from this.  The Lowe's Enfant Plaza Hotel has .16 up.  So I'm on my MiFi and we're praying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, but I got to tell you, this looks fantastic.  So is this 4G?  It's 4G.  Yeah.  Well, I think in DC they've got good 4G.  Who's the carrier?  It's Verizon.  So it's LTE.  I think that looks pretty darn good.  In fact, that might be better than a lot of home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chad and I were talking though, is I want to get the, what are they called?  Bondering or whatever.  The thing you had in your backpack, it's out the Southwest.  I want to get it.  Keep this one and then get a Ting and bond the two so I'm safer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think actually, well, we'll see.  Knock on wood.  This looks like you might be, this might be a good alternative in areas where there's  a good LTE.  It looks really, really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we downgraded the signal and I'm not getting the video from you and I'm not doing  anything else on my laptop.  Right.  Well, I'm liking it.  This hotel, they supposedly had wired downstairs.  It's just awful.  These hotels should all be shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the problems is they're sharing bandwidth with everybody else in the hotel and everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  else is good.  They're not buying enough though.  They need to buy more.  $100 a head for the Wi-Fi that doesn't work.  Wow.  It didn't, but that was their going in bid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're at a postal?  I haven't introduced anybody else.  Let me introduce the rest of the panel.  Okay, do that first.  And then I want to hear what this is all about.  Of course, Gina Giappani.  And then you can do your stamps.com commercial.  And then I actually will do a stamps.com.  Gina Giappani is here, of course, from smarterware.org and thinkupapp.com.  I'm going to move you in a little bit closer, Gina.  I don't like you so far away.  You were, but I'm mad at you because you were in the area and you didn't stop by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was.  I'm so sorry.  I was up there for a couple of days.  I had back-to-back meetings for thinkup.  I was at food camp over the weekend and then just had back-to-back meetings for thinkup  and just got home last night.  Just started to watch the WWDC keynote this morning, three days later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I thought you were here for because you are doing iPhone development as well as  Android development, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's because I'm dogfooding my iOS app.  I love Android and I'll be a Google I.O. in a few weeks.  But yeah, that was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Likely excuse, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it to do text?  You're dogfooding?  What is it that you're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's to do text.  Yeah, exactly.  I wanted to get a sense of what it was like to walk around in the world.  Instead of just getting an iPod Touch and using it as a test device, I wanted to live  with it the way that my users were.  So that's why I switched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now I got to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do.  I like iOS a lot.  It was a big learning curve for me because I was Android for years.  There are just a lot of iOS conventions that I didn't know about.  People say that iOS is just naturally easy to use.  There are certain things about it, like double clicking the home button and certain swipes  and gestures that I had to learn.  But overall, yeah, I really like iOS a lot.  And I was impressed with the keynote this week.  And I think that Apple just does really great designs, great user experiences.  I do believe that.  I love Android too, and I'm really loyal to Android's values, that's for sure.  And I think Android's made a lot, a lot of progress.  I'm thrilled to hear Android news in a couple of weeks at Google I.O.  And I'm dying for that phone that you've got in your hand there, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love this Galaxy S3 more and more.  It really is a wonderful phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really appreciate both for different reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good.  And you might recognize this fellow sitting to my right in studio here.  Aaron Newcomb is here from The Source Show.  It's a open source podcast, hacking, making, that kind of thing.  He also frequently co-hosts our Floss Weekly open source show.  Try to do as much as possible.  We love having you.  And disclaimer, full disclaimer, you worked at Sun when Sun was acquired by Oracle.  You were acquired as well.  So you are an employee.  What do you do at Oracle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am in hardware marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if any big database hardware comes up in this conversation, you must...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Turn to me. I'm your man.  No, I was going to say you should recuse yourself.  I should recuse myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But frankly, maybe we should turn to you.  Better be better.  Anyway, it's great to have you, Aaron.  I'm a big fan.  Yeah, thank you very much for having me on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not the least of which reasons, because you always bring donuts.  In the morning.  In the morning.  He is a welcome guest at the Brick Twit house.  So, yeah, I guess we should start with WWDC because a lot of people have pointed out that  Apple made a number of announcements about iOS 6, its next version of the operating system  for the iPhone, that many of the features in iOS 6 are really just cribbed from Android.  In fact, it's pretty obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One piece that says that Android is still better.  It's on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's talk about it.  Let's talk about it.  The most obvious one is the, well, Maps is probably the biggest news story, which is  that Apple is in fact going to boot Google Maps from its operating system.  You still, I'm sure, will be able to get it as a third party app and do its own maps,  which are, as far as I can tell, a direct clone of what Google is doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Except people are having fits because it doesn't have driving or transit directions.  I mean, walking or transit directions.  It doesn't have walking, biking or transit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It also doesn't have, and I think this is not a small thing, it doesn't have StreetView.  Yeah.  I like StreetView.  When you use it, Dvorak, of all people, is always raving about how when you use it turn  by turn on Android and you get there, the StreetView pops up and says, there it is.  That's the building you're going to.  And that has some real use.  I think 3D, which both Google and Apple are doing, they both have little mini air forces  flying over major cities, is a cool thing, but not really of much use at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there some use for it that we don't see the same way that StreetView is probably useful  for self-driving cars and all kinds of other things?  Is there some reason that, yeah, it's not enough to just be cool.  It's not very useful, the 3D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not in the same way that StreetView is.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  StreetView is really useful.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the 3D stuff, I don't get the investment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that, I don't know, and maybe it's because you and I, Jeff, don't think spatially  like that for directions, but I know my wife loves it.  Really?  Yeah, my wife really loves to drag down the map and turn it into 3D.  For some reason, it helps her navigate a little bit better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's different on turn by turn.  She wants to see.  Yeah, but that's not, that would be distracting if it used those actual rendered buildings.  That's not what you see.  You want to see the little kind of simplified version of where you're driving.  And I agree on turn by turn.  Right.  But what is the, this is like Google Earth.  It's got a high cool factor.  I can't see it's really attractive.  A little application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't really see it.  Just a quick correction.  Bike directions are in iOS.  They are?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, Andy Bello did it.  I want corrected.  Yeah, there were some reports that said that it wasn't in it, but it is.  Bike directions are not there and public transit aren't in the current beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it have traffic?  Yes.  In fact, that was how we knew that Apple was going to do this because remember a year ago  when there was a privacy issue about Apple, remember saving that large database of where  you'd been, the database of Wi-Fi access spots and GPS locations.  Apple is in explanation at the time said we're developing a traffic app.  So yeah, they probably will have the best traffic, maybe even better than Waze.  Waze is same idea, crowdsource traffic information.  W-A-Z-E is on iOS and on Android.  But I think if you have, what is it all, 480 million, 380 million iPhone and iOS users  doing it all at the same time, you're going to have excellent traffic, especially in areas  where the iPhone is very popular.  Somebody pointed out in the chat room, this is true, because there is, and this is huge,  an API from Apple, much like Google does with its maps, you might expect third party apps  for subway or walking, biking, well they have walking but biking, that this is going to  empower apps throughout iOS.  Much the same way that Google Maps does, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so that was the first one.  The second one is Siri.  Siri is smarter, Siri is more like the original Siri app that Apple bought.  It can book tables, it can finally launch applications.  Now the reason this is a little confused is because, for instance, what's available on  Samsung product, and I can do all of those and more with the Samsung product, but I don't  know, what is the Google product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's voice commands, right?  I mean, it isn't a personality quite like Siri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is Vlingo.  Are you familiar with Vlingo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vlingo, Samsung used to ship Vlingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The S-Voice uses Vlingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It still does use Vlingo.  It's branded as Vlingo on the Galaxy S2 and the Note, and now they've dropped the branding  on the S3, but it's still Vlingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's still powered by Vlingo, yeah.  At least according to Lifehacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks a lot like Vlingo, so I could show you.  And by the way, I think the dictation is more accurate in Siri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the thing I wondered though, beyond that, Leo, I hear people all the time say  Siri is not that good, it's not that good.  How good is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Siri is pretty good.  What do you think, Gina?  You're new to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hit and miss, hit and miss.  I mean, sometimes I say things to Siri and it spins and it can't fulfill the request.  Other times it's great.  Certain things it's great for.  I use Siri to set reminders constantly.  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And very accurate there, I think.  Yes.  Shopping list too.  If you say, add bread to my shopping list, which is really a reminders list, it does  that almost perfectly.  And it has the geofencing, which is very cool, and they're going to enhance that geofencing.  So for instance, when you walk into the store, you can have it set up so that it will, or  when you leave work, it'll remind you of things like that.  But these are things you can do, if not natively in Android with third-party apps for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's interesting that Siri's built in to iOS, right?  And that she's such a personality that she did the opening monologue at the keynote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And slammed Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And slammed Android, yeah.  I mean, I think John Gruber said that there was clearly like an F-U Google tone throughout  the whole thing.  And Siri kind of said it in the beginning, right?  It was Siri talking on the iPhone and then the rim shot on the iPad.  It's pretty funny, actually.  It's pretty funny, actually.  Yeah, she actually made fun of all the, they showed all the Android build names and that  reminders list.  And she said, who's naming these things?  And yeah, that was interesting.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it was interesting that no human took that tone, but Siri was allowed to.  Siri's like the vice president.  The vice president is the attack dog, not the president.  Siri is the attack dog.  There's some other features that Ice Cream Sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about Passbook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Passbook.  Passbook.  Now, there's no analog in the Google world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a bunch of analogs, right?  You can do every piece of what Passbook does, but it's not integrated into one app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Fandango will let you buy movie tickets, but not airplane tickets.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your United app has the boarding pass, my Starbucks app has that.  So it's all on there.  It's just not pulled into one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would submit, and I think that was always true in iOS as well, and I would submit that  the unification into one tool is what makes Passbook interesting.  Not the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Passbook is really interesting.  But if you look at it more broadly, Passbook is about offloading all the stuff in your  wallet to your phone.  Exactly.  Right?  And Google's trying to do that with Google Wallet.  But I was talking to a friend and I give him all the credit for making this observation  is that Google Wallet is really cool, but you can only have it if you have NFC and if  you go to certain retail shops that support it.  And this whole idea, I mean, I absolutely believe that tapping to pay with your phone  is absolutely the future, but people are getting there slowly.  Right?  I think people are really kind of skeptical and not sure that they're ready for that yet.  And Google's kind of released that in a very limited way, unlimited hardware with limited  retailers.  Right?  Apple is introducing the idea that you're going to use your phone for wallet-like functions  kind of slowly and easily.  I mean, the idea of having my Starbucks card pop up when I approach a Starbucks and that  the balance is automatically deducted.  I never remember what the balance is on my gift cards.  That is that's a beautiful user experience.  It's not that threatening.  And it kind of introduces this idea that your phone will become your wallet in a way.  I think that was a lot less, you know, extreme and limited, I think, than Google Wallet.  So I was really impressed with Passbook.  The idea.  I haven't tried it yet.  I haven't installed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and there are the 4G fails us.  No, he's frozen.  We're going to get Jeff back in a second.  I do think that the thing about Passbook is not so much what it can do today, but what  it says about what Apple's intentions are down the road.  I mean, if you add the true contents of your wallet that we care about, Starbucks card  OK, movie tickets, airline tickets OK.  But if you put my credit cards in there, if it becomes an Apple Wallet, especially since  Apple already has my credit card, as does Google, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you gone into an Apple store with the Apple app and purchased something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but I know people who have and you don't have to talk to a human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's wild.  It's a wild experience.  Yeah, I've done it.  It was incredible.  I was like, you know, I had the app installed, the Apple Store.  This is the Apple Store app.  I had it installed because, you know, it gives me stats on my own sales for my app.  Actually that's not that maybe a different app.  You know, you know what?  I'm sorry.  I went to the Apple Store and I was buying something, a time machine, and someone said  and the Apple person said, hey, you can you can buy this using the app.  And I was so excited.  I actually installed the app right on the spot and did it because I wanted to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you could go in, take it and walk out, which is really weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You scan it.  It charges your Apple ID account, just like as if you were buying an app.  And then you just walk out of the store.  So weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't that the major of shopping, though?  I mean, isn't that what's going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what Apple would like.  And Apple would love to get a little 30 percent on all those transactions and probably wouldn't  be that high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I think that's why there's so many players in this market.  I mean, everybody is trying to get into this.  Obviously, all the credit card companies are trying to get into it.  Google, Apple, all the cell phone carriers are coming together around one product or  another, one standard or another.  And I really think there must be a lot of money here because everybody is crying at  it. Jeff, we got so sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry for this connection.  This company called InfoTrends did a study to say who would you most trust to handle  a digital email account similar but for business.  Number one, Amazon.  Last, Facebook.  Really interesting, because I think people don't want to mix.  The reasoning was they want to mix their social and so you have in your business and so  you have right banks, phone companies and technology companies all vying to be that  trusted intermediary.  The problem is, I hope they're not going to charge 30 percent, Leo.  I mean, three percent for MX is bad enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, and I'm sure they won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, that's. But I think there's an opportunity here to undercut all of the credit  cards and you know, you could it's something you can imagine Google doing of  saying, you know, we'll we'll charge point five percent for transactions and make it  work just to become the killer.  And it could and it could change transactions, which would be a good thing, I think, for  businesses and us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who has the natural advantage?  Is it the OS maker, the handset maker or a third party like Visa?  I think the real feel that Visa and and MasterCard and Verifone, which really hates  Square, for instance, have is that they're going to get disintermediated out of business.  It should be a good thing.  Wouldn't be a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if anybody really likes their bank or their credit card these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Although I have to think that somebody is going to partner with somebody.  So here's an opportunity for Visa to say, I'm sure what they're waiting to see is who's  going to be the winner in this horse race or at least this preliminary heat and then  jump with the veng.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would love it not to be a phone company or a bank or a credit card.  I would love it to be at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I think that that's the clear choice of consumers is Apple or Google, right?  That we would trust Apple or Google.  We don't want Samsung.  We don't want Visa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Though remember back in the day, Microsoft bought my friend, you Pender Chardonnay's  business on something, forgetting the name of that was actually a music recommendation  business, but they bought it to get a passport.  Oh, no.  Passport. Right.  Yes. Right.  So passport was there where Microsoft now was an early attempt.  Yeah.  Twelve years ago was going to be the wallet.  Single sign on.  And I think the reason it didn't work was that we didn't necessarily trust Microsoft  with this task.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I don't know if we trust Google either, do we really?  Maybe Apple's the one because Apple, you know, we know what Apple's business model is  is to sell hardware.  So they're kind of like Switzerland in this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But the problem is unless Apple decided to do it for other handsets, that it's  only of limited utility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, unless you have an iPhone and then you're good.  And that's why Apple does this, because it makes people buy iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  True. But then that doesn't get them into all the stores across the world.  Because I think it does.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's got to be a partnership.  I mean, I don't think Google or Apple want to be in the transaction processing business  itself. That part of it.  So they partner with a they partner with like, I think, you know, Google's really  already partnered a little bit with with MasterCard, right?  Actually, you're partnering with the back ends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's back end transaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yoderly is who you partner with somebody like that.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's even there's even back end ones to that.  There's there's there's, you know, big industry shifters.  And I can't remember the names of them right now.  But those are the guys that, you know, you probably buy one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw it in a movie.  They were the guys who handle all the transactions behind the scenes.  Right. I can't remember who it is.  I'm sure somebody will tell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember in the early days of Connie Nast, when I was there working on on  style dot com and that kind of stuff to try to get a store up in the early days  was torture. Yes.  The only way you could really do it in the early, early days was by having a Yahoo  store. Swift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was the company in Europe.  I think Swift is worldwide.  Swift is internationally.  Is that their international? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do the upper bank clearances.  There's also a lower level credit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get your Swift number, right?  Yep. Yep.  So how do we want to pay?  So this is the next question.  So Google's betting we're going to want to do this  kind of almost a swipe or a tap against a piece of hardware.  Apple Passbook right now looks like it's using barcodes and QR codes. Right.  Which I'm not sure that's a good that's kind of as we  I think we've experienced, that's kind of a hit or miss, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but it's not the problem of you having to take a picture of a QR  code which goes nowhere.  I use the Starbucks app all the time in Starbucks.  And all they all I do is hold it up in front of the scanner and it's done.  And boom, it's very easy. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think, Gina? What would you like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I want that.  I mean, I don't care about the technical implication.  Like, I mean, I just want it to be easy and I want it to work.  And, you know, buying that thing at the Apple store that way was was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  swiped a barcode, right? On that on the product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. If I remember correctly.  Yeah, I was actually looking at the barcode.  I was pointing the phone at the barcode on the on the object on the product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem with NFC, too, is I think people will have this fear that  is it charging me for things when I don't know it?  Right. Whereas when I hold it up and the scan and it beeps,  I know that that's a finished transaction. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just I'm like people people like tap to pay, you know, tap to pay is not that big a deal.  The fact is, is that paying for a meal at a restaurant with a credit card  involves handing over the card, bring it back, sign in.  And that's scary. A lot of transactions.  Cash is dirty and inconvenient.  You get a lot. I mean, there are just there's so many things.  Paying with your phone is is is a much, much easier transaction.  And I think that really somebody in the chat room asked,  did do the people really trust Apple or they just trained because of iTunes?  I mean, Apple really has done the best job in the long, you know,  has been doing this for the longest of training people like, hey, you know,  we've had your payment information, we've made it so easy for you to buy songs  and now apps and now software on your desktop and now products in our Apple stores.  You know, Apple's really teaching users like how to pay.  And that and that it's safe and secure and that works.  Right. I mean, it hasn't had any, you know, security issues with with payment.  And they've been they've had credit card.  I mean, they were they were talking about this is W.W.D.C.  They the largest database of credit cards that that well that they know of.  So I don't know what that means. If there's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is Amazon a player in this?  I mean, Amazon is the payment method for Kickstarter. Right.  I'm surprised I haven't seen them do more.  I would think they'd be such a natural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're not in your pocket yet.  The Kindle, the Kindle, the Kindle is a buying machine.  Right. And Amazon purchasing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they never think past their own shelves.  They've got this infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I bet you they are thinking.  I bet you they are. I don't see the results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I so if Apple starts to become preeminent,  this is what's Google's relationship with with Amazon?  Is this is it hostile because Amazon didn't give them credit with  in the fire or is it is it good because they're an Amazon?  They're a distributor of Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a very interesting landscape we're about to enter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah, it is interesting.  But I think being in your pocket, I mean, your phone is in your pocket.  So you're going to pay with pay with that anywhere. Right.  You don't have a Kindle in your pocket.  And, you know, I mean, Amazon is great for payments on the Web. Right.  But but that's the other thing that does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really interesting is is is the fear of credit card fraud. Right.  Somebody can take your number and all the fear about, oh, my God,  they have your number and your other little numbers.  There's been a breach of security and all that.  If we start to get to physical devices,  that's going to be potentially a much more secure transaction.  People are going to feel a lot better about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, we had Bill Harris on triangulation a month or two ago.  He was former CEO of PayPal.  He runs a kind of mint like website called Personal Capital now.  But his great interest is in finance.  He says it's all an authentication problem.  Yes. Any time you have payments, really, the problem is merely  are you who you say you are? Am I who I say I am?  Once we validate that, then the transaction can proceed securely and safely.  And so if you think about it, in that case,  these phones are really perfect for that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a great cloud story because because money really is a cloud.  There is no. Yeah, it's all bits.  Yeah, it's all bits.  It's all just up there somewhere.  And you have to have authorized and authenticated access  to a supposed virtual value in the cloud.  So who is the best at authentication?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who has does anybody have a leg up on this?  I mean, Google, probably, right?  Who knows Facebook?  Facebook knows who you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mm hmm. Yeah, maybe it's Facebook.  It could be Facebook and Amazon together doesn't have my credit card,  but Amazon does. They're a part of Amazon does.  Yeah. You could imagine a lash up there to be very powerful.  So so so why would Facebook do that to get back at?  Well, I mean, supposedly now Facebook's all lovey dovey with Apple.  But how long will that last? Yeah, it's a very.  And Apple, Apple doesn't really have your credit card.  Apple has access to transactional infrastructure at scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The potential for this is so massive.  And we're talking trillions of dollars a year, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the data and the knowledge and the data.  Yeah, that's value.  Yeah, so there's going to be competition on the rates to come down, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But I mean, but there's huge value.  And even if you're doing  millions and millions of transactions a day  and you only get a fraction of a penny per transaction,  it still can be a significant amount of money.  There's huge incentive.  You've got a lot of stakeholders here, many, most of whom are competing with one another.  But there is incentive if you could if you could see your way to a winner,  if you could say it's Facebook, if only they had hardware.  Maybe that's why they're doing a phone and a credit card.  You know, there's got to be some way that this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One will kill a Leo is if the retailers can't stand to have five different hardware standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, one way has to work.  In fact, with credit cards, it didn't work when it was Visa or MasterCard.  It didn't work till it didn't matter.  And you just go in and you give them a piece of plastic.  And if you had to think about, oh, do they support MasterCard or Visa be a pain?  And that's why MasterCard and Visa won versus American Express Discover.  Remember Diners Club? Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, do you remember that today's Leo?  My mother used to have a charge plate.  Charge plate at Macy's. Yes.  That old metal plate and it had notches in it based on what stores was authorized  youth. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And none of that worked because it was too fragmented.  And that's kind of the state we're in right now.  At some point, there's going to be some  and it's going to be like rock candy, I think, because I think we're just super  saturated right now and we're just waiting for it to click.  And when it happens, it's going to happen.  And you will look back and say, wow, that was fast.  Remember, like ATMs, you know, I mean, people don't go into banks anymore.  That's it's going to be like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're just going to turn around to as the ATM was there to get rid of the tellers  once they got rid of the teller.  And so they begged us to go to the ATMs to save the money there.  And then once we're all in the ATMs, they try to charge us for the ATMs.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think the key is it comes down to three things.  Ease of use, ubiquity and security.  Precisely. Whoever can do those three things first, the best is going to win.  Or at least be the leader for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's why you look at somebody like Square, who really is a is kind of the  out is kind of the out party.  They're not really they're doing a great thing.  I love Card Case.  I guess they pay for pay with Square now, they call it.  But I go into the local coffee shop here because that's the one I can go in.  And they just say, put it on Leo.  And that is a really perfect it's it's got convenience on its side,  but it doesn't have ubiquity.  And I think without ubiquity, I trust them and it's convenient.  But it's not everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's another one on Kickstarter and I supported this project.  I forget the name of it.  But it's a it's an iPhone case.  And you what you do is you take all of your credit cards and affinity cards  and scan them in or roll them in.  And then you have one card out of the case that's readable as if it were  your Starbucks card, as if it were your United Airlines card.  Terrible. Yeah, I think it's probably not going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it too late to get your money back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I feel it's one of those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have thrown away so much money on Kickstarter.  And this is a perfect example, Jeff.  You don't even remember the name of it.  You thought it was a good idea.  And you don't even remember the name of it.  They got your money.  It's too late before it's gone.  They got your money. It's too late. It's over.  We're going to take a break.  Jeff Jarvis, Gina Tripani, Aaron Newcomer here.  We're talking about Google, the cloud Facebook and yeah, a little Apple too,  because Apple's announcements.  Actually, there's a really good article on The Verge  about comparing Chrome and Safari on the new MacBook Pro Retina.  And it just shows you everybody, including Chrome,  have to update now to support this high resolution.  There was an article in The Wall Street Journal, a guy said, businesses, CIOs,  watch out these new don't let your don't let your employees get these new displays.  They'll suddenly be watching high def video all the time.  Jeff, what are you at? You're at a postage conference.  What is that all about?  We lost him. He's he's quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A guy in the industry named John Callahan, a delightful, wonderful, nice guy.  But there's a lot of our fans here. Good.  There's fans here. So they'll be watching.  So John read my book, What Would Google Do?  And and tried to apply that to the Postal Service.  What would Google do if it on the Postal Service?  And the head of the Postal Rate Commission, Ruth Goldway,  happened to answer a question at a conference, just that question.  What would Google do if it on the Postal Service?  And she said Google would buy everyone in the country,  every home in the country, a computer and a printer.  Minitel. Right, right.  And so it led to I helped last year a little bit more than this year,  but organizing John organizing a conference of trying to get all the people together,  trying to figure out what the F the future of the Postal Service is.  This is the second one this year talking all about the Postal Service as a platform.  What should that be? What should it be enabling?  And a lot of discussion is really fascinating  for the experts who are on one of the panels I ran.  Really, really smart guys.  I asked them, what's the opportunity?  And the four things were control of the address structure,  tying your name to an address where you can reliably deliver.  Number two is big data.  Number three is e-commerce.  The Post of Hong Kong has places where small businesses can come in  and very easily send things, not just receive.  And four is trust and privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yes, there you go.  You talk about authentication, the Postal Service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. Some danger there.  You know, I don't want to have a national identity card  that we have to use for the Internet.  But you do want identity for things like all these transactions  we just talked about and all that authentication.  If the Postal Service said yes, this is really you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The USPS has been talking about signing and stuff like that, right?  I mean, I think they've been involved in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the Postal Service is, you know, in terrible financial straits.  The Postmaster General spoke here yesterday and said straight out  that it's Greece, which is pretty serious talk.  But so it's this weird thing.  John Callan brought me into it.  You know, what the heck do I know about Postal Service?  What a fascinating day.  And it's a fascinating discussion about another industry in great  in great disruption that should be a platform for a lot of innovation.  And the one of the vendors mentioned here, all of this.  As a new way to do Indisha and to do selling of stamps.  And in terms of going into the post, having to go into the post office.  And do we need 35?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's fading in and out.  I'll see you at the conference.  Patterson says he wants the Postal Service to deliver cold milk  and eggs, and then soon they'll be delivering shampoo.  And wait a minute, that's the milk man.  You know, I do think the Postal Service is clearly sees an opportunity  That was that's the the ability to print postage yourself.  And that's where stamps.com, our sponsor, actually, in fact,  I'm going to do a stamps commercial right now.  Really has a leg up. They've been doing postage, printing postage,  not a postage meter. We're not talking Pitney Bowes here.  We're talking your computer, your printer, no special links.  You print postage right on the envelope.  If you want, you could print stamp.  You can actually buy blank stamps and you print on there,  print on a piece of paper and tape it to the box.  Stamps.com, it's how they work with the post office  so that you can buy and print US postage with what you've already got.  They even offer a USP scale so that you're always using  exactly the right postage.  They've got a lot of really neat solutions.  Plus, the Postal Service like stamps.com so much they offer you discounts  you can't get at the post office 20 up to 21 percent on Express Mail  and up to 15 percent on Priority Mail.  They make it easy to mail packages of any size of mail carrier.  Come and get it free. You can even schedule free pickups.  So the post office loves stamps.com.  It's really a solution for them.  And I think this is a great solution for you if you're a small business.  Lots of good features. In fact, if you are a heavy user,  you don't even have to pay anything for this service.  It is so great. I want you to try it right now.  We've got a special no risk trial offer if you go to the stamps.com website.  Now, wait a minute before you click that note, see that $80 offer?  Don't click that. Click the microphone above it.  This is kind of a trick.  And use the offer code TWIG.  That's how they know that was us.  And they're going to offer you, oh, there's my smiling face.  If you don't see my face, don't buy it.  If you see Adam Carolla's face, it's not it's not for you.  You get a hundred ten dollar bonus offer.  Fifty five dollars in postage coupons.  The digital scale, USB scale.  You just pay shipping and handling on that.  I think it's five bucks.  There is the details. Read the details, too.  If they get the supplies kit, the month trial, this is a great offer.  I really like it. I want you to try it right now.  Stamps.com. Click the radio microphone.  Use the offer code TWIG and try this for 30 days.  I think you will be very impressed.  And I know if you're an Amazon or eBay seller, you're going to just love it.  It's the only way to fly.  And just you never have to go out and go to the post office again.  Stamps.com.  Do they are you back, Jeff? Yeah, we're having it's funny.  It's good when it's good. It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just I think somebody comes in and makes a phone call.  How dare they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's network congestion, network congestion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me give thank you, Chad.  Chad's calling me back.  Yeah, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That works. We're used to doing that.  It's amazing what we do to keep this network on the air.  Spit there.  Yeah, it really is.  If you saw the basement, you don't understand.  Apple's going to add integrate Facebook and Twitter.  We've had that for a long time on Android.  In fact, we've had everything I you know, I've got Pinterest,  Pinboard, anything with a pin in it.  I've got integrated. I could share.  In fact, the only negative on Android is my sharing list is so long.  And sometimes I have to scroll a long way  because it integrates with everything.  And there's an advantage Android has by being open.  Just works with everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something I really miss. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple is, let's say, stealing the notification system that Android has.  It's so good.  She wanted for ages. Yeah, yeah.  That's on the desktop, actually.  They're going to do it too on the desktop.  So they liked it so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that could the convergence of iOS and Mac OS 10  was very interesting to watch that happen slowly.  That notification center looks exactly like it does on iOS.  And it's on your desktop now. It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and the growl has been Sherlocked, unfortunately.  I feel bad about that. Yeah.  They're going to add. This is really interesting.  They're not cellular calls to FaceTime.  Now, you can do that with Skype and Tango, but to have it built in  to the OS to the point where you go to a contact and now  it actually has been this way for a while, but the buttons always said  call FaceTime message or email.  And now it doesn't matter if you're on cellular.  You can still do it.  And I think that that's interesting.  I don't know how they got the carriers to go along with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's easy. They're charging people for bits, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The carriers. Well, yeah, but I think the issue was all of those people.  And I'm still one of them with unlimited data plans on AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you're going to be a dodo bird.  I know I'm on the rise.  You plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could feel that laser targeting on my forehead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Google's obviously had some form of this with Gtalk  and doing phone calls and Google Voice to some extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think what Apple fans say  and I might be one of them in this case is that, yeah, OK,  but Apple is going to do it nicely and elegantly.  And with Android, it's always kind of a little bit of a kludge  and a little bit difficult to figure out how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not right.  Apple's Apple creates beautiful, simple user experiences, right?  They get the UX down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Apple will. So so is this unfair?  Apple tends to take the ideas from Android and then  and then burnishes them and then Android learns how to burnish back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  I think there's it's complete cross-pollination.  It's not a one way street.  Just as Microsoft took the recycle bin from Apple's trash can.  I mean, and this is all good for users because it just makes everything better.  Right. Yeah.  I mean, Apple may try to sue.  In fact, they tried very hard to keep the Samsung Galaxy S3 out of the US.  They're asking the International Trade Commission to actually block it.  And I know why it's a really good phone, probably better than an iPhone.  And so it's not that it infringes, it's that it's too good, in my opinion.  I know John Gruber and M.G.  Siegler will disagree, but I happen to think the Android phones are better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought it was interesting.  Some of the I'm not an iPhone user, so some of this was new to me.  But I was really surprised, like unique account signatures for email.  I know. I was like, what?  You don't have that? Yeah, exactly.  And then another one was like, I guess you can't attach things.  I'm a total noob when it comes to iPhones, because I really don't like them.  But you get you can't attach things in email, apparently.  And now you can at least attach a photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's it's it's the handling of the attachment, I think, once you get it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't do it from with from within the email from within email,  but you do it from a third party.  So you have to go from the photo app photo to email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you can't attach like a PDF or other things, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I guess Apple locks down the file system.  I mean, that's really the key.  The secret of what Apple is.  And to me, that's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How do you expect to get work done on your phone if I can't send a copy  of my presentation to somebody that I'm working with or a PDF of something  that I'm working on to somebody else?  So anyway, I found some of those things to be really, really interesting  that they didn't have a lot to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a design decision.  And I understand the design decision.  I'm looking at Apple's mail app in the iOS.  And there's just four buttons.  It's very simple, right?  And the more features you add, OK, now you're going to add a paper clip.  That's the fifth button.  And so I think that that makes sense.  And Gina, you're a software designer.  So I know you this is a constant decision, a trade off decision  between simplicity and functionality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It definitely it definitely is.  My other favorite moment was we are going to merge the search box  and the address bar in Safari.  So you just type something into this place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The last browser's not to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, really, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The very last browser not to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's innovation.  But I mean, I'm really glad.  I'm glad because I can't I still type search terms in a Safari  constantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And for some reason, I'm not fully sure of  Chrome does not work very well on Macintosh's.  You kind of have not all of them, not all of them.  But for some reason, on some of my Macs,  Chrome is like slow as molasses.  Wonder why that could be wonder.  Now you're using Chrome, right?  Now I'm not a bunch of tabs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm using Chrome, but I'm using it under Linux.  Oh, you're in Linux on my MacBook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just so everybody knows, Aaron, Aaron looks like he's using the white Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. We'll just cover that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should really be. There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it should. I got this from work and they said, hey,  this is really cool. We hear so have one.  I was like, oh, great.  Let me install Linux on it as soon as I get home. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you wipe back Mac OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't wipe it only because I want to be able to go out  and get hardware updates or software updates.  You know, if there's something, a driver or something that's not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Firmware won't be updated unless you have OS 10 on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. But you know what?  I've been running Linux on this since I've had it and I have not been disappointed.  I've been able to get it. It works great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that is that does not look like Ubuntu.  What is your it is it is actually a bunch.  You're not running that new shell that Ubuntu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I could be. This actually is.  I took Unity off. I'm not crazy about Unity.  I can't stand Unity.  So what are you using for your desktop?  So this I'm using actually I'm going back to the Gnome 2 compatible shell for this.  And I recommend Linux Mint to anybody.  I installed it on the Gnome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it doesn't have Unity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. Linux Mint has it's based on Gnome 3,  but their shell is so much easier and better to use.  I totally agree with you.  So anyway, Linux Mint. Sorry to get off topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I took you off topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no such thing as being on topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just brings me so much great pleasure that we're talking about.  You have WWDC and you're running Unix on your Mac.  Look at that. Let's have that coverage.  I love that.  Well, and I'm the bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm the consumer who actually the minute they announced that Retina bought one.  And it's you know, of course you are.  I got all excited because I got an email from Apple this morning.  It turns out the notebook's not on its way,  but the MagSafe adapter that will allow me to use older adapters on the new MagSafe  connector is so I'll be getting that tomorrow anyway.  We'll do an unboxing.  Andy Rubin, whoa, laid a bombshell, right?  You know, you got to think there was a concerted effort on Google's part  to do the best they could to kind of throw some water on the Apple bonfire.  They knew that the WWDC conference is coming up.  Last week, they did their maps event, saying, you know, see what we're doing.  They want to make sure they announced that stuff before Apple made its announcements.  And they were right to do so.  There was a lot less ooh and a nying on the 3D feature, for instance,  because Google had announced exactly the same thing three days earlier or five days earlier.  But Andy Rubin tweeted also last week,  conveniently as a pretext using the fact that Scobel had tweeted or Google plus  a rumor, a completely bogus rumor that Andy Rubin,  the Android head at Google, was going to leave for a startup called CloudCar.  In fact, Rubin then used that as an excuse.  No, I'm not leaving. And oh, just to make sure the meme is complete.  There are over 900,000 Android devices activated daily.  Daily. That's amazing.  And then drilling down on that, I think some people thought, oh, well, he must mean like reinstall.  No, these are activations where they're going to a phone company and saying I'm signing up.  So that's real. I mean, that's not that's not a bogus number.  That's an amazing number. That's almost a million a day.  It's almost a million a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does that include people fires, by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm sure it doesn't because they don't say it's an Android device.  I don't know. That's a good question.  Even if it did, it can't be that can't be more than a few thousand out of the nine.  True.  I don't even know how you can get to 900,000 a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm asking. Are there other devices we're not thinking of that are that are powered by Android or, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's got to include a bunch of inexpensive Android devices in the underdeveloped world, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Well, when I was in Korea, I mean, you didn't see iPhones.  You saw you saw Samsung Notes.  You saw new phones and lots of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say, though, that this does not include Wi-Fi tablets because they're not hooked up to an account.  So there may be many, many more devices out there.  I find it hard to believe, but I believe it.  I don't think he's lying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd love to see a breakdown on this.  You know, I don't I'm not sure.  I'm sure that there's some way they could hide the numbers.  So, you know, they didn't give away too much information, but just show like, how does this break down per country per device type?  I'd love to see a breakdown because just so many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, they don't want to show that.  It would be a fragmentation evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Absolutely.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love the picture on the verge, too.  I don't know how they got that picture of Andy Rubin.  Of, you know, after the rumor that he was leaving, you know, they've got this picture of him saying, look, here's my phone.  I'm not leaving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is that phone? Is that a Nexus?  Looks like a Nexus. Yeah, I think it is.  I think it's a Galaxy Nexus.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Oh, I'm not leaving Google.  I love Google.  I'm still here.  I love Google.  We're getting excited about Google I.O.  Apple's had its developer conference now in a couple of weeks, Google I.O.  Kevin Marks asked, by the way, if he can have your ticket, Jeff, do you mind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not up to me. It's not transferable.  I would love for him to have it.  Just go to the press, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. We'll go to the press, folks.  Yeah, let them know that I wasn't.  We want to send a different correspondent, Kevin Marks.  That would be the thing to do.  You ever hear of him?  You might remember him.  He used to work for you.  You'd think Kevin could get into Google I.O.  I think so.  We're crying out loud.  Anyway, we'll talk to the press people.  Three point seven million Android activations on Christmas Day and New Year's Day.  Nine hundred. That was last year.  Nine hundred thousand daily now.  Pretty soon the whole world will be using Android phones.  I mean, don't you run out of people at some point?  Thirty million a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the OS, Leo, for the phone that's in a Ford.

Transcript:  Microsoft. Actually, it's Windows.  Right. Of course, it's Windows. Right.  But now that was another interesting boy.  Was that an interesting one?  And I had to say I was gulping a little bit because Apple announced that they were going to  they were making a deal with everybody but Ford, including Mercedes, General Motors,  Chrysler, Honda, Toyota to put a Siri button on the steering wheel.  Ford got Sherlocked.  Because, I mean, basically, if you put an iPhone in a car and put a button on the steering wheel,  you've got Ford SYNC.  Yeah. Isn't that interesting?  Now, of course, you have to have an iPhone.  But if you're buying if you buy an hundred thousand dollar Mercedes,  I think they should throw the iPhone in.  Yeah, frankly.  Maybe they'd sell more.  What? It's an iPhone. Yeah. You know what?  They'd sell more. They probably would sell more.  Just build into the price, guys.  So is Apple is Apple just abandoning their relationship with Google?  Is it really all over now?  The map. This is kind of the the maps thing that kind of does it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think it's the maps thing.  It's the Facebook stuff that they announce.  Obviously, Facebook, you know, kind of has it in a little bit for it's one of their.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess that was bad news.  They didn't mention Google plus integration.  Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, so I mean, I think all of these things, you know,  and starting with the you know, there was an article on Wall Street Journal about this,  actually about how really most of what Apple announced is about taking down  or trying to compete better with Google.  I think that is what it's all about at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As Scott Forstall pointed out that Apple iPhone users are far more satisfied  than Google Android phone users.  Seventy five percent of our customers check the top box very satisfied compared to  less than 50 percent for the competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's like saying you're more satisfied with marijuana than air.  You know, it's a drug.  I like them too.  Wow. That's really let me think about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean you mean people are satisfied with the iPhone because they're stoned?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Buy it. Yes.  Right. It's a cult. It's religion.  And don't get mad at me, iPhone people.  I have it too. I like it too.  I got my three Apple products right in front of me here.  So I'm not dissing you, but let's admit that it's far more cultish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the first level is going to be higher.  The first step is admitting that you have no control over your addiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple will work with Google products when it suits them.  Google is the default search engine in Safari.  It's still there, by the way, interestingly enough.  Yeah. And will be unless there's a better alternative.  Right. I mean, the fact that there's not Google Plus sharing from the notifications bar.  I mean, that's just because Google Plus just hasn't, it's not, I mean,  it hasn't had the penetration, right?  I mean, if everyone was using Google Plus and wanted users wanted Google Plus,  I think Apple would have supported it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good point. Very good point.  They're a market driven company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think that's a big part of it, Leo, is what you just said.  I mean, interestingly enough, in this Wall Street Journal article,  they say that 58% of Apple's revenue in the quarter ending in March came from iPhones.  So I mean, that's their biggest revenue generating profit right now.  And then if you look at the smartphone distribution, 59% of global smartphone  shipments in the first quarter were Android.  So I think, you know, for Apple, they see the writing on the wall.  They're threatened.  They're threatened, just like they were with Microsoft back in the day.  Maybe, maybe not, you know, they were the underdog back then.  But, you know, I think that they really feel threatened by the potential that Google has  in this and what they're actually demonstrating and showing they can do in the marketplace now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mike Elgin pointed out something that I noticed has been happening with me on Facebook on the  mobile platform. I don't know if it's happening on the desktop platform.  Facebook has become more of a walled garden.  When you click on external links, and maybe this was a bug, I don't know if it's gone now,  but when you're in the Facebook mobile app and you click on any external link,  including Google Plus, as Mike points out, you get a warning saying,  security alert.  This link may not be safe.  You are about to leave the safe environs of Facebook world.  There are unwashed masses out there.  Be careful.  I got to try this and see if it's still doing it.  When that happened, I was offended.  It wasn't just Google.  It was anywhere on the free and open web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. My co-founder, Anil, wrote this great piece called  Facebook is Gaslighting the Web.  And that was one of the things that he brought up is that Facebook  instills this distrust of any link that goes outside Facebook by default.  I think that that's probably a bug, though.  I think there were some folks on Facebook who came in and said,  oh, this was a bug.  We didn't know that this shouldn't pop up for every link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't they test anything at Facebook?  Seriously?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Move fast and break things.  That's how Zuck does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  You would think somebody would have noticed that.  I don't know.  Was it a bug or do they wait and wanted to see what the reaction would be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but it's so silly.  They're not really going to say they don't really believe that.  I don't think it's not worth the Taurus that go through.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I just got it.  OK, so I'm scrolling through my Facebook.  This is on mobile through my Facebook news feed.  And I saw a great article by M.G.  Siegler.  I wanted to read on his website, ParisLemon.com.  Please be careful for the safety and privacy of your Facebook account.  Remember to never enter your password unless you're on the real Facebook website.  And be sure to only download software from sites you trust.  Sincerely, your friends at Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook is actually making another interesting change to their API,  which is affecting me at ThinkUp,  which is that when you authorize an application to access your Facebook data,  that token, that privilege only expires now after 60 days.  So you can't say this app has access to my Facebook data forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you're constantly asked for a re-login.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  You're constantly asked for a re-login.  So every 60 days max, it can be shorter.  You have to ask the user to re-authorize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just clicked a link to Ford Motor Company.  Please be careful for the safety.  And privacy, if this is not a bug, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe it thinks you're nine years old, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stranger danger, stranger danger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's almost like they got their white list and their black list mixed up or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm telling you, this is on the Ford Motor Company fan page.  You want to lose General Motors, you want to lose Ford, do start doing that.  These page links stop working.  You're going to have some very angry people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Try to go to Microsoft, Leo.  They're a friend of theirs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it works on everything.  Maybe it is a bug, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's a long-lasting blog bug.  Mike wrote about this how long ago, hours ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to find a Microsoft link.  That's the problem.  It's only whatever's in my newsfeed.  Boy, that's just shocking.  This is Spotify.  That's a partner, right?  Well, Apple's their partner.  Oh, even worse.  Please be careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So welcome to the walled garden.  Now, that's on the mobile.  I don't think it's doing it on the desktop.  But boy, that's AOL 2.0, isn't it?  Please be careful.  It's dangerous out there and we love our friends at Facebook.  Yeah, it doesn't do it.  It does not do it on the desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds a little bit like a bug.  Leonard Neil wrote his post, Facebook engineer said,  I work on the Facebook on the team that generates the warning and question,  the site integrity, and this warning appears to be a bug.  This is a while back.  We're still doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to email the Facebook guys right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, and we had last week, we bashed Facebook for killing the weather mines,  or actually it was not weather mines, but it was James Spann's individual site.  And it did go back in 18 hours and they said, we should reiterate this.  You had a conversation.  It was complete error and they fixed it as quickly as they could, which they did.  They fixed it within 12 hours.  It's happened to Scobel.  It happens all the time.  That I don't mind so much about.  Some of our chat room is reporting this is now it works on the desktop as well.  So what is this security warning when we click on links from within Facebook?  See, I'm getting a direct link out to the web for me on the same link that did not work on mobile.  So maybe it's just mobile.  Maybe it's just Android.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't reproduce this on the desktop.  All the links are going.  We tried on iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could very well be, and I think this is kind of well within Facebook's kind of MO,  that they thought, well, let's just see what the reaction is.  We can always call it a bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've emailed Elliot Schrag and Andrew Noyes.  Poor Elliot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every Wednesday I get an email.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I was glad we asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and I was glad to give his response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's nice that they gave a response.  Maybe it's just me because this is another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no.  They responded very quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The people who knew were all off at an off site.  So they gave me a response immediately.  They came back the next day after they verified and talked to people and said,  you know, it was a mistake.  Sorry, this is what happened.  I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm clicking on iOS now to see what happens on iOS.  And it may be that it's just me.  That's another thing.  I don't know if you're seeing it.  They're not short URLs.  They're full links with little thumbnails and all of the above.  It's being very slow right now.  I'm going to take a break while we.  No, you know what?  It's funny on iOS.  Oh, but that was a Facebook page.  Let's go somewhere that's not a Facebook page.  Here, Yahoo.  Fish oil fail.  Trending articles.  Oh, it's another Facebook page.  Nope.  Yahoo.  Let's see if it goes out to Yahoo.  So I did not get that error on iOS.  So maybe it's just me.  Maybe I'm in a test group.  Are you getting it, Gina, on your?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Things are weird and slow.  I'm checking it right now on iOS.  It's not happening on the desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see if the fourth thing happens.  Because this happened on Android.  I got the error message.  Maybe there's something that knows about my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you using Chrome or the built-in browser?  I'm using Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I'm using the Facebook app.  I apologize.  Okay.  Anyway.  It's not happening to me on the desktop.  It's a bad idea.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a really bad idea.  Oh, it's clearly a bad idea.  It's a bad user experience.  Knock it off.  It's just bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it makes me...  Truthfully, it's bad for them because I will not...  If I can't click clicks in my news feed  without getting that every single time,  I'm just going to stop using it.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Especially when they're trying to do deals  with news corporations to have this.  But I'll come off like a fanboy of the company,  but I just can't believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here it is on the desktop.  One of our chat room people said,  I got it on the desktop too.  For the safety and privacy of your Facebook account.  And this is a link to the same Yahoo page I tried to go to.  So that's really weird.  A Good Morning America site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It didn't happen for me on iOS.  It's not selective.  It is.  I'm not getting it either.  Something's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sounds like it could be one set of servers.  Right.  That has a bad version in it.  That happens.  It's not checking in.  It has some kind of blacklist or whitelist.  It's not checking in.  I'm just guessing here.  And it says, oh, when you fail to do something,  then make sure you show a warning.  And it's showing a warning.  It doesn't happen to me on iOS.  So this is the thing.  We've got to get better on the net about these things happening  and not having a bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Because there's mistakes that are happening right and left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  The fact that these guys at Facebook,  I mean, they've done some stupid things at Facebook.  Let's be clear about that.  But they'll answer the question.  Send them an ad.  Send them a question.  They'll answer it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to take a break and come back with more.  This is fun.  Aaron Newcomb is here.  It's The Source Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  The Source is the name of the podcast.  And the URL is thesourcesthow.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  .org.  Got it.  If you want to know more.  And of course, Floss Leakey.  He's a regular on there.  And he works for Oracle in charge of Big Iron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I've been on all about Android for, I don't know,  four or five times now.  So I'm a stand in.  Yeah.  He's an Android guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's a ticket.  Jeff Jarvis here from DC today where he's at the big postal conference.  And Gina Tripani from San Diego, California.  We'll have more in a moment.  But first, I mentioned these people traveling all around.  Because sometimes when you leave town,  you wish you could access your office computer securely, easily, quickly.  Sometimes you just go home early and you say, oh shoot, I forgot to.  And you don't want to turn around.  That's when Go To My PC runs to the rescue.  Go To My PC from Citrix is the best remote access solution out there.  And now, now you can use it with your iPad or your iPhone,  which is very, very cool.  Or your Android tablet.  They got an Android app as well.  Because suddenly you're accessing your Mac or your PC, your Windows machine  from your portable device.  I mean, your iPhone.  And you could do everything you could do at work.  You could send and receive email.  You could access network resources.  They'd get a keyboard on it and the whole thing.  So if you get that urgent request, hey, where's your PowerPoint slide?  Or can you put some numbers in this spreadsheet?  We're missing your input.  Or the boss calling, hey, did you see my email, Smithers?  Where's your response?  You don't have to turn around.  You don't have to go back to work.  You just launch Go To My PC on your iPhone or your iPad and you take care of it.  Send and receive email.  Run any program, access any network resource.  Go To My PC.  Here's a free 30-day trial.  See that orange button at gotomypc.com?  Click it and use the offer code Twig.  I'm sorry, promo code.  It's going to be a hard habit to break.  Promo code Twig.  See, it even says offer code on the lower third there, by the way.  Is this a legal thing?  No, I don't know why.  But for some reason, the sponsor has asked us, I don't even know if it's Citrix.  It might be their agency.  Please could you say promo code?  And it's a force of habit because it says promo code on the site.  I think actually this makes sense.  If I say offer code and you get to the site and it says promo code,  you might be confused.  Do not be confused.  They're the same thing.  There you go.  I said I'm going to call it the Leo code.  Use the Leo code Twig.  You know what I'm talking about.  The promo code there, the field.  Put T-W-I-G and that's just so we get credit.  That's all.  So they know where you heard it.  Go to mypc.com, click the try it free button, use the promo code Twig.  We thank them so much for their support.  I've been saying this for a while.  You know, I got this phone and I love this phone.  I'm a big, I am in love with the Galaxy S3.  I go to bed with this phone every night.  I wake up to it every morning.  Sometimes with my limbs wrapped around it.  And I have to say it's great, but I have to point out also  that it is a quad core processor in here.  And I have to ask myself, do I really need four cores in a smartphone?  Well, Intel now says, no, you don't.  Of course, this is an ARM processor, right?  Intel says that the current versions of Android make woeful use of Intel's dual core processors.  Poor implementation of, Gina, you're going to have to translate.  Poor implementation of threading technology by the operating system saps any benefit dual core  processing brings to a system and could even be detrimental to performance.  He said, even ice cream sandwich has a bad thread scheduler that limits the benefits  dual core ARM processors bring to Intel, to Android, to phones.  Now, remember Intel's trying to get people to use an atom processor in phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I do, I have to say, I do agree with them, whether it's a bad thread scheduler or not.  I can't really think of a compelling reason to have four 1.4 gigahertz processors in this device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you're never going to get four times the amount of processing power.  Just because you have more cores doesn't mean they're usable.  And I think that's what they're trying to get to here.  I mean, when I was at Sun, we found this out because we were coming out with  something called chip multithreading, which was like 32 cores on a chip.  It's kind of like hyper threaded stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so this was one of the big problems that they had to overcome was the scheduling,  the thread scheduling in the kernel had to be adjusted to make proper use of  that many multiprocessing going on.  So that was something that I know that the engineers worked really hard on  and they were able to overcome it.  Otherwise, we would have never been able to put that many cores into a chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but also the truth is that you aren't probably running for concurrent processes  on a smartphone.  I mean, yes, you have, when you do the recent apps thing, it shows you all the apps you've  launched, but they're not really running on Android.  They're kind of at best in a sleep mode.  They're not using like a sleep mode.  Yeah, they're not using CPU cycles.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dealing with multiprocessors in a mobile app is it's like an ample.  The problem is amplified so much because you're switching apps very quickly.  The app has to be responsive to your taps, even when it's doing making network connections,  which can also often be slow and are often switching from Wi-Fi to data to nothing.  I mean, there's just a lot more going on on your mobile phone  than on your desktop computer.  So the threading has to be really great to be efficient and make good use.  And yeah, I would just, I would love to see a third party, an objective third party kind  of improve this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because Intel, somebody in the chat room said it, as soon as Intel has quad core  processors for mobile devices, they'll be saying how great they are.  In fact, we wouldn't have these multi-core processes if Intel hadn't realized they couldn't  get to four gigahertz on a single core.  And they said, well, I guess we'll put two in and we'll say it's twice as good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's kind of an odd strategic positioning to say, oh, you don't need a good chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. For Intel it is.  Yeah.  Anand Tech, thank you, chat room. Again, Anand Tech has a review of the Lava Solo.  Isn't that that Russian singer?  Lava Solo.  It's a Intel Medfield based phone.  And they're running the JavaScript benchmark and boy, oh boy, it does have the best time  well over every other phone.  All these other Android phones in the JavaScript benchmarks.  Here's Browser Mark.  Also, the Lava Solo is tops only bested by the international version of the HTC One X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is quad core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is quad core.  And I don't see the Galaxy S3 on here.  So how about let's look at low level floating point performance.  Again, very good, except the quad core beats it.  The Lava Solo.  Who's buying this phone?  I can't even say it.  Here is Linpak, which is a scientific benchmark.  And the HTC One quad core phone beats Handily.  Beats the Lava Solo.  So maybe the Intel is not the super.  But remember, the Medfield is not a quad core.  I think the, is the Medfield two cores?  Here's a Qualcomm benchmark, which presumably would do very well  with the Qualcomm chips, the Snapdragon.  Oh, so they left the Snapdragon off and the HTC One again,  clobbers the rest of these.  I think you could safely say that at least in these benchmarks, which are synthetic,  the quad cores are doing pretty well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and you have enough bandwidth to do much more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, benchmarks are not, they're so synthetic that  they're doing stuff that you don't actually do on a phone, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someday we will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It can be very misleading.  And again, you know, those benchmarks might be able to take advantage of the quad cores,  where I don't know the whole lot of Android apps.  That are threaded in the first place.  That allow multi-threading, right?  So I mean, you know, there's a lot of desktop apps.  Games certainly do this.  Photoshop.  Photoshop, they take advantage of those multiple cores, but I don't know,  and I could be wrong, Chatroom can correct me if I'm wrong,  but I don't know a lot of applications yet, at least for Android,  that take advantage of multiple cores.  They all run in one core, usually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your Google TV is getting an update.  Sony and Logitech both updating to 2.1.1 and Honeycomb, actually Honeycomb,  Honeycomb, the Logitech refuse going to Honeycomb 3.2.  Oh, God help us.  Oh, Honeycomb.  It's a great name, lousy operating system.  Now, there is the new Google TV box, and that will be ice cream sandwich,  and we'll have AirPlay-like streaming.  I have to say, this is another thing that I really like on the Galaxy S3 is DLNA,  which is that kind of the open, real version of AirPlay, Apple's AirPlay.  And I was able to playback music.  I haven't tried it with video yet, but playback music onto,  I have two DLNA compatible devices, a AV receiver and a little internet radio.  And it was great.  Press the button, it sees them.  They're all on the Wi-Fi network.  I press play and boom, it's playing from the phone.  It was really sweet.  I presume when they say the new Google TV box will have AirPlay-like streaming,  it will be using DLNA.  Allowing Android phones to stream media directly to a TV.  However, users will need to run a separate app to stream content.  That doesn't sound good.  Is this the Honeywild device that you guys mentioned?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Honeywild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Arm processor.  They will only be sold in Taiwan, $95 to $120.  I think you also have to consider the market and a US device might have different,  very different features set, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, these little USB devices are becoming, or USB profile devices are,  seems like they're coming out like crazy now.  And I think this is one of them.  These devices, they're really small.  They usually have a HDMI plug that you can just plug right into your TV.  They're running Android 4.0 on an ARM chip.  It's pretty incredible what they can pack into these things.  Like this Andro stick?  Exactly. That's one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't know if these things require MHL HDMI.  This is a new spec for HDMI.  It's called MHL.  It provides power and means that you could,  because Roku is going to do a Roku on a stick that will plug into this MHL port.  My Ankyo AV receiver has an MHL HDMI port.  So I will order this Andro stick.  It is about the size of a USB key, full Android capabilities, multimedia services,  Wi-Fi, HDMI plugs right into your TV.  I don't, it doesn't say it requires MHL.  Let me look and see on the product page.  It will work with IR, remotes, wireless mouse, mini keyboards with touchpad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And these things are incredible.  And they're the size of my thumb, basically.  I mean, this looks really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So wait, but this isn't, this isn't a Google thing.  This isn't a Google TV thing.  No, this is Android on a stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is better than Google TV.  It's Android 2.3 Gingerbread.  It's on a Cortex A9 gigahertz processor.  It's got a Mali, Mali GPU, four gigs of NAND flash built in, built in Wi-Fi 802.11 BG and N.  Mini USB port for power supply.  HDMI 1.3 doesn't require MHL, it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That one doesn't.  I mean, most phones come with MHL and even if you don't have an MHL capable  receiver or TV, they're starting to come out now.  But even if you don't have those, you can get an adapter on Amazon for like 10 bucks at the most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like a little, it's like a tip pigtail that comes out of the phone,  out of the phone's HDMI or USB port and then has that special, our HDMI adapter.  These things will use DLNA.  I think this is going to be an explosion of little tiny USB.  You have one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've got one somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little explosion of devices.  This is, this one is called Andro Stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was trying to get Chrome on one.  I couldn't do it, but.  But you have one.  Chrome OS.  I was trying to get Chrome on a stick.  I failed, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a bunch of these coming out.  They're all based on the ARM, the various ARM chips.  Right.  You've got to kind of be careful because the nomenclature with ARM is a little goofy.  So like ARM 7 is more powerful than ARM 8 and you have to be a little bit careful,  but there's a lot of these coming out and I think it's really great that technology  has gotten this small and portable and it's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really cool.  It's like, you know, it's like these, what was the name of that little mini computer  that was $40?  I want to say that peppermint stick, but it was something like that.  Yeah.  Chat room.  Raspberry Pi.  Raspberry Pi.  I can't wait to get mine.  Peppermint stick, Raspberry Pi.  There's a definite suite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should be naming Android operating systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Raspberry Pi sounds good.  I don't know what that is, but I'm going to get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was hoping I would have mine by today to bring it in with me, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if you saw our security now earlier today, but Steve Gibson was talking about  something pretty amazing.  Apparently, we had talked before about Stuxnet and the New York Times article saying that was  an Israeli joint Israeli US spy development to take down the Iranian nuclear enrichment plants.  They were aimed directly at the centrifuges as those plants.  They were a government cyber warfare weapon from the US and Israel.  And then we heard shortly after that about a much older ginormous malware called Flame,  or Flamer, a variety of names.  I think there were some other names.  20 megabytes in size with a lot of modules.  Last week, they had a suicide module, and last week, command went out to Flame installations  to self-delete.  Well, now researchers have, and I think very convincingly, connected Flame to Stuxnet.  Apparently, it's the same...  They believe the same people wrote it.  This code is nearly identical in both...  There's a module of code that's identical in both viruses.  Kaspersky Lab discovered this.  So I think we now know, although I suspected, where Flame came from.  And in fact, one of the things, one of the very interesting revelations was that Flame  is using super sophisticated number theory to create collisions in the hashes, or to  take advantage of collisions in the hashes.  And mathematicians were saying only the top, the best mathematicians in the world could  have crafted this attack.  These guys are like super good.  I think we know now that they're very busy in Quantico, Virginia right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't this...  I mean, here I have fits on this show about China doing evil with hacking sites in the  US and going after Google and the whole Google fight.  It really does put us in a terrible arguing position that we do it.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we just have to drop the thing, the holier than thou.  Oh, you're using cyber warfare.  We would never do that.  Hell yeah, we'll use it.  And what the hell's wrong with it?  Oh, Leo the Hawk.  Well, here's...  Okay, here's your choice.  Cyber Hawk.  Yeah, I'm a cyber hawk.  And here's your choice.  And this was the choice the Bush White House made.  You know, Vice President Cheney wanted to bomb Iran.  So did Senator McCain.  Remember, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran.  That was their plan.  Imagine how destabilizing that would have been.  Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed, created a virus to slow down their nuclear enrichment.  Wouldn't you rather have that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, but the next time we get attacked by one of these bad...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, okay, so there is, you know, in warfare, we do often make agreements like the Geneva Accords.  Well, we won't use bio weapons if you don't use bio weapons.  We'll all agree no civilized nation should use bio terrorism or whatever.  Should we be doing that with hacking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not their internet, it's ours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you and Gina agree that it's bad to use cyber warfare?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It puts us in an uncomfortable position.  I'll go that far.  What do you say, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I maybe wouldn't have stated as strongly as Leo, but actually, Leo, I think I agree with you.  I mean, I feel like it's a defensive necessity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, surrounded by cyber hawks.  What's the fourth vote there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think it's an unfortunate reality of the world we live in, put it that way.  I mean, it's the reality.  That's what we are unfortunately stuck with.  Computers started coming, viruses followed soon after, and I would agree with Leo.  It is better than sending the planes over enemy territories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we go from realpolitik to realtechnique.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, I admit there's collateral damage as there is in all warfare,  and we saw that with Stuxnet.  It foolishly leaked out.  It was intended only for these Iranian nuclear enrichment plants.  It propagated on USB sticks and it leaked out and it did spread.  And then, malefactors who were non-political took advantage of the code in there.  But I think that we have clearly with Flame, you can see some very, very, very sophisticated  coders at the NSA who are probably the best programmers in the world who are writing stuff.  And I'm sure that they will make sure or do their best to make sure  that this stuff is very highly targeted.  And look, let me put it in a very specific way that might make it easier to accept.  If I said to you, Jeff, well, we have a choice.  We could bomb these nuclear plants in Iran and run the risk of igniting a forest fire,  a wildfire in the Middle East that we can't contain, or we could very selectively  inject malware into their system that would break their centrifuges and slow them way down.  Which would you prefer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want to make an equivalency here, but it is the logical version of the nuclear weapon  argument that bombing Japan ended the war earlier.  Yeah, but it killed a lot of people. This did not.  I agree. I agree. But it's the lesser of evils.  I just, oh, geez, I guess I'm on Pollyanna. I just liked, I was downstairs at this  Postal Conference, believe it or not, talking to somebody from the State Department,  because they're related to the ITU and they're related to all the stuff going around the world.  And we had a very high, you know,falutin conversation about trying to uphold the  principles of freedom on the net, and the net as this tool and fight against nefarious  governments doing nefarious things on the net, and not nefarious governments doing things that  will open the door for nefarious activities and the political activities and so on.  So it's hard to stay above the fray. Maybe it's impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know the right answer, and I'm being overly provocative, but I think it's a very  interesting question. And certainly cyberattacks can be used to kill many, many civilians. If a  cyberattack against our electrical grid or our water system or a variety of other things could

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  be absolutely as deadly as any bomb. But I'm also enjoying you as Dr. Strangelove.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think if the United States, I have to phrase this very carefully, because I don't think the  United States has any moral supremacy or any right or there's no the U.S. white man's burden  or anything. So I'm not saying that. But let's say there were a coherent threat to the United  States and to our security and to our shores, and we decided that the best way to fight that threat  would be with a cyberattack, not one that kills a lot of innocent civilians, but a cyberattack that  is very targeted and effective. I would think that that would be far preferable to a lot of other  choices. I'm not talking, I mean, why shouldn't we use those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so now that I'm going to absurd, I'll continue the absurdity. Is a drone attack  better than an infantry attack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, now we don't have time to get into that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say this opens up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a very different conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I don't disagree, but you got to put things on a continuum somewhere and that's less,  it puts fewer lives at risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a pacifist and I wish there were no war and killing at all. And I don't think people should  kill. I don't think there should be war. But I'm also a realist and I think that there are cases  where you do have to fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree. I was a pacifist until 9-11 and liberal in the foxhole was me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I hate to use, I mean, let's use World War II. I mean, let's find, when was the last  good war? Okay, let's say World War II. Nobody would argue that. If you could have, I mean,  we did, we tried to blow up Hitler. If you could have successfully blown up Hitler,  I think that would have been a good thing.  And yet nobody wants to acknowledge political assassination as a legitimate tool.  Right. True.  So that's a very difficult realm. And I think it would be a mistake to rule out the use of  cyber warfare as a tool of the US of US foreign policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. All right. We can still debate it, but okay. Next question, more appropriate to the show,  perhaps, is were our special wonderful Quantico geeks bad because number one,  Stucks net spread and number two, it could be tied to the other worm. Did they do a bad job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, this is an interesting conversation.  It is. And I can think of reasons they might have done that on purpose.  I think it wouldn't be necessarily out of the question that the US government would like our  enemies to know that we are capable of this because after all, who has the best computer  scientists in the world? Korea.  On that note, we're going to take a break. We're going to come back with our tool tip  and number of the week. This is a great conversation. Let's table it. You know,  one of the things we really, what Tom Aaron and I really want to do, we want to use the Oxford  debate format for some subjects. And I think that would be the very first debate submitted  that cyber warfare is a legitimate tool of foreign policy.  Oh, agree or disagree? Wouldn't that be fun? That would be fun.  Yeah, that would be a good one. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've got the right people here. Are you?  And then how responsible are developers for the software, the effects of the software that they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  build? Yeah. Isn't that interesting? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what's your moral responsibility as a software developer? Okay. Well, we'll put it all off for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the debate. Okay. We're going to take a break. When we come back, our tool tip and number of  the week with first a word from ting.com. We're talking Android phones. Let me tell you something.  It's not just the handset. You've got to get a better cell carrier. And these guys, I love them.  I love them to death. It's actually Elliot Noss and his team at the ultimate, well, two cows,  the ultimate collection of windows software. They used to be there. I think they just call it two  cows now. Elliot came to me last year and said, we want to reinvent cellular companies. We realize  it's a terrible experience for human beings. And there is a better way where you could save money,  get very clear billing pay only for what you use. Never pay prepayment penalties,  never pay premium prices for excess bandwidth. That's ting.com. They have real people on the  phone. There's a no-hold phone policy. It is just check it out at ting.com slash twig.  You can find out they have a little calculator that you just put in your stats, who your current  mobile provider is, how many devices you have, what your total is. And then you take a look at  the ting plans. And here's the beauty of it. This is all just suggestion because no matter what you  pick, you could say, I'm going to take extra large minutes. That's 2,000 minutes and 2,000  text messages a month and say 2 gigabytes. And I'm going to do three phones. My family has four  phones. That would in total be $109 for four phones and all of that. But if I don't use all  of those minutes, they give me my money back. If I use more, they charge me at the same rate.  There's no penalty. And I get voicemail, picture and video messaging, three-way calling, caller ID,  tethering, and hotspot for free. It's built in. I don't have enough time to tell you all of the  great reasons you should check out ting. They use the Sprint service. It's the nationwide Sprint  network. So if you've got good Sprint coverage where you are, ting will work just as well.  They've got great phones. Now I should say the way it works because you're not getting a subsidized  phone is you're going to be paying a little bit more for the phones up front, but  this is the fair price. And if you use our show code twig, you'll get $50 off that device.  Galaxy S2, they have feature phones too. The Samsung Conquer, they've got some very nice  Android phones. They call them small computers. I love it. These guys are geeks and they want to  do a better phone service. They even do, by the way, the Mi-Fi cards, high-speed internet cards,  USB, and they have the Sierra and the Huawei mobile hotspot. So I got to tell you, ting.com  slash twig, please just do yourself a favor. Find out about it. You're going to love it.  Make it better. The only way to make it better is to patronize a better company. Let the other guys  know, hey, there is a better way. Gina Trapani, your tip of the week. You got two of them. Go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ahead and do both. Yeah, do both. Okay. First one is called Blockly. It's a web-based graphical  tool for people who are interested to learn how to program, or at least people who are interested  in learning how to think like a coder. If you go to it, what is it? It's code.google.com slash P,  Google Blockly, just Google Blockly. Web-based graphical programming language. Users drag blocks  together to build an application and then you can output the source code. This is so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is so cool. So I can move forward, turn left or turn right. So move forward. Turn. Oh,  I see you go down. Okay. Turn left. And you see it right away, right? Yeah. Yeah. So then you can run

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the program. If you click on the run program button, you can see what you've done, how it works.  Oh, this is fun. Okay. And this was inspired by Android app inventor. It was a similar kind of  whizzy way to put together my Android app. And fun for kids, fun for, I think, anyone who's really  trying to get an idea. I think you could put loops in there and you can have a little, for people who  are listening, we're working on one of the Blockly demos. This is just a demo. Yeah. Yeah, it's a  maze. It's a little, the little Pegman, the yellow street view guy was on a map and where,  and Leo is dragging and dropping the moves that he should make. Go forward, go left, go right to  make him circle the maze and reach, I guess the goal is to reach the little Google Maps pin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I think that's a good goal. Yeah. Let's see here. I mean, this is a very trivial,  but you know what's interesting is it generates Java code. So you can actually see what the Java  code you're generating is. So that's a good way to learn Java as well. Right. Yeah. Or JavaScript,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should say, not Java. Yeah. JavaScript. You can export a Blockly program to JavaScript,  Dart, Python, or XML, which is pretty, pretty interesting. You know, this is just a preview  and it's, and it's kind of, it's kind of fun, but kind of fun to play with, but check it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if you're interested in whizzy wig coding tools. Yeah, I am actually. This is really neat. All  right. And your other pick, wait a minute, let me just see if my program works. Oh yeah. Let's see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  run. Okay. Peg man making a left. All right. I should have sounds. It should, it should.  Yay. I win. And he doesn't want to wiggle at the end. That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that cool. And you can also see that you can have, as you said, logic. So I could actually  write a, that was a very brute force, but I could also write a, one that would sense walls and stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like that. Yeah. Do a while true and make like man go back and forth continuously. So you could  write a solver, a more generalized program. Yeah. Yeah. So my other pick is the new version of four  square, which came out for iPhone a couple, a couple of weeks ago, came out for Android.  It's beautiful. And I love it. And I have to say that four square, I was in San Francisco this  week. I don't spend a whole lot of time there. I spent the entire time looking at four squares,  explore tab, which is really great. They're really emphasizing now. Yeah. It's not a game anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not check-in. I mean, they have those features, but really it's about, it's a recommendation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  engine. Yes. Yeah. And if you've got your friends hooked up and what's interesting about the new,  the new apps layout is that to me, it looked very Google plus ish. There's a big emphasis on images,  comments and likes are in line. So if you're following people on four square, I know a lot  of people who aren't into the check-in location, the geo apps are probably skeptical. This app is  really nice. It's really fast. And it's now the experience is the same on Android and iOS. And  it's hugely upgraded. And I find myself taking a lot more pictures and commenting to my friends,  Hey, let's, let's meet up for coffee, you know, kind of making ad hoc plans inside the four square  app really than anywhere else. And fantastic for recommendations for, you know, restaurants or  whatever, when you're nearby and it works particularly well when you're in San Francisco

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  during WDC and your friends. It's much more of a social network than it was before, which I think  is really interesting. I mean, I could see spending time here now. Yes. Yeah. And they've added

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  likes. You can heart people's, you know, so all my San Francisco friends were like liking my check-ins  because it's like, Hey, you're in my town, which is really fun. You can upload multiple pictures  and swipe through them. It's really, it's a really nice experience. And it's a lot faster,  which is always four squares, Achilles heel. I mean, if you pull out a check-in app, it takes  a long time for it to figure out where you are. That gets old really fast. And this app is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is actually is quite fast. Yeah. Look here, Russell unlocked the flame broiled badge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh man. I am such a, I am such a badge collector. I am a dedicated badge collector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me too. I always buy new badges. It's terrible. I'm back on four square because of this app. I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week. By the way, Facebook, both people responded to me. One asked  for a link. The other one asked the timeframe. So they're trying, but they don't have an answer yet.  My number of the week, appropriate to me, and that's Postal Vision 2020 is 168 billion. That's how  many pieces of mail the USPS delivered last year. And that's down the 3 billion from the year before.  They delivered to 138 million addresses every day, 228,000 routes and I mean, and 217,000 vehicles  in their fleet. Just a little ways to understand why it costs 40 some cents. I don't even know how  much it costs to send them a letter. Do you know? 44 cents by things. I see. I wouldn't even know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use stamps.com. It just prints it. Yeah, I'm going to let Aaron, I'm going to give Aaron the  seat, my seat to Aaron because Aaron has come up with you could take a pic. We only have a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's do it. Usually do a tool, right? So I'll do a tool. This tool is called, I don't know how  you pronounce it. Grive or G Rive. I don't know, but it's basically, if you remember,  when Google came out with Google drive, there was no Linux native Linux client interface that you  could use. So of course, what does the Linux community do? They get to work and they build  their own. So this is called Grive G R I V E. And you can go out and get it. It's on GitHub. They  have a GitHub page. It's Grive.github.com slash Grive. And so if you're a Linux user and you want  to interface with Google drive and have your documents sync back and forth, you can now do  that with this tool. It's not, it doesn't support, they don't have packages for every version of  Linux. There's a PPA you can get if you just search for Grive PPA, you can find PPA is an  Ubuntu term, which is a way to get packages on Ubuntu so that you can get that. I had to build  it myself last night on my server that I run at home. Actually, it wasn't that bad. And it did,  it worked right away. It's very, very simple. You just go into the directory. I love that you  can use it from the command line so you can actually navigate into the directory that you  want to sync with. And you just type in Grive and it syncs automatically. It does all the thing.  It doesn't do it. It doesn't do it. If you want it to do it automatically without intervention,  user intervention, you have to put it in cron or something like some sort of scheduler. But hey,  what could be easier than that? Yeah, exactly. Everybody can do that. Right. But actually,  the reason I like this is because for people that work on the command line, it's great. And also,  if you're a script writer, if you write scripts, having the command line interface. So like,  that's the first thing I did was I went into my backup script and edited that to automatically  launch Grive after I run my backup job. So it syncs everything up. So I went into Google drive  this morning and sure enough, there was a backup of all my my SQL databases waiting there in my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Drive. So this would be good for your server. I'm thinking for web server or, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  if you're just running on your laptop and you want to and you run Linux like I do most of the time,  go give it a try. The only downside is that Google will they have committed to developing  integrated tool for Linux. So this may get superseded at some point. Or Google may change  their API. It's always a possibility. And this, you know, there may be some hiccups along the way.  But if you're a Linux geek like I am, go give it a try. Aaron Newcomb, the source show.org for his

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  podcast all about open source. Of course, he's on Floss Weekly. So nice to have you. Yeah, thanks  for having me. What is this? What is this shirt? Save Ferris. Save Ferris. Now I know why they  were talking about Ferris Bueller, except that's not Ferris Bueller. Who is that? No, that's Cameron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know why they have a picture of Cameron, but that's okay. I like Cameron. So Cameron's okay,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  too. He was kind of underappreciated. He was. Is he the guy who drove the car off the porch? Yeah,  exactly. Out of his dad's garage. Jeff Jarvis, thank you for joining us from your postal conference.
