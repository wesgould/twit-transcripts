Transcript:  slash twig.  Are you ready?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Twig this week in Giggle. I'm gonna call it that because people got mad at us last week because we didn't talk about Google enough.  So it's this week in Giggle.  But it could be about Google, the cloud, anything that Jeff and Gina want to talk about basically. Gina Trapani is here, SmarterWeird.org  ThinkUp app. An expert giggler. She's an expert. She knows all about giggling. I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I practice giggling. I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you and I both like to laugh. We do. We do. I think that's good.  Now Jeff, he left me out of it. Jeff is not a big laugher.  Jeff, you don't laugh a lot. You scowl. You grimace. Jeff is rage face of the group.  Jeff Jarvis, a jolly old elf.  He is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York, the author of Public Parts. Great book.  About living in public. And both Jeff and Gina are our regular hosts joining us this week.  From GigaOM, Matthew Ingram is here, senior editor at GigaOM. It's good to see you, Matthew.  Hi. Welcome. Where are you based?  Toronto.  Another Canadian.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like it. We have more Canadians on this network. And it's not by choice. It's just it happens that we do. I don't know why that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're nice people. They're nice people like nice people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're nice, nice people.  They're vegan. We're nice.  Now Matthew covers the internet. As he says, doesn't cover anything that breaks when you drop it.  But we are going to cover something that breaks when you drop it. So your opinion is welcome, Matthew.  Thank you.  Because there's a new droid in town.  Actually, I should probably start with the kind of interesting news that Google is activating.  Let me see if I can get... This is from Eric Schmidt.  Ever the Leaky Civ, who says that this is at the Motorola on display event. I think the most interesting thing announced at that event.  The one point... Is this your number, Jeff? I hope I'm not.  1.3 million Android devices are activated every day. Of that number, 70,000 are tablets, which is a pretty hefty number.  That's 210,000 tablets a month.  That's decent.  And it's up considerably from...  Last December, it was 700,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just saw a figure somewhere. I didn't save it, unfortunately. But in some market, I think it is maybe here, the Samsung was outselling the iPhone. Samsung has three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's correct. But that, I think, is not to be given too much credit because...  Given the timing of the iPhone.  Yeah, the iPhone comes out next month. The consumers are actually smarter than some people give them credit for and are absolutely not buying the iPhone because they're waiting to see.  Whereas the Samsung Galaxy S3, which did, in fact, for the first time last month...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or could be buy the S3 while you can since it's got added to the Apple suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting because we saw a variety of... Did I get the number of tablets wrong? 70,000 a day times 30.  Isn't that 210,000 tablets a month?  Am I wrong? No, it's 2.1 million tablets a month. I am wrong.  That sounds better.  That's a lot of tablets. That sounded like too big a number.  Wow. 2.1 million tablets a month. Android tablets. Most of those have to be Kindle's.  I love mine.  I'm not Kindle's that one. Nexus 7's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Don't ask me about numbers today. I'm not good, apparently.  So Motorola at the same event announced the new Motorola Razr family.  The Droid Razr, ultra-thin. The Droid Razr Max. Those have already been out for a while.  Now the Droid Razr Max HD and the Droid Razr HD.  Basically, bigger, crisper displays, longer battery life.  Isn't that going to be an improvement?  Isn't that going to be an improvement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wasn't it? They had the Droid and they had the Razr and now it's the Droid Razr?  No.  And the Razr was some of the old-fashioned phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. They took the name Razr from the old Razr and put it on Droid.  I'll get it.  Because it was such a successful phone, the Razr.  Well, it was for a while.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, like forever ago, though. They need to ditch both those names and come up with something new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Droid is a terrible name.  Razr is a terrible name. So 4.7-inch, 1280 by 768 display.  This is the Verizon flagship phone, but I have to say, I don't think these are that impressive.  1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon, gigabyte of RAM, ice cream sandwich, but they will be upgraded to Jelly Bean by the end of the year.  They're LTE.  Oh, they're shipping with ICS.  Yeah, shipping with ICS.  That's so amazing. It's a great phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, shipping with ICS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a Google company and they can't get their act together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good example of what the hell.  Motorola's stopped doing so much blur.  We reviewed yesterday and before you buy, we reviewed a new Motorola phone for, was it for Sprint?  I can't remember, but it's not very blurry.  It is pretty much a vanilla Google experience.  So at least they're moving in that direction.  Big batteries on these guys.  I think probably biggest in class, the Razer HD 2530 milliamp hours, the Max HD 3300 milliamp hours.  That's I think even bigger than the Note 2.  So they say 27 hours streaming music, 10 hours streaming video, 32 hours mixed use time, 21 hours talk time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw that the latest iPhone rumor is that the Apple iPhone battery will be 40% bigger and Mondo battery.  So I think we're in battery battles now, which is not a bad thing for any of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we ought to be. Although the, it's all rumors.  We won't know till next Wednesday, but the rumored size of that battery is not big.  I think it was 1,750 milliamp hours.  Not big compared to the big app batteries you're seeing on Android.  It is, but you want, you know, what we're trying to do is get a phone that will last till we go to bed.  We're not asking much.  Exactly.  I hope it doesn't need to last all week, just till we go to bed.  And I have yet to find a good phone that'll do that.  The Nokia announcement today, this is announcement week.  Tomorrow will be Amazon's announcement.  We'll get that in a second.  Nokia announced two new Windows 8 phones, the Lumia 820 and the Lumia 920.  I think the thing most interesting about the Lumia 920, the top of the line, besides the fact  that it's running the new Windows 8 operating system, Windows 8 phone, is that it's going to use a PureView camera.  This camera is similar to the, what is it, 41 megapixel camera that they're shipping  in a Symbian-based phone, but it has, it apparently, good low light, more than 8 megapixels,  a lot of capability. If it lives up to its promise, it probably will be the best camera phone out there.  Is that enough, though, to get people to buy it? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And where do you go? Do you buy that or do you buy the phone camera?  Right.  The cameras with Android on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. That's kind of interesting too, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nokia, is it the biggest company that went from number one in a technology field to near death?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think there's a long history of companies.  IBM was pretty big at one time, not near death at any point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it didn't really go near death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple, Apple certainly got close to dying.  Apple.  90 days of dying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I did, but it wasn't number one. Not by a long shot.  No, it's a pretty big fall.  Big fall, but I just think that from being in such an enviable, wonderful position,  to such a low position in such a fast period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is probably...  I think RIM is going there, though, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Say again?  Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think RIM is going there, though, isn't it?  RIM is too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. That's true.  Sorry, Canadian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kodak?  No, I don't think Kodak counts.  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think really what happened to Nokia was the rise of the smartphone.  And ironically, Nokia was one of the first companies to do smartphones based first on Symbian,  and then they had Mimo and Migo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the Nokia Symbian phone was my first smartphone.  MoBlog and a Flickr with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Text America, baby.  The N95.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Remember?  Yeah, I think it was the N95.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looked like a camcorder.  Actually, I have an N95 in my museum behind me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I loved that N95.  That was an awesome little phone.  MoBlogging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  MoBlogging.  That was the Scoble special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. I first saw it at a podcast expo many years ago because I think it was Chris Markwer  was interviewing people, or maybe it was Father Roderick  was interviewing people with his N95.  Yeah, Scoble loved it.  So that's a really interesting situation where a company was totally dominant.  And by the way, they still are, even then they were known for the best cameras, weren't they?  Yeah.  But it's over.  And Motorola, apparently Google's selling off the set-top box division.  I wonder, this Motorola acquisition, Google does not seem to have taken it in hand very well.  These are not impressive phones.  They're real also, Rand.  Shouldn't they be doing the Google Experience phone from Motorola?  When's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wasn't there a quote today, someone said, and I couldn't find it again.  I saw it run by on Twitter that somebody said, and so I could be wrong here, it was very hearsayish,  that if you want a great Android phone by Motorola,  and somebody else said, would you go to Samsung and think of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not true.  Samsung is the Android phone to buy.  I think HTC, now HTC of all of the companies decided to wait till after Apple's announcement.  We'll see how that strategy works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It can be like the days when we had newspaper, we had magazine covers,  and we'd make five or six of them and leave them by the press and decide which one to put on.  Oh, you think?  Maybe they have different products ready to throw out.  I don't know.  You think?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Throw out that one.  Okay, that one is out.  We don't want to get sued over there.  You think it's worried about getting sued or not or being buried in the marketplace?  Both.  Yeah, it's just surprising that Motorola, well, is it too soon to say this is the new Google Roller?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe, right?  The cycle, maybe next year or this time they'll have finally.  Still, it seems like they could have coordinated a little bit to ship with Jelly Bean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The transaction closed in May.  So May, June, that was pretty fast to do it in three or four months is pretty fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're selling off the set-top box business.  So there goes our sort of Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. We had a whole strategy planned.  We did. We did. They wouldn't listen to us.  Fools.  We knew what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dennis Woods.  You said last week, you still argued, Leo, last week, as I remember, that  there will be no set-top boxes. So why be in that business at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, it's a bad business. It's gone the way of the queue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google executive Dennis Woodside became Motorola's new leader.  He said on Tuesday, yesterday, the merging of Motorola and Google will take mobile  innovation to new heights.  Okay. We have-  Versus what?  The Droid Razor HD is not new heights.  It's not new heights. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's priced at what, 100 bucks, I think?  For Verizon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't even know why people bother talking about handset prices.  I guess consumers pay attention. Have they not learned that really that's a fraction of the  total cost of the phone? That it's the monthly fee that really makes a difference?  Maybe not.  Anyway, Nokia's stock price tumbling 13% as a result of their-  Oh, well.  Of their lackluster announcement. $99 for the Razor M. What's the M? I don't know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So basically phones made in cold places are headed down, phones made in hot places are headed-  Ah, I think you've discovered a trend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You've put your finger on it.  Always gets a conspiracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The southernmost phone.  The great Robertson Davies said that Canada was not like America, it was like Scandinavia,  so the Nokia rim axis here has fallen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? You said it was Scandinavia.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is kind of like Scandinavia.  It is. It is. He argued culturally it was closer to Scandinavia.  Lots of fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Beer.  Beer? Just a quiet attitude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sled dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could do worse than being like Norway, now the number two richest nation in the world.  Thanks to their oil reserves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nokia is down 16% now.  Oy! So that's an example of what? Buying on the rumor, selling on the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The news was not enough to get the stock market excited.  Shares of Finnish handset maker drop after company unveils two new flagship devices in  make or break move. According to the Wall Street Journal, it was a make or break event.  Yeah, this chart, this is an epic cliff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yikes.  Investors want to be sure the devices will be selling well ahead of Christmas.  For Nokia, it's all about distribution now and we got no answers on when these new devices will sell  and which US market operators will market them. So that's key.  These are Christmas devices, but they don't have any deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nokia's always have, go back to year 95, they've always had problems  doing deals with the phone companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of experts think that that's actually what happened. It was just merely that they did not  have the US deals and so they were selling unlocked phone in the US and nobody was interested.  That was an analyst at the Swedish banking group, Swedbank.  Wow, that I think-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  60% of its value in the last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to have an interesting fellow on triangulation next week, not today, but a week  from today, Hans Peter Brandmo, who I met in Norway at the Nordic Light Festival.  He does something interesting for Nokia. He's a startup guy and the idea was that Nokia brought  him in to fund internal development as if they were startups. So if you've got an idea and you're  a Nokia employee and you've got an idea, you go to Hans and say, look, I want to create a Skunkworks.  I want funding as if it's a startup. They have startup metrics. You have to show a certain amount  of growth, et cetera, et cetera. The idea being to bring this kind of innovation into a company,  I think is a very interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a lot of big companies try to do that, right? Microsoft kind of does that a little bit.  Google certainly does.  Google did that with Wave. That's how Wave was structured. I wonder if you can have the  kind of urgency that an actual startup founder has around whether or not they're going to be able to  pay the bills inside a big company like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't unless your job is on the line, right? I don't think they want to go that far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have access to resources that you might not otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the key, I think, for him. And also the accountability. So you're accountable to  these metrics. You have to produce like a startup would have to produce.  Do you get the upside?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  You don't?  Well, I don't know. Maybe.  There's corporate politics there. You can do phantom equity. When I started Entertainment  Weekly, we were called entrepreneurial because we actually, this is God's honest truth,  we were outside the time life building one block away and that was considered

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you had only raised a pirate flag to the roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they regretted not having me close under their thumb. And then we got phantom equity,  which turned out to be quite a phantom in most ways because the accounting is always,  it's like Hollywood accounting. Well, no, we got to charge it for the desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Phantom equity. Yeah, I had phantom equity at Tech TV.  Oh, you were just the same. It was completely phantom because it turned out that Paul Allen  had to be made whole before we did. And by the time he got his money, it was like,  there's nothing left for anybody else. We're going to work on getting Matthew back. We've lost his  signal. You know, Rogers does this in Canada. They just, if they see you using Skype after 15  minutes, they go, you're done. You can't, no, no call should last more than 15 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those Canadians, they're not so nice. They only seem like they're nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mr. Rogers is not so nice. Are you on Rogers? What are you on, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Rogers. Yeah. See, I knew it. Is there anything else?  I'm contractually obligated to say that Ted Rogers is a wonderful man and tremendous service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ted Rogers is the Rupert Murdoch of Canada, which is the Norway of the North America. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's very confusing. I'm all, I thought we were Finland. Are you Finland? No, Finland is not part

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of Scandinavia. Finland is just completely different. It's his own thing. It's more  Russian Scandinavian. I'm told we're going to take a break. We got Matthew back, but I'm still  going to take a break. So there, this portion of the show brought to you by your friends at  stamps.com. Stamps.com lets you print US postage. I know that seems like that should be illegal  somehow, but it isn't. In fact, the postal service loves it because you never have to darken their  door again. You can stay at your desk and print your own postage, mail your own stuff. You can  actually do stuff, everything you could do at the post office, you could do at stamps.com. For  instance, give me one. International mailing. Good example. Used to be if you want to send something  overseas, you'd have to go into the post office and there's forms and all this stuff and get an  international mailing thing. No, stamps.com, they'll do it. They even fill out the forms for you.  Oh, I got one. Packages bigger than 13 ounces. I've actually mailed books that weigh two pounds.  You get them back. The mailman says you got to go to the post office because we got to look at you  in the eye in this post 911 era. Not with stamps.com. No limit to the size of the packages  you mail. You get discounts you can't even get at the post office. Up to 21% on express mail.  Up to 15% on priority mail. I mean, it's really cool. Now here's the deal. I want you to try this  so we've got this no risk trial offer. When you go to stamps.com, do you see it right there? And  that seems pretty tempting. $80 value. Do not, do not click that. Click that they're not going to  like stamps is going to be mad at me for saying that, but click the microphone and enter the word  twig in the promo code T W I G. And then it's a hundred $10 bonus offer. So what they do is  they increase the postage coupons you get coupons for up to $55 in postage. You use them over a  period of time. It's not all at once, but a, Hey, it's a $55 free postage. That's nothing to sneeze  at. And you get the digital scale for free. You pay shipping and handling for that's five bucks  to pay you back on that. They give you a $5 supply kit and a four week trial.  So you're, you're making out like a bandit here. This is a 30 day, no risk trial. All you have to  do is go to stamps.com and use the promo code twig. It's worth $110. And you'll see why I love  stamps.com. We have two accounts here. I love stamps.com and you will love it too. Because you  just don't have to go to the post office. The mail carrier comes to you stamps.com  uh, so let's move on from Motorola. Apparently Google is a, according to rumor, going to release  a Nexus seven with three G in it in the next six weeks. This comes from the next web.  Actually, Modico Paul O'Brien at Modico had the original story. So let's give Paul credit here.  That would be now the problem is that this is going to be a tough market because not only  you're going to see Amazon, I think tomorrow announced new Kindle fires. We're sure of that,  right? Because they, they sold out on amazon.com, but in a week or maybe next month, depending on  who you believe Apple's going to announce a mini iPad in this market. So the Amazon report on

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amazon is it's going to be ad supported. So they're going to break even the $200 line,  the Google set. So we see this incredible lowering and what is, what does Apple do in that  case? Apple doesn't go for price shrinkage. How is it going to be so special that it's worth,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you know, what 400 bucks at a, it won't be, it won't be. I'm convinced that Apple and I,  and here's, here's my reason. I think this, um, and I've seen a number of blogs that say,  really the mini iPad is an iPad too, in terms of internals, it's 1024 by 768. It's a smaller  screen with that resolution, but that's the iPad to resolution. Same chip in there. This is, in  other words, this is last year's technology and, and it based on pricing, it is possible that  Apple could actually sell this at 200 bucks. Really? Now the advantage, uh, of course Amazon  has is first of all, Apple was not going to do an ad supported device and Amazon's real purpose for  the Kindle fires to get you to buy stuff from Amazon. Exactly. I don't think Apple's always  said we don't even make it money on iTunes, you know, Apple makes money on hardware. So can,  but, but on the other hand, if they sell it for 400 bucks, it's not going to, it's a non-starter,  isn't it? I think so. What's the price? It's in a world in a world. You want to be Matthew Ingram

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to do in a world, in a world, in a world where Amazon is selling a tablet for $150 in a world  where Google is selling a $200 tablet. Can Apple sell what? 250? I think they could sell 250.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, Farhad, I think it was Farhad at, uh, Farhad Manju. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He had a thing  arguing that the Kindle wants to be free. And I think if you look at what Amazon does, I mean,  Amazon makes money on content selling content, right? They don't care about the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple's the exact opposite. I love this. The Kindle, like, like information,  the Kindle wants to be free. This is actually in the Daily Herald. Wow.  My record says Farhad on the, uh, about Amazon's mixed at best two summers ago, I guess that before  the holidays, Amazon would cut the price of its cheapest Kindle to 99 bucks. They did eventually,  but just did, they didn't do it until this year or last year, I guess, with a $79 ad supported  Kindle. I don't know about free. How much close to free, right? Yeah. I mean, subsidized for sure.  Right. But, but even at 200 bucks, it was subsidized. All right. So, so it's the point

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is Amazon doesn't care about the hardware price. Right. That's not what you said before about  phones that, that, that, that, you know, everybody knows the prices and the price. So the same will  be here. It's just subsidized a different way. If you buy enough stuff, if you join Prime,  if you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, then you get a free device. The device costs you nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because I think Scobel said that I think Scobel thought that the fire would be free with a Prime

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  subscription. Yeah. Before it came in, maybe there's Prime plus or something. You have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  imagine that they're giving you a cash register. I mean, that's what you have to think about it.  You have to think about like, this is a way for them to get money out of me. I mean, I hate to  be that cynical and I, and you know, and I love, I love the, the Nexus seven and I really love the  Kindle as well, but they're just giving, they're giving you a cash register for you to perform

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  transactions with them. It's a tube. They can dump content. But the key here is that we've talked  about that you've talked about this before guys, that, that the, the Kindle was a, a emasculated,  pardon me if that's sexist, but a, a gutted Android. Right. And it was terrible. It was bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's why the Nexus, I convinced us why the Nexus seven was so popular, same price. And it's  really Android. In fact, it's better. It's jelly bean. Right. So that, so what does that do to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amazon? Amazon surely is watching that and saying, this thing is actually good. Jelly beans actually  good. We're not really hurt horribly. If we put some of those features in there, we've got to have,  you know, those, those computer like functions of mapping and all that kind of stuff and communication  and email. Does this Kindle move beyond being just a content device to truly becoming a tablet  computer or does it stay as a content conduit? And will people be satisfied with something that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  just a big iPod as opposed to an iPad? Yeah. Cause the iPad's definitely moved into the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  content creation sphere. It's a laptop. Really. Meanwhile, what happens to a Barnes and Nobles  and then also in my, in Canada, the, the Kobo. Dead. What's dead? Yeah, it's dead. Who would

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  why bother? Yeah. And in fact, what's really interesting, this is so different from the PC  marketplace where you could have, you could have numerous incumbents. What this feels like in the  tablet market is really, there can only be one, maybe two. Why is that? Is that because it's a new  market? We'll let shake out. I mean, when, when IBM made the PC was just IBM, then it was IBM and  Compaq. Then it was IBM and a jillion other companies. Maybe that's what's going on with  tablets or is it really the case that right now there's only two, there's an iPad or there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nexus seven and that's it. There's only two phone operating systems. We just went through that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. But there are multiple hardware choices. Why multiple manufacturers. It doesn't  look like that in, you know, it's the cliff falls off. You've got, you've got iPad at the top,  pretty far below that. You've got the Nexus seven pretty far below that almost to zero. You've got  the Kindle fire and then there's nothing. You've got the Samsung 10 inch with the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  with the writer thing and all that. That's not, I think it's niche. I don't know. I don't know how

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well those sell. What did, what did he say? 70,000 a day, 2.1 million a month. That make, I find that  hard to believe that they're activating 2.1 million tablets a month. Do you think he's including  Kindle in that? Yeah. I wonder if he's including Kindle. That number seems way, it just seems huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Didn't they project. So didn't they sell like 8 million Nexus sevens, which was way more than  they projected. I thought I saw that number somewhere. So, and the Nexus seven has been out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for. Oh, that's about right. Just a few months. So it must be, it's mostly Nexus sevens. Mostly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nexus sevens. Wow. It's pretty great. I mean, it is really great. The thing that makes the Nexus seven  so great is the Google layer for me. Right. Right. Cause I just, I use calendar and I use maps and I  use Gmail and I use Google voice and I want all those things. I mean, you know, I want those things  on my tablet. Right. And you can't, and honestly, like I love the market, the Play Store. I think  the Play Store is better. Well, let's, let's say this. I think the Play Store, the app situation  in the Play Store is much better than Amazon's app store. From the developer's point of view or  the buyer's point of view? Both. I'd argue both. What's better about it? Content wise, Amazon has

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  way better content. Why people would, Oh, I see better than the Play Store. Yeah. So like, so I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that the experience of buying apps on the Play Store is, is better. Although maybe I should make  this argument because I don't have a Kindle. I haven't installed the Amazon app store. I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I find it a very weak experience. Yeah. The only advantage they have is the free app of the day,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but it's usually crap. Right. Right. So the Play Store experience is better for the buyer and it's  way better for the developer for sure. I mean, the Amazon app store you just have to wait for approval  and you don't have control over your copy. And, you know, it's just, it's, it's, they just haven't  developed it. The tools just aren't mature. They aren't as mature because they just haven't been

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  around as long. It seems a little thing, but I have to say, I love web install. Yes. It seems  like a little thing, but I, it's great. Okay. Maybe it's not just me. No, the, the, the McGill you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  have to go through with Apple of downloading it and syncing and all that mess and, and, and upgrading  things. I think that it is a step stage ahead as an experience, as, as an ongoing, you know,  consumer experience. It's too bad. I'm curious. Go ahead. Would you, if given the choice now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  would you buy this with 3G? Yeah, I think I would buy it with 3G. I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's too geeky to use your phone in tether mode and the wifi. It takes time. It's a pain.  Fire it up. Yeah. It's a pain. So really is it, it's a, it's a demerit not to have 3G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is. And you know, those, the commercials where the dad and the son are camping. That was dumb.  I feel like it's like they couldn't have picked a commercial that highlights the fact  that you have to be on wifi more to the people who know that you'd have to be on wifi. It just  seemed like a crazy choice of campaign. But yeah, I mean, this seems, this seems obvious that they  come out with a 3G version before the holiday season. Didn't somebody do a tear down and you  could see where the 3G bits and pieces would go. So, and I think that I think it's going to sell,  I think it's going to sell well. I mean, I don't know the people who already have a Nexus seven.  I don't know if they're going to buy the 3G version, but for the, for the people who are  serious tablet users who are going to be out and about, I think a 3G version is a big, a good,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  good value, good offer. Well, it's coming. They say, or somebody says, Modica says,  soon. You watch in the convention, you watch the Republican convention, the Democratic convention,  YouTube's very involved with both. They're streaming a lot of it. Although apparently YouTube  flagged the Democratic convention video on copyright grounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, at this point, like, isn't it so clear that these copyright bots are so badly implemented?  Terrible. Terrible. Where things get pulled out. I mean, I mean, Leo, you deal with this pain

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  every day in your day to day business, but. I've been complaining about it, but maybe now. So the  Hugo awards got pulled down by you stream for the same threat, same thing. They were showing clips  of Hugo nominated movies and the automated copyright bots saw it and disconnected it on  you stream. So the live stream of the Hugo, the big science fiction awards, right in the middle,  in the middle of it. First Lady Michelle Obama's speech live streamed on YouTube.  But then the immediately after it finished, it was flagged by copyright claims from WMG, SME,  Associated Press, UMG, Dow Jones, New York Times, Harry Fox Agency, Warner Chappelle,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  UMPG publishing and EMI music. Who should be mad about this too? Is it YouTube? Is it the companies  that supposedly complain through their bots? Is it the whole damn copyright system? Is it the pirates

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  who caused this? I vote ABC. It's just terrible. I'm mostly mad at Google for enforcing for,  well, for not writing a better bot, but also for not pushing back on these people and saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you know, well, they've got to do a whitelist. They've got a whitelist. They do. To say that  we understand that you know what you're doing. And if you don't, if you mess it up,  you're going to go into the, you know, in the shade woodshed here. But for God's sakes,  Twitter is a professional organization. It's not in your interest to get sued. It's not your  interest to get in trouble with Google. They should have a whitelist for you and the Democratic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  National Committee. Look at this. The video is still blocked. The DNC has made the video private  because it's embarrassing. I'm just, that's just wrong. You know, what concerns me is Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  says that it's going to voluntarily push down websites page rank based on copyright claims.  What concerns me is we're going to have the same type of bogus claim, right? Except they're going  to affect website page rank and you're not even going to know about it. This is, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but it's one factor and any system gets, any system can indeed get scammed, can get gamed.  And so yeah, it will get game. So right, Matthew, you will. But then I think people will suffer

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  from that and then they'll fix it. But here we see the message, right? We're outraged because we see  a message saying it's been blocked. We're never going to know whether a site should be higher in  page rank or should be lower. It's just going to happen. But the sites that are involved,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the sites that are affected by it will know and they'll, like if it happens to Twit, Twit's going  to put up a fit properly. So, and we, the Twit army will come in their defense and storm Mountain

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  View with pitchforks and overges. Yes. It just, clearly it's an, I mean, look at the list of  people who are complaining about it. It's, I don't even, the Associated Press, the New York Times,  this, they don't, surely the New York Times didn't, isn't asserting that they have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  copyright on Michelle Obama's speech. No, wasn't there some, well, there wasn't at the video,  wasn't it the video that was blocked? It was the video. Yeah. And so there's some automated  thing that says there's an, I presume this is what happened. There's an ID for the AP or the New York  Times and something, and it just, and they have their own bots. And so it's, it's a complaint bot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  meets the copyright bot and I don't think, I think this is even worse. I think this is something that  we've seen frequently where it's reversed. So the New York Times or Fox or Harry Fox agency  or somebody was playing the speech and they asserted a copyright on their news story with  the speech in. We've seen this happen many times where local news does a takedown. This  happened to the NASA Curiosity landing, which is NASA uncopyrighted material that every local news  station ran. And then the bots said, oh, it was on the local news. So actually the local news owned  the NASA footage. So they killed the NASA video. I wonder if this is that. Yeah, no, but you're right  then. Okay. How about they're right. Cause I watched that video. That's not Hugo. Hugo was  clips from Hugo was clips. Right. It's just a mess. And, and, and, and it's embarrassing to YouTube  because YouTube is the official streaming partner of both the Republican and Democratic conventions.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Unbelievable. It's pretty dumb. This is where the white, somebody's got to build a white list  functionality to say our friends don't get screwed. And it's our friends are innocent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they can't, I think they can't. Why not? Why? I think they're worried about losing their  safe harbor. So they bend over backwards. Cause the worst thing that could happen to YouTube is  to be seen as a publisher, not as a safe harbor protected. So, so if, so if they start favoring  certain people, they're not as they're not an yes, then they're not, then they're partisan.  I think they're making an active choice. I think their lawyers are saying, no dudes, don't do that.  The worst, cause it would put it put YouTube out of business if it were, this is just collateral  damage. It's collateral damage to the DMCA. Well, it's dumb.  It's dumb. This story from wired.com says it was Michelle Obama's speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not that. YouTube says it just briefly showed an incorrect error message,  but the reality is the video was blocked for hours. Yeah. YouTube got it all wrong. Cause

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouTube statement was, after tonight's live stream ended, YouTube briefly showed an incorrect error  message. Neither the live stream nor any of the channels videos were affected. But according to  wired.com, it's not clear what he meant by none of the channels videos were affected as the video  was unplayable. That's pretty affected. What's funny is that the, when, when contacted by wired  for comment late Tuesday, an Obama campaign staffer who works on digital outreach had no  knowledge of the outage, asked the reporter for the URL. And then upon seeing the takedown said,  I'll have to call you back. That's, that's straight out of an Aaron Sorkin script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To be fair, they were kind of busy yesterday. Yeah. You see two things happening here at,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  at cross purposes. Cause you see these, these absurd extensions of copyright. We haven't even  gotten to my friends in Germany and France yet. On the other hand, you have Canada, since we have  Matthew here, let's honor Canada. Canada has a new copyright law that, that extends fair use or  what is it fair case summer or something. What are you calling it here? Fair dealing. Yeah.  And to Matthew, do you know what the law can you, can you describe some of the new features?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't go into it in any detail. I haven't looked to get Michael Geist to explain it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's interesting because there's what the economist wrote about this, that there's a  whole bunch of new efforts to, to soften or make, make more sense out of copyright.  And a few countries yet at the same time, of course we have insanity going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we keep saying it's the pendulum, right? Swinging, except the pendulum seems to really  be stuck. I think it hit really hard on one side and it got stuck because it hasn't swung in any  appreciable way in the last, as long as I've been around. How long is, how long is copyright now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Forever. Oh. All right. Here it is. Canada passed a law in June that sets a new standard of  permissiveness. It caps statutory damages if copyright is breached for non-commercial purposes.  That's a big F. It expands definition of fair dealing, fair use in America, fair dinkum,  as I'm sure what to be calling it in Australia, and creates exemptions for educational purposes  and for parody. Good.  Firm has passed claims about infringement to the person who posted the material rather than  immediately take the content down themselves. This contrasts with the practice in America and  Europe where a web company alerted to infringing material must remove it. This encourages knee  jerk responses to complaints. Here I'm quoting from the economist folks. Britain too plans to  introduce internet friendly legislation this autumn, after a review by Ian Hargreaves. It'll  also recommend exemptions for non-commercial use, user generated content, and so on. Another  innovation is an exemption for copies engaged in text and data mining, known as big data.  So the idea that if you copied something only to analyze it, you were creating a copyright  violation is absurd. You are now allowed under this notion here, not spread widely, but I think in  Ireland and Australia, that you can analyze the data, which advances knowledge and science and  such and so forth. But as the economy says, the tide is not all one way. EU officials want to  maintain rules whereby computer users pay a small tithe on digital products to collection societies.  These fees are meant to go to content creators. Meanwhile, my friends, the Germans,  I've just met with one today, who have their  we talked about this show before, the effort to extend copyright to make Google pay for snippets.  Now France, of course, is proposing the same thing through magazine publishers there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That pendulum ain't coming back. So I just went to the Barack Obama site and the day two is now up,  so YouTube has either unblocked it or something. But it's looked like it was blocked for quite  some time. So that is that the live stream or is that this is oh, maybe that's oh, you're right.  This is now. Yeah, that's the live stream. Oh, nevermind. Date. This is day. All right.  Well, you should just watch it on TV anyway. That YouTube stupid. Okay.  Okay. Who watches TV on YouTube anyway? Silly video on the web. It's for crotch shots. Come on,  let's get it right. And Lady Gaga videos. That's what YouTube's for. Not politics.  Actually, it really is a problem if they want to make YouTube, you know, credible and reliable  for news. They got to solve that. Yep. What happens? NPR asks, when a Kickstarter campaign  fails, does anyone get their money back? No. The answer maybe maybe really? Well, if this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  not funded, you get your money back. You never get you never paid money. But but I have to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking at all the stuff I spent money on on Kickstarter. And the only thing I ever got was a  bra. So was it a was it a man's ear? Well, no, it's called the Joey bra. And the idea was it was  like a kangaroo is a baby kangaroos called a Joey. It was a bra with a pouch for your iPhone.  Did you try it? It was too small. So I didn't. So I got something but it was but it was too small.  So I've backed eight projects. All of these I've paid for, except for one, the space folk  album the folk album on on the moon did not get funded. But everything else here got funded,  including diaspora, the pebble watch, the cone coffee filter. I just got the email telling me  to put the address in for the watch. I've gotten all that crap too. I've never none of this have

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I received. I've got a different problem. I've gotten everything. But I have real buyer's remorse.  Me too. I got a little thing that's revolutionizes video on the iPhone. And it's this little plastic  thing that fits over the camera so that you can just put it down and we'll take a picture with  that with that. And I thought, why did I buy that? Now, how much was that? Oh, I think it was like,  you know, six bucks. But it was why did it the worst one was, and you may find me for this  already, but it was it's an iPhone case that magically copies basically all my credit cards  and frequent shopper cards in the case. That's a good idea. One card. So I can use that card.  Yeah. But it's a case. I don't want another case for my iPhone. I now have this thing. I should  sell it on eBay and be I can imagine going in the store and say, No, really, that's an American  Express card. So right. Yeah, that's my problem is I buy stupid stuff. Well, I don't know if this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  stupid or not, but I haven't gotten it. Go ahead, Matthew. Sorry. So Kickstarter is the new home

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  shopping network. Yeah. Look what I bought. Yeah, there you go. That's it. Look at the crap I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  purchased. It's it's digital Capitamonte. And by the way, diaspora did did do something. I mean,  I gave him like, 100 bucks. That was the first my first experience on Kickstarter. But now they've  decided to move on. So I think that one's well, they've they've thrown it open. It's open source.  Yeah. Yeah. That means it will die. It's nothing. Some of this is cool stuff. I hope I get it.  I did get the Joey brah exactly as promised. Did you fund the Tesla Museum? No, you know what,  I'm a bad man. I think I did. I meant to. Oh, they made the money. They got the money. Sorry.  And the problem with the Tesla Museum was that was just enough money to buy this,  the land. Right. Now they need a lot more to build it.  That seems to me like yet another way to throw money away. I don't know. So what is now is there  going to be a backlash at some point on Kickstarter? I mean, 1.2 million dollars. So they got 400,000  extra layer and 350 extra. Good. They could put up a little shack. Yeah, it reminds me of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the early days of even eBay or Craigslist or you go to buy something, you get ripped off. I mean,  all of those entities have had to institute something, some kind of protection, even Airbnb  to some extent. I think it's going to happen with Kickstarter. Someone's going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But how, but Matthew, I get. Yeah. But how can they really? Right. This is it's not an investment,  but it's an investment. Let the buyer beware. Yeah, it really is. I think that you've got to  some of these ideas won't work or there'll be problems with them. Or yes, there'll be some  people who run off to Brazil, but I don't know what Kickstarter can really do. I think there'll be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  big celebrated one. I mean, there've been a number of million dollar plus Kickstarters. All it takes  is one of those for its recipients to go to Brazil. And then we're going to see a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kickstarter collapse. Yeah. I've had a really good experience on Kickstarter. I've backed 16  projects. They have a new profile page. If you go to Kickstarter.com slash profile slash  do you need your penny? And I think I had a bad experience with one. I mean, one that didn't,  that didn't happen. And the, and the person emailed and said, this didn't happen. It took  a lot longer than I thought it would. I got caught up with other things. I can, what do you want me  to do? Do you want me to donate your money to charity? Do you want me to refund your money?  And this was just a guy who was just a good guy. And I thought that, I mean, not everyone's going  to go through all that trouble, but I don't know. I think, I think part of it is I think there's an  art to like picking projects that are going to do well. I mean, I tend to, I tend to choose projects  that are pretty popular already. I'm pretty conservative, I guess. Have you received all of  these things? Yeah. I mean, my, the first one that I backed was my cousin. My little cousin did a,  did a home EP by Jenny Oh, Jenny. Yeah, that's cute. The album is great. It's out. It's in iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That makes a lot of sense to me. And those are, that's not a huge, those aren't million dollar

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  projects. Right. A friend of mine wrote a book, the Mindfire book, Scott Birkin, who's great. And  actually you should have on triangulation someday. Oh, I like Scott Birkin. I would love to get him  on. Yeah. Yeah. Another one's an iPhone app for my friend does a, does a, does a website for, for  Louisville text adventures. Ze Frank's the show I backed, which is great. I mean, I just, there are  a lot of really good products. There's a new public market here in San Diego that got funded  on Kickstarter. I'm really excited about they raised like $90,000, I don't know, $146,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I don't know this smart thing. I'm not getting anything that's just died on me. I've got some,  I haven't gotten yet, but, but they're still, that's okay. The timing is, is within their window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think about it more as creative charity than anything. Yeah. Yeah. Well, if you look at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that way, then there's no loss. The NPR example, the NPR example is a, is a open source, you know,  game box, I guess. Oh yeah. They've raised eight and a half million dollars. That's the one. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the one that if they don't do it or they took off. Yeah. Yeah. People are very excited about the,  oh yeah. That's the most successful Kickstarter project of all time. I did not actually donate

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to that. I don't know why not. I am such a, I mean, I think that's, I think the things that  Gina's talking about, or some of them, you know, you look at what Amanda Palmer did with her album  and tour, that's a direct connection with a specific individual, an author, a musician,  an artist, someone who's doing something that you want to support. Then there's a whole other  category that's, you know, basically companies making products. And I think in that case,  if they just take the money and do something else, or then I think you have a right to complain. But  I guess Kickstarter is saying, don't look for any help from us. Yeah. I think a lot of these cases,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  these are not individuals exactly as you say, these are companies that are already kind of in

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the business of kind of, you know, it just feels a little. Well, we're really going to get down to  it is the jobs act. When they figure out exactly how to enforce it come January, when we can invest  in companies, it is an investment and it is equity. But you know, this is a hard business  investing and people will make mistakes. I listened to a wonderful BBC, Peter Day is just a great guy  on the BBC with a business show and a wonderful podcast. I listen to all the time and he did the  British version, which has been out for a year now with with tax benefits, by the way, to the  investors. And what one of the services there proposes that you should do is make a bunch of  small investments across a diversified portfolio of startups, just like a VC would on the hopes  that you hit okay on a couple of them, knowing you're going to lose on most of them. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But most people will never do that. No. And you still do better if you just bought index funds,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  no load index funds. But all right. What I'm struggling with is right now I have one of my  students has a great business, I believe, I live a lot of my students businesses, but there's one I  was talking to today, I mean, who has been doing fundraising. She's got a great proposal. She's got  a great business, I think called parcel par c l d.com. You can't find much about it there yet,  but it's going to change the relationship of brands to customers. Let's put it that way. Right. So  she's got all kinds. She's been out there doing great presentations. She's been talking to the  rich people. She's been it's trying to get that first domino to fall. Right. I've got another guy  who's doing a really exciting business thing here in New York. Same thing. Talk to him today. He's  got a great thing. He's been out there dealing people and it's waiting for that. Well, if you  find somebody to lead here, I'll come along there. It's an incredibly frustrating system for people.  And it's, you know, we gotcha. And so and, you know, we can have this discussion about VCs and  angel, but a lot of them can be really jerks. Don't we know? Yeah. And that's what's holding up  innovation. Now, of course, there's also a lot of really bad company ideas that don't deserve to be  funded. But I think this is an area that is ripe for disruption. Is the jobs act the right way? No,  it's not going to do everything. But I think that it brings in at least one more competitor to say,  okay, the heck with you. I'm going to get funded my way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. I just, yeah, I agree. And there's lots of neat Kickstarter stories.  You know, Kickstarter responds to the NPR thing saying, since Kickstarters launched in 2009,  30,000 projects have been successfully funded. That merely means they got money, by the way,  successfully. By more than 2 million people. These projects include documentaries, albums,  our program, the number of creative projects that have been funded and produced on Kickstarter  in the past three years is enormous. Many could but they never say how many delivered.  Do they even know? I don't even know if they know. No, they probably don't want to know.  Right. That's a number they probably would not like to report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But there have been other efforts that do really good analysis of the data that is available. But  no one's done that follow-up study, which an academic really should do as to what products  actually got out. And then, you know, the next thing that's odd to me is, all right, so fine,  there's products that I've seen on Kickstarter. I missed the time period. They're already funded.  I think, oh, I'd like that. There's no place to go buy it. Once the first tranche is delivered  to the Kickstarter backers, is there an ongoing product there or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kickstarter's terms of use require creators to fulfill all rewards of their project  or refund any backer whose reward they do not or cannot fulfill. We do hope that backers will  consider using this provision only in cases where they feel that a creator has not made a good faith  effort to complete the project and fulfill. Kickstarter cannot refund the money because  we never had it. Money is transferred directly from your credit card to the project creator's  Amazon payments account. But I got to point out Kickstarter takes a skim on everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, this is not a nonprofit. You know, when I back a Kickstarter project,  though, like I feel like what I'm buying is being a part of something early on, like more than the  product itself, like the TikTok, which was the iPod or the mini iPod mini watch band, you know,  like I just saw that in the Apple Store last week. Right. I bought that on Kickstarter. I was one of  the first ones to have one of those. Yeah. It's in the Apple Store now. It's pretty amazing. That  was a really one of the really big projects. And I felt like, oh, hey, like, you know, I was a part  of this or, you know, with the book or the albums, like I got a little thank you, you know, from the  author or the creator. Like, it feels more like just kind of being a part. I know I sound like a  hippie right now. I'm not an investor. But I feel part of a creative movement and part of a community  of people who saw something interesting before anybody else saw that it was interesting. I can't  wait to go to this new market in San Diego and be like, hey, you know, I helped make this happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you're the right person to be investing in Kickstarter because you have the right attitude  towards it. I just fear that there's a lot of people who think they're in a marketplace of  that they're buying stuff. Like I think there's a lot of people who think they bought a Pebble  watch that is going to be useful and wonderful. And A, there may never be a Pebble watch or B,  there may be one and it's crap. Right. And people, you have the right attitude, but I think,  I don't know, maybe I'm wrong with a lot of people who use Kickstarter,  I really think they're buying something. I think that's the, you know, that's the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the difference between the, the Kickstarters that are individually driven and the Kickstarters that  appear to be companies. You know, if it's an individual and you're backing their dream and you,  you know, you know, you buy into it, then you're willing to accept a little bit more risk, I think.  Maybe you just, you're okay with feeling a part of it. If it's a company building a thing and they  say they're going to build a bunch of them, then you want your thing. Right. But I think that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  mistake to go to Kickstarter and see a thing, but I think that's what most people do. They say,  oh, the Ouya is going to be great. I want to get in on the ground floor. Instead of Gina's point of  view, which is those people have a great idea. I want to support them in their attempt to create  this wonderful thing, whether they succeed or not, because that's really what you're doing.  Mm-hmm. Right. But most, I think most people, certainly I noticed this in myself,  I really want that coffee filter and those gaming dice and the headset that makes the world 3D.  I really want that thing. Big mistake. I thought that's what I was doing, but I'm not.  Right. You're pre-purchasing. I'm pre-purchasing. Yes. It's not that. And  does, so does Kickstarter have an obligation to make that clearer or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hmm. I don't know if they have an obligation. Well, that again goes to research. What do people  think? I mean, if I were an academic, and I'm not, doing a study, I think it would be a great  study of funding. As you go to the Jobs Act, I would look at microloans and loan platforms  that exist. I would look at Kickstarter and Indiegogo, and I would look at the jobs platforms  that exist here in the UK, Jobs Act, I mean, and see what the delivery is and what the expectations  are. What's the demand side say about it? It's a great area for study, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think in Kickstarter, it's in Kickstarter's interest or Indiegogo or whoever to just be as  clear and repetitive as possible, just to keep saying this is between you and the person or  thing you're funding. We're just connecting you to like Craigslist or Airbnb or whatever. You guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  have to work it out. I think you're right, Matthew. And I think that if there are those  big bad cases that come out, there'll be regulation that comes. There'll be Chuck Schumer,  my Senator in New York, who loves the Saturday press conference, will call one on Saturday  saying, I'm going to protect people by proposing a new law against these Kickstarter things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that'll be a disaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. So it's in their interest to be as open as they can be. So maybe it is in their interest  to know those numbers and to face them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And maybe I'll get my dice someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I'm going to get my pebble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know we'll get a pebble, but I want to underscore that I've seen a dozen of these things  and they're horrible. They're unusable. And just be prepared. Just be prepared.  It's not, for instance, Kiva has gotten a lot of criticism. I think you understand what you're  doing with Kiva, right? It's very clear that these are micro lending and you're probably not going  to get, you probably get your money back, but you might not. And if you do, you're not supposed to  really take it out anyway. You're supposed to pay it forward and all that stuff. And I think you  understand what you're doing. Kiva is clearly humanitarian altruistic Kickstarter feeling.  It feels like a marketplace, which is probably not what it should be.  Build that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The ones that I find fascinating are the ones like, I can't remember if this was a Kickstarter or  not, but the bus monitor lady, you know, who got-  That's a great project.  Yes. Who got belittled by the kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. The Redditors raised, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  600,000. I mean, I'm sure I wasn't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was Indiegogo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was Indiegogo. Yeah. Because Kickstarter wouldn't, it doesn't comply with their guidelines.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I mean, you know, 600 grand.  Isn't that great?  I can't be the only person who thought, I'll just film myself being humiliated in some way.  I'll get a half a million dollars. I mean, she gets to do whatever she wants with that money.  Yeah.  I guess. Just find that fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody's mad at me in the chat room because I'm bashing Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a Kickstarter funding platform. It means investor, not consumer buys, well, you know,  get over it. Plus somebody said to the dice look like two prostate glands anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not deliberately, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel that part of my job is to be a consumer watchdog. Now,  the problem is that I talk to a variety of different levels. Anybody who watches this show  is certainly more than aware of what they're getting involved with with Kickstarter. But I  also think about all the people who listen to the radio show who think that the internet is free  via a thing called Linksys. And it's for those people I fear.  And Kickstarter rejected us because we wanted to do a Kickstarter project for the studio and they

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  said no. Why? I don't know. Because it was part of an ongoing business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah. They have these specific guidelines. Like their goal is for people to fund creative  projects where there's something tangible that happens in the end, like an album or a documentary  or a watch band or whatever. Yeah. We probably should have gone to Indiegogo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I thought it was interesting. I'm trying to remember the comic site. I can't  remember the name of it now, but they did it. Sorry? Oatmeal? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  KXKCD? I know. I'm just throwing it. I shouldn't. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, another one. They did a campaign and they were going to remove all the advertising from the site  if they were fully funded. Oh. Did they do that on Kickstarter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Penny Arcade? Penny Arcade, yes. Penny Arcade. Awesome. And did they raise the money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was a lot of debate about whether they should be allowed to do that or not because  it's part of an ongoing business. But their argument was, well, it's basically you're just  buying a sort of ad-free version. So it's a specific thing. But I thought it was in a real

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  gray area there. And what was the final decision? Were they allowed to or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they were. They said they'd talked to Kickstarter about it and Kickstarter said it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was fine. It's called, it was the project was called Penny Arcade sells out. They raised half  a million dollars on August 15th. And it was just basically to support. See, I don't see how that's  any different from asking people to help us build a studio, but I can see why there was debate. But  I know who cares. I don't care. We did it ourselves. Because the chat room. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  now we know why you don't like Kickstarter. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I actually got interested in the idea of using Kickstarter or something like it  to crowd fund journalism. Could you, and I know there are a couple of journalism projects. There's  a magazine that Bobby Johnson's involved in. There's a couple of other sort of one-off research  projects, but could you use that model to fund, like Dave Cohen tried to do with Spot.us. Is that  a way that you could get your readers to support journalism?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like that idea. Yeah. One of my students, if you look up narratively.  Yeah, they're on my list of things. They're getting close. They're 41,000 with 50,000 gold,  four days to go folks. Look at great people. A lot of people who write for the New York Times,  New York magazine, others really want to rethink how to do journalism in New York. I think their  price is a little high and they got to shove it in, but they could make it, man. They could make it  if you'll help them. Where is it? They need nine grand. Narratively. Yeah, four days to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're close. Click it. They're close. What do I get? Do I get a t-shirt? No, I don't think so.  I get to feel good. See that one, they're not promising me any physical good. I can't complain.  How can I complain? I just feel good because I gave.  Do I get a subscription? Oh yes, I'll be a premium member.  You can become a member of the Inner Circle. Hey, I gave a hundred bucks to app.net. I'm an idiot.  I certainly don't use me as a, in any way. Yeah, a bra that doesn't fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other thing I gave to an Indiegogo was Alexis Ohanian's internet promoting bus tour,  which I think is a great thing. Another good one. Yeah. I know there's good stuff. At least

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't buy Facebook stock. That's up today. Is it up? Today. Oh yeah. Because Mark Zuckerberg,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and they canceled their second. They basically did a buyback. A million shares are going to  use to pay the taxes, which basically reduces the pool. So it's basically like a buyback.  So it's up 4.8% today to 1858. I think yesterday it was down to 1708 or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think you can get mad at Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg wrote a letter saying, hey,  don't buy this stock. They effectively warned people that, hey, it's going to be a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  before we make any money. Andrew Ross Sorkin wrote a really tough column in the New York Times.  Really tough taking the CFO on and saying it was all his fault. And I think that Matthew disagreed,  but I think that it was not off the mark in the sense of saying that it's about the price that  was set. They saw other companies like LinkedIn found the value went way up right after. So that  meant that the company lost that money to speculators. So they wanted to price this to  get as much revenue to the company as possible. The thing that nobody talks about here that I think  really caused a lot of the problems for Facebook is that there was an artificial scarcity of the  stock in a marketplace beforehand. The fact that you can trade insider shares now and there's a  huge scarcity, nobody can get them. That drives the prices way up and it changes everybody's view  of what the real value of the company is. And that's why we knew the valuation of Facebook was  absurd before, but that was the valuation in an open marketplace. Just a very scarce one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and Mark, there was a huge amount of hype. I mean, let's face it, everybody thought it was  going to be a hundred billion dollar stock. All the brokerage firms wanted it. All the banks wanted  it. VCs were desperate to get out at X price. I mean, none of that is David Ebersman's fault.  And if he accepts the advice of his underwriters about the listing price,  that is also not his fault. That's what they do. But ultimately, Matthew, the buck did stop with him.  But his duty was to raise as much money as possible for the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Mark Cuban's point. Mark Cuban said he did exactly what he was supposed to do. He got  10 billion bucks for Facebook. He says it was not Facebook CFO's job to protect investors or to  worry about shareholders' portfolio. If they were willing to pay that, they'd be foolish of him not

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to take it. But what's the impact now on it? The problem is there is clearly an impact now on the  company. You have people wanting Zuckerberg's head, which I think is way wrong. I sure wouldn't want  the stock without Zuckerberg there. That's a good point. You have this, it's the cootie-ization of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the company now. And Cuban's response to that, by the way, is that companies can reprice options.  So unhappy employees can be made whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you're right. I mean, Zuckerberg said, I am looking at this thing as a long-term.  He warned everybody.  So don't buy it if you want to flip it tomorrow. And so a bunch of people bought it so they could  flip tomorrow. So they got screwed. Yeah. Somebody wrote an article saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's obvious nobody read the prospectus or Mark Zuckerberg's letter. So it's not there.  It's like buying stuff on Kickstarter. It's not your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the RTFM tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. The RTFM tax. I like it. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Russian military.  I like this story. Has removed the Google layer from Android tablets because Google is spying

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  on us all. As opposed to the Russian military.  But that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. The Russian defense ministry announced a stripped down encrypted version of Android  is destined for government and military devices. They'll also sell it to the public  without Google's spyware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And nobody else is going to spy on you on that device. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want it. It's called the Russian mobile operating system, Romos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So wait, they're calling Google Maps spyware? Is that what's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah. Because Google gets information about where you're going. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because Google spies on you. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The first 10 inch tablets running Romos will be available later this year.  Shockproof, waterproof, $460. Assembled in Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like buying those old Soviet army hats and pins and things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got those when I was in St. Petersburg. They were cheap. I bought a bunch of those.  Yeah, they were all legitimate.  Oh, you think they're not real?  You mean somebody's like making those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because you can still get them today years after. The same supply is always there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It says the finished product will be mainly aimed at state officials and military personnel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I actually am surprised that other governments don't do that. First of all,  you can because Android is open source, so you can make your own version of it.  And why not? I think that's smart. I think our government should be doing that.  Didn't they make President Obama ditch his Blackberry and use some sort of crappy Windows  phone 6.5 device that had all this encryption hanging off of it? It's like this shoe box.  Didn't that happen in Iraq four years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think so. I misread the headline and I thought it was they ain't Google Maps  spyware. It's all over your house. The whole layer is gone.  They're using their own GPS alternatives called GLONASS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've had that for a while. In fact, my phone, the Samsung S3,  and a lot of other phones support both GPS and GLONASS. Oh yeah, because you can't sell it in  the Russian and other markets if you don't have GLONASS. And it's a second GPS system,  which is probably a good thing. So I want to talk about Twitter with you, Matthew.  We need to have a therapy session. Apparently you both love it and hate it.  I do. I am with you 100%. What do you hate about Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess I hate little things. I hate the fact that their apps aren't consistent, so I can do  some things on the iPhone app, but I can't do them on the iPad app, and I can't do them on the  website. Those things are all infuriating and I hate the fact that I'm addicted to it and I'm  just constantly on there and can't put it down. But I guess the bigger picture stuff is I'm  concerned about where the company is going and where the service is going. And so as someone who's  so attached to it, I'm concerned about where I'm being taken and whether I'm going to regret that  at some point. So it's the company you dislike. I guess it's some of their strategy. I just don't  know. It feels to me as though they just want to control so much of the content, none of which they  create, incidentally. But they want to control as much as possible of that in order to try and  monetize it. It was great when monetization wasn't a big deal. Then you just let content go wherever  and it doesn't matter and people can create their own apps and that's great. But now the pressure is  on. You've got to come up with... We talked about Facebook and its IPO. Twitter might have thought  it was going to go public at a huge valuation before. I don't know if they're still thinking  that now. But the pressure is on to generate cash that justifies the huge private market value  they have. And so they have to monetize it. So they're monetizing me and my attention and my  content. And so they're controlling it and that irritates me. I like this part that you said that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you hate that it's becoming more of a broadcast network than someplace where you actually talk  to people. And I think that that's true. After we talked about it a couple of shows ago, I actually  did get verified by Twitter, which is wonderful. Thank you, Twitter. But when you get verified,  it's interesting. By default, if you go to my profile, you don't see any of my replies to other  people. You only see tweets which are not replies, which I think says a lot of exactly what you're  saying. That Twitter wants us to be a place, a broadcast medium. This is the thing that I  don't like about Twitter. It feels like we're all just standing on the top of mountains,  shouting out into the void about ourselves. It also just feels like this ego machine.  It's really difficult to have good conversations. My friends reply to one another a lot, but it's so  difficult even with the client tools to just follow threads of conversations. That's why  Storify is great. But you need to have somebody who cares enough about the conversation to actually  compile the Storify. It would not be hard. It's a computer. It could figure that out.  Yeah, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Matthew, haven't you talked about how what you think said with Twitter and other posts you've  written is that it becomes a promotional vehicle for TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I wrote one post about how two things that Twitter did in quick succession really summed up  for me, the contrast and the tension and the conflict between the two visions of what Twitter  should be for. One was shutting down Tumblr. You can't use our follower search tool anymore,  period. The same thing they did to Instagram. That's on the one side. The other side was  bragging about how well the Olympics went because it drove a lot of traffic to NBC's prime time.  Here's what we don't want. We don't want you, the user, to be able to do useful things with  another platform that involves Twitter, so stop doing that. On the other side, our friends  at NBC just love us because we're pushing eyeballs to prime time. Well, is that to me?  Do I want to just be a vehicle that pushes eyeballs to prime time? I don't know. I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter has become speaker's corner where a lot of crazy people get on boxes and shout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or it's become, let's go with metaphor here, it's become a street where barkers stand out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of their stores and scream at you. My big problem with Twitter now is related. Whenever I look at  the at replies, there's so much garbage. People use it to shout at me. That is also an interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  consequence of being verified. You get spammed way more, way more, instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you get a bunch more followers than you got verified to?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I'm wondering if the spam bots then, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, you actually get added to, or you get followed by Twitter verified, so I think that  they're looking at Twitter verified's follow list to see all the people who are verified. My followers  actually stayed about the same rate of growth. But yeah, you definitely get spammed a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It means that it's hard to have conversations because it's just, it's become a shouting match.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think that's, you know, to some extent that's a natural phenomenon given the size of  the network. I mean, when lots of us started, it was very small. And I think that's part of  what people get out of say Google Plus or app.net is that it's a small network and it's people  you know, or in some cases know. And so it just feels smaller. I think the challenge for Twitter  is they're getting big and that's great if you want to sell ads, but to some extent it's  degrading the user experience. And I don't think they're helping by threatening things like  Tumblr and Instagram and maybe even Flipboard. You know, I just don't think that's,  for me as a user, that's doesn't feel right. I agree. That was the really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  conversation that then proceeded after that and you got quoted in it. Mike McHugh warning  that he fears that if Twitter closes down too much too fast, it really loses what it is. And then  Fred Wilson came back and answering kind of you both saying that trying to answer the question  that you posed is can you be a business and be an open network? And he said he thinks that you can,  but the problem he argues for Twitter is that it started too open. Right, right. That it's easier  to start close. It's like the old argument about pay. It's easier to pay and then give it away free  then give it away free then pay. Same. And I don't know that I buy this, but the argument here is  that it's easier to be closed and then open up. But I don't know that you ever do witness Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I think he's right. I think Facebook, it was easier for Facebook to do something like  the open platform later after it had built this huge thing rather than start out wide open,  which is what Twitter did, and then try to close down because I would argue Matthew,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but Twitter would never be Twitter if it hadn't been open. Well, that was my argument too. I wrote

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a post today basically, you know, responding to Fred, looking at what he said. Twitter is trying  to wind back the clock to sort of rewrite history and say, well, now we'd like to be the thing that  we could have been if we weren't so open. But the reality is they never would have gotten to where  they are now if they weren't open. That was the whole, that was what built the network. I mean,  at replies and hashtags and retweets and everything that is unique about Twitter was created by users.  They didn't come up with all that stuff. Do you know what I mean? So now they're trying to  monetize that and control it. But the reality is it wouldn't have existed if they hadn't been open

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in the first place. And of course, the question Twitter is asking is, well, okay, fine. So let's  pull up the ladder. Can they continue to maintain value or increase value? I mean, there's nothing,  I understand that morally and ethically it feels bad to be open and then close.  But is it impractical? It's practical, isn't it? Aren't they going to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure, it's practical. But my, so the big question that I don't know the answer to is,  and I think we're finding out the answer is when you try to wind back that clock and you try to  close down or tighten down or however you want to describe it, shepherding the ecosystem, I think  Jack Dorsey calls it, when you do that, can you maintain that value that you built by being open?  Or does that, do you sort of kill the goose that laid the golden egg by trying to restrict it too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  much? Can we think of examples of open things that have closed and survived? Are there open  source projects that became closed source? That's tough to do. I guess not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's almost impossible, I think. It's almost impossible. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you'd have to go to every single contributor and have them agree to change the license of the code

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that they wrote. You could fork a non-open version. But what about, okay, here's an example then,  and I think I've used this before, CDDB, which was an open database that people contributed to of  music information, which basically sold and became a proprietary system. It survived. In fact,  it's probably very profitable right now. IMDB, same thing, right? It was originally created,  all the data was created by users. And then it basically went to a commercial operation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could kind of argue that Wikipedia is certainly still open, but it's way more difficult  today to make Wikipedia edit than it was five years ago, just because there's so many controls  and so many, the computer communities, so vigilant now. Delta F has sent me an article

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  from TechCrunch saying that Oracle is basically trying to take MySQL closed. Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I think they're going to have trouble doing that. I mean, Wikipedia, I used it as an example  in my Twitter post today. It's a little like Wikipedia, not just closing down or becoming  more restrictive, but doing that in order to appeal to large brands and sell ads. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that changes the whole nature of the experience. But they've, yes, and then that would be no longer  Wikipedia and it would absolutely damage them. But I don't think Twitter is in the same position  as Wikipedia. I don't know. I mean, it's clear that it's, you know, you got to dance with the  one you brung you. It's unethical. It stinks. But will users really rebel? I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, here's the thing. Let me try this example on you. Movable type.  They were open source. They were open and open source. It came six apart. And then to make it  into a business, which we understood, they had to create a licensing scheme. And you could do that  well or do that badly. And I think that they didn't do that as well as they could have.  And it had a permanent impact on the company and opened up the door for WordPress.  Which remains open. WordPress is ingenious to me because it, and I use this example all the time,  if you can maintain an open layer and become the first to build on top of that, you will always  benefit from it being open because others will contribute to it. And you, you know, you reduce  your costs and other things. And yes, you'll have competitors building, which is what six apart tried  to prevent. That's why its licensing was onerous because it tried to keep people from building  a competitor to six apart's own hosted platform. And I think WordPress learned from that and said,  no, no, okay, we'll create the open platform. We'll leave it open. And even when the VCs from  Polaris called me about this, I only echoed what the founders wanted, I'm sure, when I said, no,  leave it that way. That's genius. Build the for-profit on top of that. Be the first to know it.  So you separate the two. Whereas six apart ended up in channel conflict, in community conflict.  So people say, why am I going to contribute to this anymore? And you're restricting my license  horribly here. And I don't like this. At the same time, we knew it couldn't get you free forever.  So we agreed, I think as users, that they had to change the structure so that they could survive.  Because we wanted them to survive. Because we depended upon them because they were a platform.  But it's a very tricky shift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The two examples that I like to think of are Digg and MySpace. I mean, those were primarily  communities, content-related communities, but not platforms, not sort of technology, not software.  It was about the community. And Digg effectively ruined its community by trying to monetize in the  wrong ways, by trying to answer to their VCs or whatever caused the problem. And MySpace arguably  did the same thing, ruined the user experience in an attempt to try and monetize. I think those are  the risks for Twitter. I'm not saying it's going to happen. I'm just saying that's the risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Digg is the poster child, and MySpace, the poster child for what not to do.  The Democratic Party platform includes internet freedom and cybersecurity.  I know sometimes those might be at odds. I don't know. The Democratic platform calls for an internet  that is secure and reliable and is respectful of intellectual property. The free flow of information  and privacy. Basically, it's everything anybody would ever want. And then some.  Key provision in the Republican platform released last week was reducing regulations on broadband  providers. I'm not saying I have a dog in this hunt, but you know, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Moving on. I don't want to get too political here,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but I'd enjoy those speeches that you two blocked later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On the political end, the story there about why campaign reporters are behind the curve is very  long, but actually very good. I liked it a lot. Right. Arguing that reporters, and we know reporters  doing the horse race stuff. This is stupid and ridiculous and wasteful and brings nothing. And  I've complained about 15,000 correspondents at each convention reporting on absolutely nothing  because nothing happens. It's all scripted. It's all infomercial heavy on the commercial light on  the info. Having said all that, even with all that is criticism. This piece argued by Sasha Eisenberg,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right? Yeah. Sasha says that it's in fact, it's worse than that.  That the truth is we aren't even that good at covering the horse race.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, there's very sophisticated data going on to figure out that small portion of the population  that actually is movable. And that they're looking at the campaign within the campaign in entirely  different ways. And we're missing that story utterly. It's basically like gaming dig. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It turns out that the electoral college system is highly gameable. We know that because I live  in a state where it doesn't matter who I vote for. It's done. So I could just ignore the polls  because all of California's electoral votes will go to Obama no matter what I do. But there are a  few states where it really matters. Ohio, Florida. And so those states, a lot of data is gathered  about each individual in those states much more detailed than one might imagine. It's not merely  soccer moms or Latino voters. It's really deep. And they quote President Obama's chief pollster,  Joel Benenson, who says, think of it as a level five player in chess. The press is a level five  player in chess and a level eight player in chess. You have people covering campaigns who are at the  mercy of the grand masters of politics. The journalists just don't understand the big data  that's going on now in political campaigns. They miss the story completely. And I think calling

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  them level five is being complimentary. Yes, I agree. Breathless and often fact-free stories

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about data mining and micro-targeting soon became plentiful. But few journalists had access to any  of the campaigns' actual data or even much understanding of the statistical techniques they use.  It's a really good article. I tried to explain it on the radio show and did a miserable job.  But if you're worried about the targeting and the marketing and the tracking cookies  that you see day to day, hey, this stuff is being applied in political campaigns to great effect.  To great effect. And the campaigns are using it in, you know,  they're playing it like a grand master. It's very interesting. It is.  Sometimes, you know, I feel like these campaigns are moronic. And sometimes I feel like they're  very smart. And I think they're both simultaneously. Yeah. Well, they treat us like morons.  They certainly think we're moronic. But in the post-car… Well, you know, you're in Canada.  I don't know. What is the Canadian take on the US election, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I must admit I haven't been paying attention to it that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you're just like an American then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I haven't actually been… I've been following the convention chatter on  Twitter. That's mainly the way I've been consuming the political news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah. 140 characters. That'll give you all the depth and detail you really need.  Well, there's links in there too.  Oh yeah, there are links.  I just feel like the two-party system, the electoral college, it just makes it ripe for gaming.  And of course, all these computer tools, that's what they're really good at. And you've got a  whole generation of younger people, Gina's age now, in there who know how to pull all the levers.  And they are doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So much of it seems like theater to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's absolutely theater. And some of the actors are pretty bad.  All right, we're going to take a break. Come back with your tips, your tools, your picks of the week.  And Matthew Ingram, if you want to pick something or talk about something you like, you can do that  too. But first, a word from our friends at Two Cows, the same folks who bring you Hover.com,  which is that great domain name system. Actually, I think Two Cows, and I talked to  Elliot Noss, the CEO there, and I think what they've decided is we're going to look for  industries that are ripe for reinvention. Industries that are just run poorly that  somebody who's smart and uses technology properly can transform. They started that with domain name  registration at Hover.com. And now they're doing it somewhere we really need it in the cell phone  industry, the mobile phone industry with Ting.com. When he showed me Ting the first time, I was,  I just was so impressed. I thought this is exactly what it should be. Big savings,  no long-term contracts, billing clarity so you know what you're paying for and you get exactly  what you're paying for without the penalties, and just complete usability. Ting.com. It's  built on the Sprint Network. So if you have good Sprint coverage where you are, this is a very good  choice. And just go to Ting.com and look at the plans and you'll see how it works. At first,  you might say, oh, this is like any cell phone carrier. You pick how many minutes and messages  and data you want, and then how many phones you want. And this is kind of nice. You pay six bucks  per phone per month. So as many phones as you want, great for families or small businesses.  So let's say we're going to have four phones, and I'm going to say, well, the four of us will  share, these are all shared, 2,000 minutes, say 1,000 text messages and three gigs of data.  And that will cost for all four of us, 124 bucks a month. But here's the beauty part. If you don't  use three gigs of data, let's say you use two, they'll rebate you the $18 difference. Let's  say instead of 1,000 text messages, you do 6,000. There's no penalty. They just charge you the  difference. So you're paying for exactly what you get without penalties. You are credited or  to charge the difference based on actual usage. That's what you get billed. You always get for  free voicemail, picture and video messaging, three-way calling, caller ID, tethering,  and hotspotting. So this is, that's all built in. They are not blocking you. Now they've got a broad  variety of devices. They even have ways you can bring your own devices. It's a little more  complicated. So you got to, cause it's a sprint network. They do have the galaxy S3, which is  very nice. The photon Q and even feature phones. So, you know, you can save. They also have,  and this is really good, dated devices. So you can use their 3G and 4G networks at the same  affordable, straightforward pricing. I am really a fan. If you go to ting.com slash twig,  play with the online savings calculator, you'll save $50 on your phone, 50 bucks right off the top.  People, I want you to discover this because this really is, you know, this is the beginning of  how I think using technology appropriately, modern billing systems and so forth can really  change the cell phone industry. Folks at 2cows are doing it. Ting, another nice Canadian company.  It's funny, they don't offer this in Canada yet. I think the system in Canada doesn't, you know,  it doesn't work that way. But Sprint, it's interesting. They're working with Sprint as  an MVNO and Sprint is very interested and very supportive of what they're doing.  No contracts, ting.com slash twig. I like this. Mom's ride free. If she uses her phone once a month,  like my mom at the airport, you just get her a phone, like six bucks for the phone and her  minutes and stuff, you know, are pooled in with yours. So she uses it once a month,  it's six bucks a month. Bada bing bada boom. I actually got to do that for my mom. I've been  reading this for months and I didn't even think of that. I love it. No overage penalties. You can  use as much data as you want, by the way. And it's consistently linear billing. You get credits on  light months. Multiple devices on one plan. Great for families and small businesses. No fees or  limits on usage. It's just exactly what you see is what you get. Whizzy wig cell phone service.  It's a revolution. Ting.com slash twig. Save 50 bucks on your phone. And thank you, Elliot Noss,  and two cows for trying to make sense out of this crazy business. Gina Tripani, your tool,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry, tip of the week. Tip of the week. Google spreadsheets added inline discussions per  cell. So you can, you can click, right, a click on a cell. I don't know about you. I use the  spreadsheets all the time. My co-founder and I are always making spreadsheets for our business.  And now you can, you could leave comments on a sheet before, but now on a particular cell,  you can, if you right click on it and choose insert comment, you can add comments, you can reply to  comments and you can even like at mention or not at plus mention someone, I should say,  if you do plus their email address to give them. Oh, that's sweet. Yeah. So it's just,  does that share the spreadsheet with them? I think it's for people who the spreadsheet  is already shared with. Okay. So you can, so they get a notification that they have a, they have a  comment. Right. So yeah, just, just a little kind of upgrade, but I was excited about it because  it's nice that you can kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  she got disconnected right at the very last word of her tip. And now we'll get her back. Your number  of the week, Jeff Jarvis, it always happens that way. Right. So I, you know, whenever that happens,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's Mike. I assume my connection's right now. No, you're still alive. Sorry. No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's all right. Skype crashed. Skype crash. I couldn't handle the Google spreadsheet. It was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  too good of a tip for Skype. Sorry about that. So, so Royal Kingdom, the, the, I don't know how big

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  this survey is, but they looked at demographics of various social networks. Unfortunately,  Google plus is not included. And, and, and some of it, you know, obviously we're going to know  in terms of ages, 55% of Twitter users are 35 or older. 79% of LinkedIn users are 35 or  older. Turning it around 58% of Reddit users are 35 or under. Yeah. And so on, right. Orchid,  85, 83% are under 35. Okay. So that's, that's fine. So what fascinated me was the gender  distribution. We, I think we still assume that the net and the geeks here on are male, but in  the services they looked at, most of them are majority female, Pinterest, Goodreads, blogger,  tag, Tumblr, MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, WordPress.com, Yelp, Flickr, StumbleUpon, LinkedIn,  even live journal are all majority female, majority male Quora, Reddit, Orchid, GitHub,  Stack Overflow, Hacker News and Slashdot. None of those a surprise. Yeah. So it, it, it,  this is not the domain of testosterone anymore. Interesting. Or should I say Pinteresting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pinteresting. Buzzfeed just did that piece about app.net and medium and subtle being mostly white  male. Yeah. I don't know. So I guess that those are kind of new, newer apps. They're developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's developers. Yeah. Yeah. Just like Stack Overflow, Hacker News and Slashdot, GitHub, Orchid,  Orchid, Reddit. Yeah. DeviantArt is more female than males. That surprises me a little bit.  Yeah. Yeah. But not much. The biggest one is Pinterest. That doesn't surprise me.  No. Blogger is big female. Tumblr, big female. MySpace. I like this. It's interesting.  And it makes sense. That's a ping, ping, royal.pingdom.com. P-I-N-G-D-O-M.  I hesitate to do this as my tool of the week, but I'm going to anyway, just to make people angry.  Leo's trolling. I'm trolling. Have you ever used Bing on your Android phone?  So it's funny because, and actually this kind of bugs me when Google does it too, you know,  the Bing widget looks just like the Google widget as if you could type something in this field,  right? So it's got Bing and then it's got a field and then a microphone. You can't? No,  you can't with Google either. You tap it and it just opens up the thing.  So you could make the widget a lot smaller, gang. That's a lot of wasted white space up there, but  it does have the voice thing. Gina Trapani. And it does a pretty good job. And I have to say,  it is a very, very easy, nice interface. The official website, Wikipedia, Google Plus,  SmarterWear, Twitter. I mean, it does everything you'd expect it to do. It's got the pretty Bing  pictures, images, videos, maps. Look, this is a, you know what? If you want Windows phone on your  Android phone, just put this on here and you get all the benefits of Windows phone, including Bing  searches, big image search and all of that stuff. You know, that widget thing, that's an Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  widget design thing. Like when I was building a widget, it's so funny. There are all these  things over in forums, like filled with questions, like how do I put a text input field in my Android  widget? And the answer is you cannot. You cannot put text input fields in your Android widget. The

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ones that have them are just a launcher. It's a lie. But the thing is this could be a lot smaller  because I don't, it just, actually I have a resize thing. I wonder, let me see if this will,  maybe I could just do it, unofficially resize it, make it, oh yeah, I could. There you go.  That's what it should look like. Yeah. That's what it reminds me of. It reminds me of those early

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  web banner ads where it looked like there was something you could type into a field. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All they wanted you to do was click. Yeah. Click. So, but you know, Bing is free. You know,  it's just one more thing you can do whatever they want. They can do whatever they want. I just think,  I think it's kind of, I kind of like it. I put it, I just thought I'm going to be really, you know,  counter, instead of having the Google thing at the top of my, my Android phone, I have a Bing,  just why not give Microsoft some love, you know, they've been feeling lonely lately  out there in space. Bing. Bing. That's very contrarian of me. I love that. But it's good.  You know, it's a good, it's actually a very good search. It's got some nice features to it.  I use DuckDuckGo. So yeah, they don't have a widget. Let's give DuckDuckGo some love.  Matthew, do you have anything, a pick a tip, a number, anything you'd like to share with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just one thing on what Gina mentioned about Google spreadsheets. I saw that if you use,  if this, then that you've heard of that. Love, I F T or whatever it is. Yeah. So you can actually  program things to insert stuff into a spreadsheet in Google Drive automatically. Oh, yeah. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Riley wrote something about it today. Oh, wow. That was really interesting. That might be the  most exciting thing that's happened to me all day. You can use that because you know why,  you know why Chad's so excited about that? Pinboard works in with, with if this and that,  right? You share your links and then you could populate the spreadsheet automatically.  Oh, literally this has made my day. You just gave Chad eight hours more a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to be able to send you links throughout the week, Chad, that end up on the, on the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That'd be great. Yeah, we can do that. All right. Let's all coordinate. Okay. There'll be an email  coming out. Maybe I'll make a gul'dak about it and then we can share some links to it. And then

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you could, you know, you could, for instance, monitor Jeff's Twitter feed and if he put hashtag  twig, then you would take that and put it into the spreadsheet. Right. Yeah. Yeah.  As Matthew Ingram says of Giga Ohm, senior writer at Giga Ohm. Great to have you, Matthew.  Thanks for having me. Really love having you on the show. Are those boxing gloves on the door

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  behind you? They sure are. Just in case things get, you know, a little heated in here. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those are for the editorial meeting. I'm impressed. Nice to have you. Jeff Jarvis,  City University of New York, buzz machine.com. Great to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's so quiet. I was looking up. I just wanted to note here another, another number that the  Glee premieres on September 13th. With special guest star. Oh, I didn't hear about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't remember, but it was good. Who's on, who's on Glee? I saw the promo for it and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  can't remember who it is now. If you search Glee season premiere, I think you get the promo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a bad sign because the chat room's not jumping in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Britney Spears is definitely going to, I think they're going to do a, a Britney episode.  They did that. They've done that before. They did it before. Is it Kate Hudson? I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that's it. Just go to Fox.com slash Glee. It has a video there. I don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought it was somebody more interesting than that. I am. I'm very, she's a dancer.  She's a dancer. All right. Anyway, Kate Hudson. No, thanks. He's derailed the conversation. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  specialize in that. I delight in it. You know, aren't they all like 40 years old now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're all like in college. They're getting out of medical school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're too old to be teenagers. Gina Trapani is at, I like, I like how she writes it in her,  in her Twitter bio. I think I got to go back to that now because I was looking at it and I thought  that, and by the way, where'd you get that great picture of you? Oh, that's cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. When the, when the Batman, when Dark Knight Rises came out, this blog did,  did like characters of tech bloggers. As if you were in a cape. She says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I make think up and to do dot text back in the day I started Lifehacker and she's a super woman.  Gina Trapani. Nice cape. Yeah, nice cape. Thanks. Love that. Appreciate it.  We do this show every Wednesday, 1 PM Pacific, 4 PM Eastern time,  two, one, 12, 13, 2000 UTC on twit.tv. You do, do watch live because then you could be in the chat  room and yell at me. And if you decide, and if you decide not to watch live, well, you can also  download the shows after the fact. We make on demand audio and video available at twit.tv slash  twig. And you could yell at me then, but you know, it was interesting because we were discussing  yesterday and our, the executive committee was meeting and we were discussing thinking about  changing the theme song. And we came to the conclusion that however dopey our theme song is,  it is our theme song. It's true. So we've decided not despite, well, somebody submitted a fun theme  song, but I listened to it. I thought it just like every other theme song. We have a unique theme song.  It's dopey. It's recorders, but it's ours. So we're going to keep it. So there, Britney Spears in  episode two, episode one, Kate Hudson. Oh, it is Kate Hudson. Okay. I didn't know she was a dancer,  but apparently she is. Sure. Sure. Thank you everybody for joining us. We'll see.  It's a good promo. I should run it. We'll see you next week on twit.
