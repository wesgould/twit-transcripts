Transcript:  Coming up on this week in Google, I'm in here in place for Leo Laporte, who's off gallivanting  through San Diego.  We've got Aaron Newcomb and Jeff Jarvis joining me.  We have a lot of fun just chatting about.  And we get the earnings out of the way up at the top.  Then we talk about AMP, some changes to kind of search that'll make you see a little bit  more of what's going on with accelerated mobile pages.  Also the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 announcement was yesterday, and we'll talk a little bit  about that, about some of the new Nexus rumors.  Android Nougat is right around the corner.  Comcast is messing with your data on the ISP level, wants to sell it to advertisers.  All sorts of stuff that we're going to discuss next on This Week in Google.

Transcript:  This is Twig, This Week in Google, episode 364 for Wednesday, August 3rd, 2016.  Abs of Chipotle.  It's time for Twig, This Week in Google.  Leo Laporte out today.  Actually just took off.  They're going to San Diego for something down there.  A little bit of sunshine, a little bit of Mexican food.  I'm not really entirely sure, but I'm Jason Howell filling in for Leo, at least doing  my best to fill in for Leo, and joined by awesome people.  As always with this show, I always enjoy coming onto This Week in Google because we get to  talk with none other than Jeff Jarvis.  How's it going, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good.  I'm glad.  I'm delighted you're back, and I'm going to see what we're going to mess up in your  life this time on Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  I was back in the back office with Megan.  She was like, just don't break your device with two-factor authentication.  For those of you who missed it, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jason took one for the Gipper last show, so we're going to see if he can match it this  time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, all I can say from that is everything's good now, and I learned a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you have a shrine to Matt Cutts up in your home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  Matt was instrumental to at least pushing it along, so that was really nice of him to  do that.  Also joining us is Aaron Newcomb from the Makerspace.  Where is the Makerspace?  Where are you at right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I am in lovely, I wouldn't say downtown Benicia.  I'm not actually in downtown Benicia.  I'm in the industrial park.  Yes, here at the Makerspace, Benicia Makerspace.  So I thought it would be nice to have the show from here for once and see how it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right on.  And behind you, you've got some sort of laser-y thing that totally attracts my eyes to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's actually the sign from our laser maze.  We set up this big 8-foot by 16-foot laser maze, and you can crawl through it kind of  Mission Impossible style to try to get the jewels at the end or whatever you're trying  to do.  And that's the sign, maybe if I turn this a little bit, you will see it better.  That's the sign that goes up on the front of the laser maze as people are queuing up  to go through this thing.  That's what it looks like.  So a little Arduino programming and a strip of LEDs goes a long way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What happens when you cross the laser?  What happens to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it makes a sound.  It goes, ah, and it also adds this whole thing is timed.  So it adds five seconds to your time every time you cross through a laser beam.  So you're really trying to avoid them and come out with the best time possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you say the majority of the stuff that you're working on in Makerspace has to do  with Raspberry Pi, Arduino?  I mean, is it pretty much all built around that for the most part?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, see, a lot of the stuff I do is built around Raspberry Pi and Arduino, but no, not  at all.  So we do welding here.  We're just doing our first machining training.  So there's a lot of equipment we have here that you wouldn't have in your garage, presses  and brakes for bending material and shears for cutting metal and lots of woodworking  equipment.  So really, it's kind of whatever you want to make it.  If you want to do woodworking, you can come in and do woodworking.  If you want to do electronics, you can come in and do electronics.  The 3D printers are right behind me.  You can do that too.  So it's a mixture of all kinds of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Super cool.  My only real experience with any of this stuff was actually working with you to get the Raspberry  Pi up and running on my arcade cabinet, which gets used very frequently at home.  So thanks again for helping out with that.  I finally got the kids understanding that these aren't the kinds of games that you touch  the screen on, that it's like a different type, a different category of game.  Took them a while to actually warm up to it, but now they've got Pac-Man fever, so it's  good.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Aaron, if you ever find yourself in Pasadena, go by...  Bill Gross's Idea Lab.  Oh yeah, definitely I've heard of it.  He has his fab space there to do the things that he actually works on.  He's built cars out of there and all kinds of neat stuff, and it's really cool to see  it in the process of a company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.  Absolutely.  Sounds great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fanned.  Bill's one of the nicest guys in technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excellent.  That's Pasadena, California.  Yeah, the Wikipedia doesn't really show me a whole lot, but...  Anyways, well cool.  It's awesome to be doing a show with both of you guys.  We've got a lot to talk about.  Actually, this was a big...  I know it's kind of boring to start with earnings stuff, but I think it's important in the sense  that technology companies, like the really big technology companies, this was a really  impressive earnings quarter, starting off with Alphabet, who had their...  For the second quarter of 2016, the revenue's up 21% year over year.  Half of their searches come from mobile, and that's obviously a testament to the strength  in Android, also the paid deals with iOS, all that kind of stuff.  With more than half of all those searches coming from mobile, basically the overall  ad spend on mobile is increased 63% year over year, so there's a lot of money to be made  there.  Obviously, really good news for Google.  Lots to go around, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the numbers right before that from Facebook, it's killer, and it's scaring the hell out  of media people because they more and more and more and more own the advertising world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so they're the big guys, right?  Obviously Google is tremendous in online advertising.  Facebook is kind of moving upwards, but still not necessarily a total threat to Google at  this point, would you say, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, not at all, but I wouldn't sell my Google stock, but I wish I had some Facebook stock  because I think they're both going to do very, very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess the challenge here for Google in this regard is that mobile ads actually cost less  than desktop ads, so if their strength is in mobile, they actually have to do a lot  more work to make up the difference, but I guess this is just the landscape that they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The volume is very high, and as we see coming up with...  We'll have a discussion a little later on AMP, between AMP and that speeds up the experience  immensely and you end up getting more inventory out of it, more engagement out of it, and  better performance of the ads out of it, so they're going to be tweaking the mobile experience  constantly, and data.  Mobile generates more data to be able to be more targeted and thus more effective and  efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, very, very true.  So Google's doing awesome, or I always do that.  I always accidentally say Google, but it's Alphabet actually, although Google's behind  all the searchy stuff that's happening that's making a heck of a lot of money for Alphabet.  And yeah, I don't know, and Facebook, Amazon had a really impressive earnings quarter.  They, quarter after quarter, are basically breaking their records of revenue generated  each and every time, so you've got these behemoths just doing nuts, and then you...  There you go, posted a record profit.  Third straight quarter doubled the amount of employees that they have for the company  in one single year, which if I remember correctly, I read somewhere that the number of employees  that they added in a single year, which is 268,900 employees is the new high.  The number that they added is more than Alphabet has as a company, which kind of gave me pause  right there, but I guess Amazon has a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The vast, vast majority of them are not doing high tech jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  It's all about fulfillment.  It's all about a lot of the work around taking all those products that people order online.  And paid a lot less.  And pushing it out, yeah.  Something that isn't factored into there, I guess, are the seasonal employees, so that  would even make the number higher.  So yes, getting the earnings out of the way, but I don't know, any thoughts about kind  of like where we are in technology in general as relates to these three companies?  And then you have Twitter, which is just limping along.  It can't quite keep up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or what do you remember?  Yeah, I mean, I would say that you mentioned Apple having a little bit of an issue, right?  Diversifying.  But I would say that Google, as much as it's trying to diversify, it's also having some  issues, right?  Because almost all of their revenue or the vast majority of the revenue that comes in  is ad revenue, right?  I think they have a lot of work to do in terms of diversifying and making other parts of  the business profitable.  And this is exactly why they did Alphabet in the first place, right?  Is that they have all of these other things that they're trying to do so that if the ad  market ever crashes, they're not going to feel the pain as much.  And this is something that they're trying to do with their moonshot programs and other  things.  And I think Amazon is out there doing the exact same thing.  They realize that online retail is one thing, but if online retail could go to some other  company at some point, and so they have to diversify.  And so it's interesting.  I think that they may actually have the, I wouldn't say the most diversified portfolio,  but at least with things like AWS and cloud business and pushing more towards a, on the  one side pushing towards retail and then on the other side pushing towards business customers.  I mean, I think they may actually be in the best position because if one of those flip  flops on the teeter totter, they can depend on the other one.  Whereas Google and Apple are really in trouble if they lose their primary sources of revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a really good point.  Amazon with, you know, like Alexa and the Echo, that's a whole angle of its business  that I don't know how much of that is actually driving the success of the company necessarily,  but it's an initiative that was very experimental, it seemed like, and has really kind of caught  fire and now has become very close to Amazon's heart as far as like kind of dialing into  the fabric of Amazon's efforts going forward, really trying to kind of have those integrations  and everything, at least from the sales side.  And then you mentioned their web services division, that's their cloud and storages  and you know, all that technology behind the scenes, $2.8 billion of revenue for the quarter,  which is up 58% year over year.  So that's just going nuts.  So because everybody relies on what Amazon does in the cloud, which is kind of scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's good for them, right?  Like I said, at least at least they have something to fall back on.  Whereas Google has a few things up their sleeve, but nothing like Amazon.  So I think Amazon's actually in really good shape.  And like you said, Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know Twitter, that's the, what did I see here?  I read this article by the Wall Street Journal that was basically kind of looking into kind  of the challenge, the big challenge for Twitter, which is essentially the fact that so much  of its usage comes from non-users, which is kind of the way the service has been built,  right?  It's built so that you can get on, you can follow, you can share all that kind of stuff.  But you can also watch as a voyeur from the outside or, you know, see these tweets embedded  into pages and all this kind of stuff.  So visibility is high.  You know, they're talking about it on TV.  They're talking, they're mentioning, throwing hashtags into advertisements and everything.  So it's not like Twitter isn't a known product.  It's just the fact that it only has 313 monthly active users compared to possibly, I think  they were estimating somewhere around 800 million, sorry, 800 million addressable users  as far as like an audience, but not a daily user that's logging in, just kind of seeing  them tangentially.  And that's kind of a huge issue for Twitter, trying to figure out how they, you know, how  they convert that into some sort of way that they can make any money whatsoever because  they're just not really doing it.  I don't know.  So yes, obviously Twitter has the big challenges there.  But any other thoughts on these earnings before we get out of the earnings pool and jump into  fun stuff?  Let's jump into fun stuff.  I don't know why I started off with earnings, probably because it was right in front of  me.  I started off with Samsung because that's fun.  Did you guys check out the announcement yesterday with their new device, the Galaxy Note 7?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought I was going to go, but it passed by me and I didn't know, I didn't get an  invitation or anything, it didn't happen.  But it looks like a nice device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really nice.  Actually, I was pretty impressed.  Leo, Ron Richards and myself were on hand yesterday morning to kind of cover the announcement  and everything.  It wasn't like we were talking about a device that we hadn't already heard so much about  in the internet sphere.  So many things had leaked about this already.  So there weren't a whole lot of surprises.  But to catch people up, 5.7 inch Super AMOLED display, Quad HD with curved screen.  So they've added a curved screen to both sides of the Galaxy Note 7 to kind of bring it in  line with the Edge, which by the way, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge sold more than the  S7 in the past five months.  It's been incredibly popular.  So it makes a whole lot of sense that they would kind of move that design language in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jason, have you spent much time using an Edge phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I've reviewed the Edge device, actually both of them.  The first one that was just like the single edge on one side, which is weird, and then  the latest one.  What do you really, does it add any value?  It does to some.  It didn't really to me.  I mean, from an aesthetics perspective, I really like the look of the device.  But the screen then to me is weird.  Yeah, you mean how the image kind of falls off to the sides a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not the way it's meant to be seen.  The other thing I wonder is, when I go into the airport, I travel a lot, I go to the airport  and time to put my phone down at security or at the gate or the club, trying to hold  the phone on the edges so it doesn't hit any buttons or anything so you can put the bar  code down.  Is this whole little dance you have, is that worse on the Edge phones?  Are you in danger of hitting stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like I got a little bit of that in my playing around with it.  I'm pretty sure, I'm guessing, and I'm going to check out the Note 7 so I'll be able to  test it with this as well, but I'm guessing it's the kind of thing that the longer you  live with it, the better you get it at that sort of thing.  You kind of adjust your usage pattern on it a little bit so that you don't do those things.  But I definitely had phantom touches on just holding the device when I was using it and  that would annoy me at least short term.  I'm sure people kind of get used to how you're supposed to hold it eventually.  At least I would hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still think it's a gimmick personally.  Maybe the sales are proving me wrong, but I said this before either on this show or  all about Android.  I think it's a gimmick.  I think it's an interesting gimmick.  It certainly has enticed people to buy this particular device, but at the end of the day,  what usefulness do you actually get out of it?  Maybe there's some folks in the chat room that have one that can tell us, oh yeah, I  use this every day and here's the feature that really works for me.  Everybody I've talked to says, oh, isn't it cool?  And it's like, well, okay, what do you do with it that you couldn't do otherwise or  that really makes it better than having a flat display?  And nobody can seem to answer that question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's cool because it looks cool.  That's my opinion.  You know what I mean?  And I don't know if that's necessarily enough, but sales are pointing to the fact that it  probably is.  Samsung in their earnings, not to go back to earnings, but just to kind of tap on this  point here, said that the S7 Edge was the breakout.  Like I said, it beat the S7, so it's selling more.  Their earnings were, they increased revenue 5% year over year.  After having really had some challenges over the past couple of years, they've really turned  things around with this latest kind of family, the S7 family of devices.  And within that successful family, the Edge is the breakout hit.  Whether people find it useful or not, they're willing to drop extra money because it does  cost extra to get the Edge version.  And you can get an S7 version without the Edge.  Yes, you can get a traditional S7.  Note 7 also.  No, you cannot with the Note 7.  So the Note 7 is only with Edge.  It's only with the Edge on the side.  And I want to see it because some of the early reports that I had seen had mentioned that  it might be like a less steep of an Edge, like curved corners, but not necessarily as  curved as the S7 Edge.  I'm not really quite sure.  I haven't seen it in person yet to judge that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Give credit to Samsung because the world laughed when they sat down and produced a phablet  and it took over and the world looked dubiously at them when they put on the Edge phones.  And the market is proving them right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So credit to them.  Absolutely.  I mean, almost to the point to where these large factor phones, we don't even really call  them phablets anymore.  They're just phones.  We've gotten so used to seeing these large factor phones.  And yeah, I mean, in the early days of all about Android, when the first Note released,  it was enough of a kind of quizzical thing that we actually had a segment, which was  Android in the Wild, which was can anyone actually spot one of these things out in the  wild?  Like you're on the subway and you see someone randomly using it.  And it was really hard to do, but they paged away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was in Korea and I tried to buy one there because it was an odd beast and you saw them  just all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  So, you know, taking Samsung's been listening to their users a lot and, you know, they've  had they've almost been forced to they've had to correct things because the last couple  of years they have not done as well as they were used to doing, at least as pertains to  mobile but just in general.  So they've made some changes to the Note 7 along those lines.  There's the curved edges on the screen.  They've made it waterproof.  So now the Note series is waterproof all the way or at least the Note 7 is waterproof all  the way down to where the S Pen slides into the device.  That is waterproofed in there.  So you know, it's no water is going to get through, which is really interesting.  I'm very curious to know how they pulled that off.  They've increased the battery life to 30, 3500 milliamp hour battery.  So you know, based on versus the last version, which I think was like 3000 milliamp hour  battery and battery is important to everyone, I think probably one of the most important  features micro SD card slot.  They worked that back in.  So you've got removable storage that makes their new come happy.  What are you going to use that for?  If you had this device, what would you use it for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything and everything.  I mean, just just simply having a device, you know, we've talked about this before,  just simply having some extra storage and a lot of these programs you can say, you know,  don't keep my photos, which are usually the biggest drag on your internal storage.  Don't put those on my on my internal storage, put those on external storage.  And just doing that alone will save you so much space on your device, let alone, you  know, the fact that you can put a bunch of movies on there, take it with you on the plane,  change it out if you want to watch something different, all that kind of stuff.  I mean, it just makes it so much more usable, in my opinion.  But you know, I think if you didn't already mention, I'll say it again, the fact that  there's four gig on this device, four gig of internal memory, as well as I believe 64  gig of normal storage.  Yeah, a baseline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the beginning.  A sign for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think that is a good trend in the right direction, just because there are some  people that don't care about the external storage.  They just want to have everything on there.  And at least that gives you a little bit more room to play with.  I mean, on my Nexus six, which I'm still using about ready for a new phone, I think.  But on my Nexus six, I mean, I'm constantly kind of bumping up into that 32 gig that I  have.  And so it's nice just to have the extra internal storage as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're getting close.  I think you're getting close to needing a new device, Aaron.  And, you know, possibly the new Nexus is the next side right around the corner.  It sounds like that's probably what you're I'm guessing you're waiting for.  You got it.  But yeah, so Samsung did a great job here.  They also have iris scanning built into the phone, which I really want to play around  with. This was one of those things that we heard about in advance of the announcement.  And I kind of did a little eye roll just like, oh, all right, Samsung's doing the thing  again that sounds great on paper at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The eye rolling will get all messed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. Totally. It's not going to let me into the phone.  And but yet everybody that's played around with it, at least in the preview stage, says  that it's in some ways faster than a fingerprint scanner.  So and almost to the point, I read in one article where it was like, I'd take a picture  of the process, but I can't because it's too fast.  Like any time I try, it just lets me in right then.  And I can't actually snap a picture of it.  Oh, so I don't know, could be kind of a gimmick, but it actually sounds sounds pretty legit  to protect certain parts of the phone and not to mention fingerprint scanners aren't  the most secure thing in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyways, there was as we learn more this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, right. OK, so there researchers were able to I think they initially 3D printed  so someone who was murdered, they wanted to get into the phone.  It was a Galaxy S6, I believe they wanted to get into the phone.  Yeah, I was in a six to see if there were any clues to who the murderer might have been.  And they took, I guess, a picture, an image of the fingerprint of the man who, you know,  whose phone it belonged to.  And they tried to 3D print a thumb print or a thumb to access it.  But of course, that doesn't carry a charge the way our hands do.  And so that will keep that from working.  So they ended up 2D printing it with conductive ink and that got him right in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, something to try at our next.  Maker lab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Second, the maker lab. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's probably easier to do that than it is to replicate the iris of someone's eye  in order to get to get into a device.  But but that's just that's fascinating to me.  So, yeah, cool things.  They also announced something called Samsung Pass.  This is kind of tied into the security of the device and that, you know, it's got NOx  security underneath, which is very well known for very good protection for these devices.  Samsung Pass is actually going to be working with banks like B of A, Citibank, US Bank  and a bunch of others to essentially store a lot of that card information stuff  and work in tandem with iris scanning as well as other authentication methods.  So I think overall, what what Samsung is doing here is they're filling out their  like they've got a really good schedule going right now throughout the year.  And this year being a great example of that, they started with the S7 and the S7 edge  really aimed it towards the general consumer had a knockout last five months.  I mean, their the last five months of sales has just been enormous for Samsung.  As things start to settle down, they unleashed the Note 7, which has a very ardent,  you know, particular audience, but is also really good and tailored for like enterprise  users and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Dr. Android, it wasn't that long ago, a year ago, we thought when Samsung was, oh,  well, that's the home, we don't talk about Uncle Samsung.  Yeah, not doing so, it's kind of plastic and kind of nothing.  And it really seems to have come back to a quality reputation, no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really does. And like I said, this goes, a, their profits are showing that, you know,  they're they're actually selling phones in a time when it's really difficult to sell  phones. Historically, this is about as bad as it's been since this whole smartphone  revolution of the past seven years since the since the iPhone kind of released and  everybody hopped on the bandwagon.  You know, this last year or two has been really everything's slowing down.  Even Apple says it's slowing down.  Yet Samsung's able to push through it with really great hardware.  So, number one, the sales are showing that.  And number two, like I said, they're listening to their fans, they're doing things,  they're making changes to their devices, at least in the mobile side of things, that  actually means something.  In my opinion, I got so used to seeing Samsung devices and seeing that the tricky  software that they throw in.  And, you know, again, I rolls because they look great on paper, they look great on a  stage when they're showing it off.  But then in reality, like you never use it, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what's the other Dr.  Android question? What's the latest guessing on timing for the Nexus?  Nexus, Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, from what I understand.  OK, so this might tie in with the fact that Android Nougat, which is, you know,  historically the next version of Android has launched with a device with a Nexus device  of some sort. That's what we're used to.  That's what we're used to seeing for years and years now.  Well, it turns out that we might be seeing Android Nougat in the next couple of days,  potentially. Evan leaks, sorry, Evan leaks, Evan Blass on Twitter.  He's a notorious leaker of information.  Or, you know, he's he's given a lot of information from people who want to leak  information, and it's usually very accurate.  So he posts it when he feels confident in it, says it's probably going to happen tied  to the security patch in a couple of days on August 5th.  Google's already announced that there will be a security patch on the 5th.  They haven't announced that Nougat would be associated with that in any way.  So that remains to be seen.  But that if that happens, it's a very different scenario than what we've seen in  the past. Normally, these new versions of Android have a device to launch with.  And this time, you know, we're hearing about two HTC Nexus devices.  We haven't heard about them in any sort of official way from Google yet.  So they don't even exist as far as we're concerned.  And it sounds like Nougat is probably going to release before those and that  another device in LG V20, I believe, is actually going to beat the Nexus devices  to market as the first hardware shipping with Nougat.  So we don't know.  We know that the V20 is launching in September from what LG says.  And if they're touting that it's going to be the first hardware to ship with Nougat,  it tells us that the HTC Nexuses, if they actually do exist, probably not coming  until September at the earliest and don't know when beyond there.  So I don't know if that's a good or a bad answer for you, Jeff.  Are you?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I was thinking about this.  Somebody asked us, I think, in Twitter the other day, you know, what do we think  of the Nexus 6, Leo, he was asking Leo too.  Leo is long gone into 45 with their phones.  I still I still like mine a great deal.  And we are at the point of wondering what feature could they come up with?  It's going to make me mean I'll switch because I'm a lemming.  And, you know, Google says, oh, here, here, you put the carrot in front of my nose  and I'll go buy the carrot.  But I don't it's hard for me to imagine what they're going to come up with.  It makes me say, oh, I got to drop this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about you? Yeah, I mean, I've felt that way for a little while now.  I mean, you know, we've got improved cameras.  So the cameras are finally pretty close to on par with what I'm looking for.  I don't know. I don't know what the feature is anymore.  It's it's like sometimes it feels like we're a peak phone as far as that's concerned.  You know, all the phones have kind of blended into each other.  And I don't know what a new device brings that makes it a must  have, other than that, it's a new device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think this actually elevates the Android operating system part of the device.  Right. I mean, when we're talking about  because there really isn't a whole lot of new features from a hardware side  that are coming out, except more and faster. Right.  So we're at that point where desktop PCs were, you know, maybe, I don't know,  eight, nine years ago, something like that, where they kind of peaked.  And people stopped talking about this, you know, AMD versus Intel  and this processor versus Intel.  And all of a sudden it was, you know, the new software you could run  on the desktop or your laptop or then phones became really popular.  So I think we've just hit that point where we have plateaued  in terms of where the hardware is, not where it can go, but it's just the  the the the differences are so slight or so insignificant  that they're just not interesting as much as they used to be.  So now it really is about the software.  And I think now Google, at least, has and its partners  have an opportunity to shine with Android on what the software can do,  how it can make use of those resources as opposed to just the hardware itself.  And I'm actually really hopeful for the HTC devices.  I know a lot of people are kind of like, I don't know.  HTC hasn't been doing much lately,  but I always enjoyed my HTC devices when I had one.  And so I'm really hoping that HTC can make a comeback.  If it is true that they're going to be the the new Nexus  manufacturers of the new Nexus devices. So we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really seems like all signs are pointing to yes, as far as that's concerned.  There's two devices that are expected.  Sailfish is the kind of code name for the smaller five inch display  with a 1080p screen.  And then there's the Marlin, which is the code name for the larger  five point five inch QHD AMOLED display.  And outside of that, those changes and I think a larger battery on the larger one,  they're pretty much the same between the two of spec for spec.  So, you know, it really seems like this is probably what  what we're going to expect as far as the new Nexus devices are concerned.  I've always really liked HTC as well.  And I've always thought that, you know, their hardware, their build quality.  I really like kind of their their style and aesthetic  when it comes to their design.  The HTC 10, I reviewed that I really enjoyed playing around with that device.  You know, but this is this is a crazy year  because you've got flagship devices from Samsung, from HTC.  These high quality devices, LG,  Motorola, although Motorola got rid of the headphone jack.  So you can dock them a few points for that.  But you've got so you've got these these higher cost devices  compared to this whole like middle of the road, four hundred dollar priced,  but still incredibly impressive hardware options like the OnePlus three,  which is excellent.  And Leo, I think did Leo show off the ZTE Axon seven last week?  Sounds like he did,  which is also just excellent design for like four hundred dollars.  So this is just it's such a weird time for smartphones.  It's kind of I don't know.  It almost feels like it's confused because at some point you have to  you have to ask yourself where where it's worth  going from the four hundred dollar phone that has pretty much everything  you really want up to the eight hundred and fifty dollar note seven  that adds a stylus and, you know, a couple of other features.  Is it worth it?  So I don't know, but I don't know.  I'm looking forward to the new Nexus whenever that happens.  And it'll be interesting if Nougat does release in a couple of days here  to see how that rollout goes.  You're both on six, as you said, right?  Yeah, I am six.  OK, so you got regular six.  OK, well, you both would get Nougat.  I think the regular six is also lying to get Nougat as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's the main reason to to to get Nexus phones.  Yeah, it's the assurance that you'll get, you know,  every time I look at a Samsung device and I think they're getting better.  And I'm like, but then I really want to wait and deal with Samsung.  The other thing I'm doing is that is because I travel,  I have Google Fi on the six and and my real phone is the six P.  So when I'm traveling, I'm using Fi on this internationally,  which just makes a huge difference.  So I'm carrying two phones.  And then because I have AT&T grandfathered on my main phone,  I can't tether from there so I can tether from this thing.  So it's really it's it's I'm dragging around two phones in my briefcase,  but it's kind of worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you have the two phones so that you don't have to give up  a grandfather or the grandfathered unlimited.  That's specifically like you're not going to let go of that no matter what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just in case I just never have to worry.  I don't think I use that much data.  Yeah. But it's like an insurance policy.  I don't have to worry.  You know what? The phone will automatically say data worried.  And I think that's not for me.  That doesn't apply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Now, I had the I had the grandfathered unlimited data with Verizon for quite a while.  And then I just really like I started actually looking at my data usage.  And I was like, man, I'm just not using it anymore.  And then for based on what we do and in the world of Android, I feel like,  you know, when you're on Verizon, just as an example network,  you're so limited compared to the possibility in the open world  that is out there outside of Verizon as far as options and everything like that.  So I ended up being OK with the fact that I was just going to let go of my unlimited data.  Verizon was really working hard to make it really inconvenient, too.  So, you know, they really don't want you to have your unlimited data.  Oh, they don't. They don't.  They make it challenging just for that very reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every month, you have to chew gums, turn around, spin five times to keep your plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Call us. We'll talk about it.  We'll talk about it.  If you are considering getting the Note 7,  then you will probably want to preorder it,  because if you do preorder it, you get a free your choice of either a free gear  fit to wearable like fitness wearable device.  That's based on Tizen, by the way, or you get a 256 gig micro SD card.  I'm assuming that Aaron Newcomb would opt for that if he were to get a Note 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But just think about how many Raspberry Pi images I could put on six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can hot swap your Raspberry Pi images on the fly, all from your phone.  Sure. Yeah, that makes sense to me.  So there you go.  Samsung's gear.  Well, they also announced a gear VR, like an updated gear VR,  because the Note 7 is now based on USB-C.  So tell me about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is my gear VR going to be still is still going to work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, OK. Well, so what phone are you using with your gear VR?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The I guess this is the Galaxy 6S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The S6. So the S6 will still obviously.  That's right. It's easy.  They all name their things almost the same thing.  Anyways, the old gear VR obviously is going to continue working with your device.  Your device would work with the new one.  What they've done is they've they've changed the  the there's like a little removable plug.  So you can choose whether that removable plug has the standard USB  or the USB-C connector on it, and it'll actually work with the S6.  There you go. Those are the those are the plugs right there.  So, you know, if you want to upgrade, go for it.  Jeff is just one hundred dollars.  Wider field of view.  Or it could just not be that important.  I'm sure the one you have right now is just quite all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How much time do you do each of you spend in VR in a month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not much at all. I mean, zero.  Yeah. Zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unless unless I'm testing because I don't have one.  So unless I'm testing something out,  I go to a friend's house or something or yeah, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting, but I it's not interesting enough to me  to the point where I want to go buy it.  I'd like to play with it, but it's not like, you know, when the Wii came out,  I was like, oh, I've got to go get that right.  I mean, the kids are going to go nuts or whatever.  But this this isn't quite there yet.  Like the killer app for VR to me hasn't quite hit yet.  I'm sure it will at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Pokemon Go of VR has not hit for you. That's right. That's right.  Yeah, I mean, I actually this week,  today's episode of Android App Arena is a cardboard VR episode.  So I spent some time this week in VR.  But if I'm not doing it for those reasons, I mean, it's just hard.  For me, it's more of a time issue.  I just don't have a whole lot of time to play games and be take, you know,  stop whatever I am doing and pull out a a goggle or a helmet  and put it on and take 20 minutes doing this thing.  I think it's neat, though.  I think it's interesting.  Remains to be seen if it's really the next big thing.  We thought wearables, you know, like watches and stuff were the next big thing,  or at least someone did  in the higher house because we saw those everywhere.  And I feel like even that's kind of petered out at this point. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will say what I did do since you asked, Jeff, is I did go look at the Conan  360 coverage he did at Comic Con, where he did his shows  or at least some of his shows, some parts of his shows in using the 360 cam.  And that kind of blew me away  in terms of watching live video and being able to move with my finger  or if you had cardboard on, obviously with your head,  move around and see what people were doing, including the audience,  how they were reacting to the jokes. Right.  That was pretty neat.  And so there may be a play there for sporting events, live concerts.  So things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hold on there.  So I just I mean, there was somebody who was really good at VR,  doing investment in VR today at my school, because we're worried about this too.  And I'm not sure concert concert doesn't make sense.  The concert is a 180 at most is more like a 150 degree thing. Right.  How often do you want to turn around and see the crowd?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you might not want to see the crowd, but like if you go  look at the Conan 360, what they did is you could actually pick  to view the conference or the concert from a different angle.  So sometimes, you know, when you're sitting in the cheap seats  or you're way off to the side because you didn't know that that was a bad seat  or it was the only seat you could get.  You're like, man, I wish I could see what it looked like from over there  because that, you know, I just wish I could see what, you know,  I want to focus on the drummer or the guitar player,  but I can't see him from here.  Those kinds of things are possible with the 360 view.  And so I think it does make it interesting, especially, I mean,  you got to remember to like sporting events and concerts and stuff.  Those are true fans in the in the true sense of the word fanatics. Right.  These are fans that really want to get into this.  And so I think they might even pay more to see a football game  or a concert and be able to look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But our guest said it and our guest is expert in VR and he  and he did all kinds of work in it and he's pushing for it  and investing money and so forth.  His view about a football game, he said, you know,  look at a 4K TV straight on curated by expert people  with commentary and the right scene selection.  That beats a 360 camera on the field.  I don't know what the heck I'm looking at.  Well, there goes the ball.  You know, and I think he has a point.  I think we I think it's your point, Eric, earlier.  We haven't found we're struggling to find the killer app for it.  And we just haven't found it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel like there's something to be said, though, for experience.  Like, yeah, they're completely different experiences, right?  Watching a football game.  And I think football is actually a great example  they bring up, because even when I go to like a live football game,  I don't necessarily feel while I'm there  that it's the best way to watch a football game,  because I miss out on all the other stuff.  Right. And there's a lot of waiting and, you know,  the field's very far away compared to where I happen to be seated.  And sometimes I just feel like the TV experience for me is better.  But there are other experiences where I would love the ability,  even though I can't make it in person, to be immersed by it.  You know, I might not look behind me at a concert  when I'm actually at a concert.  But if I can transport myself into tricking my brain, almost that I'm there,  then I have the ability to do it if on a whim I decide to.  I mean, like, yeah, look around.  It makes you feel like you're there in a different way.  Not that you're necessarily going to be watching that person  that's standing behind you the whole show.  But right. But that makes you feel like you're you're in a real experience  more than just watching a video on a TV screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it certainly did me watching Conan 360.  I felt like, wow, I kind of feel like I'm sitting in the audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Yeah.  There was a there's a video I was actually just setting up.  I got one of those Gear VR  goggles when I bought the S7 a little while back  and then promptly dropped it and broke the screen.  Finally got the screen replaced.  And so I was like, OK, so I'm going to go through the setup  with the Gear VR and everything.  And one of the things that they pre-install on Gear VR,  can't remember the name of it, but, you know, as a musician, I love this as a demo.  It's this it's this video, a 360 video of a guy  sitting at a piano with his dog sleeping on the on the carpet.  And he's just sitting at the piano like playing and writing the song or whatever.  And, you know, I have no reason to look around and look at the couch  that's behind me or anything like that.  But just the fact that I'm transported into the middle of this room  in this like highly kind of personal scenario,  like that kind of extra information brings me there more  than if it was just a fixed view, you know, and that I think  I think there's a lot of potential there once we get VR  to the point to where it's crystal, you know, it's super clear when you look at it.  I think that's another barrier right now is when I look through VR  and I can't help but just notice that it's blurrier than I want.  It's not as sharp as I want.  I want it to be super sharp because then that will help increase  the kind of perception of reality.  And so it has a ways to go.  But but I'm excited for it.  And actually, you bring up VR, VR, so, you know, a part of  the new version of Android Nougat, which  hopefully is rolling out in the next couple of days.  Neither have either of you guys played around with like the dev preview.  Anything with Nougat yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I've got it on the on the my six.  I like the notifications a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, notification improvements are being able to act on notifications

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and not having to go to the application.  I think that we're going to see more and more of that.  You know, let me ask you, do you?  I'm still the odd man on not finding a heck of a lot  of value in Google now.  Yeah, OK.  I just it's just it's just not that targeted on me.  It may be the two accounts problem.  But but I get I get a sense with notifications  how Google now it pulls things out to the front of the view.  You can act on things when you see the worries.  You don't have to open up the app.  It's like Android Instant Apps, in the sense you'll get the  chunk, the actionable chunk of what you want to work on wherever you are,  whether that's through Google now, whether that's through notification,  whether that's in on a web page.  That's very appealing.  I think that's that's to me the breakthrough for Nugent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, you know, we heard at Google I.O.  about kind of this this furthering of what Google now began as  and going into the world of assistant, whatever that ends up being.  And it sounds like that's probably going to be integrated into Android  and or Nuget at, you know, to some degree.  We haven't seen any of that in the developer previews.  So there's still some surprises to be unveiled once we actually see Nuget.  There's, you know, assistant integration.  Does that replace Google now to a certain degree? Right.  Or is that an evolution of Google now?  We actually actually just the other day there was a leak.  Android police had a leak of the Nexus launcher.  And, you know, the file is out there now.  So you can actually install this if you want to.  It's not fully operational.  But you can install it and play around with it.  But what it hints at, aside from the fact that the app drawer is going away,  or at least the button for the app drawer is going away,  instead, you swipe up to reveal your apps. Really?  So, yeah, you're looking at it right now.  There's a little upwards arrow down at the bottom  that you swipe up to your apps.  So more changes are afoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's hard for clumsy people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I think it's probably just like reprogramming your brain, right?  Or if someone's never seen it before the first time they did,  did they know that that little dot with the, you know, that little  circle with the dots inside actually represented apps or not until they touched it?  So, you know, it's probably a minor change, ultimately.  But what this hints at is that the Google search bar up at the top  is also going away.  And instead, you're going to have a little Google button that supposedly  could be tapped.  And that would bring out the search, but possibly also have  kind of assistant integration  worked into there in some way, shape or form.  So so we don't know.  Maybe Google now will get much, much, much better for you once assistance  kind of worked in. Yeah, I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that's what also interesting to me is Google now as spoken.  How do you mean assistant?  A lot of what you do with the Google now will become voice in voice out.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you are you very used to kind of doing the voice commands at this point?  I do it more for dictation of things. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't do voice commands. What about you guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Control the device, not necessarily a whole lot.  I might I might use a voice command to like, you know, play a song  or play an artist or something like that.  But yeah, nothing really that major, nothing that technical.  And I mean, there are tons of Google now commands and and all that kind of stuff.  I just I don't think of them.  I just don't think of them on the fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm using it more and more these days.  I mean, I'm using it, especially the read me my itinerary command.  Wake up in the morning.  It's a really good one.  I just read you what's on your calendar.  That's a really and I've been using, you know, read me my voice messages  or my text messages, but that doesn't always work.  You know, mostly I use it for search, but I am starting to use it more  and more and prefer it more and more and certainly for dictation.  What I've thought about when I was thinking about what Jeff was saying  about now is what I've noticed is that there is good stuff in there.  I just don't always see it because I don't always swipe over to that  tab to see what's in there.  And the notification part, though, is getting more useful to me over time.  I'm starting to get more notifications that are either just in time  or your package was delivered or, you know, things that might be interesting  to me are starting to creep in there more and more.  And so I hope that with assistant, they'll take that and really incorporate it  in a way that's useful for people, because I'm starting to see Google  with all with all the Google apps, certainly.  And I think other app  developers are starting to get into this with Nougat is  is starting to build those little nuggets in there that can really be useful  and help someone right to really make it as Google's calling it an assistant,  as opposed to just  something interesting to look at once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, for sure.  I have I have noticed that my usage of Google now has slowed down lately,  and I'm not entirely sure why.  Like what were you using it for mainly?  Well, I mean, I don't know.  Like my main value was just checking in on it to see to see what it  what it was giving me, you know, like weather, weather prime example.  I probably use Google now for weather more than like the actual page of Google  now for weather more than anything else.  I don't use it for parking directions.  I don't really I don't even really use it for itinerary  because my itinerary is always kind of the same.  Like I can work and I do shows that I go home.  It would be very helpful if I was doing a lot of traveling, I'm sure.  And I would probably rely on it to a certain degree.  But, you know, there are ways that it ends up working, you know,  where I'm outside of my normal use case, like when I do travel  and suddenly it pops up that card that says you're flying tomorrow.  Here's your itinerary.  You know, things like that.  That's what I think.  That's that's where it excels.  And I wish I wish there was more opportunity for it to do things like that  that were really helpful in my day to day life.  But I think my life is just so, you know, so normal, you know, to to my own days.  My days aren't really that varied, that there's not a whole lot of opportunity  there for Google now to improve it as far as that's concerned anyways.  But I was trying to I was I was digging through my pocket list  because I had found a really great voice command  kind of interface for for Google now to know all of these extra things  that it can do for you.  And I just cannot find it.  I mean, there's thousands of them.  There are so many.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talked about that last time I was on the show.  I think Leo brought it up as his pick as his tip of the week or something.  Some guy compiled the list of all of the.  Yeah. And he made like, yes, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so you guys already had it.  All right. Old news, but still very, very cool.  There it is. OK, dash Google, dot I.O.  I kept putting Google, dot I.O.  because I thought that was it.  But it's OK, dash Google, dot I.O.  If you want to check that out again.  Apparently, Leo beat me to the punch on this one.  That's a good way to take a look at it.  Let's see here.  We can touch on a few more quick Android things before we get out of this  and then we'll get to you and we'll get to AMP after this stuff.  But let's let's finish up on this, because I know you've got things to say  about the the news real quick, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google was not here to argue about it for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. So you'll have the floor.  But real quick here, there's actually a new security  notification that's coming to Android, which I think is actually  I'm amazed that it took this long to happen because it makes perfect sense.  But essentially, when you when when your account is logged into on a new device,  you know, I'm very used to getting an email that basically says,  you know, your your account was accessed on a new Chrome  install on this computer or whatever.  And, you know, it's me.  So I know that that's OK.  And I just dismiss it. I archive it.  Whatever. Well, now you're going to get a notification in Android  that asks you or that tells you front and center on all of your devices.  Did you just sign in?  Is this you? That way, you know, immediately, you don't have to know  that you don't find out the next time you log into your email five hours later  or whatever. You know, right now, somebody accessed it  and you have controls right from there to actually do something.  That's the precursor to getting rid of passwords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you think? Yeah, yeah.  You know, they're kind of there's been speculation about that.  That what will happen is that your phone becomes that device  where it'll ask you, is that you?  And you say yes. And that's what will get you in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, fascinating.  I have to think about that.  Is that is that a good good alternative?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you guys? Oh, I hope so.  I can't wait to get rid of passwords.  You know, I can't stand stupid little things.  Things that don't matter in life at all.  That are what the most complicated password you can imagine. Yeah.  They want to soliloquy and haiku form.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The worst of the worst is when  when you've got all of these rules for a password, that it actually takes you  time to figure out, like if you're playing the game right.  Basically, it takes you five minutes just to select a single password.  I understand why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But not only the passwords, but the security questions.  I don't know if you guys have noticed this trend in security questions.  Oh, yeah. There's five questions.  And they're like, you know, what was your third best friend's middle name  in in second grade?  And you're like, I don't know.  How could I possibly?  I'm never going to remember this.  And so, you know, if we could just get rid of those by having the phone  be that security question thing, that would make me happy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Or iris scanning or scanning or scanning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be Samsung.  So I just looked at my Google Now.  And the first thing in stories to read is the thing I wrote on Huffington Post today.  And it says, you've shown an interest in Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I Google, you're supposed to know this, at least.  You're supposed to know at least this.  That's me.  Yeah, you know, you know, one other thing that I have been using Google  now for lately, and it used to really suck at this is what you're talking about.  Stories to read.  It used to be horrible at giving me articles  that I might actually be interested in somewhere along the line,  somewhere in the last like four or five months.  They figured it out.  They got rid of the junk.  I felt like I was getting so many just junky spammy almost articles before.  And now I'm actually getting things that I'm like, oh, add that to the list.  I'm going to remember this one for, you know, for all about Android  or for tech news today or whatever, like it's super applicable.  So they made improvements there and that gets me looking at it regularly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. Do you guys use the news and weather app,  the Google News and Weather app?  Not the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use I use I use Google Play Newsstand.  Oh, yeah. Constantly. Oh, OK.  God, I don't use that either.  I try it really because Dr. Android,  because it's basically, you know, what it does, it replaces it to an extent.  My old RSS habits.  Because there's a technology bar in it, right.  Just fine. But then I can go in and put all kinds of categories in like,  believe it or not, I have Chromebook, Android, Auto,  just to see if it ever comes to the car I want.  Google, Bitcoin and other things.  And so there is the latest of the news that I want from across multiple players.  It's really very good.  Ah, very interesting.  I recommend trying it.  I could use those as a tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to try it as well, because I use I use the news and weather app.  And what I've noticed is, is that a while ago, maybe seven or eight months ago,  they started putting in, is this something you're interested in?  And they started giving you suggestions.  And then over time, you're kind of curating your own interest list.  And eventually it starts, you know, well, almost right away, it starts putting things.  Hey, you know, based on your you said you were interested in Jimmy Fallon.  Did you catch what happened last night on Jimmy Fallon? Right. Here's you know.  And it's like all of a sudden it became much more useful.  And I I'm not sure since you don't use news and weather.  My assumption was is that Google now was getting better  because I use Google News and Weather and it was incorporating my suggestions  into Google now.  But but you don't use it and you say your suggestions and your  story suggestions in Google now is getting better.  So maybe that's not the case.  But I know mine have gotten immensely better over the past six months or so,  because I started actually interacting with it and saying, yes, this is interesting  or no, this isn't interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm hmm. So yeah, I've definitely seen that in Google now.  And I've used it from time to time when it when it pops that up.  No, I'm not interested in Justin Bieber.  Just right for the record.  You don't need to give me any more news stories about Justin Bieber  because that one time I searched his name.  So that was nice to get that control.  And then you can, of course, you can go into the settings behind the scenes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now that it knows you like the girl from Ipanema,  it's going to give you really boring stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it's been tracking everything that I say without me prompting the search query,  that might just be the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The show we had to suffer through twit music for the show.  It was awful. I'm telling you, it was painful and terrible.  And then Jason started doing percussion and humming along with it.  I couldn't help it, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was just it was too catchy and a horrible way to go back into his head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I do it again. Yeah, thanks a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had driven it out completely.  And I feel it like struggling to get back in there, but I'm not going to let it.  I'm not going to let it instead.  Let's talk a little bit about AMP.  No, don't. Oh, man.  It either. Oh, man.  Did that actually happen or was that just in my brain?  I don't know.  Accelerated mobile pages.  That's AMP is about to see an expansion that goes far beyond the familiar  carousel of supported links, links that we now see.  Or at least I've seen a lot of those and into all mobile search results.  So this means that results from AMP publishers  and automatically serve up the AMP version direct from Google when clicked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's here's the deal.  And this they're calling it a developer preview.  And I keep on saying, why is it a developer preview?  A developer doesn't have to do a thing.  Developers not developing anything. It's just you're linking to more.  So that's just what they call that. That's the reflex at Google.  All it means is that for now, the only way you can get to blue links  to AMP is by going to g.co slash AMP demo.  Again, that's g.co slash AMP demo.  And there you will see that if an AMP link exists for a given story,  then it will go to that AMP link.  Now, a couple of things about this.  I talked to Richard Gingras at Google before the announcement.  And he said that there will be no impact on ranking.  Right. And I said, well, yes.  But I said, but but Google keeps telling us that fast pages will rank better.  And one way to make them fast is AMP.  And then their answer is, well, we have 200 signals for ranking.  And the speed is one of them.  Now, what the weight is to that and how you get there, I don't know.  But I take the point that it's not they're going to prejudice in favor of AMP.  They have 150 million AMP documents now,  a four million new AMP documents each week, 179 countries,  79 language, 650,000 domains.  So it's spread rapidly.  Now, two weeks ago, they announced AMP for ads because what's happening  on AMP pages, it holds the geography of the page,  I mean, the architecture of the page and ad is supposed to go in.  But the blank box stays there because the damn ads are too slow.  So now they have efforts to speed up the ads, which is what the real push here is,  is to make the experience better.  And so that's going to improve matters.  But even with the slow ads, so-called viewability for ads has been better  with AMP because people see the whole page and they don't give up and go away.  The timing here is one second for an AMP page up to 16,  17 seconds for a regular page has huge impact on 90 percent of the publishers  have used AMP and said they get greater engagement.  What else?  I think that was the those were the highlights of what I heard from there.  So I think it's a good thing.  There's still confusion out in the marketplace.  I was talking to a newspaper publisher a week ago.  They still think that this is like instant articles and you're going into a  Google walled world and no.  Yes, Google has an influence over the standard, but it's an open standard.  You don't have to use Google CDN.  It's just a Web page.  And like other Web pages, it's served through a CDN, but it's still your Web page.  It's just a faster, better Web page on.  And again, let's also emphasize, if you use the G.C.O.  slash AMP demo, that will only be the case in mobile.  They do not go to AMP pages on big screen browsers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why it wasn't working for me.  I was trying to trying to get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was reading your mind and so I heard confusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason, you got there.  Yeah, I mean, that was my that you kind of addressed one of my questions,  which was it feels like we're becoming three types of Web.  Now we've got standard, we've got AMP and we've got instant articles and publishers  kind of have to do this song and dance to make sure that they support,  at least to some degree, I mean, if they're interested in speeding things up,  supporting all three is that I mean, that's got to be a pain for publishers,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  though, right? But it's no different.  Well, you know, so this is a really interesting thing.  It's not just that.  It's not just taking the content you already have and serving it in new ways.  Right. That's that's that's that's a lot to do.  You're right. Instant articles is basically an RSS feed.  And if you do an AMP page, you can turn that AMP page into your RSS feed.  Instant articles, as I understand it, and it does 90 percent of what you want.  So that's not that bad. But there's something much bigger going on  in in the media world, which is a platform native publishing.  So Washington, I think we mentioned this last week,  Washington Post just put out a job for two full time Facebook live producers.  I see media companies advertising for full time Snapchat producers  and because you can't just take the articles you already wrote for print  and just try to shove them in like,  you know, something down a pate and a goose's neck.  I said that in all these platforms.  You got to do what's appropriate to the use case of the platform.  I'm not well, I think tomorrow I'll publish a post.  I talked to these guys who who founded Occupy Democrats,  which is an amazing thing to me that makes just memes for Facebook  and obviously politically oriented toward the left.  But rather than trying to get people to read articles through these mechanisms  and still see ourselves as a destination, you make content that is appropriate  to the platform so that people can use it as part of their conversations.  That's the bigger challenge than just publishing stuff in AMP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aaron, have you had much kind of much interaction with the AMP pages?  What do you think about them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, interestingly enough, we were just talking about news and weather  and on news and weather, if you look down at your suggested articles,  it'll say AMP on there  and they come up in that browser that you get on the phone.  And I've had trouble in the past.  I don't know if this is AMP's fault or if it's the Google  the browser part that comes up on your phone because it's not Chrome.  It's a separate thing.  And I've had trouble getting some things to work, especially multimedia  things that are linked to in the article or whatever.  They don't work.  And then eventually, at least on my phone, it'll say, oh, do you want to open this up  in Chrome? And I say yes.  And then everything works.  But that's been my experience is that.  And again, I don't know whether it's the AMP part of it that's that that part  that's not working or if it's the actual browser like.  And the same thing happens, you know, when you do Google search from your home screen.  Right.  It comes up in that you're still in the search app and it's showing you a web page  there as opposed to just opening up Chrome as it used to.  And I think maybe it's just that thinned down browser part that's not working.  I don't know. But that's been my experience in the past.  Otherwise, I love how quick the articles load.  It's it's fantastic.  You don't have to sit there and wait because, I mean, we all do this.  If you have to wait more than five seconds for just about anything, whether it's on  your phone or your desktop, you're out of there.  You're out of there.  You're not staying. You're going to like, wow, this is broken.  I'm going someplace else.  So it's fantastic to keep the eyeballs on the content.  Yeah.  But again, it may be Jeff, maybe, you know, but I've had some issues, technical issues  that I want to interact with.  I know that's really interesting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, just just from a use standpoint, anytime I encounter those, I, you know, or  that carousel, I can't help myself, but just tap into it.  Just to see just be like, how fast you can load or whatever.  And yeah, it just goes so quickly.  And that's awesome.  I love it.  By the way, one oddity of them is that if you go through that carousel, you know, one,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  two, three, four, five, six, you just went through six page views, even though you weren't  looking at the story, because because the definition of page view was the page loads  and because the page loads so quickly.  Oh, wow.  They're still sticking in the industry with that as a definition.  And clearly that's not going to work long term.  That's that's that's nobody's trying to deceive anybody.  But they have to update these issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The amount of time spent looking at a particular link, essentially.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other issue that Google said was that even before, because let's not forget, AMP  was was started in great measure.  I was I was at the Google News Geist where this kind of got birthed and part of discussion  I was part of a year and a half ago.  And it was an effort to give something to the news industry to help the news industry.  But the truth is, AMP has never, ever been about news.  It's about a faster, better web.  And so Jigra said that the part of the interesting thing is that even before they moved off  the links from went to the blue links, even even though AMP links were only coming from  the carousel and Google News, still commerce companies have been implementing it.  Because if you have a slow, miserable experience on commerce, you lose customers, you know  just how many you lose.  So AMP is proving to be a better experience for commerce.  And and I feel that the other thing was I asked them, what about others linking to AMP?  And they said that Pinterest and Feedly are already there linking a Nuzle is already there  like a Nuzle was the first one.  They just jumped right in.  If you're a Nuzle fan like I am.  But but Twitter, Medium, LinkedIn are working on and near also linking to AMP content if it's available.  So you're going to see it from Google.  You're going to start seeing from elsewhere as well.  And once the blue links come in, if you're a publisher that's not doing AMP, you're a fool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this is this does this have implications on Facebook as well?  I mean, I know Facebook does some of this stuff already.  I'm sure in their technology.  But, you know, I actually wouldn't mind.  I've started using Facebook a little bit more just because, you know, that's that's where people are.  I really still love Google+.  But the people aren't there except for my my technology peeps.  Hey, guys, it's the sound of the tumbleweed.  Yeah, exactly.  I still I still use Google+.  On almost a daily basis.  And it's where I publish first.  But anyway, my point was, is that on Facebook, I mean, I really wouldn't mind having a Tinder like experience.  If you'll pardon the analogy in that you can you're just looking at stuff and you're just swiping through like, no, not interested, not interested, not interested.  Oh, that's interesting.  And if I could have that type because half of the stuff as I scroll down through there, it's like, sorry, I just don't I don't I'm not interested in that.  I don't really care about that particular update.  But if I could just go, oh, that's the one I really want to drill down on.  That would be actually it would get me more engaged in Facebook.  That's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and I mean, is that part of Facebook's instant articles?  I mean, isn't that a chunk of what they're doing?  They're certainly offering these things up fast.  But you're talking about just like the action of swiping through them piece by piece by piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the action and the quickness of it.  I mean, I know a lot of stuff is preloaded already in Facebook.  So it's already there.  But yeah, the interface itself, as well as just having it load, you know, instantaneously at a nice, you know, and maybe some of the the.  Acceleration that caching that Google is doing, it seems like it would it would help there as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let's see here.  I'm not sure how much more I have on AMP other than I like it.  Oh, that's plenty. We've got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're just used to having a full hour.  I know of a fifth.  Leo inserted here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. Exactly.  So we've trimmed it out down a little bit so we can make room for drones, delivery drones.  I think this is pretty cool.  So last week we heard that Amazon was going to be taking its drone party to the UK where they were going overseas, where they were going to allow Amazon to test their delivery drones.  And the White House is basically now working with Alphabet on its project wing drone delivery project.  It's testing it here in the U.S.  It's part of a thirty five million dollar National Science Foundation grant.  Google has plans.  At least last year had said that it had plans for drone deliveries by 2017.  So by next year, Amazon's also targeting twenty seventeen.  And I don't know, this is kind of laying the groundwork, at least bringing some of that testing on to U.S.  soil so that the U.S.  isn't, I guess, left behind in this pursuit of delivery drones.  What do you guys think?  Is this something you're you're looking forward to?  What are the implications here?  Dr. Gadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  OK, I was waiting by us hoping I could go first.  I think it's great.  I think it's interesting that the government's getting involved.  I think there was a lot of negative feeling from companies and individuals when they came out with the fact that you have to register now to fly a drone.  And they've I think a lot of people felt like the government's cracking down on drones, not only for personal use, but for business as well.  And isn't it awful?  And since then, they've kind of they've kind of shifted a little bit, realizing that this is a technology that's going to happen and it has tremendous implications.  And yes, there needs to be some protections for things like airports and military and what.  But but but the implications of the technology are far outweigh any sort of, hey, let's you know, let's prevent people from using it because there's going to be not just delivery, but all sorts of commercial uses that are already going on today.  So I think it's really interesting.  The most interesting thing here was that I thought was that the it was a government.  It's the National Science Foundation.  I guess it's still part of the government, but they're actually doing some testing in unmanned flight research.  So we can prove the point here a little bit to say whether it's actually going to work or how safe it is or what issues there are to overcome when we start talking about this, because I think it is going to happen.  It's just a matter of time.  Are you what about you guys?  You guys looking forward to the day like I am when that you hear the drone come to your front door and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, here's that thing you ordered on Amazon.  I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think certainly for the first, the first I think we need some killer cases to break the ice and the fear and the techno panic on this.  Right.  And so what I see is deliveries to emergencies, medical supplies, blood, that kind of stuff.  That's God's work.  And it's not going to get in conflict with jets flying above.  It's going to be low enough altitude.  Things are going to happen.  I think that's going to be critically important.  So to me, I would push those kinds of humanitarian efforts to get people used to the idea of it.  And then commercial efforts follow.  And I have to believe that if we do this right and regulate it properly, it needs regulation.  No question about it.  It's aviation space at the right drone level and knock that off.  And yes, now I'm a former member of a future of privacy group, former just because I lost interest.  I read my book, but I still get their newsletters.  And there was there was just recently a huge seminar about drones and privacy because you can panic about privacy about everything.  So, of course, yes, the drone is going to come over your backyard and see that you have weeds.  Fine.  Fine.  But when we get past that kind of techno panic stuff, clearly there's tremendous use, clearly a tremendous benefit.  Now, what's interesting to me is that if this really does start taking off, especially in the suburbs and city, it's going to be difficult.  Yeah. But in the suburbs, Amazon is going to start killing off more stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm. Yeah.  Well, I mean, and certainly the amount of people that that's required to, you know, like doubling their their their workforce for things like fulfillment and everything and delivery and all that kind of stuff.  Well, I guess deliveries more more in the hands of like UPS and FedEx and whatever.  But I'm imagining that a drone workforce is going to cut down on their need for for for labor and stuff, at least to some degree.  But yeah, like right.  Sorry. Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just going to say it certainly could impact UPS and the mail service, which has benefited greatly from Amazon's delivery.  And so they've got to be worried about this.  But but probably not entirely.  I mean, you can't you can't lift everything with the drone.  They're not going to make drones big enough to lift, you know, a 60 inch TV screen and deliver it at your stores at your door.  So there's going to have to be delivery drivers anyway.  But you would almost think, you know, all the tiny little packages that you get either in the bubble wrap packaging and all that kind of stuff, whatever it is.  I mean, they're so they must just be monotonous at this point.  But, you know, I wonder if it'll lead to cheaper, cheaper delivery or at least cheaper cost for Amazon to be able to deliver that way as well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right now, the FAA requires line of sight for drones and it also prohibits flying over people.  So these are things that are going to have to be overcome in order for this framework to be figured out.  They're targeting 2017 as the as the time the year that this is going to be figured out.  So next year. But I guess that remains to be seen.  I'm open to it. I'm certainly not concerned.  You know, I'm open to it as long as I'm expecting it.  You know what I mean?  I'm cool with the drone landing in my backyard.  If I if I said, hey, drone delivery, me this thing, that sounds great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't see why not. I think burrito drones, burrito drones is going to do it.  That's the killer wrap. Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All of the burrito places are going to employ their own drones for delivery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Chipotle is finally going to overcome their PR problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have a story in the rundown.  In the rundown, I think I think I put it under under numbers.  That's fine. The guy ate burrito every day, ate Chipotle every single day.  And boy, is he cut. This isn't like Jason.  Yes, subway guy. We know where that story is.  So this guy is eating Chipotle every single day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how long has he been eating Chipotle?  I think. Yeah, go for it.  I was just going to say you eat any you eat any.  OK, so for every day for a year, man, that's got to get old.  I mean, Chipotle, sure. I'm sure it's it's good.  I've had Chipotle a couple of times. I know you guys have a thing on this show for Chipotle.  I've had it a couple of times. It's all right. It's good.  I'm not rushing out to Chipotle anytime soon again, but it was OK.  But any time you eat the same thing every single day for an entire year, man, that's got to get old.  But is this just to prove that you can and still be totally cut?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I guess he's doing it as a diet discipline.  OK, there's no different from the ill fated.  Well, or or infamous Jason with subway.  Right. You know, it limited your your panoply of food.  Got it. Maybe being bored with your food is not a bad thing.  That's true. Yeah, that's not to mention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, he didn't get he didn't get to look like that just by eating.  There's more to it.  People, you know, you don't go from A to Z just by going to Chipotle.  You get a lot of workout to do to get to look like that.  I don't know. You know, with enough exercise, you can probably eat just about anything you want.  And in fact, you know, people that do the bodybuilding stuff, I mean, they actually have to bulk up in order to to get the muscle on.  So, you know, yeah, I think I think the exercise probably goes a little bit further than your choice of which fast food place to eat at.  But yeah, what do I know? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Down if you scroll down on that article, you you get a an Instagram post, which which is basically the before and the after.  Keep going down a little bit further and you'll you'll see the other ago.  Now you've got the before and the after.  So you too could go from this to this by just eating Chipotle and nothing else whatsoever.  Don't do anything else.  That's all you got to do. I'm not over promising.  Right. All you have to do is eat Chipotle burritos for a year and you too will look like that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, I just want to put up with they don't have them here, I don't think, in California.  But just put a plug in for Mo's Southwestern Grill.  For those of you that have them or I like them a lot better than Chipotle.  But that's just me.  OK, OK.  They had them in when I lived in Ohio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. When I walk in there, they always scream, welcome to Mo's.  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're like, quit yelling at me.  I like their food better. They would let me mix it up more than Chipotle would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, the Mo's stuff doesn't feel quite as fresh and umphy.  But I do like that they have queso. Love queso.  Yes, exactly.  That makes me happy.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It makes everybody happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jason is stuck in a burrito sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pretty much. I'm trying to think of technology and I can't because I'm just thinking of like guacamole right now.  This is what you get.  What is going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For those of us that haven't had lunch yet, I mean, I don't know if you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. I ate lunch. I actually ate Mexican for lunch. So some Mexican food, some tacos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I had lunch. So this is great conversation for me.  Like, what? Android? What? Can you eat it? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you can eat a nougat. By the way, have you guys eaten nougat?  I mean, have you like actually gone out and got like a box of nougat and tried it anytime recently?  I feel like nougat's like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. And I was appalled that poor Mike Elgin, when he was on the show two weeks ago from France, for the joke, he had to slice off a piece of nougat and it was $40.  What?  Whoa.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No way. Who knew that nougat was that expensive?  I know.  Wow. Was it good? Like, did he say it was...  He said it was good, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Nougat's...  It seems like a fruit cake.  Isn't nougat in Milky Way?  I thought...  Nougat's in Snickers.  Snickers, that's right.  Yeah, it's in Snickers. It's the really kind of chewy stuff layered in Snickers. Yeah, nougat seems like good in things, but by itself, I don't know, we got a box of nougat for all of that Android when we knew the name.  And I don't know, it's very underwhelming. Of all the desserts that we've had as Android, or treats that we've had as Android names, it's probably my least favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, it is in Milky Way. Milky Way is a bar made of chocolate malt nougat topped with caramel and covered with milk chocolate.  I'll see, but I like Milky Way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a corporate redefinition of nougat. I suspect the French would say that's the calling.  It's not the actual...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, not quite the same. Yeah, Toblerone is also a nougat-y treat.  Oh, that's interesting.  Supposedly. Yeah, supposedly.  Okay. Yeah, anyways. Should we be worried that Comcast is asking the FCC to loosen restrictions that would allow them to sell user browsing data to advertisers?  What do you guys think? AT&T apparently already does this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it at an individually identifiable user basis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That I did not see. I did not see whether it was specific to a user.  I mean, it would have to be... well, actually, no. It would have to be, at least if you take AT&T's example.  They did this last year. And what that allows for, you can actually pay extra to not be tracked in this way.  So it's like a feature that you have to pay extra for to not be tracked.  But what they end up doing is they sell that to advertisers who will then like mail you based on your browsing history.  You know, mail, email, just general web browsing.  So, yeah, I would have to imagine that at least to some degree this would be tied to you if it's similar to AT&T's giga power service.  But I mean, it's different, right?  Like we talk all the time about allowing companies like Google and Facebook kind of into the world because we get a product from them that may or may...  If we're okay with doing that, then hopefully we're doing that because we get something in return that's of equal value to us.  They're free services, let's say.  But when you talk about ISP, I mean, tech companies is one thing.  They have certain access. ISPs have the whole enchilada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The whole enchilada, so to speak. The whole burrito.  Yes, the whole chipotle.  Yeah, that does make one nervous. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think you should be...  I mean, they should be paying you, right?  Or something. You shouldn't have to pay to get out of it, though.  I mean, it should be free to opt out, right?  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, I can do it with Google. I can go to Google and say, don't track me.  Right. The real way to do it as an option that would end up being popular is we'll pay you if you give us this data.  We'll give you a privilege if you give us this data.  And then it's a choice, and you benefit from it, too.  And it's fully in your hands.  Then people aren't going to complain and scream privacy because it's clearly their choice and they're rewarded.  And are they rewarded sufficiently? Well, that's a marketplace.  There's a lot of efforts over the years to come up with marketplaces for your data.  It's complex because you don't really want...  Remember the early days of Facebook privacy stuff.  You have to set a whole bunch of rules in the beginning and then you get a headache.  You get a headache.  But in this case, yeah, I think they could say here's something.  So Leo and I both use the Google surveys thing, which is kind of ridiculous.  But the fascinating thing is that it'll often say to me, the survey does most often is we have a question for you based on your shopping history.  And of course, it knows exactly where I was.  And then it asked me, when were you there to clearly prove that I'm credible?  And then it wants me to just rate them.  OK, so three stars, four stars. What difference does that make for them?  I'm not sure why they're getting a lot of value out of this unless what they're really doing is paying me 10 cents to verify their GPS activity.  And if they know that I went to Walmart on Saturday, June 1, then they know when everybody went to Walmart on Saturday, June 1.  And I'm OK with it. They're paying me 10 cents for that information.  Would everybody be freaked by that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, but at least you know, at least they're asking you, do you want to take part in the survey?  And they're paying you for that information.  So, I mean, there's two points right there which are really important.  I mean, I just got this survey this morning that said we noticed you went to your bank.  Well, I didn't go to my bank. I went to a grocery store that had a bank inside of it.  And that's the kind of information that Google can't necessarily get just just by tracking your GPS because there's a bank there.  There's a grocery store there and one's inside the other one.  They don't know which one you went to.  But with the survey and me agreeing to it and then paying me for that information, then I can say, yes, I did.  I actually didn't go to the bank. I went to the grocery store.  I mean, that wasn't what the survey was about. But just as a for instance, there is just some data that you can't tell even by browsing.  I mean, there's a lot you can tell by people's browsing history.  There's a lot you can tell by people's network traffic that goes across their your ISP and the routers and all that.  Another perhaps a good reason to use a VPN, by the way.  But you can't tell everything. You're going to get a lot of false positives from that data.  And so by taking it one step further and when you do that, you do it in a more public way that says with someone's permission that says we want to collect this data and we may pay you for it.  I think that's a great way to go.  So it's been really interesting experiment to to after Jeff, you and Leo turned me on to the Google surveys thing to see what comes up and what they're pulling from my history and stuff.  It's actually very insightful. It's fascinating. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have not checked out the Google surveys thing.  Oh, you should definitely. How do you sign up for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I forget. Is it the consumer surveys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it the consumer surveys site?  No, there's probably an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just download the if there's an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is the name of the app?  And I actually can't remember. It just comes up for me occasionally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't remember either. I'm looking it up right now.  Oh, opinion rewards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.  Got it. OK, now I'm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's the deal.  I end up earning, you know, like 250 every five days or something, but I buy a TV show with it.  You feel like it's hey, Google has a currency, which is entertainment.  I get some free entertainment. Sure. I answer some questions.  That's that. Whereas United Airlines gave me a thing where you can earn miles by doing this.  Oh, all right. I'm a big United guy. I'll do that.  But it was J.D. Power and other kinds of things that we got extremely personal asking whether I had prostate cancer.  And even though I've told the world that I have, do I really want to tell them that?  And in the end, I only earned 50 miles.  So I said, no, not even a dollar amount may be equal to the two dollar show that I get.  But somehow the two dollar show felt like it was worth more than this intangible mile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  50 miles is not very much.  But, you know, that's that's going to be harder to find value in than something that you can watch right now for sure.  We're getting we're getting a little bit empty here.  But but definitely one thing I'm really excited about, I'm I'm curious what you guys think about it is Magic Leap.  So we've talked a little bit about VR today.  A new it's this ultra secretive company that basically Google and many others have invested in.  It's kind of an augmented reality product that has yet to be anything tangible.  Yet they've had millions upon millions of dollars invested into it.  I can't remember the exact amount, but it's something like seven hundred and some odd million dollars without any sort of product.  And every once in a while they release these little videos that kind of showcase what you'll be able to do in this augmented reality world.  They just released a video at a conference from a conference in China that basically shows a user measuring the space in their room and shopping for lamps in order to fill it with kind of sounds a little bit like Project Tango.  Right. Right.  We saw that at Google I.O. and actually we're at Google I.O.  They were showing off Project Tango on the stage and some of the things that they were doing.  And it really felt like based on what I had seen and what we'd seen from Magic Leap over the last year or so, the little bits and pieces that we have anyways, because we haven't seen very much.  They really reminded me of similar products, although what I understand about Magic Leap and from what they've kind of said in little talks and stuff, we're starting to hear more and more is that they expect it to be some sort of a low profile.  All glasses type form factor that you would potentially wear all day.  So I don't know how soon Magic Leap is coming around for everyone to check out.  Finally, I don't know when we're finally going to get any more information about this, but it sounds really fascinating.  Have you guys been following along with kind of the Magic Leap thing?  Are you interested in it?  We think.  No, I'm interested, but I haven't been following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I guess there's two parts to the two different answers to the two questions, but I am definitely interested in it.  I mean, there's also been talk about leaving Google leaving a microphone on all the time to listen to conversations and things like that.  So, you know, I think it's I think it is really interesting.  And I think it goes to what we were just talking about.  Right. You get more and more relevant things when you have more information.  And that's what this is really all about.  But, of course, again, there I'm sure there will be plenty of concerns about privacy and all that, too.  So, you know, I think this kind of with Google Glass and things like that, I think it just comes with a little caveat that says, hey, you know, just be aware there may there you may need to have some sort of a little LED light that comes on when this thing's on or some some notification that this thing is listening to you or watching what you do or whatever.  There has to be some because obviously you can't you couldn't I don't think anyway you could take that thing out and and leave it somewhere and walk away and have that be in somebody's home, let's say, and have that be legal.  Right. You could put in a public place, but not in a private setting.  So there's going to have to be something that's going to be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to be interesting. I guess there's a lot of Hollywood kind of action around this to Peter Jackson, who did the Lord of the Rings trilogy and all that.  He's seen the technology and he's like way on board with it.  Apparently Star Wars or Lucas in the in San Francisco.  Lucas is actually has a part of its campus dedicated to Magic Leap kind of test area where they're playing around with it and allowing people to kind of come in and mess around with the technology.  And also you were just showing Carson kind of a little bit of video shot with Magic Leap that would superimpose, you know, the characters into your space and actually use a table that you happen to have in your space to project imagery onto there.  They're talking this up to the point to where they're saying that when they put fake when they put artificial people in the room with you while you're wearing the glasses, they actually have to change the the brightness of those people slightly so that when you're looking through the goggles,  you take that as a clue that that is in fact not a real person.  They say that it's that that that it's that believable that the experience is way better than what we've seen so far.  And I don't know how much of that is hyper hyperbole or not, but that's the kind of stuff that gets me very interested in it.  Yeah, kind of that elevated reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it goes back. I think that the expense of this is huge.  Yeah, trying to try to build this stuff is mightily important.  The expert I was talking today in my office said that you really need to have as he put it the picks and shovels.  You need to have the software. You need to have the ability to build your own stitchers and other things to really push this.  That means that a lot of this remains in San Francisco and L.A.  In my world, in New York and media, I think we've got to deal with the reality of what exists today.  What exists today is 360 photography and 360 video.  Yeah, that's pretty much it in terms of what is possible.  And Facebook can show both 360 photo and video without goggles.  That's going to get you to some critical mass and value.  There is applications like real estate that start to be of value.  So that's what I'm paying attention to now.  I think the far out stuff will be out there and people with a lot of money like movie producers and advertisers and brands will be playing with it.  There will be a critical mass. There will be a return on investment.  But God bless them. Play and experiment away and we'll see what falls back on us then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Kind of trickles down to everyone else eventually in lower cost hardware.  So I don't know if there's anything before we get to kind of the picks and everything.  Is there anything in here that we didn't talk about that either of you guys really want to make sure gets in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So as we got to that guy who eats Chipotle every day, that was the big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. All right. Just want to make sure we definitely talked about the guy who eats Chipotle every day.  And I agree that is very important because those abs are really impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess we should mention for the record, Uber giving up on China and merging with or handing over to D.V.  China is just impossible market and every single American company and European company that tries to go in China.  You just can't do it. Man, Uber had design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, they had big plans for dominating China and just man, after two years just did not work out for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So well, you know, so you guys you guys don't want to talk about the Pokemon Go update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, tell us what about the Pokemon Go update?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't know what it has to do with Google. I guess it sort of does.  Yeah, we've talked about a lot of things that have nothing to do with the cloud computing and all that. Right.  I mean, so there was an update that came out where they fixed a few things.  This is the first major update they've done since the app was released.  It took away footprints. That was the big deal. Right.  So you can't see how close the stuff is to you anymore.  But they did do some things to ease people's concerns or address the issue that some people had about telling you, look, don't drive.  If you're you have the app open and you're driving, it'll say, you know, don't drive and use the app at the same time.  Certain things like that. They added some security things. And so that was good.  It'll be interesting to me, at least one thing we want to do is we want to add the makerspace as a PokéStop.  You still can't do that.  So if they get that capability, I know we'll be interested because we're thinking about doing all sorts of things with 3D printed Pokemon,  maybe leaving those out where people near where the PokéStops are so that people can find a real life 3D printed Pokemon to take back with them just for fun.  Yeah. Yeah. So we'll see if that if that ever happens.  But anyway, the app was updated. A few new features, a few features they took away, which probably helps them in terms of traffic and congestion,  since they don't have to calculate all those footprints now.  I guess I guess people were theorizing that that actually was kind of a concern to have to calculate the distances where these creatures may actually be in relation to your given location.  Could have been dragging down the servers. And so that might have been why they got rid of those.  Oh, I see. Right. Actually, that's a lot of sense.  Yeah. But people were kind of upset about that. I doesn't bother me at all because I never found it a useful feature to begin with.  I couldn't figure that part of it out. So I'm sure you guys didn't find Pokemon Go a useful feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I open it every once in a while and throw a Pokeball from time to time. That's about all I do. I don't I don't go out and explore with it.  I probably should maybe a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's funny because sometimes we don't often but occasionally we'll go like to downtown San Francisco with the kids and the kids kind of don't like it because you always get stuck in traffic and they it's going to take forever and blah, blah, blah.  And now they're like, can we go to San Francisco? There's like a million Poke stocks.  So it actually is it is working in the positive sense that they actually want to get out and take a look at things.  Maybe it's not the way that we would you know, we would hopefully hope that they would engage in the culture and the diversity and all that.  They're not really there yet, but at least it's getting them out and about and looking at things that perhaps they haven't really looked at before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, better than not. I suppose.  Yeah, I still kind of my brain is programmed to where if I'm outside and I see someone looking at their phone, I still kind of automatically assume they're playing Pokemon Go.  They're probably just reading a text message. But at this point, it's like it's it's permanently altered in my brain.  All right. Hey, let's do some picks and we'll start with Aaron.  I'm sure you've got a project of some sort. That's kind of what you do with the makerspace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do. I do. But you're it's actually an app today.  OK, I will show it off.  It relates to bakery things. You haven't installed already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep, I installed it. Oh, let's see where it ended up on my screen here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're fast. So let me set this up for you. So one of the things that you hear at the makerspace is we do we call it the Raspberry Pi Arduino night where you can come learn about these little computer platforms and learn how they work and things.  And one of the questions people ask most often is, OK, so I've got my Raspberry Pi onto the network and it pulled an IP address, but I have no way of knowing what that IP address is or how to actually log into it because I disconnected it from the monitor I was using in the keyboard.  And I know it's on my network somewhere, but I can't find it and log into it.  And so a lot of listeners probably already know about these utilities, but there are utilities out, especially for your mobile devices that can help you find IP addresses on your network.  One of that is is I don't know if it's pronounced thing or effing. I think we've talked about it before.  I prefer I'm good. I like better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should I? OK, first of all, before you continue on, should I be worried about showing this screen because it's showing a bunch of IP addresses?  We think not this screen. Well, no, no, no, no. Your screen. Yeah, the app on the phone. That's a good question. You know, we could just do with the. All right. Let's stick with that. I don't want to. I don't want to make a horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't want to do that. So anyway, but it will show you the IP addresses on your on the network that you're connected to, and it'll even show you some things like, hey, this device has multiple IP addresses associated with it.  So in some cases, your Raspberry Pi, for example, might be hidden behind, might have a couple IP addresses.  One of them you can actually communicate with the other one you can't.  So you can click there and see what the other IP addresses and communicate with it that way.  And when it pops up on your network, it usually says the host name of the computer, which in this case would be Raspberry Pi.  So for people that are getting into Raspberry Pi or just starting out and they need a way to find the Raspberry Pi on their network, this is a great way to do it.  Not only that, but this is just a really cool app to have anyway to be able to take a look and see if there are other computers or devices on your network that you may not be aware of.  Maybe you don't have the wherewithal to be able to log into your local router or gateway at home and find that information.  This is a great little way just to open that up and see there are other apps as well on the marketplace.  The one I use is I think called Wi-Fi Analyzer that will do this and more.  It'll also show you Wi-Fi signal strength.  So, you know, whether you should move your Wi-Fi to a different channel to be able to maybe have more room away from your neighbor's Wi-Fi, for example.  Because it's all basically broadcasting on a similar frequency.  And by moving the channel around, you can actually get a little bit better reception on your Wi-Fi at home.  So it's a little bonus there for you if you want to take a look at that.  But for finding devices on your home network that are difficult to track down, highly recommend either Wi-Fi Analyzer or a thing, as I like to call it at home.  And by the way, one other thing, since we're on my pick, the pick that I had last time I was on this week in Google,  I got a lot of tweets about people saying, how do you build it? Can I build it?  It was a little box, had a little keypad that you could play a sound with.  So I actually did a full on instructable with a video.  So for those of you that were asking me where they can find more information on how to build it, where to order the parts, all of that stuff, please go check out the instructable.  It has all the answers there that you'll ever want in terms of how to build that simple little box.  Or if you're just looking to get into Arduino and you're looking for a project to start with, this is a really good one because it teaches you about how to interface with devices,  how to play a sound or two. It's nothing that's going to be too difficult for a novice user. So go check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice. Only cost $12 for all the parts to put together too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. A $12 secret code box, I think I called it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very cool. Find that on instructables.com.  Jeff, you have a lot of numbers in here. What's the number you want to go with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it could be how Google asks for what you make in your previous job, but they don't really use it in determining your pay because they only use it for data.  So to find out what everybody else is paying, but they pay based on the job, not the person.  So I found that interesting. I found it interesting that Nielsen is going to measure the TV chatter on Facebook, which is another way to look at the real ratings.  But I think I'll go with this one because I found it moderately interesting. Who was it who did this?  Center for Responsive Politics looked up the campaign contributions for employees of Facebook and Twitter.  And two Facebook employees and one Twitter employee gave to the Trump campaign, as opposed to 349, I think the number was, who gave to Clinton, the two companies together.  So I found that illuminating. I'll just leave it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. That's a there's a wide gulf. I don't know how much more I'm willing to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Trump's campaign while we were on the air, I insist that they basically close the fundraising gap with Clinton this month based on small contributions.  So those small contributions are not coming. It would appear from Twitter and Facebook employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One thing that I will say is I saw an update on Twitter last night that made me laugh out loud and it said something to the tune of the 2016 political race is as if Michael Bay is directing it.  And it really, it really does feel that way.  I saw a crazy political race.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Two great New York Times tweets. One said that that that with all the things going on with Trump, just one day, it's a journalism school test as to what's the lead.  Yeah, right.  Because the other one was after Trump says said this week that the New York Times doesn't write good.  A New York Times scribe tweeted me write good soon.  OK, I'll leave it there so I don't get you in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'm guessing anytime we we we talk about politics, we probably get at least an email or two.  So I'm expecting that that's OK.  That's just part of the job.  Excellent. So there is that I have an app that actually Google just released this morning that I thought was kind of cool.  It's kind of an educational style app that uses Google Maps and the 3D imagery associated with Google Maps that they've curated over the years.  It's called Vern the Himalayas.  And basically what this is, they've taken their map data about the Himalayas and they've laid it out in a three dimensional sort of way.  I actually have it on my device right here.  I don't know if you have I'm sure there's some sound effects.  I didn't check it out if there's sound effects this morning.  But basically, what is it?  Oh, it must be nighttime in the Himalayas.  That's why it's so dark.  But you've got a little kind of like heat map up here of different points of interest that surround you.  And you can you're this guy.  I think he in scale you your name is Vern.  And in scale, you're about 500 feet tall compared to everything that surrounds you.  And, you know, you're basically maneuvering through the Himalayas.  And every once in a while, you'll come across different things.  I've found a glider like a glider so I can fly around through the mountains trying to see if I can find any sort of informational point.  As you go along, let's see here, you can you can kind of scroll around.  You see these little informational points that when you walk up to them, you can, you know, do you hear the audio?  I don't know if there's any audio coming through there.  And I just turned it off.  That was my accident.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do not hear the audio, but maybe that's just me.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't know why it's not playing.  But basically, there's like an instructor guy that kind of comes on and tells you about some of the places that you're seeing, having a hard time finding any of these points so that I can show you kind of the interactive elements.  But you start to kind of come across different things that aren't just mountains, but different points, you know, places that exploration has taken place.  There's a jet pack that you can find through somewhere, which I'm having a hard time finding.  Oh, here's something.  OK, I got a little jolt.  So now I've got oh, now I can.  Oh, nice.  I can sled through.  That's cool.  So you find these little things and you just kind of get to explore the Himalayas as this little robot guy and learn something new about it as targeted for kids.  Of course, it was an idea that I guess some kids had and Google just decided to kind of create an app about it and take their maps and really kind of bring it to life a little bit so that you can explore a world that maybe you've never been to.  Probably most of us have never traveled through the Himalayas and definitely not as a 500 foot tall robot.  And you can kind of explore the landscape, learn something about kind of the other explorations that have happened, different key points about the region and everything.  I don't know.  I've wondered, you know, because Google has all these 3D maps of the world about taking these maps and making them playable.  Because we're always used to game designers spending so much time working on levels and level design and everything.  It's like we've got the world is our level design when you're talking about these types of apps.  And this is kind of an example about that.  But it's pretty cool.  What is that sound?  Sorry, that's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's there's makers in here.  OK, it confused me because I was like, do you hear that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then that started going.  I was like, wow, that does that part of the app?  That's really confusing.  I was on mute for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that reminds me, I wonder if they're feeling I wonder if this is a response or maybe they're feeling a little bit guilty about letting Niantic Labs go now that, you know, they've done the Pokemon Go thing.  They're like, we got to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are we going to do?  What do we have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've got Vern.  OK, yeah, let's do Vern then.  Yeah, not quite Pokemon, but that's cool, though.  I like that.  Yeah, it's a neat little way to kind of explore.  And, you know, obviously a little hard for me to find points right away.  The Himalayas, it's a pretty big space.  So, you know, it takes a while to explore in order to find the things.  But you find these flags and everything and you can read all about it and it'll tell you kind of the story of these different areas.  So very cool.  It's called Vern, the Himalayas for Android.  You can go and install it.  It's free and check it out for yourself.  I want to get the jetpack because that's that's when it looks like you can you can have a lot of fun.  You guys, thanks so much for for tuning in for this week in Google.  And thanks to both of you for taking it easy on me.  I always enjoy coming out of the this week in Google, especially with you guys, because you guys are a lot of fun to do a show with.  Aaron Newcomb, tell us a little bit about what you want people to know about the work you're doing and where they can follow you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure. Well, you can always follow me online.  Like I said, I'm still on Google+.  But Facebook works and Twitter works.  I'm Aaron Newcomb on both of those, of course.  I will be on the new screen there is this Saturday.  So you can definitely check me out there live.  What is it?  Three p.m. on Saturday or three p.m. Pacific.  Three p.m. Pacific. Thank you very much.  And I'm going to have a little surprise.  I'm bringing a project.  I posted a picture of it up on Google+.  So if you want to get a teaser about what my project could be that I'm bringing to talk about, you can take a look at Google+.  And figure out if you can if you can guess what it is.  Oh, there it is there.  Yeah.  What is it?  What could it be?  You'll find out.  Couldn't be flight simulator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not what that says.  It's not flight simulator.  No, it's not.

Transcript:  We will find ways to ruin your life.  Excellent. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You haven't made a sacrifice for the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like that's kind of required at this point.  Jeff, tell people what you want them to know about everything you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so I had an interesting conversation today on dot NYC, which is the show we're still trying to figure out.  That's where we're kind of not doing on the network yet until we get it ready and worthy.  But very shortly on YouTube, if you look for dot NYC show and soon on Facebook, I did an hour long discussion today with Jim Rutenberg,  who is the new media columnist, David Carr's replacement in the New York Times and my friend, very smart journalism thinker, Jay Rosen.  And it ended up being a full hour on Trump because it's such a fascinating phenomenon right now with news coverage and political coverage.  And so I had a lot of fun this morning.  This is my second podcast today, which is nothing compared to you, sir.  But for me, it's a big deal.  So dot NYC show and it'll be up very shortly in both places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excellent. Definitely check that out.  I find it on YouTube to kind of get the inside scoop on dot NYC.  Thanks again, Jeff. Thank you.  And yeah, you can find me at about dot me slash Jason Howell.  I do tech news today here every single day with Megan Moroney.  I also do all about Android and Android app arena for the Android type stuff.  It's probably why we're a little Android heavy at the beginning of today's show.  Apologies on that for people who watch all of the shows.  But there you go.  But thanks for always making it fun and easy for me to come on Twig.  It's always an enjoyable time for me.  Twig is every Wednesday, one thirty p.m. Pacific, four thirty p.m. Eastern.  Is it twenty thirty UTC?  I think I could be wrong on that.  But listen to Leo next week and he'll probably correct me.  You can join us live at Twitter TV slash live.  You can find the show on demand.  And always the home on the Web here is Twitter TV slash Twig.  And all our episodes are there.  All the subscribe information that you need can be found on the page.  So we make it really easy for you to subscribe to this week in Google.  But that's it for this week.
