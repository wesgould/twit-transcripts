Transcript:  This is twig this week in Google episode 501 recorded Wednesday March 27th 2019  I didn't say it Oprah did  This week in Google is brought to you by  Capterra find the right tools to make an informed software decision for your business visit cap  Tara's free website at cap terra.com  slash twig  It's time for twig this week in Google the show where we talk about the latest news from the Google verse  which these days is includes Facebook and  Twitter and  every journalism  Matthew Ingram's here back from Italy or are you about to go to Italy just about to go. I'm so jealous  This is the big news event every year in  Where is it Perugia Perugia, that's right. Mm-hmm and  Jeff's going to I think so that'll be fun. Jeff isn't here today.

It says they make excellent circus dogs  And I should have read between the lines  What that what that meant now your norm is very calm, but our our Bijon was not  When the camera is on norm is very calm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Normally a couple times a day. He'll just go wild and run around the house and yeah  Like a madman like like a cheetah really fast and then loved our Bijon. He was great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he but the kids were little too sometimes. Yeah, right. I remember I remember fun. I worked with you. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  Oh there goes Matthew again, give him a bone give him a bone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I forgot leo. I meant to have my lower third updated

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not about chromebooks.com anymore. No, it is it is i'm on temporary assignment as a former tv guide critic this week  Mocking poor jeff jarvis's lower third on msnbc the last time he was on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of all the things you could say about jeff jarvis four times  Of all the things you could say about jeff jarvis former tv guide critic is absolutely the most demeaning nothing lower  Nothing lower. Holy cow  So I think there's a very big story a brewing it it isn't imminent but it is a brewing  the european parliament yesterday passed  The new copyright bill and that means they passed articles 11 and 13 unchanged  And this is a big freaking deal  Uh now it's not law because each country  Has to then endorse it and they can change it. Uh, it's very likely that we'll see france endorse at first  Since really it was france that pushed  this new  copyright law

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, and just to confuse everything they've changed article 13. It's article 17. Yeah. Oh that that's oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, never mind. No problem  This despite millions of petition signatures phone calls letters  complaints from the big  internet companies and regular internet users  What is  So first of all, this is a a general copyright bill. It's called copyright in the digital single market directive  Whatever that is  And it's not a directive. It's a directive not a law  So because it's a directive, uh, the eu nations now have two years  To do something called transpose it which is make it their own law  Written into their law and possibly modified for that country. So countries have until 2021  Now france will almost certainly  Uh jump on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that's actually part of the problem is that we don't know  How lots of these countries are going to interpret?  this somewhat vague  Descriptions of the things that the eu agreed to and so you could actually wind up with this incredibly sort of balkanized process where  If you do something in, you know, denmark, it's okay. But if you  Do exactly the same thing in france. It's not okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which one of you would like to why don't you take this matthew tell us  What uh articles 11 and now 17?  Say and what the what it means

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So 11 without going into too much detail 11 is about um  Upload filters i'm pretty sure I have that right. Uh, so  Is the link so is 11 the link tax? Okay  so 11  is  broadly speaking, uh, uh gives  Content owners the right to charge  aggregators for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Excerpts of their content. So this is aimed at google because google it's it's the snippet text google puts a little snippet snippet  It's search results google news has larger chunks  Google's already said if this is the law of the land in europe, then we will no longer be able to do google news  they even showed a little extremely a  Picture of what search results would look like in europe after this but what we wouldn't see anymore is is snippets  Uh, this is by the way, not something  This is something that's been tried spain did it and germany did it both with very little success

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And google pulled out of spain completely. Yeah, there's no spanish google news, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's 11 that's the same text. Yeah, and one of the things that's vague about it is it says  That you can charge by the way that google says this is what the internet is going to look like no excerpts  It looks like the page failed to load. Yeah  Which was obviously partly a pr effort that look how terrible completely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you did search for a story you would just get daily star in a link and you wouldn't know anything about the headline  Or anything because those are all snippets

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  one of the things that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You may not know i'm just curious what is this done in spain for example to those publishers and their traffic killed traffic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it has reduced traffic, but not by as much as you really think. Oh, yeah  So it has definitely. Um, I think the last estimate I saw there was a study done  Um, it was in in the neighborhood of 15 to 20 percent, which is still serious  I mean, yeah, it's not  but it's still  It's not significantly, you know change those businesses and germany I think when they uh axel springer  Removed itself effectively from google news, and I think it said that it saw traffic declines of like 60 percent  so  The part one of the things that makes this this particular article difficult is it just says  that publishers content owners can charge  uh for  Excerpts that aggregators like google are allowed to use short  Excerpts, it doesn't say how short oh, it doesn't say a number of words  It doesn't so this is all going to be open to interpretation. Is it 10 words? Is it 100 words?  800 words

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well in the worst it might be different in each country

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. Uh, so then the second one 13 which is now 17  Is the effectively makes  any  Tech platform like google or facebook or twitter  Uh responsible for the content that gets uploaded and it is those companies are required to remove  Copyrighted content before it gets uploaded to prevent it that's being uploaded to me much more significant

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's potentially yeah, the ramifications are huge  So now for instance when we upload something to youtube that has  Material in it that a copyright holder disputes. There's a takedown process using the digital money and copyright act  But there's also a defense for us the fair use defense that were a news organization apple for instance took down  the youtube video  Of our coverage of apple's event on monday. They also did a takedown  On ios today, which we showed a small little snippet of one of the movie clips or something like less than a minute  In both cases, we'll dispute it and say no. No, it's fair use. This is commentary on a news story  We're a news organization and youtube will say oh, yeah, never mind and bring it back up after some period of time  And so there's a week or two that you're down that you lose that revenue  um  That's the process today  Right under article 30 under article. Yeah section 230 allows fair use

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it also protects the platforms from any liability. That's important

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, they get a safe harbor exemption there. They can't be they can't be punished

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, and all they have to do is sort of make a good faith  Attempt to take content down when someone complains so the the eu  Directive would completely reverse that so there is no protection  A for anything that's uploaded no fair use exemption  The onus is on the companies to prevent it  Sort of prior restraint if you want to think of it that way to to stop stuff from being uploaded  So the risk is they'll just stop  Everything right or at least huge quantities of stuff that arguably is  You know fair use or fair dealing as it's called in the uk and australia and canada

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think google's moving closer to this anyway with youtube because I our takedowns happen much faster  And i'm guessing that they're tuning up content id to do it on submission  As opposed to on posting right that as soon as you submit something content, they'll have to with this article 17  The only way to do it. Yeah  Uh, which means our stuff will get turned down before it is even uh aired

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They actually uh, it would not surprise me if you're right leo just I missed your episode on on the stadia news last week  But if you recall  Using the google assistant button on that when you're playing a streaming game on google on stadia  It knows where you are and brings up a youtube video at that specific spot in the game if you need help  So they're already the technology is in some ways already there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm sure google's been thinking about this and planning for it that they seemed inevitable and they had it  You know an experience of it, uh the snippet tax in germany and spain  That's that light shung jeet trek that that javascript

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's also been a huge amount of pressure on them  to in both germany and france to remove hate speech and of and  Basically illegal speech right so they've been gearing up to do that because there are massive fines involved  if they don't take down  sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speech that breaches the rules within 24 hours i'm concerned and I mean obviously there's lots of concern about this article new article  17 slash 13  uh, but I I feel like uh something like what we do which is commentary on news  And almost always the commentary on news is on somebody else's copyright story  Would be jeopardized by something like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the eu has said that they there were a number of  Complaints obviously one being the upload filter was going to stop lots of stuff that was not copyright infringement  That it would stop people from say uploading memes  and so on that use copyrighted content, but  As a as a form of commentary so the eu has said  That's not the case. That's not what we want to do  Gifts will be in memes will be protected  Journalistic and academic I gotta point out they're not protected  Well, and they're not the ones who are going to be implementing it. They're just saying this is our principle

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't want to punish memes exactly, but it's not if you don't want to punish memes you put it in the law  Otherwise, it's the interpretation of the countries in the courts, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the risk is that each of these countries are going to interpret it  You know in some cases in the most draconian way possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  So so is this really all about revenues for these?  Publications, I guess I should say i'm trying to look at it from my perspective as a publisher  All three of us on the show are publishers. Obviously, uh, I don't have like a you know subscription fees and things like that  I have my commentary out for free on the web, you know, it's ad supported obviously, but  i'm trying to figure out  I I get the I don't think they even mention commercial versus non-commercial  Yeah, see that's an interesting aspect to me because I understand a  Publication that wants to you know preserve its revenues and so on but we know that's been declining for years  and i'm just this nobody sitting in my you know house with my dog blogging and  I actually like having new snippets in google news. It brings me traffic obviously, so  I'm just trying to figure out where I fit in and how this all is going to work

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think I mean obviously this goes back  Decades or a decade in some cases the the feeling on the part of european  Publishers that google in particular has been stealing content from them stealing revenue from them  They've been putting pressure on the company, you know for god knows how long and it's led  Effectively to these kinds of restrictions. I'm not convinced  That the that they're even going to help that they're even going to sort of accomplish  What these publishers and copyright holders theoretically want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So  We'll uh, we'll just watch with interest. I mean, I don't know there there's both  There's hope in one respect because there's still time to lobby individual countries  Although there was a lot of lobbying over the weekend 200 000 people  Took to the streets across europe. There are five million signatures on a petition  uh, and the parliament quickly passed the resolution  the directive, uh anyway, so I I don't know what kind of hope we're gonna have but  uh, I I think it's as i've said before it's up to our listeners in the eu to  to try to moderate this in their individual countries because  There's nothing I could do about it from here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just to make it even worse. I saw  A piece I think in the guardian that said some of these eu members  voted  Wrongly voted incorrectly because they didn't understand what they voted  No, they voted for the wrong article because of the way it was structured  So some of those votes might actually not have been  They could theoretically have been against those articles  And one estimate I saw said that if they had voted the other way  They wouldn't have passed  So there's a there's a voting issue there as well unless you think this doesn't really matter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  uh, I think  I mean, this is an interpretation, but I think what we're actually seeing  is  The old incumbent media chiefly in germany actual springer the the printed newspapers and magazines  Who are terrified of the new media and internet doing everything they can to  Disable or hobble the internet and there's good reason to do it. We just got uh  information on um mobile viewing in the united states  40 percent of mobile web traffic is youtube 40 percent  And this and this is a significant jump in the time spent  From 29 to 34 percent at the expense by the way of television  And so this is exactly what's happened to all sorts of incumbents bookstores  grocery stores  When's the last time you went to a video rental?  Store this, you know, this is what's been happening. Thanks to the internet and now it's publishers turn and uh, they're very scared  And uh and television and and newspapers and magazines. It's it's uh, it's a changing environment

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the funny thing is they've actually had the longest amount of time to actually deal with the change because  The web was all text in the beginning, you know, yeah, so  And they're coming now with  Regulation or directives and all and I get it. I I I do it's just where have you been for 25 30 years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think a lot of the a lot of those sort of  the reaction to  google and to the internet and even to facebook is  Is an attempt to blame them for problems that have actually been going on for decades  I mean readership of newspapers started declining long before the internet came along because people had tv and radio  So it's not as though  Google and facebook suddenly caused this sharp decline. They just caused the already existing decline

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To speed up a little bit. Here's a this is a great from nielsen  A great graph  This is uh 18 to 34 here  The blue is tv and that includes dvr  from uh year over year from 27 to 22  And then the uh orange is watching the internet on a computer that's gone from 29 to 34 big growth  In the most important demographic from that point of view of advertisers, but also the point of view of the future  Uh, you know if you go to adult 65 plus these oldsters are still watching tv  Um a lot of it 60 percent, but there's even a drop I have to point out there's even a drop there  uh, so  You know the others are uh tv connected devices like game consoles or rokus. That's green  Watching on an app is red. That's a small that's interesting app or web watching on a smartphone is a small  uh, and then uh, i'm sorry red is tablet and then uh,  Orange is a app or web on a smartphone. Oh the light orange is soaking never mind forget  Thank god, there's an eraser on this thing just forget I even tried to make any sense of that at all  But you can see there's a definite trend to increase time spent on mobile  And not a surprise frankly not a surprise at all, uh, let's see what else um  Um tuesday it's the end of the line for alo google plus inbox  Uh, am I leaving anything out probably? Oh goo.goo their url shortener  The google graveyard if you go to killed by google.com. I think we did we show this last week  Or no, I just I just bookmarked this. These are all the things  In in chronological order killed by google  And it's kind of a long scroll  Kind of goes a long way. There's google now  Remember that  There's google code. There's picasso. Oh, I remember that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some of those things have evolved into other things though. I mean google now is still part of your google feed  Is it?  Yes, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that google now? What is that?  Yeah, google reader. Yeah sort of I don't know  No  Sparrow  They bought it then killed it  Panoramio panoramio that was cool google wave. Don't tell genotropany. It's gone  Remember songza. That was cool songza google flu vaccine finder. Remember we talked a lot about how you could  See how the flu vaccine was working all over. Why do they even?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Why

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why why google why why this is a great site I read I don't know anything about this but I  I was reading some commentary by someone about the very first one on the list google fusion tables  And they were saying that this was a hugely  You know valuable thing to have and lots of people used it and in fact built  Services around it and then and then just poof this is on it to be honest

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why  My wife when we talked about google stadia  She said don't tell me about any more google stuff. They're not I don't want to get involved. They're just going to break my heart. I  Forget it  And I think that that's a genuine problem for google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is they don't especially yeah people don't trust them like developers  You you're not going to build anything into those and they're on those services

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was the whole pitch of stadia was at game at the game developers conference. Come on. We need some games, right?  We got no games, please write some games would you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean you wake up one morning and what sorry never mind we changed our minds

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're not doing that anymore. That's as bad as writing a game to run on facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's it's also bleeding into their hardware a little bit in my opinion and that's even worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you are on a pixel book right or you were you love that pixel book pixel slate right now. You're on a slate  I love pixel book  But they didn't announce a new pixel book this year. They announced instead a fakatka tablet you like the tablet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it. Okay for cock, but i'm a different user  You're different. All right  No, you're different. All right  I evaluate it and I and I recommend this to all the folks I write to or write about you know about chromebooks  You need to think about what your your own use case is and for me  50 percent of the time i'm using a device to watch tv on youtube tv or  Hulu or netflix and so on and I prefer a tablet the other 50 percent of the time  I am writing coding and so on but I don't need you know, a 14 hour typing device  So this is perfect for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think one thing google did that's a little  Difficult is that they have five models ranging in price from 600 to 1600  and  A normal person going to buy this is not going to know what's the difference between  This and that I don't even understand  That's why I write articles about those. Thank goodness. There's about chromebooks.com and there's no link tax  Why why uh what?  At this point you can't get the uh, the two bottom of the line

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The celeron no and they never had them  They did people have to pre-order them so they never once the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you didn't pre-order the day they announced it you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so marquez brownlee  He pre-ordered one and got one and I think that was the beginning of the end for the cellar  Man, that guy's got I think that's a fair assessment. I don't know that for a fact because he panned it, right?  He panned it. Um, wow for some good reasons. No question  I I do question google's judgment in trying to bring a 3000 by 2000 display to a celeron processor

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh with four gig of ram and uh, did he say it wasn't fast enough? What did he say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The biggest well, he said a lot of things I the  Some I agree with some I don't the one I agree with and that most people took away from was very valid and that is the  Uh animations when you're switching  Apps like when you go into like the overview mode like on an ipad when you see all your apps running  That's the butter smooth, right?  When you do that on a pixel slate or the one that he was using it was janky frame rate drops stuttery  And I get it and in chrome was 73 we may talk about that a little later in the show that just came out  That is supposed to address some of the issues does that mean that celeron will be back?  I don't know. I really don't know but I question their judgment of even bringing that device out and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it is what it does. I know i know marcus has a lot of you know, his  million of millions of subscribers on youtube and is  Widely revered among geeks  But honestly, I don't think he carries  Uh that much weight in the general populace would be expected to buy this  I mean, maybe he killed it. I think it's much more likely google put it out so that they could say starts at 5.99  Never intended to sell it because that's too many skews  Just from the point of view of consumer going to the store saying I don't know what to get now  They've got they should actually take it off of this  Yeah, I would I would agree. Um, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One point about marquez's reach. I mean, we know he's got the geek following  He's got out of seven eight million subscribers, however many it is and he's earned every one of them. He's awesome  The thing is leo it wasn't just the people who watched his video on youtube  It was all of the other outlets picking up on it. These people repeated it. Yeah  Exactly, so that expanded the reach  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, i'm just i just started marquez's page. I think so  Uh, this is uh his youtube page will give him a plug and increases subscribers by about five people  He's got an 8.2 million now  mkbhd on youtube  Um  Wow, I mean if he has that much power that's pretty impressive  I don't even know if in his heyday wal-mossberg could have killed a pixel book  But maybe maybe  And I think you're right. I think people listen to him influencers listen to him and then tell their friends. Oh, no, don't get that one  Right, but honestly, we're also not talking about I would guess not vast quantities. They don't sell a lot of these

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, and I think that's part of the problem with the pricing as well  Asides from numerous skews google doesn't move enough hardware to get really sweet deals on ships and so forth. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know it is what it is. Um, I would I would expect people buy samsung chromebooks or other inexpensive chromebooks  premium creases or acer aces yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing is they really they could buy lower costing ones that were not as good say as the pixel book leo  But when you bought your pixel book, what other high-end chromebooks were there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm-hmm, right. No, that's right. And I still love that pixel book. I think that's a really great device

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what that device has done has gotten asus and dell and lenovo to start selling  Five six eight one  Nine hundred one thousand dollar chromebooks now. Yeah, so you have choice now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, what's the best selling chromebook out there right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, i'm sure it's a low-cost one  Yeah, maybe you know the asus c302 flip has been around for two years  And people love it. It sells like hotcakes. I think and it just got a replacement that uh, you can now order a refresh so just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When available last week or this week rather one thing that you can get in non google hardware  I don't know. Does google sell it with an lte a radio  No, they do not. Yeah  So that's something desirable I think for a lot of people is the ability to be always online and  Samsung and others do offer chromebooks with uh lte, you know, the original did have that or I was at the launch

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember it. Yeah, and they stopped doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Great idea another thing google kill  Put that in the graveyard and smoke it  Uh, yeah, I mean i'm looking here's a chromebook  From acer an 11 inch for 200 bucks  Uh, those 11 inches typically are around 200 dollars 14 inches  HP's got one 225  And then you're right. There's like the chromebook plus which is what my daughter uses in college. That's 500 bucks  from samsung  Uh, and I think is a really nice piece of hardware and of course you get aluminum body  That's one thing one thing. It's really not one of those choice is really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exploded a chromebook for our youngest when she went to  University actually we might have bought it when she was still in high school and I still have it and use it  As a sort of you know, it's it's on the kitchen counter and I use it for this and that  It's not like a main work computer, but it's still it still works. Yeah. Yeah, it's not the fastest

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you recommend? Uh, uh kevin. I mean, what do you you you recommend a slate to people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tell them that if they're going to  Use it more as a laptop to get a pixel book or an acer chromebook spin 13  Yes, I think that's a nice choice. Yeah, I mean I I listen what I use is not best for everybody I  state that repeatedly so  Depends on what you need it to do, you know the $200 laptops leo that you just said very capable devices  They're celerons maybe four giga ramp 720p displays  But if that's all you want to check your email and browse 200 bucks well spent, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I often recommend users. I recommend it for people who want to secure banking and things like that, you know  Yeah, yeah, you can use your windows laptop, but you'll be you know for bad you want to stay secure use a chromebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, I just wish they hadn't killed stuff like inbox. I really liked inbox. I don't understand why into the line

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was great. What so what was wrong with it and unlike microsoft when google kills something  You can't use it anymore. It's dead. It's dead  Yeah, you could still use windows xp if you should have a mind  But you can't use inbox after tuesday, nope

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I mean alo, I never used alo. Did you guys use alo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well jeff and I joke about it. We messaged each other when alo launched and that's the last time we used it  I forgot it even existed so i'm not worried about although had google said this is our future going forward messaging  We want all android devices to use it. We want google phi users to use it alo is a was a great messaging tool  I it could have survived. That's just google not giving it any steam

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean messaging we've talked about  We've talked about this before  messaging is the worst example of  google at like at one point what they had like five or something and  And it wasn't clear which ones they were sort of investing in and should you be using hangouts?  Should you be using you know, it was just in multiple teams. It was just nuts. They're pushing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rcs now this rich communication system over sms  Aloe didn't do as I remember alo did not do rcs  Uh, and they want you to use  messenger which is  android messenger, which is  the messenger that comes  On your samsung phone in addition to samsung messenger  Yeah, it has pretty much the same icon the same name  Yeah, uh one's green one's blue  It's very confusing and the reason I mentioned samsung is as well as the pixel 3 has done  And there's new models apparently coming. We'll talk about that in a second  By far the biggest android  Handset out there is is samsung by a long shot number two number one phone manufacturer in the world number two is apple  uh  Or huawei depending on which way the wind's blowing  So really the experience most people have of android is on samsung  And it's extremely confusing because you get the android messenger from google plus the messenger from samsung  And then you know you can if you want download alo and  messages  hangouts

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, sure  You know internally there's just too many teams trying to do too many different things and this is just strictly pending for being on the inside  It's just a coordination effort too many competing priorities, you know different that's right. I forgot you were a contractor at google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you did you have any insight into what was going on at the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I I dog fooded alo for eight months before you even saw it. Yeah, I mean wow  Yeah, I bet you liked it  I actually did I liked it a lot. But the thing is uh  Again, just as you said too many different competing  apps that do the same thing plus with the android, you know, uh  Licensing terms a samsung or somebody can create their own  So now you've got two and three duplicates the same thing just from you know, an un-messenger app. It's yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's yeah, it's but I have to wonder like if some  Someone in google says, you know, we need we need another messaging app  Wouldn't wouldn't a bunch of people put their hands up and say well as it turns out we already have five and uh,  So, you know, maybe we don't need another one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because alo's whole claim to fame was it used google assistant  And it had the smart replies that were built in the inbox and  So it it must have been from the a the ai assistant division, right?  That was their their thing, right? Is that right kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it was a I don't think it's a secret and I don't think we got in trouble for saying it now  um just about every decision  From a product standpoint that I heard of or was involved with there not that I was making the decisions just to be clear  It was all about how do we get ai and the cloud in this product, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's pretty evident based on the products you've seen since and by the way, that's not a bad strategy  That's a very good strategy. It's a lot better than the vic and dotra era strategy. How do we get social into everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  true  Yeah, that didn't work out so well, but but what google doesn't do a great job of I don't think is  Is kind of make clear?  This is an experiment  You know and we're gonna learn stuff from it, but we're probably gonna shut it off at some point or we might  because people you know, they  Download these things and they start using them and then they become parts of their lives even google plus for that matter  And then it's just suddenly now we're not doing that. So yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we we rag on google almost every week for this their messaging strategy  only because I use hangouts  And I want it to survive for something like it. Yeah, i'd like a unified strategy that here's here's what I need  And I don't think i'm alone something that works on the desktop android messages does that sort of thumbs up something that works on ios  Hangouts does that hangouts is all three  And uh, that's pretty much it and something that'll work with my sms on my phone whether I use a pixel or a samsung  And hangouts is the closest thing they've got right now, but I don't think hangouts is going to last  I think hangouts is soon to join that great thing. What's the problem with hangouts? Yeah, I don't understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean i'm sad to see that go because that's how stacy and I communicate for our iot things and  Um, I know that hangouts meet is going to like the g suite side and I don't think that's what you're talking about  Leo, you don't want that you want to consume? No, although I was talking with lisa this morning. She says well I use hangouts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not killing it. I use it on g suite and I said yes, they are it's going to be chat for text  and then meet for  Video and audio calls  Right and will that that'll be automatically replacing hangouts or will she she'll have to download those won't she?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, I think it it would wouldn't surprise me  She gets it in a app update to hangouts if she's got a g suite side

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's almost worse because then you had hangouts there now. It's something else  Yeah, and it doesn't end the stuff by the way something else doesn't do all the things that hangouts did  And by the way, if you're a google fi  subscriber as I am  You still use hangouts

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if that's all been worked out yet. I think it's been tight  It's crazy  This is why i'm using an iphone these days. I sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I actually so the and the other problem has been the pixel 3 reliability and there's been a lot of complaints about this  I love the camera on the pixel 3 and I like a pure google experience, but once the samsung s10 plus came out  I I there's just not it's not there's no  It's not there's no competition. It's it's just a much more reliable phone not not more affordable, but  Much more reliable phone that works better. It's got better screen, etc, etc, etc  I just I don't I think google needs to figure something out. I don't know what

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I feel like the messaging the messaging stuff at least and even the social stuff it was so clearly not  Anything that core google?  Kind of cared about deeply because it didn't really involve well social did involve search and it it sort of tangentially involved search  But it always felt like these things were kind of  You know toys for for engineers to play with but not real products not things that would affect  Google deeply enough that they would sort of care about them. Yeah, so that brings us to stadia

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And um, we've met we already talked about a little bit because this was announced last week at the  Every time I go to cnet now and brave it says this site is stealing logging credentials is bad  I don't know. I can't go to cnet anymore. I guess  uh  What so uh, i'll or no that was variety. Come on brave chill out. There we go  google stadia great article by trevor trevor rubin and variety is  a net neutrality nightmare  and  It points out the real achilles heel of stadia, which is yes. Google has lots of server capacity. They're going to put  High-end graphics processors especially designed amd  gpus  In every instance so you'll have what they said that you'll have 10  teraflops was it teraflops or yeah teraflops of uh,  Processing performance compared to the three or four in a ps4 pro or an xbox 1s  And and they'll even be able to combine instances if you really need it  It'll be great for cooperative play because you and your friend can be playing sitting on the couch together  And you'll each have your own instance, even though they show up as one on the screen, etc  All sorts of really great things  Sounds wonderful except that they're completely at the mercy of the last mile  your internet service provider  And the variety article raises a really interesting point now that they don't have to pay lip service to net neutrality  Watch and see I wouldn't be surprised at all if if comcast and verizon and at&t  If I don't get something in the mail from my isp at comcast in a few months saying, you know for best  performance  Google stadia requires our special high latency connection. I mean low latency connection for a mere five dollars a month

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and it would be a perfect uh  Perfect pitch because they know that gamers are obsessed about that. Yes, i'll pay it  If i'm reading websites, I don't actually care if it loads in 11 seconds or 2.7 seconds  But your game is going to be huge, you know unplayable  Huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I I don't disagree but I I question how many true  Quote unquote gamers are even going to do this because they're going to use it. Well, it needs it needs some games

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be a place to start

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it needs games people have already invested. I mean true gamers have invested. You know, that's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thousands of dollars. That's a good point. They already have an xbox or playstation or gaming and they're planning online  And yeah, they don't care as much. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is to me this is the bigger opportunity for people who haven't spent, you know a two thousand dollars on the latest  gtx video card and  Everything else and that opens a tremendous potential opportunity for these people. Yeah, I could see the isp is jumping in here  But I I was actually happy about stadia personally. I'm like I can I can use my pixel slate for something else now. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think you're right. There's probably a fairly big chunk  of potential gamers kind of casual gamers  You know who they're never going to build their own rig. They're never going to get the latest, you know  Console, but they might be willing to use stadia

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean they're getting access to high-end hardware on the cheap and certainly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Certainly, it's the case that there are existing  streaming gaming solutions. I play g-force now on my shield  My video shield that plays quite I haven't had any problems with latency. Have you  No, it's been it's been great

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know what your isp or who it is or what your i'm on a pretty fast comcast connection, but uh  Can a gigabit phyos connections?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, that's enough out of you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would I still wouldn't be surprised even though you and I don't clearly don't need it  If we didn't get emails from verizon and comcast respectively saying  You really have to get our special new gaming connection

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To play so they're going to start the letter. Hey, that's a nice. Those are some nice games you got there  It'd be a shame if something was to happen though

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  I I think  The challenge for google is going to be they have no presence in gaming at all  Microsoft was very quick after the google announcement  I think a lot of us including me watching this thing. This this is a shot across the bow of  Microsoft and sony because both are planning similar services  Microsoft was very quick to respond last week saying  Wait, will we get to e3? We'll have some announcements for you. They have a streaming service  They're planning to launch next year  And the advantage microsoft has is that they have a lot of games. They have their own  Microsoft studio games which are very popular and they have relationships with all the big gaming companies  They already offer many of these games on the xbox  Goal, what is it the xbox plus service where you can subscribe but you still download them. They're not streaming  And sony is in the same boat nintendo's in the same boat  These companies already have relationships google's starting from scratch going to be very challenging. It's definitely an uphill battle

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a we'll have to see it all comes down to content content is king  Um, the other one that I wouldn't discount is amazon and twitch because what we didn't talk about  Last week was the youtube factor here with stadia. I think is huge  Um, and amazon could pull the same thing with twitch

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, is that a case of google doing so?  Clearly it's if some even said this is to save youtube. I think that's an overstatement  but uh  As they pointed out during the event youtube sells or down offers a lot of gaming downloads billions of people watch youtube gaming videos  Not this not the live streaming so much, but the gaming videos to learn how to play a game and so forth  Obviously, they see a threat from twitch amazon's  live streaming gaming service  They did offer some unique features in youtube. You mentioned one of them the ability to be watching a  gameplay and then pick up right where  That gameplay is right now by pushing a button and you're streaming on stadia  There's also the ability to package  a current position in a game  And offer that so somebody like ninja could say all right  This is a great chance for you to try fortnight except fortnight won't be on this but it's a great chance for you to try fortnight  Uh here here's a download you could pick up right where i've left off  That's cool  Uh, the ability to stream directly to youtube from stadia. That's cool  although  We'll see. I mean, I don't they didn't say anything about an inset of the gamer or chat room or any of the features  That makes twitch really powerful for those guys who are streaming gals and guys who are streaming  um  So but on the other hand that's that's google shoring up its own business as opposed to giving gamers what they want, right?  it's it's  Sometimes a lot of times companies do this and I always wonder when when especially silica valley when companies  Are solving their business problem ahead of solving their consumers problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See you're you're going back to the gamers. They're not solving the today's gamers problem  They are solving the non gamers problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But are the non gamers asking for those features or are those features designed for youtube to succeed against twitch?  You see what i'm saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do I I see what you're saying, but I think there's just I mean how many how many people in the u.s  Have a custom-built gaming rigor spent. No, I agree. I understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, I said that during the stadia launch. This is not for current mainstream gamers  But those features sound like they're trying to woo  Ninja away from twitch, right? If you're going to save youtube with this you got to woo the twitch guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they might as well try like if they can get a sort of broad mass of kind of either non gamers or casual gamers  And they can kind of chip away at at amazon and twitch  And why not it's a win all around and see this they've got nowhere to go but up. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's an advantage of starting at zero. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The game developers themselves. I mean at first I was like, oh they're not going to want to be on this thing  Because they got to port their games over to linux because the stadia hardware is linux yada yada  But then i'm like wait unless it's an exclusive thing they can still have their  millions and millions of sales to regular true pc gamers and add onto that through  You know the the bigger audience of non gamers that say hey I can play these awesome games, you know  And not buy two thousand dollars worth of hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and here's the funny thing because that's exactly what  apple announced on monday  Is a our apple arcade which again like stadia won't be available to the fall  We don't know how much it's going to cost. There are a lot of big question marks  And they don't have any games for it. So they're actually saying to developers  We want you to develop a game exclusively for apple arcade. You can't not only can you not sell it on android  You can't even sell it on apple people have to play it through arcade with their one price subscription  And developers now now go to work  And I think that's a tough pitch  Especially if you're a developer  That is making good money on the app store. Look how much  epic makes on  Fortnite in-game purchases, which would not be eligible for apple arcade  they make billions

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so so what are the what are the  Distribution what's the distribution deal for a game developer in apple arcade? I haven't seen that yet. Yeah, here's here's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oprah said it on stage when she was standing there  A billion pockets y'all a billion pockets. It's in a billion pockets. That's the distribution offer  I don't know how many people subscribe to apple arcade certainly not the full billion  but the fact that you're on a billion devices and available on a billion devices is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably fairly compelling and I think also apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, wait, you can't say that and oprah said it. I didn't say it oprah said it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you can't agree with oprah because  stadia, for example  Can run probably on two billion devices. That's true. It can run on all of those plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Run on every iphone and every android phone and every chromebook and even on chromecasts  Yeah, and tv's and and exactly we don't know if stadia is exclusive  We know apple's exclusive stadia may not be exclusive  Why would I don't think they need to make it exclusive the pitch of stadia is you could play this game on this cheap device

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is 35 or well 60 or this thousand dollar pixel slate you fool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I think the sweet spot for this. I don't know what google sweet spot  But from the player's sweet spot is a chromecast ultra 75 dollars and then you really want the best experience you buy the wi-fi  Google controller which reduces latency because it's correct just like the chromecast connecting directly  That's a pretty sweet bundle. So what I don't know what you've spent there because they didn't announce a price for that  But let's say 200 bucks  And then whatever the monthly fee, which they also didn't announce. So let's say 20 bucks  Um that that might be pretty cool  I mean if but but then it sounds like you're a gamer and maybe if you are you already had a xbox

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But maybe I mean there's lots of kids. You're you're not gonna let your kid you're not gonna know lots of people  Are gonna do it, but not everyone's gonna give their kid an xbox  Right one or a plus  So the kids will demand these daddy. I want a chromecast ultra  And then you can grow future gamers, right?  Yeah, so if you can get them young maybe they'll get used to it  Maybe they'll even like it and as it gets better and you add more features more games  They're probably watching these games on youtube now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true  And they did mention and I have to say I was thrilled to hear this cooperative gaming because lisa and I lisa says my wife  Let's I want to sit on the couch and play a game with you like gold and I remember golden eye  You could two people could yeah  And I looked and there's like it's like the lego game is the only game you can do that with  We didn't want to play so  That's one of the things google explicitly called out at the stadia announcement is cooperative gaming and because each person will have their own instance  In the cloud it'll be good quality  You can actually be at different places in the world and I mean and and she could sit there with her pixel book or  I could have the big screen we could I mean there's really some options here and I could see this being a family gaming opportunity  You guys should play jackbox

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's jackbox?  Ever play that no, so it's their games. I think it started with you don't know jack  Do you remember that love that played that many years? Yeah  So jackbox effectively it's all it does is multiplayer games  We played it at a family reunion kind of thing with nieces and nephews and cousins and there's a bunch of there's a game  Where you're called quip lash where you have to come up with?  Stupid sort of funny saying party games  Yeah party games, but they're really well done

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They won't let me look at it unless I give them an email address  Excuse matthews

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, anyway, they're fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Real quick did apple say what developers will get as a cut of the 9.99?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No feed first of all, they didn't say 9.99. They we don't know what it is  Uh the deal for apple news, we should talk about apple news too since you both are journalism types  Uh the deal for apple news according to the wall street journal is 10. It's 50 so it's 9.99  I subscribed immediately because I had I used to subscribe to texture. It's the same same price apple keeps five bucks  the rest of the money gets distributed based on engagement time, so  and and so  That was another interesting announcement  Yeah, well i'm really curious both of you have had experiences in print and have watched print struggle  Uh a lot of people blame facebook for the end of journalism  This is apple  Is it apple's attempt to save journalism or is it apple's attempt to draw the last drop of blood out before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They toss away the corpse, but which is i'm gonna go with number two option number two. I'll take number two for the win  I mean if they wanted to save journalism, they could not take 50 like that would be suggestion number one  If you're going to try and help media companies, you would not take 50 of the revenue

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know to me yesterday we were talking about it on macbreak weekly and I said the thing I hate about this is it's a walled garden  And it's not the web and everybody yelled at me. They said well, no, this is great. You want a walled garden  This is a what do you what do you web? I can still look at the web  Yeah, but this doesn't interact with the web this draws resources from the web. No, no, this doesn't hurt the web  And that's what really worries me more than anything is that journalism as soon as it becomes a walled  Who are we talking though to that works for the daily rupert murdoch's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Crazy hugely successful tabloid newspaper

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, he spent what a hundred million dollars or something building a newsroom and  hiring journalists  And somebody we talked to regularly was one of those journalists. Wow. Yeah, it would have been fun. Yeah times  Yeah back when that's what I was pretty good there for a little while. I call stupid money

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Until they launched us rupert's doing okay rupert's doing fine  Rupert's not hurting. He loses 20 million estimated  A year on the new york post  He doesn't care 20 million and he's lost that for 15 years. Why does he still do it?  Because he doesn't care he wants the new york post and he doesn't care

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's 20 million is nothing he makes so much money off for fox that he subsidizes it  It's surrounding air and it gives him a voice in manhattan an important voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  It's for power. So apple I mean  You know a bunch of people josh benton at the neem and journalism lab did quite a good piece on news plus it's um  I don't know. I don't see why  And in fact the new york times and the washington post decided not to take part  But I don't I don't actually see I think it's like a hail mary pass for a lot of publishers. They're like well  Who cares like apple is in a billion pockets?  Maybe we only get 50 percent of whatever  pennies people contribute but at least we'll get something and maybe it won't cost us a lot and so why not  I mean, we're literally so desperate. That's what it is. It's a death. It's your ass. Sally set up a lemonade stand and said  You'd put your paper there. They would go for it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because that's really what's happening is that these all these magazines are are dying on the vine  And a billion pockets y'all well, right?  Right, if I make one penny for pocket I can

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought it was fascinating though. The wall street journal is part of it. So the new york time  But they're not fully a part of it. We should point this out. No, they're not. They are what yes. No you get a they are  Everything from the journal is in there. No, so that's what's fun  Yes, that's what's fascinating. So I did some research  No, everything from the journal is in there, but they are only going to surface  General news so it will only show up sort of in your feed or in the highlights general news  Everything from the journal is in there, but only if you search for it  So if you know a specific keyword or you know a headline  You can find it but I think they're counting on  The fact that like 99 people are not going to do that. They're just going to get whatever journal stuff comes to them  so it's they're actually trying to  Take you know have their cake and eat it too  Put your content there, but actually only highlight the general news that you don't care

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I could so so for instance, I pay 149 for the journal digital subscription  The difference between this and apple news is for one thing apple news only keeps it for three days  You can't go past three days, right?  and then you're saying all the content is there because I  I apologize for saying you're wrong. Obviously, you know what you're talking about  What I had read is that only a few things would be from the paper would be on apple news  You're saying it's all there. It's just not surfaced

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. So the journal's own reporting on it said  Basically, so they should know right almost all  Or virtually all so who knows there's probably some stuff that isn't on there  But most of it is you just won't be able to find it  I don't know if you've tried the search, but it's terrible and there you can't browse  Anything you can't you can't say hey show me everything from the journal. So you're only going to see the stuff  That apple's editors  Highlight, right and that'll be just the general news

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good deal for the journal because the journal is going to get basically plugs  On the front page of apple news, but if you really want to see more  You're gonna have to go to the site you're gonna have to either it's also interesting that the journal is hiring 50 people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they tied it to this launch. So they said being part of news plus they're gonna hire 50 people  What just to report on things some of which might actually be exclusive to news plus?  Non-business related. I just find that fascinating. It feels like a daily kind of thing like murdoch is just what the hell  Apple's really big  Let's just hire a bunch of journal. This is though. That's that stupid money

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was talking about if you make enough money from another source say fox  You can play with it you've got you know, you've got it's the downside  I mean I would do that if you know in a little way, you know if I  If I had a hundred dollars a month discretionary income, I wouldn't care  And for for rupert five or 10. Yeah for rupert. It's probably the equivalent of a hundred dollars a month  It's like well  Let's do it. So why i'll buy a lottery

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the long-term risk is that if people figure it out and they do start getting more journal content  Some of them could decide well stop subscribing. That's the next that's the next step the golden goose

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is for blogs like nine to five mac and then apple insider to start publishing the tricks  To searching apple news and getting wall street journal articles  But there is no in there are no inbound links right you can't no no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to classic apple product. It is a wall connected to anything. Nothing goes in anything. Nothing goes out  It's literally just like a newsstand but on your tablet  yeah, and  it's it's a  it's interesting to me sort of  in an academic way that they  They play so much emphasis on  No algorithms no data no privacy, we don't know anything about you. We don't know what you read. We don't know where you live  That's apple and I and I actually had somebody say  I like recommendations made by companies that know me and what I read  So apple's basically saying we're just going to choose a bunch of stuff  We have no idea whether you're going to be interested in it because we literally don't know you know or care

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tried to get rid of people magazine in my in my apple news plus it's a very retro approach, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like the guy at the newsstand and the people that put the newspaper together didn't know you either

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, and you would think it really now that bad though matthew from a from a anonymous  But don't they are they using some algorithms to recommend based on what you're doing on device algorithms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So even those don't they said they will not track what you read, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they they will not track could mean on the server side and apple but on the device your phone your phone's tracking you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not anybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, i'm just not going to get random. I have to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As a as a regular user of apple news because I try it all the time  It's not doing a great job of figuring out what I want to read

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At all and I have to say it's a great it is like we'll go into the newsstand and reading through random

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very much like that, which is the serendipity that could be fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure, and that's that definitely has value, but I think things like flipboard and and even facebook  God love them who do kind of recommendations every now and then there is something that is interesting that you would not have found otherwise  So now you're counting on apple's editors who nobody knows how many of them there are who they are  To sort of select those things for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been asking every show since the apple event every panel  Do you apple really is selling this privacy right and it's it's it's it's obviously  In contrariness to google and facebook, right? Well, they they snoop on you they collect data  But we promise we won't and they see that as a selling point  And of course in the tech press we're very aware of all this. We see it as a selling point  My question that I ask every panel. I'll ask you guys this  Do real people care do they?  I mean, I know they're aware of it because we've been hammering this for years  But do honestly do people when you go out in the world say, oh i'm going to choose apple because they're they stand for privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So in my experience no, yeah, i've never heard that from anyone  In the list of reasons why people say they choose apple  Yeah, that does not appear right like I like the grows gold cases. Yeah, that's much higher one. Yeah  That's much higher one. Yeah. Yeah, my message is number two

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No one has ever mentioned privacy. There is I think a somewhat subliminal awareness of security, right?  Like people think oh, I don't want to use an android phone because I hear apple phones are safer  But not more private. I don't know if I have not heard that not even heard so no one has actually specifically mentioned it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't really hear the privacy as a selling factor either. I do hear a lot about the security obviously writing about google devices  I get my occasional comment there you're buying spyware because google spy and so on  Um, but the privacy factor. I don't think normals really  Care, you know actively

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't even have people talking to me about  Oh, there was a huge leak and all these passwords like I just don't think a lot of that stuff  Can it's it's complicated. I just don't think it affects people in their daily lives unless they get hacked or unless  You know, they get fished somehow  um  I did have one conversation about apple and  Security or privacy and I pointed out that they're what to me is just a massive  Hypocrisy the way they treat users in china  um, so they're happy to protect your data and not snoop and so on if you're not in china, but  In china, they pretty much do whatever the government tells them to do. Right? So  All of that data is available  Even I think uh encryption keys are stored locally. Yeah, the keys are stored in china as well. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's that's another another issue  Mr. Pachai goes to washington  Uh, and and the president tweeted about it he met with donald trump in dc  Today I think right or was it yesterday  uh trump said that uh, he tweeted  That sooner pachai met with him and is obviously doing quite well  That's nice  That's nice. I like to get that inside that look. What does that mean though? Obviously, what does he mean?  Yeah, it kind of implies there's something nefarious right? Uh, google's doing well  You guys don't have a gm don't have a job but google's doing a I don't think that's what he was  He wearing the diamond rolex again or like what does he mean? That's for trump. He was wearing nice shoes. He had good expensive shoes  He's doing quite well  Uh, this is also from the twitter. He stated strongly  That he is totally committed to the u.s military not the chinese military  In case you were like a freaking toddlers writing this  uh  Also discussed political fairness  And then various things that google can do for our country

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meeting ended very well like facial recognition ended good

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On on google's part, uh a spokesperson said we're pleased to have productive conversations with the president  About him shouldn't you capitalize president? Let me ask you journalists guys. Is it lowercase p?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's lowercase p unless you're referring to him  In his official capacity like president donald trump, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then the president  Uh about investing in the future of the american workforce the growing the growth of emerging technologies and our ongoing commitment  To working with the u.s government  Earlier, I guess this month trump had accused google of helping china and their military  So sooner said I just want you to know we like the u.s military. We prefer the u.s military  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In case you hadn't figured that out already. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and then of course, uh  Trump and republicans have accused all social media including google of having a bias towards democrats  Uh trump tweeted earlier this month google is helping china and their military but not the u.s terrible  The good news is they helped crooked hillary clinton and not trump and how did that turn out?  It's like a freaking toddler. It's just like yeah, okay. Um  How did that turn out? Um  Yeah, so I can kind of read between the lines google  Of course, uh because their engineers  Kind of rose up decided to decline to do any work for the military's uh, was it the jedi?  Uh, they didn't bid for jedi which microsoft has done as well as oracle  um  microsoft's ceo satya nadella said  uh  Even though he was also getting some heat from engineers at microsoft said well we're you know  We've always done contract work for any uh, you know  What did he say legally elected government democratically elected government?  And it's patriotic. I think jeff bezo said because they are bidding for as well. It's patriotic to support the military  What are you talking about?  um google did decline but I think google did it not because they didn't want the money or they didn't  Think they weren't patriotic but but honestly you got to keep your engineers happy  And if a lot of engineers are saying whatever you do don't sell our work  for the military  You kind of don't have a lot of choice it's not like you can fire them all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it was project maven too, wasn't it maven? They were yeah  Yeah  To use ai to get to help drones right target people that was what it was. Yep. Yep face recognition

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were in the running for jedi, too. Yeah  so that's why uh  Uh sundar pachai had to go to the white house and and tell the president  That we are committed to the u.s military not the chinese military

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The great thing about president trump is  You can just go in there you can pat him on the back give him a hearty handshake said no  No, no, we love you and that's and then he believes it. Yeah, it's it's oh, okay. Never mind forget  forget what I said forget that the  Chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told the senate that google was working directly or indirectly counter to u.s interest forget that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know an hour and a half from now. He's just gonna say  I know I know right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you it must be hard for these ceos you can see tim cook almost literally grinding his teeth  Sitting there next to the president watch yeah, but you have to do this  You have to kiss the ring. You can't not go  And especially now I think google facebook apple microsoft amazon all understand that they are in deep doo-doo  And they and they've got to appease the u.s government

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because there's a big antitrust hammer. Oh, yeah, just sort of waiting. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know at this point they might actually prefer trump to somebody like elizabeth warren who wants to bring them up  Uh remember the eu  We were talking about them earlier remember the fact that they find uh google  one and a half billion euros  Uh for monopolistic behavior  Yeah, turns out the same day google's price went up two percent adding 17 billion dollars  to the market value  10 times  The amount they were fined by the european commission. Yeah, so  This is why google's glad to pay that  Yep  a good day on the street  But then there's then there's the guy I love this  Who uh who made?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many hundred and twenty two million hundred twenty two million dollars. I love that story sending

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Phony bills to facebook and google which they just paid

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now he did get one. Uh, he did get caught that one the schadenfreude was pretty  Was pretty strong. Uh, yeah, I mean it was total fraud  He pretended to be a company that they actually bought hardware from he just sent them invoices. I just love the fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they would just pay them. Yeah, the investors were accompanied by  Forged invoices contracts and letters that falsely appear to be executed and signed by executives and agents of the victim companies facebook and google  And which bore false corporate stamps and boss with the victims company's names  To be submitted to banks in support of the large volume of funds that were fraudulently transmitted  Via wire transfer. He's he's in lithuania  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No one checked part is he's only he's only agreed to give back 50 million. He made so that was like 72 million  Yeah, what's gonna happen to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, probably they can't find it because apparently he scrolled cash away in cyprus lithuania hungary slovakia and latvia  He does face up to 30 years in prison true. So that's the downside. So i'm we're not recommending this  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there was a there was a company actually in canada that used a similar strategy didn't create  A real company name but would send out fake invoices  And then I think the name of the company was something generic like telecom services and there was a picture of a phone  and then it would  Normal looking invoice and right at the bottom in tiny print. It said this is not an invoice  and so  So he would send it to  You know old ladies and like people on mailing lists and and to some companies and they would just pay  Because they're like, oh, okay  I guess we used some telecom services and he would make it for such small amounts  That nobody would I bet this happens all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean i'm not convinced we wouldn't fall for such a thing  I don't I mean we have a full-time bookkeeper. We at least my  You know, he's a cfo and with long-time experience as a controller. I'm gonna have to ask her  If somebody were you know, I let's just matthew would you send us an invoice and just see if we pay it  Services render services rendered make up a good name make it in canada

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought it was interesting. This guy's company was actually registered. I think in lithuania  But the company he pretended to be I don't think had even had business in lithuania. So I guess nobody even noticed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it would work with us because we're not that big and we kind of know what we're spending money on  You know google you gotta figure google's got hundreds of invoices a day, right at least. Oh, yeah thousands

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thousands. Yeah thousands

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this why I have four electric bills this month

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See to be honest the reason I kind of laugh is because I would I could see myself doing that paying bills sitting down you  Stick sit down to pile and bills. I guess you write checks. This is I remember writing check  You just write checks for everybody. Yeah, like it hope they don't cut off the electricity and mail it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The case of the lithuanian  lapser  Uh, let's take a little break when we come back. I want to talk about chrome 73 kevin toffle is here from about chrome books  Dot com he has much to say about the new  chrome os 73  Including features not mentioned by the big goog  Matthew ingram is also here. He is the chief digital writer at the columbia journalism review at cjr.org  And it's great to have you guys. It's fun. It's just for me. It's like just sitting down and chatting with my old buddy  About all the silly stuff happening today  Chatting shoe chat and chew  Um, where where is that it's somewhere in northern ontario  You know somewhere in northern ontario sounds like  Like  A neil young song actually. Yeah  Yeah, it is somewhere in northern ontario  Our show today brought to you by cap terra  Whether you're somewhere in northern ontario or in the heart of the city in the big apple or the big orange  You got a business you need business software and I have to say  Um, I remember working when I first started working at cam bier in sarah francesco in 1984  So, I mean pcs were out max were out  Uh, and I was a music director and I went into the music office  To put together the playlists  For the djs and they said there's your computer that generates a playlist. It was a it was a pdp 11  And it was running software off a big eight inch floppy eight and a half inch floppy  And they said here's the software  It's 1984 you put the floppy in you close the thing and you push the button it would go the head would go

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The very first thing I did was break that  I don't know what happened  But the floppy stopped working one day shortly after I was employed and we managed to get something a little more modern  And that's when we had to search for a little more modern software  I hope you're not in the situation where you're using software design for an explorer eight  But if you are can I point you to cap terra?

It's what?  Sometimes I don't know that there's an update. How will I know that there's an update kevin tofel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you've got the chrome releases blog which you're showing on the screen right now  Which I when I especially when I was at google I would say guys better release notes and they're slowly doing that because before it  Used to be we've got a new release, you know check for updates and they never tell you what was in it  So at least we're getting bullet points now  But your chromebook should automatically show a notification at the bottom right system tray. It's not immediately obvious

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like a little funny little notification, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Correct, correct. And the thing is and a lot of people don't realize this even though chrome os  Is announced when a stable channel update is available like it was on monday this week  It's a staged rollout and and they actually I think they do it to five percent of users per day than another 10 percent  Okay  so  My tip of the week or one of two actually will be to tell you  Or show you a place that you can bookmark and see if your device is ready to get the update because you can always manually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Check for updates and in most cases on an update like this you need to  Restart this system, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's correct in a yes technically and and  One of the reasons chrome is very quick with updates for actually applying them is and I don't know if they're very very real  As a soul quickly go through it. There's actually two system partitions on every chromebook  One is the active chrome os that you're using and there's a a backup of the last version  And what happens is the update gets downloaded and is installed to the partition not in use when you reboot  It then boots into the new one and therefore everything seamlessly updated because it already is updated if that makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you were if you were to suggest to somebody who wasn't super wealthy  Or super techie to get a chromebook  Which one would you suggest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the first thing I would ask them is what are they going to use it for?  And if it's just basic browsing and maybe an occasional android app  Geez, some of the new acers like the 514 250 dollars  Something something in that range  I mean there's a they're they're almost all the same matthew at that price point in terms of the specs  It comes down to like which one might have a better keyboard for you, you know that you like or or something to that effect  uh  There's just so many so many low end choices and really it's that they're in a sense all the same just minor differences at that point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right  This is a big update though, right? I mean, I mean it's a not a point update

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Correct. This is a full release. We were all on 72 points something up to this point  And in fact my pixel slate is still on 72  I did not get it yet. And again, i'll share on how you can find out if your device has it and when it's available  um  All of the all the major releases are big updates that again it gets back to they don't really tell you what's in them  and I think that's a very very bad choice from a user experience because  You we've got the bullet list that we had on the screen before and there's some great  Bits, but i've been tracking all the other things and they didn't mention them there  and  I mean, I I probably found six seven

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Large features that are very impactful. Well run run. Why wouldn't they why wouldn't they mention them?  You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's more of a cultural thing with release notes than anything else math  I don't think it's to diminish any of the features  I think it's you know, some of them are tied directly to bugs  So they know that a lot of people, you know want to for example be able to map  Uh google drive in linux, for example, and maybe not a lot of people do but whatever  There was a lot of folks following that but I do you can see  There you go  You can see all the open bugs and you can star them and I have a feeling the more stars something gets which gets you  On an email list for the updates of of that particular bug  Uh probably has a lot to do with what they highlight and what they don't got it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is one bullet point that has concerned, uh, some people and it's this one report additional telemetry data for chrome os devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, okay, and I understand that I guess I would say

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But well I just point out that this is exactly the phrase microsoft uses  And then microsoft windows gets a lot of heat for  Selling or sending data back to the home office  Microsoft will say and I bet google will say we use that telemetry to make our products better  So know what's going wrong and know what you use how you're using it. Is that what this is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a that's exactly what it is. It's nothing to my knowledge. That's nefarious or data that's being sold  It is in fact you can  Well, you probably wouldn't I I go through the the actual code commits and you can see that they are generating data from some of these  After they roll out beta bits and things and they're like, let's see  Is this actually fixing the problem or is it not so they they have lots of histogram type data that they generate and  Send back to the mothership  But to my knowledge it's it's really all to make the product better and see that the work they're doing is actually  Doing what they want it to do, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so are there what are the biggest features that you think people will be excited about and especially any features that  People don't know about that aren't listed on that very short bullet list

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so, um, I mean we talked earlier about the the really bad animations for example on the seller on slate and and actually  It wasn't smooth on any of the devices, but there are many transition  Animation fixes in this version. I have not been able to test them on stable because I don't have it yet  But I have been testing it in dev and beta and i've seen an improvement  So that's always a plus  I know a lot of people bought this as a tablet and  I still kind of question that because it's really a chromebook in a different form factor  But that's a whole nother another issue. Um enterprises should be pretty happy because they're getting in fact google mentioned on the bullet point something about um,  uh  Printer mapping and so on and that's obviously big in enterprises where they still print but they're also getting  Cristini and the reason they couldn't have it before is because there was no enterprise policy built into the chrome administration management  So they added the tool to manage that and so that way if you're in  You know, you're in a an enterprise and you have managed devices  They can actually be managed to have christina or not. Maybe they don't want you using linux for whatever reason. I don't know, right?  One of the other really nice ones that will is more universal  the  native pdf annotation support  Which is fantastic because even if you don't have a device with a pen if you have a touch screen device you could  Mark up a pdf sign your name, etc. Didn't work for fields filling in fields when I tested it, but I know they're working on that  But I know a lot of people are like, yeah  I got this pdf and I all I can do is print it or look at it and that kind of sucks  so so that's a a nice fix and uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you don't really need a third-party pdf utility. I use kami in chrome as a extension for pdfs  Sounds like I don't need it on chromebooks

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean you could still use it there's plenty of great android apps for example and extensions like you said leo that  Let you do that. They're not going away  But no the pdf uh annotation is built in a native and if it does enough of what you need to do  There's no need to you know, junk up your hard drive with extra stuff. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  About I'll tell you how you found out about this stuff. Just go to about chromebooks.com  Kevin is obsessive about this. I've heard of that  Yeah  Everything you'd ever want to know it's right there  Some more leaks about google's new low priced pixel threes the pixel 3a and 3a xl  They'll be available  in iris color  In addition to black and white i'm not sure what iris is. Is that bluish? This is according to wind future blue violet color  Uh, we also think that pricing is going to be  Around 500 bucks for the 64 gigabit  Gigabyte i'm sorry pixel 3a and the xl a little bit higher. So it's about 200  To 300 less actually 350 less  Than the big boys, although google seems to be offering some discounts lately on the pixel xl 3xl  and the three  Uh previous rumors said the pixel 3a and 3xl would launch at verizon in the spring  Which we're in right now. So keep your eye peeled if you want a low price pixel three

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would grab that 300 off that they're doing right now at google. That's right. I mean and the chromebooks are a deal too, right?  Oh, that's right through march 28th. Uh, the pixel books are all 200 off  So 799 for the the base model which wasn't a seller on or an m3  I mean that was a core i5 with 8 giga ram nice and 200 off pixel 3 and 3xl right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean i'm very happy with my pixel 3  I had a period of time when something weird was going on and then it just got fixed by you know  I don't know if it was an update or somehow but i've been very happy but I read boy do I read the  people with speaker issues still and  Screen issues and all sorts of stuff. I don't know what the qc usually you'd expect  That after phone's been out for six months, it's gonna be a pretty consistent product and that seems like it's getting less consistent not more consistent  so  I'm not I have in the past recommended a pixel 3  And I used it for a long time, but i'm not sure I would still recommend it especially in light of these new  Samsung s10s, which are really good  YouTube has decided not to do scripted  Series or maybe it is doing scripted series. It's kind of hard to tell  Uh, they deny now that they're canning scripted series and plan to launch an ad supported  A list of scripted series that bloomberg had said that youtube had stopped accepting pitches  um  Google did confirm it plans a big focus on paid subscriptions by  Introducing an ad supported slate that will include new and existing series in the coming weeks. This is according to  Tech crunch this is in addition to youtube premium. This is something new

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it feels like youtube's trying to  have it both ways, I mean  Bloomberg said it was basically bowing out of the  Kind of expensive right scripted show race at the same time as apple announced. It's you know, apple tv plus  Right, so not that they're not still going to do it  And then I guess too many people said wait, what the hell you're not going to keep doing scripted shows  So they had to say yes, we are  but really

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But not they're not no  It's not the really expensive ones tech crunch says that they are canceling two existing shows, which I haven't seen called origin  and overthinking with kate and june  I haven't seen either of those  I better see karate kid  That is good  That was good. I liked it and then maybe it was maybe it's because of you somebody recommended on this show and I  I watched it and it was really good  It was a it's a reboot of the original karate kid. Okay, and I is mr

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Miyagi back in it or is no no it actually takes place in present day

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the son of the karate ref ralph ralph machado's son  uh a neighbor

Transcript:  Okay, yeah, but it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is did he move in with a kid grown up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Versus oh the karate kid grown up is the new mr. Miyagi. Yes and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  More importantly his opponent in the first. Oh, that's right is the new

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the twist the twist is he's the good guy is that he's the good guy the bad guy in the karate kid movie  Who got beat up at the end?  Good guy turns out we didn't be completely misunderstood him and his motivations and he's the good guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did I could I think I confused  Just watch it now  Um, do you have to pay to see that? I thought that was just part of youtube. That is part of youtube tv  oh  Okay, so you have to pay for youtube my problem is  I just get bills from google and I pay them  So I don't I think I subscribe to everything I might be wrong, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey matthew when you send an invoice to leo, can you add my name in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Facebook  You know when you start a sentence with facebook just finish the sentence for me will you apologize  And says it'll never do it again  In this case, it's the passwords. Yes, it's this  Yeah, just take take your pick of stories. This is from crebs on security  Uh, fortunately the hundreds of millions of user passwords facebook stored in plain text for years  Were never visible as far as they know outside of facebook  But any employee at facebook 20 000 of them had access  To these and could have downloaded them facebook said the investigation so far  Actually, this is a source a senior facebook employee who's familiar with the matter speaking to crebs on security on condition of an anemone anonymity  Says that between 200 million and six  600 million facebook users may have had their account passwords stored in plain text and searchable by more than 20 000 facebook  employees  Plain text user passwords dating back to 2012  Logs showed some 2000 engineers or developers made approximately 9 million internal queries for these passwords  Words  Uh facebook apologizes and said it will never happen again  It's hard, you know computers are hard math is hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean it was only a couple hundred million. It's not a big deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Small percentage of our user base. Yeah, it's not like a billion or something. And here's the good news  Facebook is banning white nationalism and white separatism

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought that was interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  uh  They'll be treated the same as white supremacy for a while facebook said no, that's just nationalism. It's just separatism  Now they're saying well it kind of is like white supremacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've been talking about pwn to own the big vancouver cansec west security conference  Uh went on the last few days steve gibson has a full report  Uh, but firefox and edge both bowed to hackers  So did a tesla  So did safari on mojave  it's uh, it's a bloodbath, but it's a good bloodbath because  These exploits end up getting handed over to the company so they can fix them  And the hackers get a nice reward. Although as many have pointed out  Not as much as they would have gotten paid by bad guys  Companies that sell these exploits to nation states and things like that like zirotium  uh, there was a uh escape from a virtual machine that would have been worth I think half a million on zirotium  And the team fluoro acetate that made the big bucks on pwned to own  Uh only got a fraction of that actually they did all right over the three days  I think they earned something like three hundred forty five thousand dollars and they  The reason they call it pwned to own is when you pwn it you own it  And one of the things they pwned was a model 3 tesla, which they drove off with their winnings in the trunk of so that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  free car free car man, I just I just love that one of the exploits they used was  Involved the calculator  Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the uh, I think that it didn't involve the calculator the uh, they call it popping calc  Right the way you show victory is the least open the calculator. Yeah, the least kind of  Evil thing you can do which is to have the calculator open up and that shows yes  I own this machine and I all i'm going to do is launch the calculator  So popping calc is is like crossing the finish line  Now there's a big furor going on we spent some time talking about this on security night yesterday as well  Uh with asus and asus  Computers, uh, and it's not clear exactly what happened  um  so  I'll just give you the facts  This was discovered by the russian cyber security firm kaspersky lab and they said we saw this  With our customers so it may be a mere fraction of the total infected computers  But our customers got malware on their computers pushed to their computers by the asus software update tool  And the software was signed with a legitimate asus digital certificate  It what's weird though, and I think very telling is  That the way the malware worked is would only activate  On about 600 systems and it did that by mac address so the malware would get on your sys  So in other words, I mean while this is not a good thing and asus has pushed out fixes and if you have an asus laptop  You should be aware of it, but it probably didn't infect you because or affect you it did infect you but it didn't affect you because  only 600 systems had the  Right mac addresses and the malware searched for those and once on the system  Uh, it would reach out to a command and control server and then install additional malware on the machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is but that's actually more disturbing. How did they get those mac addresses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well the ones they targeted. Yeah, so that's that's what steve and I spent some time talking about i'll give you my scenario  Which steve said that very possible. In fact, I think asus now says it was what we call an advanced persistent threat  When a bad guy gets into your network like they did with sony pictures entertainment often they spend months  They're just browsing around looking for assets figuring out what's going on and one scenario would be  uh, let's say a nation state, let's say north korea or saudi arabia or israel or the nsa  uh had  penetrated this maybe they knew that the  an adversary's embassy had just taken order of  600 asus laptops  Uh, and they knew the range because they'd been browsing around in the asus customer records  That would be a perfect opportunity for them to put  uh to  Make a modified payload so that asus wouldn't know that this update payload had been modified would sign it with their certificate  And push it out and then it would go look for those particular computers and then put spyware on there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So which means they were in asus's systems for  Yeah, a good long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that is uh since the security now show. I think that asus has said that that it was an advanced persistent threat  Um, and that kind of confirms that scenario  Yeah, nobody wants to admit that and that's the other reason that asus took a while to confirm it  It is bad and I bet you it happens all the time  Because these nation states are really good  Um  At uh  Laying low well and but doing spear phishing attacks, right if so  It's one thing to kind of put out a a virus that affects a lot of people ransomware is you know, you want to cast a wide net  And while that's not hard to do it's hard to predict the results of it. But if you're a  Hacker working for a government, you know what you want. You want let's say you want the israeli embassy  In washington dc and you're saudi arabia  And you get some intelligence that said well, they just bought 600 new asus computers. It isn't so far-fetched to think that you would then  Say, oh good. Let's go get into the asus network find those computers and put something bad on target them target them  Uh, so asus, um  Had been targeted by advanced persistent threat attacks according to their press release  And uh, that's typically government hackers or highly but rarely highly organized criminal groups  A small number of devices according to asus have been implanted with malicious code through a sophisticated attack on our live update servers  In an attempt to target a very small and specific user group  User group  Asus customer service has been reaching out to affected users are providing assistance to ensure that the security risks are removed  uh, they also uh  Put out an update to prevent this  Kaspersky dubbed the malware shadow hammer because you gotta have a good name  That's we know we know we know that yeah, and uh, they said that 57 000 of their customers had it  Um, I think that motherboard then went to semantic which confirmed that they had seen it on their customers computers as well  um  So anyway just an update on that and the latest go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I kind of wonder and maybe I shouldn't be worried about this but  we never hear about like the  Attacks or hacks on the supply chain when these things are being built  That either means there aren't or we just don't hear them. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had there so there was one there was one report about i'm trying to remember  If it was the fbi they were  they were grabbing  products routers, I think  in transit to customers  And diverting them and then installing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and snowden one of the snowden leaks  showed that there was a supply chain intact  by the  cia or was he  Or maybe it was the nsa. I think it was the nsa that involved modifying ethernet adapters in right and computers in in transit  So you do it in transit. You don't do it at the manufacturer  You do, you know, you get the mail truck you detour the truck detour and you make those  Changes, I think they're hard to detect. It's one of the reasons you don't hear about it  A good supply chain attack is probably very hard to detect

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and the guy the this guy from the center for internet  Security who was a  NSA analyst said  Supply chain attacks are in the quote big deal category. Yeah  And are a sign of someone who really knows what they're doing. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're gonna I convinced we'll hear a lot more of these kinds of attacks  That they're not really something individuals have to worry about  but uh  Companies do unless you're targeted. Yeah, the democratic national committee should  Uh, you know, uh, this is this is something that if you're a target exactly you do have to worry about and I think  It's going to happen more and more and I think it's going to be part of a kind of a background cold war  A cold cyber war that will be with us for many decades

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe forever. I think that's why that bloomberg story got so much attention the one micro story. Yeah, they haven't been able to  Sort of confirm but yeah right on a motherboard tiny chip. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, let's do the google  Change log the google change log  These are new things google is adding to make your life better than ever  And google is now amping email and I have no idea  Sounds great  So amp is that technology that they do for news organizations to make  Uh web pages load faster actually because it could be any webpage might my uh,  Website pages are amp because there's a wordpress.com plug-in. I just click the switch and it means it loads faster  google  Despite their denials. I think it improves the search results  Uh, you know amp stuff shows up in an amp carousel and all that stuff  um  amp for emails coming to gmail  But other major email providers like yahoo mail  Outlook and mail.ru the russian email provider will also support amp emails  It'll turn basic messages. Oh boy, this sounds so dangerous into a surface for actually getting things done

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Including hacking you and your computer. Oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the good news is the javascript here has to all come from google servers has to be approved javascript  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds like interactive email, right basically it's amped websites in your email, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Booking.com is going to use it doodle  equid fresh books next oil rooms pinterest and red bus. I have no idea and despagar  Uh, if you build app websites, it should be a simple thing to do  It's standard html markup and that's by the way the one reason that I haven't completely  You know deprecated amp and I don't like it but it's why I put up with it because it does degrade to regular html  So you don't have to use an amp browser and you don't have to  Uh support it  So your email will continue to work. In other words, it just won't be as pretty it's kind of like html email  It'll continue to work. It just won't be as pretty  Uh apple music is on chromebooks. You'll be happy to know  No  But probably not in the most bestest way because it's coming through the android  app  That's okay. That's better than nothing, right? Hey, it works for me. I don't know. Yeah  Apple uh supporting apple music on chromebooks and and uh, that's just part of an android update that's coming out  So if you want apple music on your chromebook, you can now install the android version of it  If you used if this then that with gmail sad to say  They're turning off almost all  actually google is turning off almost all if that's then that  Support all you'll be able to do is send an email or send yourself an email all the other if this than that  Triggers are are gone  Which is a shame because I think a lot of people use this  Yeah as a way to you know, I mean you could think of a lot of ways  You might want to use email to notify yourself or

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could have custom things happen in your house based on email  subject headers and things and right that's actually part of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think twitter and facebook have both  Shut off things that used to work with if this than that  It's a shame moved on a huge amount of functionality like I used to use it to do all sorts of things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's you know, the excuse google gives is security  It's part of tightening up emails policies concerning third-party services

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is great, but the reality is it prevents you from doing things that are actually useful. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If this then that said they've tried to find a way to become compliant with the new policies  But that it couldn't do so without major infrastructure  changes, uh, which apparently they're  Unable to do or afford  We've long had a good relationship with google if this than that rights and we support their efforts to improve privacy and security  Though we understand this change may be a disappointment to the communities that use these applets we look forward to working with google in the future  To blah blah blah blah blah blah  That's too bad I I use if this than that a lot  I also use something called zappier which is a paid version of this if this than that but  I presume if this than that can't do it zappier won't be able to do it either  Um google podcasts  Finally  Adding this is it was really a stripped down podcast app, but I think this could make it the podcast app of choice  They're going to add add in episode search  Which means you without doing anything and we I should add because you know what we do podcasts, too  I will automatically have transcripts  And  That those transcripts probably computer generated, but you know google's good at that they're not terrible  Will be searchable  Which will make a big difference you'd be able to in theory in google podcasts  Search for leo talking about google podcasts and jump right to this part of the show  I hope that happens

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently people are finding the eu thanks to article 11 or 17

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, not available in the eu

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And google podcast is great unless you want to listen to the bbc

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, did you see that the bbc has pulled its podcasts from google?  They say they don't get enough information

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From google. Yeah, but what it feels like to me  And i've only followed this sort of tangentially but what it looks like to me is bbc wants  You to use bbc the bbc's podcast app  And not google's podcast app, yes, and so they're hoping that if you like the bbc you'll  Go to their podcast app and if you could just get the bbc in google's app  Then why would you use the bbc's in fact?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  BBC has been removing podcasts from other third-party platforms, too  uh  The license that they've asked google to sign  Requires google to supply user data to the bbc  And since google will not do that  This is you know, this is going to happen and i'm sad and we will never bow to this  We certainly haven't done that  but uh  Because I I support google not sharing information with us  But I have a feeling that what's going to happen is  Advertisers want  The same kind of data from podcasts that they already get from other digital media  You know the the facebook kind of data all the information about  The ads who are seeing the ads that kind of thing  Uh, we as podcasters don't offer that but it's just going to be a matter of time before  Well, you see it with spotify and spotify's acquisitions  Spotify spotify if it's an exclusive to be really trying to lock down. Yeah  If it's an exclusive podcast that you can only hear on spotify  Dollars to donuts the spotify app is sending information about you and what you're listening to how long you listened  Where you stopped listening is logging all that and sending it back to spotify and the reason they do that is because advertisers want that information  Um advertisers always ask us  Well, how do you know that people listen to the whole show?  I mean, they don't ask a newspaper. How do you know people read the whole newspaper?  They don't ask a thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing that struck me about the bbc thing is the bbc is it's a public entity. It's not a private corporation. It's supposed to  Distribute its content as widely as you all think but it's effectively saying no you can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have it unless you use our app. Yeah, and and you get ready because that's going to happen more and more  And it's a bad thing for podcasting and it's a bad thing for you as listeners and you have my promise  That we won't do that you'll never you never hear us say oh this podcast is available on apple's itunes only  That's or whatever. That's not going to happen  We want to and it's not in our interest. We want our podcast to be heard everywhere  We have an advantage. I have to say because we're so narrow in our niche  That we have plenty of advertisers because they  They know who you are  You're geeks  Your tech enthusiasts so it's not you know the average that's enough for advertisers  And we do that survey once a year to find out how many men how many women  You know how much education average income it's completely voluntary. We don't do any other data collection  But so far that's been sufficient for the advertisers for our shows, but I can see a day coming  Where people won't buy a podcast ad?  Like that like they buy regular media. They'll buy it like they buy facebook ads  We want 25 to 54 year old men who live in northern california. Can you give us that?  Now we share  You can't can't do it. There's another way around it, which is insertion advertising  And we've toyed with that  it's not our model because as you know our model is  uh personal personal like endorsements from the host and if you trust the host then you'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Trust the ad and I mean a lot of insertion ads are terrible, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, insertion is kind of what you get now with the tv and radio  But the way podcast insertion would work you would have to again use a particular player  To listen to the show or you would actually the way it would work. You could use your regular podcast player  but it would announce your location to the download source and as  You're downloading the podcast  the the  the  Host would insert ads in based on your location  So dynamic. Yeah, it's dynamic insertion  And there are companies that do this now and we've actually we took a few uh  Podcasts that didn't get advertising see how that worked. We had some issues with it and we stopped doing it  That's not tracking you. Well, it is because of course any podcast  Anytime you download a podcast our servers know your ip address  But that's all that's all we know. We don't use that but you could see how it could be used by somebody who wanted to insert ads

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't do that I can't say we would never do that but uh, I don't want I  I'm a big believer and I know mostly because I know our audience is in not collecting information about you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember you and I talked about that  Npr  Um, yeah podcast they came up with yeah. Yeah, and they have their own app, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And uh almost certainly that's part of the reason they bought an app. They bought podcasts  Podcasts  Uh, why well because I bet you anything they'd like to put that kind of tracking in it and we see a lot of pressure  There's a group called the iab the interactive advertising bureau  That is really a lobbying group for advertisers who buy digital  They pretend to be listening to podcasters, but I think the iab really is about advertisers  And really what they are is a pressure group in my opinion  to pressure podcasts  to adhere to advertisers needs  I'm just glad that i'm close to retirement  I can I can hold on for 10 more years, but after that, I know there's your show title  That's right  Thank god i'm close to some new features in google maps as we continue the changelog. I don't know. I gotta sorry  I got off drifted off topic  speed limits  And if you have an electric vehicle also chargers on your map. Yeah. Yeah  Yeah  So you'll know and easy to see business hours. I always like that  so I know when they're open and google maps does something that remembered that uh,  um  Was a little controversial  When uh swarm did it uh not swarm their parent company did it at south by southwest google maps will tell you when it's busy  At a place. Oh, yeah. Yeah  Foursquare foursquare has that that thing they only did for south by this year  Where it would say oh, there's a lot of people at that bar right now  It was a little I thought it was a little creepy because it's they know a lot about where people are because the handy information  Yeah  But it is handy if you if you want to go when it's less busy and then google maps also has that information on there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is nice at speed limit bit. I didn't realize it was so new. I I uh drove 1100 miles in two days last week  to datan, ohio to  See my sun devils playing the first four basketball game and I saw speed limits almost the entire way on google maps  I thought  Yeah, I don't get out of the house much. So I didn't know what that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, that's apparently a new thing. I've never seen it before. Yeah, I like it  Yeah, it's great. If it just shows up there, especially if you have android auto and it's showing up clearly on a visible screen  That's very handy because I mean that otherwise you got to make sure you look for the signs

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, I think that  Is the google changelog  And I think that's pretty much our show  I would love to get if you wish a pick of the week from you kevin tofel

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I I promise two one is for everyone. So i'll do that one first  I have a link in the show notes to show you and this is great to bookmark if you're a chrome os user, by the way  Uh, which?  Version of chrome os is available for your individual device  Oh, well just by the name of the device not by you personally, but you know what I mean?  Uh, so on the right hand side they list all the device names on the left hand side  They have the device boards if true geeks know what their board is. It's nocturne for the pixel slate for example

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, I guess i'm not a geek

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm great at parties, too  Yeah, so you can see in the blue, uh that some of these guys had the new chrome os 73 already  So there's your razor chromebook 15 for example. It has it whereas  The chromebook flip 101 does not so you can always see what's there  And I believe those recovery links you can actually download and kind of roll back if you needed to but I don't think anybody really needs  to do that so  But yeah  So bookmark that if you're a chromebook user and you can see when something is released  What version it is and when it's available for your device

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you uh at parties people come up to you with their chromebook and say hey kevin what?  What model is this? Can you take a look at this? Could you yeah, what is this nocturne?  What is the motherboard on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I can I can actually do that. Um, sometimes with my eyes closed if they tell me the name of the device or I can feel it  It's one of the things my wife carries me takes me around the neighborhood and says here he can figure out your chromebook in 10 minutes  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like when you're a doctor

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a pain right here. Can you how about a non-geeky just for leo pick?  Although if anybody else enjoys this I would that'd be great. Is it a beetles pick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course it is. I believe it is. I'm happy now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The daily beetles instagram account if if you're not even if you're not on instagram  You know, you don't have to sign in to see this the videos and photos of some of these things are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Beagles did a lot of stuff with fan clubs  Yeah, they sent out that christmas record every year and stuff like that. I don't know if that's what this is  Or i'm still waiting for my christmas album. I never got one. It's the rolling stones

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Circus, that's what it is  But I mean for people who like their music it's great and and for people who just think they were just  Rock and roll stars and don't know how wacky funny these guys were  Some of these interviews are absolutely hysterical

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Well, I got something for you. If that's what you're gonna if that's what you want music  Oh, yeah, the press conferences are great

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is fun being about a prostitute  And norwegian wood about as being about a lesbian. No, I just wanted to know what  What your intent was press hasn't changed much have they what your feeling is about the time magazine criticism of the music that  Is being written today. Well, you're just trying to write songs about prostitutes and lesbians. That's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love you paul

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's that's something I visit almost all the time it can be a huge time suck really so i'm really curious

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  First of all, because cait mckinnon's in it and i'll go see anything she's in  The premise of it is something's happened to the timeline of the world  And this guy is suddenly alive in an era that had no beetles  They never happened  but he  Knows all the beetles music  so  When he sits down with a guitar and plays yesterday everybody says  Wow, that's really good. Did you write that? No, the beetles did who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why did you write that I didn't write it paul mccartney wrote it the beetles who

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All of a sudden he's a superstar  Playing beetles music. Yep  I think this is a great premise for a movie plus a chance to get some great music

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's not cold play it's not fix you it's not cold play it's not fix you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My favorite part is in the recording studio they say I think you should call that hey dude  Na na na na na. Hey, dude  Ed Sheeran who says that is it ed Sheeran? That's awesome. Oh my god. That's something

Transcript:  It's a great premise and of course being beetles I will I will be there on day one. Yeah, absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I really think that's a great idea danny boyle is one of my favorite directors except for the steve jobs movie  But in every other respect  A really great director who is this is perfect material for him matthew ingraham. How about you have anything you'd like to tell us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I sort of stole this from the lineup. Um good because we didn't get to it, right?  the motion picture association of america  said that uh  the  That basically digital home entertainment or digital  Entertainment has now surpassed cable. Wow  so streaming video  I think they said  613 million subscriptions worldwide up 27 percent. Wow cable subscriptions are at  556 million  so the interesting thing is  Cable still makes orders of magnitude more money

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Than streaming right because most of the streaming is either free or or you know one flat fee

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you think about the number of people that are signed up the amount of time spent the amount of content consumed  That gap has got to shrink right cable's got to lose  and  Digital has got to win meaning we're talking 118 billion for cable. I think yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, I I  This is the kind of disruption I enjoy  You could stick it to comcast it's okay, it's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it reminds me of um those great slides from uh, who's the veteran  silicon valley  Mary maker. Yeah, mary maker. So every year she would have a slide showing time spent on mobile  And then you know time spent with print and then the amount of money spent and it was always hugely out of whack  But you knew you know over time those things were gonna, you know, get closer maybe not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean in a way that's kind of part of the the problem we've got which is that we're people are moving to non-monetizable

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Content or content that has personal perceived value right or where it's more difficult to monetize. Yeah, come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's becoming commoditized. So then what happens right you think about the early days of cable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They couldn't figure out how to monetize it either  Right, they just got like jack benny to hold a pack of cigarettes or something and say hey smoke lucky strikes  You know and and they hope that it works a lot of people smoke money strikes  And eventually they figured it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh little pick from me just something that's zoned out and relaxed with  Actually, i've got two picks one is our sponsor calm.com  Moby just announced his new album  Is available only on calm.com which is wild  Um, it's I think the first time I can remember anybody  uh only shipping  You know an album on a premium web service  I guess this kind of speaks a little bit to what you were talking about with the  the move towards a  content streaming  so, uh, that's one but if you don't want to  Pay calm.com for your uh, moby music  Here it is long ambience 2 exclusive album only on calm  It's uh, let me i'll play a little bit just so you can hear that.
