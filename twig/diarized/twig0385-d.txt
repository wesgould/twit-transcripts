Hello everybody and welcome to a very special twig for the last show of 2016.  I decided to give the staff a week off.  Stacey's off with her daughter and her husband having a lovely Christmas.  Jeff Jarvis is off lighting fires around Republican headquarters nationwide.  But no, kidding, kidding. It's a joke.  But we do have some of the best moments from 2016.  And we had a lot of fun in a lot of different ways.  Twig I always think of as our most intellectual show because of because of its hosts.  Let's go way back to the beginning of the year before Stacey Higginbotham joined us as a regular.  Jeff Jarvis is here, of course, our great friend, Gina Trapani and Lindy Johnson.  And as fitting, I had just come back from vacation aboard one of the largest cruise ships in the world.  And we were we were playing with the Theta 360 cam, the 360 degree camera.  And there's a little a little bit here from the boat watch.  But you saw that I didn't bring I did bring a good camera on my cruise and I did.  I took a lot of iPhone pictures, but ultimately most of my pictures were that Rico Theta as the 360 degree camera.  I'm really excited about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you see using that just in general life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's well, I think I did.  You did. Yeah, you did.  This is general life. Yeah.  I'm using quite a bit and I posted on YouTube.  If you go to my Leo Laporte YouTube channel, you can see you can see all the videos.  But what I what I this is it's still not very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to friend envy your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Will you please?  Will you please just envy my life?  Definitely.  The quality is not great.  What's great is, though, that you could put this on Facebook or Google.  People were I was loving the reactions in the comments.  People would say, wait a minute, I turn my phone and the picture turns.  Because if you have an up to date phone with up to date Facebook, your picture will follow your phone's angle and you can look around.  It's very easy to shoot these. You don't have to pan or anything.  You just hold this stick and you just take it pictures as you walk or whatever.  And I wish the quality were better.  I wish it had an external microphone. But you know, the next this is the third generation.  The next one we'll get this guy bumps me over here.  It gets better. But this is the robot bar where the robotic arms, the same arms that are stealing the jobs of American workers everywhere, steal, steal a bartender's job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two bartenders had to work like that.  Although I'm thinking somebody's got to fill those bottles that are hanging from the ceiling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. So those arms are reaching out for those bottles and pouring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So watch, we're going to you order a drink.  This is I loved this. Looks like an iPad. It's an Android device.  It's running a dedicated app.  We'll turn here. I'll jump ahead a little bit. We'll turn around and I'll show you.  So you can order you tap it.  By the way, you're wearing an RF enabled bracelet called the wow band.  Wow. It's like jam.  Wow band.  And you tap the wow band to the which I did about a bunch of times and then and then you can enter in your drink and that will be a sent to the robot bartender.  So there's the drink that I non alcoholic, of course, by the way, adding insult to injury is a $4 drink and then add an 18% tip for the robot.  No, no, no.  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Listen, robot rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Robot rights.  So watch the robot now has a cup in its hand and it's going to it puts it down.  This is going to be my cup and then it contains it has a container and it goes around and it fills it up.  There's a soda in the back and it's going to get some juice from the those hanging bottles or booze bottles.  And the woman is showing me that my name is up here and what drink and what stage the robot is in with the drink is is over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you don't get them while who buses the tables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Humans have the menial jobs, of course, because they aren't they don't allow the robots to roam freely.  That would be dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You gave me 18%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this is a regular Royal Caribbean cruise.  This is this is like this is top drawer stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the reason I went on this boat because I had to go to New Jersey to be on this boat, which is crazy because I went to New Jersey to sail to the Caribbean.  But the reason I went on this boat is because this is a new this is a brand new boat.  This is like this is their state of the art technology.  Gotcha.  It is very exclusive.  There are only five thousand other people on this boat with me.  But the robot bar, you know, it's not too crowded.  You know, it's not it's not jammed with people.  You can look around.  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah, that is amazing.  And then you tap your wow band on the bar when the robot's done and the drink comes sliding out to you.  That way, nobody could steal your drink.  Oh, is that clever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I enjoyed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These faking faking faking phone companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, let's get to it.  We've been holding off.  I've been putting it off.  Jeff and Verizon.  Never a love story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, never, never, never.  And people who ask me, do they ever hook up your Nexus seven?  No, they never did.  So I had my wife's iPad on it and I had my old Pixel still on it.  Stupidly, I hadn't canceled because I wasn't using the LTE on that.  But I had two things on it and I was paid 50 bucks a month for those two things.  30 buck data plus 10 bucks per line.  And suddenly I'm getting it was Christmas time.  So we weren't using either.  Right.  There was some dormant were at home.  And suddenly I get data warnings.  You're going over data.  You're about to go over data.  You went over data.  They are your way over data.  What the hell?  So go on.  And somebody had hacked the account and added or switched the two lines to two iPhone sixes, brought a gig of data, immediately used 2.6 gigs of data.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sigh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hour and a half on the phone dealing with five different people at Verizon.  Stupid sandwich.  Just amazing.  They have no good process for this.  It's their problem.  So they changed my password.  This is not going to happen again, Mr. Jarvis.  We're all fixed up.  All right.  They didn't change the password.  They came back and did it again.  Number two, they didn't fix it up.  Third time I try to kill the Chromebook.  I can't kill that.  It's back again.  I finally said enough.  I want a divorce.  I went to the store and said just kill everything.  I put my wife's iPad onto our AT&T account.  I saved a net of $60 a month by doing this.  And I waved goodbye to Verizon.  Well, two points for this.  So at one point in this, I had to go on my online Verizon thing and set up the account.  And I had to come up with a frigging password.  So the password I wanted was F spelled out Verizon.  And it honest to God, I swear to truth said bad password too easy to guess.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Too obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Too easy to guess that our customers would feel this way at the point at which they're setting up their password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, screw Verizon, same answer.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How hard was the pushback when you said I wanted to cancel everything?  How hard did they push back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they didn't cry or anything.  They just didn't do it.  So then I got a call because I went to Facebook.  They don't have to push back.  They just ignore you.  From a very nice lady.  There's one nice lady who works in Verizon HQ.  And when you're in big trouble on social media, don't we know, right, Lynn?  Don't you advise your people?  Right. She calls you and says, Jarvis, what can we do to help you?  And I said, what you can do to help me?  I said, you're very nice, but your company is the spawn of Satan.  I want a divorce.  I never want to see you again.  The account hasn't died.  I want you to kill the account forever.  And she was very nice and accommodating and did it.  Why is it so hard to have that be the standard for customer service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and why do you have to have half a million Twitter followers to get it done?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So bye-bye, Verizon. Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Verizon Mobile. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, they took out the nice lady big guns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I got the nice lady from Comcast a couple of years ago because I was tweeting  and really unhappy with the customer service, as you know.  And the funny thing is I thought the nice lady was going to take care of me.  Mostly she just basically said, could you stop tweeting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, just please, just stop. Please stop tweeting about this.  Please stop tweeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I thought, well, this has really changed.  We're from Frank Eliason and Comcast Cares.  When they really did, you know, like they said, OK, let's see if we can fix this.  They've really come full circle now to just, you know,  all we really want you to do is to stop talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Like, what do we have to do to get you to stop tweeting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're not going to fix anything. We just want you to stop tweeting, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The nice ladies don't get paid enough.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They need to pay more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. She's very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they actually hire people who sound nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, incredibly. And I didn't want it with no one in this.  I went psycho with no one. But I did say I'm at my edge, folks.  Yeah. I could go over anything.  This is easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you went to AT&T?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was already on AT&T. It's where my unlimited account is.  Oh, OK.  And I had shared stuff there. So I just added it there.  And I reduced a gig and I saved money and it's wonderful.  So I'm happy.  I serve Verizon Fios.  And I'm happy with that all in all.  But Verizon Mobile is just spod of Satan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they all suck. Come on, can we just admit this?  They all do.  It's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The people in the AT&T store,  one friend of mine named Hugo has been very helpful through Twitter.  A friend of AT&T.  I just found them. Yes, they're all problems.  The companies, but all in all, the AT&T people I've dealt with  have all in all been nicer and more competent.  There's a different culture there.  The Verizon culture is we're number one.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you are not yet a subscriber to our Twitter newsletter,  good news, you can be a charter subscriber.  You can get the very first newsletter which goes out Sunday.  If you go to twit.tv slash newsletter and subscribe,  it's double opt in.  So we're not going to opt you in.  You got to send an email and click a link.  We'll send you an email. You click a link.  What is that?  Some words just flew in.  Were those left off the newsletter?  And now they flew right off the lower third.  I've never seen that happen.  They escaped.  twit.tv slash newsletter is the place if you'd like to get our newsletter.  I will be writing little blurbs in there and others.  It'll be mostly a look at what's ahead in the week on the network.  twit.tv slash newsletter.  Somebody tie those letters down.  We've had so many great guests this week in Google.  I think of ours, Technic, as Ron Amadio.  Man, he knows everything there is to know about Android.  And every once in a while we get a visit.  We haven't had one lately because Matt's gone to work for the federal government.  Maybe he'll be back soon, like in a couple of weeks.  But one of my favorites is one of the earliest Googlers.  Matt is, I think, employee 11, something like that.  Matt Cutts.  He, for many years, was in charge of keeping spammy links out of Google search results.  He's on the sabbatical for Google.  And as I mentioned, I think he's working for Code for America or something like that.  But he was on the show back in March when we started talking about how Twitch works.  As usual, I'm completely befuddled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's a perfect segue to the next story down the row a little bit.  Twitch is now giving Julia Child.  This is just weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Julia Child channel on Twitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Okay, here's how we take a chicken and cut it into quarters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wow. I think it's nice and hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, this is definitely before my time.  The thing they did before this was Bob Ross.  And that was pretty cool because he's a chill guy in painting and it's interesting.  That was neat. That was really neat.  Yeah, it's just cool to see him paint.  But this, I don't know, you don't get to eat the food afterwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I grew up watching this show, The French Chef.  It was really the first cooking show on PBS and she was a very unlikely superstar.  I met her. She's very tall.  Was very tall.  And every bit is kind of kooky as she kind of came across.  This is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's great is it's very, very live.  There's no...  Oh yeah.  I mean, things happen.  She stuck a spoon in a mixer last night and it went flying across the set.  You've been watching it all day, huh?  I was watching it last night, yeah.  She was making some sort of orange butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's totally not a...  Because nobody knew about cooking shows. She invented it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm purposely hiding the comment section because there's a lot of stuff coming up that's weird.  But it's interesting to watch.  A lot of the younger audience are like, whoa, this is so cool.  What is that?  Why is the video black and white?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This with Twitch chat has got to be like the best thing ever. Come on.  Yeah, I'm not showing it. We don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  What kind of a filter is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing everybody uses now on Twitch is these avatars that are people's heads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like there's a Bob Ross head.  And I imagine there'll be a Julian Childhead eventually.  I don't get that. So do you see all the heads going by?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Do you understand that, Jason? You're a young person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not at all. Young person on set would be this person right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, you know what it is? It's a culture. It's a subculture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is. And this is the thing. They announced YouTube gaming.  And Twitch has all of this culture stuff that YouTube gaming is not going to have.  That's where the community is.  But yeah, all of those emotes, they're emotes and they mean...  They mean something.  Right. They all mean some kind of emotion.  The one everybody does is Kappa, which is some guy's head.  He's like a Twitch developer and he's making kind of a sarcastic face.  So that's for sarcasm. And there's a million other ones.  Yeah. I think if you really want to get into it, you can mouse over it probably and you'll get...  You should get maybe a tool tip.  That's the what face.  You can look it up and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's Baby Rage, but that one's the what face.  It's just its own set of emotes.  The Kramer one, they call that the PogChamp.  Right.  I know what Pogs are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  PogChamp is a guy and there's a video somewhere.  There was like a YouTube video of a guy making that expression and the Twitch staff thought it was funny.  So they just cut his head out and stuck it in there.  I feel so old.  But yeah, you can know your meme. Go look it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's what happened in the Appalachias.  When you cut people off from the rest of the world for a hundred years, they develop their own language.  And that's what's happened on Twitch. These are people who never get outside anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know what you mean.  What you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's so wrong. That's so wrong.  It's the Appalachia of the internet is what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  This is one I wasn't here for.  I've seen it many times and I kick myself that I wasn't here.  I was taking some time off in June and Jason Howell filled in for me.  Jeff and Gina and Ron Richards are on the show.  And Jason was trying to do a little public service announcement encouraging everybody to turn on two factor authentication when things went horribly wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I did something I should not have done, you guys.  I was like, I'm going to go ahead and do this two factor thing.  Sometimes the best things happen live though.  Like when I finally did it and hit OK, suddenly my Chrome OS said I needed to re-authenticate, right?  Because like, I'm protected by two factor. I clicked the button to do it. It powered off.  So then I powered it back on and now I'm stuck at the sign and waiting to receive the code.  Here's where I messed up because the number I gave it was my Google Voice number.  My Google Voice number is on the other side of the authentication.  Oh, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Isn't your Google Voice number, isn't your phone receiving Google Voice number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not anymore.  What about the flip? Can you go to Google Voice on the flip?  Oh boy, probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honestly, I'm happy this happened live because if anything, I could at least tell you not to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's watch Jason lock himself out of every single one of his devices live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see. I just need to get to Voice. That's all I need to do.  Come on, Google. This one time mess up and let me in.  Let's see here. It says sign out, sign back in. Yeah, so this is synced now.  I can't believe I did this for the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sign out, sign back in. It powered down. Yeah, no, it's going to be the same issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not going to be able to get it.  Why did I give it my Google Voice number? Why? Because that's what I give everything is my Google Voice number.  But that yeah, but I can't get the Google Voice number code that was sent via SMS.  So then great explainer. What are alternatives?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So wait, OK, let's OK, let's think this through you guys.  So the the the ways in which you could access your Google Voice SMS messages, isn't there isn't there in Gmail a chat label?  Is that still true? Your Google Voice messages?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, a lot of things have changed with Google Voice, but I mean, the problem is in any way that I would get access to that.  I'm going to need to the two factor to log in. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you're logged in on one. Are you logged in on your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it said it needed to re authenticate there as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, no. It just went away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You kidding me? It said it and then it went away.  Hold on, hold on, hold on. I know I can do this. It won't.  OK, because I think I got it. I think I got it.  Hold on, hold on. I hope this works.  You can you can vamp if you like. I've got to pace this.  I think I might have it. I think I might have it.  The danger of two factor right here.  No, you know, and part of it is my misunderstanding, but I can understand why I why I didn't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you ask for the printout of the 10 codes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, this is that's pretty much what I got was 10 10 codes because I've requested them from everywhere.  OK, so I'm going to sign in again. I think I can do this.  Do to do do do do.  This is a cautionary tale entering my password.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Three hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The voice wrinkle is definitely a wrinkle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I use my Google voice number primarily.  But when you set up, you know, when I set up my backup phone number, I have to use my I use my like native phone number because, you know,  my Google voice number is attached to my my Google account.  But I'm always so worried that I'm going to forget that and just get myself locked out.  But you're going to resolve this, Jason. We're going to figure this out together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're with you. OK, so so the verification code that you are sent, that is the thing that you paste over there.  Right. So I got that right.  Why didn't you accept it? I don't know.  Yeah, it's weird. It's not accepting it when I put it in.  All right. I'll continue. Actually, I can't even move the show along.  I can't even see our dock anymore.  Oh, you guys.  It seemed like a good idea at the time.  Let me try again.  Audio listeners like, wow, you suck.  Yeah, no, it's just not working.  Tell me this is something that Leo would do. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on. When you when you sign up for two factor, you have the option to get 10 permanent codes that you can put in your wallet and use.  That's I should you ever need a code. I should have done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You didn't do that. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you can't even get to your account dashboard now to do that, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says, try another way to sign in.  When I do that, the only thing there is send a text message to your phone because that's the only thing I have sent set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, so, Jason, you never got to the code that went to Google Voice.  That's what you need. You need to get the code that went to Google Voice.  Is it is your voice number forwarding anywhere?  Is there any device that that it forwarded to or might still be in the shade or wait a minute, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you have the Google Voice app on your phone that there's no way the Google Voice app is updated to support two factor authentication yet?  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that app hasn't been updated for years.  I do have it on here, but I don't think I was signed in because, oh, boy, it's not going to work again.  Yeah, it's going to do the whole changes thing.  Is there a story you guys want to talk about?  I figure this out.  So, so let me just tell you this.  Two factor authentication is really effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, Goggles is still around.  I apologize.  It is.  Yeah.  And it does.  Yeah, it does the same thing.  It has search from camera.  Get goggles results for pictures you take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you've enabled location in the settings app as well as in Google settings, they will send location data.  OK, so now it does.  It's you take a picture or something and it'll it'll it'll figure out where you recognize your logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  That's exciting.  Oh, that's good.  I tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not even doing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, maybe it's really gone.  Maybe it doesn't work.  It just pretended to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, analyzing activate camera light.  Oh, my God.  It worked.  Oh, you're kidding.  It says this week in tech MP3 edition Petaluma landmark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, you're a landmark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OMG.  Thank you, Goggles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Welcome to the landmark.  Stacy's face.  OK, now we're going to do Stacy's face because she's a landmark in Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What a cute smile.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Let's see.  Wait a minute.  Now, what happened there?  OK, activate camera light.  Look, I'm going to do it again.  What's going on?  It's kind of slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's it's rejecting my face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You're not going to like this at all.  I now know why Google thinks you're a boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I that's so mean.  I apologize.  I apologize for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is so mean.  You know, it's the short hair.  I think it's the short.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not wearing lipstick.  I mean, there's a lot of things wrong here from a Google perspective.  Although it did it put me in glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did put your glasses, which is really weird.  It's really weird.  Your own face, your own face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm installing it now.  Should I do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I'll do my own face.  Why not?  We are such idiots.  God, people turn in the show to learn something instead of going, hey, here's this five year old program we've just rediscovered.  Look what it'll do.  Yeah, Leo, it did that five years ago.  You nitwit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, next show will stick hats and funny filters over our faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Done that.  Yeah, I should do it to you, Jeff, because it probably would you think it would think you're a woman?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably.  I know it'll think I'm dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was like, not with that beard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18

Transcript:  Amish, this is very odd.  I'm going to wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to do you again, Stacy.  I don't think we did.  I don't think we we did you justice.  I think I think I'm about to be humiliated again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just feel we could do better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I don't know.  I just you know, maybe if I just took it straight on instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like how it does.  It does is analyzing, analyzing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're just we're just not landmarks.  That's that's the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It worked with what's weird is it worked with the logo.  Yeah, I think you have to be a landmark or maybe I wonder I should take a picture of  a famous person with this and see if they they're recognized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, George Clooney and it will pull up me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be pretty impressive.  I don't know how George would feel about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I'm like screenshot that and give it to Jeff.  It would make his day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something happened in July that changed the world.  Really one of the most dramatic events in technology history.  The release of Pokemon Go.  We couldn't stop talking about it for for weeks.  Of course, we have now.  There were some people who couldn't even stop playing it.  Watch.  So both of you, I thought for sure this would be the first show I've done all week that  doesn't mention Pokemon Go.  I thought there's no way Jeff and Kevin.  Yeah, there's no no not old.  Just serious.  I thought there's no way these guys these are serious guys.  They're playing this dumb game.  How could you not?  You were saying, Jeff, that you see people playing in Manhattan everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it's really amazing because I walked on the street and now I see somebody standing  there.  Number one, you can tell if they're doing the motion.  Oh, yeah, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You really can tell because if somebody's playing Pokemon Go, they keep their phone  out.  Yeah, because they're waiting for the buzz that says a Pokemon is nearby.  So if you're like me and you were surreptitious, you're walking, but your phone is there.  When you feel the buzz then and then you start seeing this as they play the game.  Oh, wait a minute.  I just got a buzz.  And seriously.  And so and then you start and I'll show you I'll demonstrate the motion because I'm actually  going to fight a wild Zubat.  And then you see this kind of finger up motion as they shoot the Pokeballs at the Zubat and  try to take it home for their collection.  So this game came out a week ago on today on a week ago today on Wednesday afternoon  took everybody by surprise, except I guess people were really paying close attention.  Somebody just got something.  Something appeared.  Yeah.  That's the cry of the wild something.  Yeah.  So you hear their cry and then you're Kevin's just playing the game for the first time.  I'm a lousy shot.  Yeah, it's hard.  So you notice I turned off the augmented reality, which was why I think that's part of the fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of it, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the fun of it.  But it also saps battery life.  Oh, boy, does it?  Yeah.  Because your camera's on all the time.  So you could turn that off and that will help.  And then it also it makes it a little bit harder.  I find it's easier, at least for me, without the augmented reality.  There you go.  You caught it, Kevin.  Nice.  So that's added to your Pokey collection.  You can now turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was in Facebook's New York headquarters yesterday.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got an E-Enix snake spelled backwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's a really good one.  E-Cans.  E-Cans.  Keep the E-Cans.  Yeah.  So your idea is you're going to get these.  These are baby Pokemon that you evolve to stronger and stronger, sometimes once or twice.  And then.  You caught another one.  There's a bunch of them around your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's because I just signed up so they were easy ones, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, not necessarily.  Usually you have to walk.  That's the virtue of this game.  I mean, they have another version for Brits.  It's not.  It's only US, Australia, Canada.  Carson told me he rolls out today in Germany, which is surprising because, frankly, the  servers have been very unreliable because so many people are signing up in those three  countries.  And Niantic, the company that made this, which is a former Google company, has said we're  not going to roll it out as fast as we thought globally.  However, the thing people can do, and I don't recommend this, you can download on Android,  sideload an APK from one of your...  Can you turn that down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I never thought I'd say that.  He's enjoying the game a little too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the biggest events for me this year and for this week in Google was the addition  of the amazing, the wonderful Stacey Higginbotham to our team.  Stacey, I became aware of Stacey when she was an editor at GigaOM and was one of the  most astute writers and editors I'd ever written or read.  She was writing, I was reading.  I'd ever read.  Really, really good.  She left when GigaOM folded, went to Fortune, and to our great good Fortune, Left Fortune  has done her own thing.  She's doing an IoT podcast.  She's writing about the Internet of Things, and she appears most weeks on This Week in  Google.  We are really thrilled to have her.  Here's Stacey emitting what has now become her trademark exclamation.  You'll know what I mean in a sec.  Well, it's like me.  I have like probably four or $5,000 worth of Sonos equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  Oh, oh, oh.  Did you guys, that was me being excited.  That was so exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounded.  So this is a common thing.  Can I make that my ringtone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Please, I want that ringtone.  Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is such a common question.  I have to tell people about it.  So a company called J-Star.  You're just the greatest.  Thank you, Stacey.  I love you.  They showed a video for an Echo skill that is not yet approved that will let you control  your Sonos from your Amazon Echo.  So if you Google, it's a YouTube video from the company that does Josh.ai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's not an official interface?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not approved yet.  They've made the skill.  But it's not from Sonos.  It's not from Sonos.  Why not?  Because Sonos doesn't have their API put together yet.  Anyway, there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Third party app, Josh, will bring a few new skills and different voices to Echo.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the Sonos thing is kind of at the end.  So the first part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is Josh like an alternative?  Like, is it in the Echo?  Is it in my Echo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Josh is actually a home control with voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's not in my Echo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's a skill that they've developed and they're just waiting for approval.  But it's an Echo skill.  They've designed it to be, but Amazon has to approve it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm saying things like ask Josh to play Beyonce Lemonade on my Sonos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  On my Jet Plus so I can control it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  And that's the part of the Amazon Echo that doesn't work.  We need artificial intelligence and we need Alexa choosing the skill.  If I have to remember it's secret.  Yeah, Echo.  Sorry.  The virtual assistant that shall not be named.  That should be picking the skill, not me.  I can't remember all of these commands.  Well, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with you.  And that's what Google and Apple are about to do where they disintermediate.  They are actually vice versa.  They intermediate.  They become your ombudsman and go out and get what you need.  And they know what apps you have and they know what skills you need.  And you just ask her.  Well, that's how Echo should be too, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  And Viv will be like that too, which is...  Right, viv.ai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thanks to Nigel Town in our chat room.  The Stacey Higginbotham ringtone.  Yay!  Turn on my audio.  Turn on my audio.  You got it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Audience, you are the best.  Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Put that on your daughter's...  Oh, oh, oh.  Nexus 5X.  Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, lord.  Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nigel Town, I think I love you, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to put it on your own phone.  Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think I'll give that to my husband.  He'll just be like, what just happened here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sneaking onto his phone tonight.  Yeah, he'll be like, Stacey's eating something again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is so endearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, well, it is endearing is a good word for it.  I only have a minute or two.  It's the show title too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is the show title.  Oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Oh, lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You saw the story of the guy who's maybe had saved his life after we had the challenge.  That's such BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's such BS.  I think Elon planted that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It said the Tesla drove him to the emergency room.  Oh, no, no, no.  It drove him to the exit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He had to take over then.  Couldn't go all the way.  But he just decided that you understand that the nav system on a Tesla is not in any way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  connected to the autopilot, right?  Right.  So it didn't drive him anywhere.  It just kept him from he just stopped having to drive into something.  Yes.  And he at some point had to sit up and go, oh, there's the exit to the emergency room  and drive the rest of the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The argument is that if he didn't have that aid, if he had to drive the whole way, he  couldn't have done it.  He would have had to stop and get an ambulance.  It would have taken too long.  He would have conked.  Right.  So the argument is that this got closer to the hospital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it sounds like an attempt to counter.  Yes, I think so.  All the negative publicity myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My mom, she actually had like crazy thing happen to her that caused internal bleeding.  She passed out, ran her car into a guardrail.  She survived.  That wouldn't have happened with a Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But with the Tesla, that wouldn't have happened if she had autopilot auto steer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what I wonder is, Stacey, so if God forbid your mom had lost consciousness, would the  Tesla have kept would have just kept going?  Yes.  At some point in time, it stops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't it stop?  Well, if she loses consciousness and her hands aren't in the wheel, eventually it will slow  down and stop or it will at first alerts you.  And I think also if the road gets more curvy, it alerts you.  I've gone long distances without it telling me to put my hands on the wheel.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They say it's supposed to.  But yeah, I've heard from people who are like, doesn't seem to me you don't have autopilot  in yours, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is a shame because I pass out a lot.  So it could be handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think those are called the vapors.  I'm a swooner.  Oh, my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's new on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something exciting just happened, ladies and gentlemen, for the latest.  We go to Stacey Higginbotham on a street somewhere in Austin, Texas.  Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, this is from Scooter X in the chat room.  And I was not caring about aloe as much.

Transcript:  Sorry, Carson.  Avada Kedavra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lumos.  Oh, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It won't kill anybody for you, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, I don't know where we're going to use this article, but I think I'm going  to use it right now.  I bookmarked it and I think we should.  This is this is this is the this is the unknown danger of surgical lasers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  During surgery after the patient farted in the middle of the operation, while the doctors  operated on the woman's cervix, she apparently passed gas and then ended up being burned  after the laser ignited the fart, resulting in a fiery explosion.  This is not a joke.  I cannot believe that's not a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And this happened at the Tokyo Medical University Hospital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The patient's intestinal gas leaked into the space of the operation ignited with the  irradiation of the laser, the burning spread eventually reaching the surgical drape and  causing a fire.  There you have it, folks.  Patient burned by.  I feel like they must have been doing like ablations and stuff inside people's like  abdominal cavities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's what you're saying is it's shocking.  This hasn't happened sooner.  Well, I feel like people would like we should know about this.  This I smell Snopes.  Yeah, I it does come from the New York Daily News.  How trustworthy is the New York Daily News?  What do you think, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  GQ magazine that gets the motto metal floss.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Who else run on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, everybody's probably Snopes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see Snopes.  All right.  What does Snopes say?  Two days ago, Snopes says the scroll down.  Snopes, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now it's hanging up on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Experts charged with investigating the incident ruled that there were no other flammable  materials present at the time of surgery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  The doctor said that the patient's intestinal gas leaked into the space of the operation  and the flammable materials present at the time of surgery and the equipment that was  used did not malfunction, leading them to believe the woman's flatulence was the culprit.  God, this poor woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what makes Howard Stern so successful because farts are just funny.  You can't help but laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is our new segment on the show when technology strikes.  What does Snopes say?  I think it just crashed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you look it up?  It's a fart laser fire and you'll see Snopes down about five.  I just crashed my Chromebook.  What do they say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just reported it.  Look, it's from the Asahi Shimbun.  This is from the Asahi Shimbun, which is a very...  I mean, this is the New York Times of Japan.  If Snopes is repeating the rumor...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, Snopes is repeating it.  I think that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's not...  Let's get PolitiFact on it.  I really didn't want to do that story.  You notice I held it to the very end of the show.  Oh my, oh my.  That could well be an early appearance of fake news.  I don't know, but it's a great story.  As we continue on, I hope you're enjoying our best of 2016 for this week in Google.  Our show...  Coming up, Jonathan Abrams, the founder of Friendster, is going to talk about Google Amp.  Actually, we had a debate all year long about Google's Amp technology.  We'll take a look at Facebook Live.  We've got some Google I.O. stuff.  But before we do that, I want to mention our sponsor.  And I'm really thrilled that they're here with us during this holiday week.  It's typically a very slow time.  And a lot of times, you know, my experience has been in radio and TV.  You don't have many advertisers the week after Christmas.  They figure everybody's all shopped out.  But Blue Apron is with us, and I'm really glad.  And you know, I think it makes sense because as we've all, I hope, had a chance to get  together with loved ones, family, and friends.  And shared this holiday season.  I'm sure you're still doing that.  One of the things that comes to mind is you kind of get reminded, we should do this more often.  This is great.  We should eat together more often.  That's what Blue Apron is all about.  Its mission is to make incredible home cooking accessible to everybody while supporting a  more sustainable food system with the highest standard for ingredients and the best  building a community of home chefs.  There is some, Michael Pollan has said this in his book, I think it was called Cooking.  One of the few things humans do that no other animal, no other beast does is cook.  And sitting down around a meal is such a significant event in a family, in a relationship.  Breaking bread, we even have a term for it.  Breaking bread together.  Blue Apron is, kind of adds that one little piece because you can do it at a restaurant.  You can get together at a restaurant.  That's fine.  But when you, trust me, I love doing this.  I love to cook.  When you make a meal for your loved ones, you put all that love and caring into it and  they enjoy it.  It just is so satisfying.  Blue Apron makes that easy by delivering you every ingredient you need to make an amazing  meal either for two or for a family.  They have two different plans.  With ingredients that are fresh, never frozen, even the meats and fish, because it's a refrigerated  box, they come to your door.  No waste.  You get exactly what you need.  No more, no less.  They give you a beautiful, you know, eight by 10 recipe card, eight and a half by 11,  I guess, recipe card.  It's laminated with all the recipe, the instructions, pictures.  They even have additional videos if you need more help on the website.  It really is a great meal.  It's like a kit, like a kit that you get in the mail that you put it together and you  add one ingredient, you add your love.  And then it's so wonderful to share it with family and friends.  And man, these menus, whoo, potato and artichoke quiche with romaine and orange salad, cod  en papillote.  That is a technique you will use again and again with fricca and spinach, steak and gruyere,  pepper corn sauce with kale and roasted potato.  I can go on and on.  Actually, you can find out for yourself if you go to blueapron.com slash twit.  Take a look at the menu.  Pick your next meals.  Your first three meals are free.  You always pick the meals you want.  Yes, they have vegetarian options, options for dietary restrictions.  Go to blueapron.com.  Pick your meals.  Get your first three meals free with free shipping.  And Blue Apron does ship to 99% of the continental US.  You know, there are some limitations because that's a refrigerated box.  But get it if you can.  It's so great.  Free shipping, first three meals free, blueapron.com slash twit.  Blueapron.com slash twit.  I think they're smart because we've all kind of experienced now being with the family.  And now you want to do that some more.  Blue Apron families cook three times a day.  And you can get it for free.  You can get it for free.  You can get it for free.  You can get it for free.  And now you want to do that some more.  Blue Apron families cook three times, on average, three times more often together.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Blueapron.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for the support of this week in Google.  Now, where were we?  Let's see.  We can start with this one.  This is from earlier this year, right at the beginning of the year.  You know, Google's business is advertising.  Apple wanted to get into that business.  Turns out, didn't work out so well for them.  Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's go back to Apple for one second if we could.  I think we might have missed this story.  I think it's critical.  Apple killed its ad service, fired its ad staff.  And what's key about this is, and I've said this for some time, Apple failed at advertising.  And thus, Apple is now motivated to pull the rug out from everyone else who depends on advertising.  So watch for Apple to get more and more hostile to advertising on mobile, which is where everything is going to go.  And there's going to be more, I'll bet they're going to make ad blockers defaulted.  And they're just going to say, yeah, to publishers.  They're making a virtue out of a necessity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I think the truth is, I had failed.  And it was, they were putting too many restrictions on advertisers.  It was too much work.  There were a lot of reasons.  It was the little banner ads you see in apps and things like that, oftentimes a full page takeover in apps.  So they're shutting it down.  But what they're doing is, I agree with you, Jeff, is going to double down on this, oh, but we're all for user privacy.  And obviously, running an ad network is kind of counter to that notion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think you're right.  And it's the thumb up the nose of, or other bodily orifice of Google.  Yeah.  It's the way Apple can fight Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's, you need not say a thumb up the nose.  Merely a way to position themselves as the privacy company.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they can actively hurt Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd be very careful about thumbing Google's nose as Microsoft has learned to its detriment, I think.  Now, after the Gmail man ads, put them in an awkward position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It was interesting to me that Microsoft for a while in Internet Explorer was proposing blocking any third party thing that was included for more than like three sites, which would have the net effect of blocking like all analytics and a ton of different ad things.  And so Microsoft pulled back from that based on what a lot of people said.  But it seems like Apple, to Jeff's point, has kind of at least enabled that or, you know, a couple steps of indirection enabled that.  And what's also interesting to me is people love Patreon, which takes, I think, five percent cut and people sort of chafe that maybe Apple taking a 30 percent cut of purchases.  And so it's interesting to think about that spectrum of like, where does the love start?  You know, and where does it become a business transaction?  Yeah.  Yeah.  People love CD Baby and those kinds of businesses.  And maybe it's just that it's a small percentage.  I'm not sure.  Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, I think that's right.  I think there is a there is a transition here from what you can support with what?  Because part of what we've learned from Patreon and Kickstarter and other systems like that is that actually people are willing to pay for things, but they're willing to pay different amounts of money for different things.  And that depends on how much they like the thing and how much disposable income they have.  And whereas, and Kevin, they're not necessarily paying.  Sorry.  So can I finish?  Whereas advertising assumes that nobody wants to pay very much and commoditizes them all down to a uniform amount per person and spreads it out over that.  So in effect, it only actually does work if you have millions of people watching.  Whereas Patreon, Kickstarter and other things of that ilk can work if you have thousands of people watching, if they if they care enough.  And I think that's a that's an interesting transformation of the media scene and one that hasn't fully sunk in yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All I was going to say, sorry, sorry for the lag here.  Paying for is is a critical phrase here because because they're not paying for access on Patreon, really.  They're paying to support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because if you don't contribute, you get the podcast or the music or whatever.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  So that's a supporting versus paying paying to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, that's it's very limited what you can do with that.  I'll be honest with you, because we tried to do that for several years at the beginning.  Now, of course, we didn't have the infrastructure of Patreon, but there was no way I could have built Twitter without advertising.  Right.  There's just nobody was going to give enough money to do what we've done.  Even when we sold bricks to build the studio, we as many as we sold, we sold 1800 bricks.  It only went about a quarter of the way toward building the studio.  Right.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But you are you're on you are on the other end of that spectrum in that you do have you're in the millions.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you want to have that spectrum, you have to have a spectrum of monetization options.  If you're if you want everything to be small and user, you know, the patronage system is a great system.  But there's only a few Michelangelo's that can be, you know, and I think even fewer Medici's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But there's even fewer New York Times is the point is that I think you can think if you frame it that way around, you've got it.  You've got it slightly backwards in that there are there are many people who could have their artistic work.  Right. We want many, many, many, many. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Whereas whereas there is this sort of there should be only one tweet.  But no, but there is this there is this I had this I went to the social computing suppose in New York last week and had one of the sessions there was TV people talking about how they use social media.  And it was fascinating to hear their point of view on it, which is that their point of view is that TV is a wonderful thing because it enables us to do these these large scale things.  And it's like, well, it enables you to do those large scale things.  But to say that the net doesn't enable that is to miss the point that it enables a gigantic range of things that TV cuts off, which it's and it's very hard for those two mindsets to meet.  Because if you are if you are successful in, you know, in big media, it's it's it's difficult to take the kind of leap that you took Leo and say, OK, I can do this myself on my own time and on my own scale.  It's not a trivial thing to do.  It's actually very hard.  And for them to it is easier for them to say what we need is to find the people who are doing something in the in the in this sort of in this trivial net media over here and make them into TV stars.  And that's that's the sort of the mindset you get.  Yeah, especially the best to the original Max Hedron movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You actually are Max Hedroning right now, which is kind of an amazing, amazing kind of juxtaposition.  One of the things we talked a lot about is Google AMP.  And I really have misgivings.  I still do about Google AMP.  But we brought in as many people as we could to talk me off the ledge, including Jonathan Abrams.  He's the founder of Friendster.  You may remember that name and is currently CEO of a news service that I use every single day called Nuzle.  He explained why AMP is a good thing.  So here's kind of my issue.  The thing that concerns me is, you know, when I hear that image tags are different, Google has specified a new way of doing image tags.  JavaScript is only allowed if Google allows it.  And certain snippets are allowed and not and many, many, many more not.  Well, everything else is not.  It is.  I understand the desire to do this and the value of it for users.  But I worry that Google has invented a new kind of HTML without in the involvement of standards bodies just by talking to publishers.  That is in effect.  And this is what I said in the tweet, forking the Web.  So I wanted to give you a chance, A, to tell me what I got wrong, because that was your initial tweet.  And B, is that not the case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't think it's the case because it's not really a fork of the web.  And the reality is AMP is the web.  It is a alternate HTML file, still HTML, still loaded VHDP.  And essentially, it's just trying to standardize things more.  So instead of all these different publishers having their own set of redundant bloated JavaScript libraries, Google's saying here is a single runtime that we're going to try to make solve all these needs and then address the bloat problem that's been causing so much problems for people on their mobile devices.  And it is an open project.  I mean, there's a GitHub repo.  And whether you're on the client side or the publisher side, you can go and contribute and talk to them about that.  Whether someday it becomes part of a standard thing, I don't know.  I doubt Google would be opposed to that.  But even now, you know, it really is more open than any of the alternatives.  And the alternatives are some of these closed platforms from some of these other big companies.  And the reality is if Nuzle wanted to say, OK, publishers already publishing their content for Apple News or Facebook's articles, great, let's just show that in Nuzle.  We can't do that.  So that to me is really not open.  And whereas AMP is something that we were able to be part of.  And if publishers publish their stuff in AMP, if somebody in Croatia publish something in AMP and then and then some startup in New York builds some new app that supports AMP to companies that have never even heard of, it's just going to work.  So that's true of any fork as soon as somebody supports it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But look what's prohibited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Leo, let me try this on you.  I think the difference is that a fork would mean that you'd be cut out and you couldn't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, not at all.  That's not what a fork means.  A fork means that you take some.  So it would fork HTML that you have a standard.  And then you decided Google's decided that instead of image will use AMP.  It's not a subset.  It's a replacement.  It's not really.  So HTML 4.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I mean, that was kind of like a fork of HTML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that was W3C proposed.  That was through a standards body.  But HTML has evolved.  I don't I don't have a problem with it evolving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But the reality is Microsoft and Netscape and all those companies had did fork HTML and added proprietary things that eventually flow back into standards.  In this case, Google's not even doing that.  In this case, AMP is really simply just an HTML page.  It is an it is a you know, here's a JavaScript library that you can run in a standard browser in a standard HTML page instead of a proprietary JavaScript library from this publisher or one from all the other companies.  It's a it's a it's a standard one.  But it's still it's still it's still JavaScript running on an HTML page.  It's not really a new kind of HTML, really.  Well, you can't use IMG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to use AMP dash IMG.  You can't use object param applet embed form prohibited prohibited.  You can use whatever you want to use, but it won't be an app page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not going to be as fast.  No, it won't be an app.  Yes, you can do whatever you want, but it's not an app page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But being an app page.  Here's where it becomes a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's where it becomes a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And remember, this is the idea is that the AMP page is a alternative version of something that exists in regular alternative version that is from Google and is promoted in the Google search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not to me the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  AMP per se.  They don't favor AMP per se.  They do favor speed and AMP is fast, but they don't favor AMP per se.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So if somebody came out with their own AMP-like faster way of doing things, that would also get the benefit to Google's search rankings.  But it really isn't technically it's not a fork.  Technically, it really just is an HTML page with a but you know, it's like using jQuery instead of rewriting your own jQuery like library.  This time it's a you know, it's something that's that's been provided but is open because there is a GitHub repo and people can can go in there and see it all and contribute.  But I think it's also important to think about this in the context of the different realistic options.  So, you know, option one is these proprietary platforms, which really are going back to like the CompuServe and AOL days.  These are these truly closed platforms.  You know, option two is that everybody just starts using ad blockers or using the reader mode in Safari or Firefox and stripping all the branding and business model stuff out of the pages because they're just so frustrated by all the bloat and the problems.  And I don't think those are those are really great options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is the new this they turn this on today, right?  And Mark Zuckerberg did a live feed of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chris Cox did two live feeds.  I see he was just on with Jorge Ramos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he's the guy behind it, I think.  Chris Cox is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and much, much, much, much credit here to Fiji Simo.  Simo, who is the head of she does all kinds of product stuff, including new stuff, but she's been really absolutely nose to the grindstone since she got back from maternity leave on video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now you might say this is a job with this.  Just a me to product.  I mean, because this is Meerkat and Periscope kind of did this to.  In fact, Facebook even did this Facebook mentions, which was available only to the.  Which camera show I should look at this camera Facebook mentions, which was available only to the didgerrity for some time and then was open to the public.  But you had to use a separate application.  Then they put it in Facebook.  But this is different.  This is different.  This is more like Meerkat or Periscope, because you can see we've got comments going scrolling up here and I can I can I can do a thumbs up on a comment.  We also have up here account and it's live.  And I should point out I'm doing this on an iPad because you need iOS to do it.  It's not available on Android yet, but it does work on the iPad.  And I should point out that it's rock solid.  If you saw, I mean, even Periscope and it was working for you too.  Right, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, show show. Yeah, show you.  Do you have your feed laptop screen?  Yeah.  So go to your laptop screen.  You get me as if I'm on.  Now compare the quality of that.  Now go to me on there.  Now look how much better the you look better.  The less pink I am and more human and flesh colored on Facebook Live than on Skype.  Now, what are you using?  I thought you didn't have an iPhone.  Right. So I'm using my my Nexus 6P.  The front facing.  Oh, so it does work on Android.  I'm using mentions.  Oh, because you're using the old the old product, which has been upgraded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Looks like yours.  It looks like yours. Yeah, they've upgraded it then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But yeah, Skype is so much worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But because I'll tell you why, because Skype's doing it in real time.  In fact, we have to use Skype so that you and I can converse.  True. In real time.  This is not a conversation medium.  There is about five, ten seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Groups. If you go to the post that announces all the new features, one is they're going to allow.  Well, at least at least you can do video to a closed group.  I don't know if you can do group talk or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's the this is competing more than with just Periscope and Meerkat.  This is also competing with Facebook's Hangouts.  It's Google's Hangouts. I'm sorry, Google Hangouts.  Wow, that's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So live for groups and events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it's just to. Well, you know, who's using it right now.  Timely, Loic Lemur, who, of course, is a good friend, entrepreneur, founder of Seismic, which was, you know, video messaging.  He he did a conference for years called Loweb in Paris, and he sold that.  He's now doing a new conference called Leaders, Lea, D, E, R, Lea, D, E, dot, R, S.  And he's he's been streaming today from his leaders conference in Paris.  With some big names to Reid Hoffman.  So the week is an interesting way to do a conference, isn't it?  It really is. It really is.  Especially since he charged like eight hundred bucks to go see to go in person.  But you'd probably prefer to go in person because you got a chance to network and meet people.  And this I think is a great way to promote an event.  I mean, look, everybody's now doing that.  Google streams most of I.O. face or Microsoft just stream most of build.  Of course, you still have an incentive to pay thousands of dollars to go and do it in person.  But if you can't, it's a schmooze.  But if you can't, this makes sense for conferences.  He had Phil Libon on the founder of Evernote, who's now become a venture capitalist.  That was earlier today. Pretty impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you could also broadcast just to a group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So like a closed group, you can invite a group on Facebook events.  You know why they do that, though? They do that for family, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would imagine. But also companies.  Don't forget Facebook for work. They're trying to push that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what, Loic is not doing this as leaders.  He's as part of his leaders conference. That's not till next month.  This is promotional for his leaders conference.  So he sat down with Phil and they're doing a teaser.  And he's used he used mentions for this.  So is it I mean, look at Meerkat went went bad.  Periscope. I don't see a huge adoption.  I don't see a lot of Periscope videos on my Twitter timeline.  Why is this better? Why is this going to do better than that?  Or even Hangouts, Google's power of Facebook? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I mean, I think I think that these are people, my friends.  I'll get a notification. I'll see what's what.  The fact that they can do it to a group, I think is interesting when I do this.  And the problem is, this is not Hangouts yet, but it's not going to take much for them to do that.  And then you also saw they have a Facebook Live map.  Journalistically, if something starts going on in the world,  you can go and find people who are broadcasting live from events in that location.  Journalistically, that'll be huge. If you go to the post Leo, the Facebook post first mentioned.  Down the page, you'll see the Facebook Live map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's not live. I don't know how live it is now.  They don't promote every video that's on. They just promoted some videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that was one of the cool things about Periscope, is you could see a map of all the different periscopes  and, you know, join other people's periscopes and so forth.  The idea was to build a community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I click on you. I click on what looks like California. There you are, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, California. How are you? Good to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's telling me that you're live now.  Yeah. I could click around the world and go to different live. That's kind of fun.  To Elmas Cara is now live.  That's Periscope did this too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tobiah Triplett is now live.  But I wonder, I think one of the cool things about this is, I remember when I was a kid, I used to listen to shortwave radio.  We've come a long way in intervening 50 years, but it was so cool. I could listen and hear, I'm listening to Moscow.  And now it's, yeah, I can watch a video from somebody in St. Petersburg showing, you know, I mean, and it's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Charles L. Huff is live right now from Senegal.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stefano Prosida is live right now from somewhere in the middle of Spain, along with Aline Giuseppe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How long before Facebook puts this in the right hand column where it shows, you know, trending?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. So mouse over any one of those dots. You'll find you on there.  There I am.  And it's showing all the people who are watching you and where they're watching from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, look at that. So it's drawing a line.  Oh, man. Two people are watching us in Hawaii, South America.  Wow. We are getting a hello. Hello, Southeast Asia.  Look at that.  Wow. Australia, three people in Australia, one in Perth.  Wow. That is really cool.  That is really nice. Now, where do I find the map again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go to the Facebook post, go to Facebook Live Map. It's facebook.com slash live map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Facebook.com slash live map. Wow.  So this shows the power of Facebook really, because they can. They've got the servers, they've got the community, they've got the network, they've got everything.  And they can put that together fairly instantaneously. Right.  Geez. Should they worry about the content?  Do you know what I'm saying? I mean, oh, yeah. Well, let me show you, Leo.  No, please don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, of course they're going to. And I wonder what they're doing about that. I don't think we asked Chris Cox about that today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the real names thing is going to help a little bit, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because if you if you if you mock up, notice I use an M there.  Right. Mock up. Mock up. Yeah, they'll kill your account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So you don't want to you want to use this in a responsible fashion.  What? There would be no advantage. I'm still streaming, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm still streaming to the poor people. By the way, if those of you who are here all 271 on the base, Leo, this is the twig broadcast.  You can go to twig.tv slash live. Yeah.  And you'll see the real show. I'm just showing it.  Yeah, but it won't be as much fun. Well, they're only hearing me now.  So they hear long silences than me. So, incidentally, somebody in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you. Carlos Contreras says the live map is in the left column under apps.  It's the very first app listed. So you can that was just another shortcut to go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The funny thing is there's a lot of people if you look at the dots. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With zero viewers. Well, yeah, they're not as famous as we are.  No, but wow, I just I feel like this is really interesting technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's fast. Yeah. So now I've got around the New York area.  There's something called Iraq News and they're live with two hundred fifty three three hundred fifty viewers, tons from Iraq.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Imagine I mean, this is the beginning of a new medium almost a new broadcast medium in a way that even though Periscope pioneered it or more meerkat or, you know, Justin dot TV pioneered it.  This is this is so easy and so many people are on Facebook.  I can only imagine what the impact I mean, would CNN start using this? Well, yes, they will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, a lot of broadcasters, if you go to the Facebook Live page at the bottom, you'll see broadcasters have been using it all day.  But the best story about this is Jorge Ramos from Univision when he covered, for example, the New Hampshire primary, he did three broadcasts that added up to seventy five minutes.  Right. There were long broadcasts and he got four and a half million viewers that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And of course, he's been using Snapchat and all these media.  But I think the advantage of this is now I presume after I'm done, this is saved on my Facebook timeline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it is. This is going to be a lot of really long, boring video on the Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My case, because it's one sided, but they don't hear the people want to hear you and all they're hearing is Steve Saylor, who's a good friend from the Toronto area says we started using it at the radio stations he works for.  Makes sense. Yeah.  Yeah, we'll use this.  OK, so we're going to be at the somebody asked, are you going to be at NAB with this?  We're going to be at the National Association of Broadcasters Convention next month in the LiveU booth.  What is LiveU? It's a company that sells or leases some very expensive hardware that allows you to live stream from anywhere using the cell network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  This is impressive.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stefan says it's not reached the live map cannot be reached from France.  I don't know why that would be.  But but it's interesting because in general, this is a global rollout.  Right. I think what did they say?  190 countries or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because people, if you look at the map, they're using it from everywhere.  Everywhere.  Iraq weed is live now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is amazing.  That is really fascinating.  We live in interesting times.  And then I guess the oh, I see the reason you saw that is because it had a pulsing blob.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that is that is music from Iraq.  Yeah, they're featuring it.  Maybe that's it.  I guess so.  That's showing the connections.  I'm seeing some featured stuff.  Here's one from Thailand.  308 viewers.  I hope it doesn't devolve, though, to attractive young women, you know, getting all of the feeds.  But people, especially males being OK with Leo, that's that's that's the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Why how are you going to discover a video in general?  You're going to discover it because it's somebody who's already involved with your feed in some way.  Right. It's a news source that you're following.  This is another reason to want to follow a news source.  You're not going to get it just because unless you go to this map.  Even then, it's so random the map.  I think it's a way to sample.  Why don't you hit a few? Let's just watch what's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, here's a Anja Jackass born son.  From was that she here from Wiesbaden.  She's got she's in the car.  It looks like she's just sitting in her living room.  She's speaking German or I presume.  So let's she's smoking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She quit smoking.  Put a comment in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm a popo.  No, not Milena.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Three hundred seventy two viewers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm saying there Leo.  Smoking is forbidden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Smoking is forbidden.  OK, how do I do that? Type that in.  R-A-U-C-H-E-N.  I'm going to comment somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK. Yeah, somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She sneezed.  I don't see how I comment.  Where do I comment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anja, what are you doing in Hessen?  Watch out.  Who wrote that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can like it.  Maybe it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  In Anja's life.  No, it says a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who wrote it?  Huh?  Tell Karima Kristau.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been told by people like Chad Johnson, people who work on Twitch a lot, that the key to success in at least Twitch videos is to interact with the chat room.  Yes.  I think I've learned that.  For another venues.  Hey, thanks for being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Absolutely. Happy to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was kind of exciting, wasn't it?  This is the first time ever at the Shoreline Amphitheater.  Can you remember anybody an outdoor keynote ever before?  I don't think I think we've ever done something like that.  I know Google hasn't.  I think Moses was the last time.  Moses.  Yes, I have some commandments for you.  That was the last time we had an outside keynote.  These are the thinnest, lightest commandments we've ever made.  So let's start with Matt.  Now, I know you're Google employee, but contextualize what we saw today for us.  What does it all mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, I really like that Google is not giving up on trying to figure out getting messaging right.  And, you know, some of the stuff like Aloe, I think is really interesting because you've always got people who can criticize and they can say, oh, it's going to do this or what about this or that.  But I think it's really promising to see Google really not willing to give this up yet.  We're going to try to figure out what makes the right sense for Android and for iOS.  How do you get a platform?  And then there was also this underlying backbone of artificial intelligence and machine learning where whether it's Google Home or Aloe all the way through a lot of the different things, you could see Sundar mentioning that.  And as a web guy, I was really happy to hear him call out progressive web apps and accelerated mobile pages because, you know, to have the CEO saying, hey, this is important and here's the kind of speed improvement you can get.  I think that's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually stand corrected.  Windows 95 launch was an outdoor launch, I think, in a big Seattle event.  But what Windows 95 launch had, which the Google launch did not have, is a bunch of geeks biting their lower lips and dancing in the most ungainly fashion possible.  That is unfortunate.  Thank you very much.  We're not going to dance.  No dancing.  Do you feel like Aloe is kind of the on-phone analog of Google Home, the new physical hub that they announced?  It feels like really what Google is doing is putting Google everywhere.  They've now coined the name.  Is this new, Matt, calling it Google Assistant?  Is that something new?  I think that is new.  OK.  But they needed that because we didn't know what to call it.  We have Siri, we have Cortana, we have Alexa.  Yeah.  You name it.  Yeah.  So Google Assistant now.  And the idea is let's put it everywhere.  It's on your phone.  It's in your house.  You talk to it.  It will respond.  It seems like it will respond in a similar way, no matter what platform you use.  I think that's very compelling, Matt.  This is the science fiction dream that I had for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, and if you think about it, a very good way to think about Google is Google cares  about how people get to Google.  How do people typically get to a Google search?  They get there via a browser.  OK, well, we need to have a browser.  And in fact, it's called Chrome because it tries to get all the Chrome out of the way.  And how else do people get to Google?  Well, they'll use a mobile operating system.  Oh, OK, that's interesting.  They'll use a laptop like a Chromebook.  OK, well, that's interesting.  And so over and over again, you can see Google being very worried about people who can get  in between users and Google and add barriers or obstacles.  And so I do think it's a pretty smart way to think about it as if you can do voice recognition,  if you can do the machine learning, if you can be a useful assistant, the mechanism of  exactly how that gets delivered, whether it's a little hockey puck beside you or whether  it's in your Google Now or your Google Assistant, I think Google is pretty agnostic about that.  But they want people to be able to do that and thinking about how to get around those  barriers so that users can do those searches with the minimal amount of friction is a pretty  good way to think about what Google might or might not do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and speaking of which, neither Aloe nor Duro require a Google account.  They're both tied to your phone number, not your Google account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Because there's so many people around the world who don't have Google accounts or, you  know, that's just another element of friction.  And so I think, you know, maybe you know the phone number of your friend and you don't  know their email address or something like that, making it as easy as possible that you  can have those interactions without worrying about join here, OAuth to whatever that kind  of stuff just makes it a lot easier.  Is it the end of Hangouts?  I honestly I think I saw on Twitter, they need to clarify what's going on with Google  Voice and Hangouts and all that sort of stuff.  And I think that's a fair knock because you can try to have a monolithic communication  app or you can say, oh, no, it's actually better to break it into different ones like  Facebook, Split Out Messenger, you know, and the right answer might evolve over time.  But I do think Google needs to do a better job of saying, OK, here's what happens with  Google Voice.  Here's what happens with Google Hangouts, because, you know, like you you you like Google  Voice.  You've used it a lot in your past or Google Fi.  You know, I love Google Fi.  I'm going to use it when I'm going abroad in a few weeks.  And that's very well supported.  But how exactly all those pieces interact?  I think Google can do a better job of explaining what their future roadmap looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think, Jason, is it the end of Hangouts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't I don't know how they can exist at the same time, how Aloe and Duo can exist  side by side with Hangouts, because, yes, Aloe and Duo bring their own expanded functionality.  But I feel like Hangouts.  I mean, it was it was basically like the next iteration of Hangouts was kind of how I saw  it.  And they did a great job with it.  I'm very excited to use it.  But I don't know.  Like like I was saying earlier, there's so much confusion already that when you have  a messaging app and a smart messaging app, you have a messaging app that has video chat  and then you have a video chat app.  I don't know how they coexist without doing some sort of either elimination or convergence.  I don't I don't know how they treat that, but it feels a little messy as far as that's concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We need more clarification.  And they were quick to say that Aloe isn't available till summer and Duo is not available  to summer.  What do you like?  How do you like this thing, Jeff, where the knock knock thing where when you call somebody,  they see you before they answer.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it really struck me as that's that's the end of Alexander Graham Bell.  It's the end of the bell.  It's the end of the ring tone.  And all that idea is that is it.  And it also means that you've now got to sell your call because nobody wants to talk on  the phone.  Right.  Nobody likes it anymore.  So it's going to be crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got to talk to me right now.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Like like like his daughter.  Like hi.  Hi.  Daddy, talk to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at me.  Look at me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Talk to me.  Oh, my God.  Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's going to be a whole new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Android and they did talk a lot about Android and Hiroshi Lockheimer came on the stage,  but they said we're going to let you name it.  Come on, Matt.  What happened?  They couldn't get the rights to Nutella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, my favorite conspiracy theory is that Sundar Pichai visited India and someone was  like, why don't you name it after this dish that starts with an N?  And he's like, well, this was like a year ago.  He's like, maybe we'll open it up to an online poll and maybe everyone in India will vote  for it the next day or something like that.  And so, you know, who knows?  But I think at the very bottom in the fine print, it says we reserve the right to pick  whatever we want.  This is for entertainment purposes only.  It won't be judged.  And I think they mean you won't get feedback when you say it ought to be called Nutella  or not, not roll or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They specifically said it will not be naming Mcnameface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Naming Mcnameface.  They brought that right up.  Smart.  Android, nope.  The deadline is 1159 p.m. Pacific Time, June 8th.  So I presume that by, you know, the next couple of weeks we'll learn.  You go to android.com slash N and you name Android N. And I love, I guess this is the  Indian dish, neyapam.  Neyapam.  Neyapam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It seems like Sundar might be trying to, yeah, slant it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Android Neyapam, really?  I don't know if Neyapam is really the name we should give that.  Here's Noodles and Nectarines, Nutmeg.  Oh, I like this one.  It had a post-it note.  It's Narshmallow.  The post-it note fell off.  Wait a minute.  See, they took Marshmallow, crossed off the M and put the N on there and then the post-it  note fell off.  Navy Bean, that's not a dessert.  Nuts and Nachos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If only nachos were a dessert.  Alas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe what they're saying is it doesn't have to be a dessert anymore.  Nuchos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about Nuchos?  Nuts and nachos together.  Two great treats together at last.  And then there's a video about, of the naming.  I wish it were like this.  This is straight out of Silicon Valley, right?  I didn't see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, I'm John Smith.  I'm CEO of PNI, Professional Naming Incorporated.  Yes, we are working on something big.  The latest version of Android needs a name.  They want people everywhere to share their ideas, but I think it's a job for PNI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They had Kit Kat a while ago, Jelly Bean, Lollipop, Marshmallow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was thinking maybe since we had Marshmallow last time, maybe now we were going to have  Narshmallow.  I don't hate it.  Maybe like toasted Marshmallow if you...  Chum, do you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You want to make sure that the N is inspired.  People on the streets, they wouldn't understand a lot of what we're doing.  There's a lot of mathematics and metrics in it, but it's really half science and half  art.  It's both.  It's math and art.  It's like a baby.  When you give birth to a baby, it's science.  But it's a baby and not a soul.  And then you have to name it.  Nucho.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nucho.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a Nucho.  No.  Nucho.  Nut, nut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everything is changing constantly.  It's a global world.  If you don't do it right away, it's already somebody else's printing it on a t-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Nashy pear, navel orange, direct distinct.  You know exactly what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel really close to Marshmallow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I love noodles because it's got a length to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They say if a shark stops swimming, it's dying.  I don't know if it's dying if it stops swimming or...  If you're not out there like a shark naming things like a shark would.  I'm not sure if that's...  Okay, so let's bring it in everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  We are names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are names.  We don't need these guys, Reza Text.  We just need you.  What would you name it?  Hashtag Android N. I think that's actually...  It's a lot of fun.  It's not going to get Bodie McBofe face.  It's going to get something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know Landor Associates?  Yeah, that's what they do, right?  That's what they do.  Yeah.  I think they created Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They call it branding or nanding.  Nanding.  Today, Facebook published its criteria for the newsfeed, which I thought...  I don't know.  Have you had a chance to look at this yet, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  I wrote a quick post about it, which you'll find there.  See, Facebook did two things today.  One was that they, for the first time, gave people a little more transparency into the  algorithm to the extent that they said, here are the principles that guide what we do.  Newsfeed values.  Yeah.  Right.  You want your family and friends first.  That's our job.  That's what Facebook does.  People also want to be informed and entertained.  Now, what I've heard this in the past, it was the opposite order.  It was friends, entertainment, information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  This hasn't been my experience.  Here's the quote.  That's why if it's from your friends, it's in your feed.  Period.  You just have to scroll down.  That's not been my experience.  No, that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not true.  No, because a lot of my friends put stuff I don't want.  But at the same time, the second thing they did, which is that they also tweaked the algorithm  to say, yes, we're going to favor friends even more.  And they're warning news organizations there may be an impact.  Well, the news organizations, like Batmash, sorry about that, Carson, they went crazy.  And the New York Times, shock, shock, they're going to show us cats, no news.  They're a news organization.  What are they doing?  They've never been a news organization.  It's never been a priority.  This is a matter of degree.  But the Nieman Lab post was the most reasonable, but most of the other posts I saw said, oh  my God, they're going to de-emphasize news.  And the company who's partnered with Facebook is basically an idiot.  Well, we've got to wait and see over time and experience and data what actually happens.  Yes, there's an impact.  But the real lesson here is Facebook is not a place to read thousand word articles.  Facebook is a place where you discuss things.  And we in news have to feed those discussions appropriately to the platform.  We don't get mad because Snapchat will not let us put up an article and we have to make  things especially and appropriately for Snapchat.  Well, Facebook is trying to gently guide us there, I think.  Nonetheless, all my EORs in the news business all went crazy today saying big bad Facebook  is ruining news again.  And I don't think that's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the problem, I mean, what are the problems I should say is that a lot of news organizations  in the last year or so have oriented towards Facebook and it's a significant driver of  their traffic when you're trying to achieve those crazy scales.  So it makes sense that everyone's like, holy cow, they're changing the algorithm.  It's like when it's like the Greeks when they were like, oh, the gods are mad at us again  when you know, it didn't rain in enough time.  That's what it feels like.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they going to start sacrificing goats on Mark Zuckerberg's porch is the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They'll be sacrificing journalists as per usual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Farhad Manju's headline in the New York Times, Facebook, a news giant that would rather show  us baby pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's just so condescending, not only to Facebook, but to every user of Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  I think actually I'll have to say Facebook, from my experience, is doing it about right  for me personally.  Yeah, yeah.  I go there and I see a nice mix.  I do see a lot of news and I can't verify that I'm seeing everything my friends and  family post.  But I see a nice mix and you're right.  I don't want to necessarily see everything my friends and family post.  Facebook's ultimate metric is I mean, I don't think this is a surprise is yeah, how much  time you spend there, period.  And they're going to just.  And they have the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they know what you like and what you don't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're going to they're going to just watch and see what you like and what you interact  with. And they're going to give you more of that because that's their only real job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right here is the same as it is to me from VidCon is that we did last year VidCon.  They're not about content, it's about social tokens.  You make things to serve the conversations people have and you can serve it with  journalistic value, with facts and fact checking and information and explanation and  education. But you do it appropriate to how people live their lives.  We don't do that. We still make a destination product called an article.  Well, that's sorry, folks, but that's what we have to rethink.  And Facebook is making us is gently not so gently making us do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's really happening. It's this it's another similar shift from the library to  the Internet. So the way you use the library is very different the way that you use the  Internet. But the library is the old days where you would go to the library and you  would get something to read.  And similarly, you would go to the New York Times site and get something to read.  And but nowadays you don't need to go to the library.  You go to the Internet, which is this tossed salad of things to read.  If you want to find something to read, you can.  But you're not going to go to the New York Times.  You're going to go to a news aggregator or Facebook or Twitter.  And you're going to see a story you're interested in, read that and then read another,  you know, a crouton from The Washington Post and a, you know, onion ring from the New  York magazine. And you're going to move around.  Is that a fair is that an apt analogy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, we ask you a question to get you in trouble.  Are you saying that libraries should close?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I guess as repositories of books, they they know they shouldn't close.  What they should do is that they need to rethink their role in the Internet age.  They're no longer the place you go to find facts.  They know that they of course they do.  It's a it's the thing librarians have been chewing on for 20 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I really think they're trying what they should do.  Libraries role should be to provide community services for people to educate themselves,  get access to things that they haven't been able to.  I know like our library is doing a lot with literacy, adult literacy, for example.  They're doing a lot with a lot of libraries are opening up maker spaces.  I don't know how they do that in a quiet environment like like a library, but they open up  maker spaces and they have three printers and other things.  And it's an investment. But I think those are the types of things that libraries can be a  wonderful resource. Everybody knows where the library is, or most people do.  So you go there to to learn a little differently.  You might not check out a book, but maybe you'll learn how to 3D print a holder for your  tablet or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So to extend my analogy, perhaps to the point of breaking, just as a library has to rethink its  role in an Internet era, so does a news journal, because you can't expect people to go to the front  page and read from the top to the bottom and see a giant full page ad for Macy's.  It doesn't work that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think maybe the publishers have to I mean, most journalists think of their job not as they  think of their job as providing information.  I think right.  Most of the people I do know do that.  The business model, though, God help us all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a little something something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it a minion? I want it to be a minion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Minion like you will now be my minions.  You are my minions.  Oh, you got it. You didn't have to stand in line.  I took advantage of this thing called eBay.  Oh, how much over the market was it?  It was only 200 some.  Wasn't much.  So they're down from a thousand.  Yeah. And it was a buy it now.  And that's because the store in Manhattan is open all the time or not all the time, but all evening.  And so it's a lot. And you can make a reservation.  So it's a lot easier. So I think people are actually, you know, content to make 100 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would be content to make 100 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They go. They get a few. Yeah.  So here you go.  Should I open it? I mean, it's sealed in the box.  I'll have to charge him.  But I thought it's probably important for me to know about this.  I'm not a big snapper.  But it is. It's totally important.  Yeah, this is this is something the kids are the kids are doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I chose black, not coral or turquoise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, OK, call me insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I just want I didn't want to look too weird.  I'm going to call you old Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I won't call you insane. I'll just. Oh, now I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this supposed to be speckled like that or is that mold?  I guess it's supposed to be speckled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That looks that looks legit.  That looks legit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Smell it and see what happens.  It smells like fine poliurethane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's the charger right there.  I'm going to need a. Oh, yeah, because they charge in the case.  Well, these are this is new in the box, kids.  All right, I'm going to put them on.  I don't think there's a charge on them, but I'm going to put them on.  You tell me how good I look. Goofy time. Ready?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I actually think for your face, they should be a little bigger, Leo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is I have a very they look huge on everybody else, don't they?  And I have such a melon head.  I have the world's most massive head.  And I have to actually buy special wide glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like the big and tall glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I go to the big and tall glasses store.  And these are too small for me.  Dang it. I thought if anything would be big enough.  Kara, come here.  Kara, put these on and see how it looks on you.  Kara is a beautiful young woman who has a normal size head.  See, they look. Oh, Kara.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They look so good on you.  Oh, I should just give them the Kara.  Oh, my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was actually I was going to I think I'm going to keep them  because I want to I like the idea.  I've heard that streaming live videos all the rage these days.  So I was thinking maybe I should do some of that.  I don't look like Casey Neistat.  That's for sure. So look at this.  They get a nice USB cable.  And it's it's this is proprietary.  It's not a traditional USB cable.  It's got pogo pins that go in the back of this.  But you know what, John, I'm just going to plug it into the computer.  I don't need to. I don't need a special.  Don't go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He just has to walk three feet to get to the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A special computer.  OK. Oh.  That is hard.  Now, you know, you're old when it's a workout to get up and go on the other side of the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, when you go that way. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that is the long.  All right. So I'm going to put them in this box and.  I have to peel stuff off, peel that off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I can I say that I love charging things in their boxes.  I love I mean, as I've got all these like proprietary cable dongle.  Yeah, it's ugly, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see behind you. You've got a charger.  It's a pain in the butt, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. Behind me, there's a charger and a connected blood cuff.  Blood pressure cuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you OK? Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, you know, it's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, this is good design, too.  So the pogo pins, I was wondering, well, where do I plug these in?  Because you don't see any visible.  The pogo pins are hid behind the hinge on the glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So when you have to plug them in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you put them in the case. Oh, you just connect.  But there's got to be a way to connect to the case, right?  And so to the charger in the case, and it just goes, it's not the most.  Oh, yeah, you could see. Oh, you could tell you're doing it right  because the little LED array lights up.  And actually, they're mostly charged.  They're mostly charged.  So I want to let them  sit there for a little bit and throb gently  while we do the show and maybe a little later in the show.  I'll I'll Snapchat this.  All right. Now, what did it say?  Take a picture. Where's the button on this?  Here it is. There's the button.  So I press this button and I'm supposed to see a QR code, right?  What happened? I got to read this again.  Install the laser for Snapchat.  Oh, swipe down to view your snap code.  Oh, I wasn't viewing my snap code. OK.  Look at your snap code and press the button on the spectacles.  OK, there's my snap code if anybody wants it.  You can show my snap code.  Oh, Snapchat would like access. Yes.  Looking for keep looking directly at the snap code.  I'm looking at spectacles found.  This has to be easy because this is aimed at, you know,  name your spectacles. What should I name them?  Banana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was going to say Blues Brothers come up a lot.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're wearing sunglasses.  We've got a full tank of gas.  I'm going to call it Hit It.  Isn't that what they say at the end of that quote?  Hit it. And then only I will know what I'm talking about.  But it's a little Blues Brothers reference.  These are the Hit It spectacles connecting the spectacles.  So exciting. I can now select an accessory.  Oh, hit it. See, hit it.  It's a little emoji with sunglasses on.  Setting up spectacles. All right.  So it's fairly easy.  It's you know, this is this is what the arrows and the.  Orbeez and everything, these are all like this same kind of thing where you.  I'm paired. OK, press once to take a 10 second video snap.  Press again to extend by 10 seconds or press and hold to stop recording.  So I've been reading there's articles on how to get good snaps.  And one of the things it says is if you triple tap, you get 30 seconds.  Double tap the side to check your battery level.  OK, if you're running low, put the spectacles in their charging case.  Specs light up when they're charging.  Yeah, I noticed that charging case holds about four full charges.  Oh, that's neat. So I'm charging the case.  Oh, that's cool. All right. All right.  And then I oh, apparently I have a story already.  All right.  Get HD. What does that mean?  By default, stories are imported in SD.  You can import your favorite stories in HD. I got it. OK.  All right. All right. So should I do a story?  Probably. All right. All right. Look at me now.  Look at me. All right. Ready?  I'm going to tap it twice for 20 seconds.  This is what happened when Leo got his brand new Snapchat spectacles.  Everybody was so jealous.  They just turned bright green.  Hello, everybody. I'm snapping Snapchatting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Snapchatting. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Snapping sounds snappier. I'm with the kids, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does the light go around in it?  Yeah, that's to let you know that it's going.  That's can you see that it's recording? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the light goes around. From your perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, no, you can't see anything.  OK. And now it's so the thing I read said a couple of things.  Put your hands in the Snapchat a lot.  Otherwise, it just looks like a video.  But this way, now, you know, it's first person if you do that.  They also said have a beginning, a middle and an end.  They also said, what else did she say?  Anyway, stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I kind of like the idea of just being like surreptitious videos  that you snapped or that surreptitious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, well, yeah, I'm  I'm going to stay away from the guy with the goofy glasses right after the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, you're going to use it to count cards, send it to your your hedge fund

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  dude in the back. I don't like what do you think if I go in the casino with this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and start to try to play blackjack, they're not going to like that.  Yeah, I think you should record whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Were there any stories of Google Glass of casinos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, probably not.  Probably you don't get through the door. I will try.  I do. I do have experience with this because one CES  we were going to an event through a casino with a camera crew.  And I said, get everything.  And we immediately got stopped, said you have to turn your camera off.  And my camera guy who bless his soul fought him.  And I said not physically, but he was no, no, no, no press.  So I said, no, no, sorry.  Don't just pretend you're turning it off.  We actually I think we're streaming live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So just yes. In June 2013, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement  issued a directive for Atlantic City to ban.  Yeah. Casino patrons were using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't want any video, any camera in the casino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Huh? Is it because of things like tracking and?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think well, possibly.  But also, they just don't want anybody.  It's the same reason the TSA doesn't want you to take pictures at TSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's that's silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, so you're catching people in affairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's true, too.  What happens in Vegas should stay there shows up on Snapchat.  Well, everybody should follow me.  And I just showed you my thing.  I don't remember what it was, but
