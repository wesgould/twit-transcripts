Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but then I'd have to quit my actual tech job. I'd have to just become a restaurateur. Yeah, we don't  know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's purely selfish on my part  Seattle's begging for Stacey's place also here Jeff Jarvis  He is of course the Leonard Tao professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Noemark  Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York blogger at Buzz Machine com author of many wonderful books  Like what would Google do?  Welcome again, Jeff. Thank you. Thank you former TV good to have the gang together. Yeah  This is the way it's supposed to be it's been fun. But this is the way it's supposed to be  Let's start with undersea cables just to make sure Stacey comes back  We can  So I think I think I know but okay undersea cables. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, I want you to be happy Stacey  Stacey has a thing for undersea cables

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He can only because I can do my Sebastian the crab impression. No, I will not sing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why are first of all, I should probably ask you. What is it about undersea cables you like so much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it's how you get the internet around the world  Because anything backhaul is inherently like necessary and not sexy to anyone so I of course love it  That's how that's that's like the technology. I love it's it's infrastructure. You love infrastructure

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Getting down into the nitty gritty. So into the weeds or the photons. I'm not sure I'm thrilled about the idea of Google or any  Company like Google Facebook would be in there  Having so much influence on the infrastructure, but I guess you know like you love your phone company. Yeah, it's like sprint

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know or this is they did this they started doing this back in like 2008 or maybe even earlier because it was all part of their  I mean again, what is their business is delivering bits at the lowest possible cost, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why give money to telcos who hated them? Yeah, no hate them and Jeff makes a great point  I'd rather Google did it than a telco  Which is what I guess who normally builds these  So this is an image from your favorite place telegeography submarine cable map calm  This is the curie cable a 10,000 kilometer cable that goes from Los Angeles to Valparaiso  Which is just northwest of Chile's capital Santiago  And  It is fully Google owned

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is unique these are very expensive to build and this is the first one that Google's ever built  It has invested in several others along with other telcos Facebook and other companies. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's that's the first unique thing about curie and then it's doing unity which goes from Japan to Rotondo Beach

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it already did unity. Oh, that's the old one. So the new one is curie. Curie is it unity was a while back 2010? Yeah. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the Southeast Asia Japan cable which was  2013 but these these are not all Google owned I guess they're the ones that Google is part ownership  Yeah, and just to give you an idea of who puts these cables in it's owned by Google but also globe telecom KTDI telecom in Indonesia  Singapore's telecom Singtel China telecom China mobile  TOT Chung walk cable and Brunei International Gateway. So that's the that's the Southeast Asia cable  faster which went into service a few years ago from Oregon to Taiwan  coned by a bunch of Asian telecoms, of course and  time calm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not time magazine. Is it? No, I make that's dead. Well, it's not dead time

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They actually had a great conference this time 100 conference had everybody this is the new D conference, isn't it?  Um, really? Yeah, I was amazed at the people who were at this time 100

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cuz they've given them an award they'll tell them an award and and they're also trying to appear human to the rest of the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you the yeah  But you know, they are humans

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They want to they want to hobnob with people outside the tech companies and make themselves  More approachable for people to counter some of the backlash. Well, it worked for me because Tim Cook who spoke at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Said some things I really liked  And I and it did humanize him he said and revealed I think for the first time I didn't know this that  Google for instance gives no money to candidates unlike any other tech company Apple I should say not Google Apple gives no money to tech candidates  Apple does not have a pack or is not a member of a pack a political action committee because Tim Cook says that would be wrong. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thought that was pretty cool. It's it's also because they're Apple people come to the table. They don't have to write they don't have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He also called for the regulation of the tech industry and in fact, I really liked  What he said about that he said  Let me see if I can find the quote  I'm a deeply free market person in mindset. I believe that some unexpected things can happen in regulation  I think that we all have to be intellectually honest and we have to admit that what we're doing isn't working and  that technology needs to be regulated I  Don't disagree with that and I think that that's fairly honest that's not so other technology  CEOs say that because it's inevitable and so we better call for it. And if we do maybe we can control it  I don't feel like Tim Cook's doing that  There are too many examples where no rails have resulted in great damage to society  I'm been on the regulation looking for rails for his competitors. Yeah  You could be right about both things. Yeah, I do believe that  Apple has has stood up and said privacy is important and they remember they fought the FBI actually had something interesting to say about that  The FBI San Bernardino case where the FBI went to Apple and said please decrypt the this guy the shooters cell phone and Apple said no  I Tim says I wish that case would have gone to court to be honest  It was dropped the day before and now after the inspector general reports have come out our worst fears have been confirmed  That it was a very rigged case to begin with and so I think this was not the government's finest hour  I have personally was it a rigged case. I don't know that I don't either. I'm gonna have to look at the inspector general's  Report but it sounds like what what he's saying and what we kind of thought at the time was that this was a cherry-picked  Case they didn't really need this information, but they thought this was their best shot at getting a  Judgment that would allow them to decrypt phones in the future

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, they wanted a high-profile thing that people would not get cranky about right you could say  Privacy privacy and they're like but terrorists a terrorist. Okay. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I thought that was good and by the way that was all at this time 100 summit  So who owns time if they don't exist no no no time ink doesn't exist many off owns time magazine Mark Benioff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, you were asking in the context of who died. I caught a yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Cable it was a long deep rat hole we went down. Yes, it was but it was your rat holes all yours

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's still and it's still a tech rat hole because Benny off so boom although time.com is time magazine  So I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm confused. I'm confusled. I was not impressed with the 100  Because I lists are such BS. Oh, yeah. Yeah as you know and Jeff's what this is for just been in these rooms  I'm sure when these lists have been created. It's really a great way to publicize a magazine to get attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh you have to I used to work at fortune they make lists  Yeah, I used to make lists a gig home. Some of these people are important

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some of them are celebrities  Jared Kushner was one of them. No doubt. He's important Nancy Pelosi also important  But some of them may be less of these are advertisers. Yeah  Tyra Banks really  Microsoft Melinda Gates Bill's wife who's been very influential  Kanye  Anyway, it's an interesting interesting list you're right. These things are really about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Promotional yeah. Yeah, and they're also just kind of New York magazine made lists  Linguafranco magazines. Oh really was that was that who started that New York? Yeah, New York really did  Yeah, well when it was part of the hair X a Rhyme Tribune, I mean, yeah  And then so I was in the room at people when they had a cut  we had a cover of Mel Gibson and my mentor the editor Pat Ryan was just  Struggling to have any damn cover billing to say what do you say about Mel Gibson at the time?  Now there's plenty to say but then there wasn't much to say and she finally just just out of nowhere kind of said  Oh, let's call the sexiest men alive. Oh  That started that a franchise. Yeah, it was just trying to fill in a cover billing. It was  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was there. What do you say about Mel Gibson? He's the now you say the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Minus that's a medic drunk, but that's another matter

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's another one for you Stacy cuz we missed you so much  Jacquard. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I didn't see the TED talk, but I was I was I was  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, good. It will be though a TED talk which demonstrates this Jacquard technology, which is a wearable technology  It was announced four years ago a long time ago. I just want to point that out  Ivan Pupri Pujerev Puperev  Who is at the ATP Google's Advanced Technology and Products Division  projects, I'm sorry division  Showed off his Levi jacket the Jacquard jacket and this is an interesting graphic  Involving vegetables  Shoes laptops. I'm not sure a day in the life of  Gemma everything we touch. Oh, I get it. It's an image of everything she touched during the day  Interesting  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's got the tray of Indian spices. I bet her cooking is delicious

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I bet looking at this because a pogo stick a skateboard a  Hairdryer, I bet she's a kid but this was all the stuff. She ate. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh eight or made. I mean if you think she's a chef, I don't know. You don't need to be a chef  This is just every home cook who's three six fish  Yeah, I mean we don't know how big those fish are judging by the size comparing it to the other stuff  They could be like sardines. Yeah, they could be sardines. You're right. We don't hearing  She's well off whoever she is she's very well off she has expensive gear and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And a jacket that snitches on her. I think is the impression I'm getting from this image

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think this is just this was a photo essay taken from an artist  And I think actually what they're probably showing is how you can imbue everyday objects with touch using jacquard  Er, sorry imbue everyday objects with technology with jacquard  Yeah, he actually used his Levi's jacket to control his presentation  Right, which having played with touch technology. That's this kind of gimmicky stuff. That's exactly what it's good for  I once saw Nick Fleetwood do an entire drum solo on his clothes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want to see Karsten replace the TriCaster with his jacket

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I thought of when they talked about jacquard way back in 2015 when they talked about it at like IO or wherever it was  I actually thought it was neat. Imagine if you because it's touch sensitive and it's it's I think it's fabric  It's a built-in fabric using like silver or something  Right and what you can do imagine that on like your couch on the arm of your couch or your favorite chair  It's just built in and it links into whatever your TV remote is and then suddenly you don't have the that remote you just kind of  Run your hands on your couch, but then you have to remember all the places  To touch or not to touch if you don't want the channel to change

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the idea is eventually you'd have fabric that you could you know, you know, you could use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'd have fabric that you could you know interact with that way and that's actually as we bring design that is in  view more things with technology  Having the devices understand  Your intentions is going to be the next or a next big area

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Should be the first thing you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got to build it and see what happens with I mean, you know, that's what they're that's the stage

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right now clearly and Chris Anderson who runs Ted came on stage apparently and and asked  Pupera if whether there needs to be some kind of contract ensuring this data isn't abused  Since it potentially creates the biggest effort surveillance network for Google or another company, you know  it's unfortunate that we've gotten in this position now where we don't and  understandably don't trust these companies and  And it's slow. It could slow down this kind of innovation because people just don't that's good  It is good. I think that we have that conversation as long as we continue to do it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When we are I mean, that's where we're I don't think it's crazy to be like, you know  I'm sure when when generals like came up against the first people who had guns or maybe arrows they were like  Holy cow. This is a new technology. We got to figure out what this is how we adapt to it, right?  It's not crazy for us to have that same thing and I'm not saying this technology is as deadly  But it's definitely got similar types of repercussions in terms of like effects

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So yeah  this is where I'm on Jeff's side of this whole moral panic thing because sometimes that catch that could be  Used to shut stuff down instead of just say let's really talk about the issues here  I think that's what we do well and that's why it's great to have both of you kind of fighting back and forth on this because  It's a it's reasonable to consider it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not crazy to press pause and if you shut something down for a little while and then you recognize  I mean like I've kicked thing. I'm sure everyone's done this I've I've kicked things out of my house and then like two weeks later  I'm like dude, that was dumb  I really need this and then you realize where you need it most and you start

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't you worry as I do that now? Oh the only reason I'm hooked I  Can't get I can't get rid of it not because I do need it or because it's a benefit but because I'm hooked on this stuff  Don't you worry about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, we got I mean books

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I know TV was gonna be awful to us. We watch we we we we watch things. It's okay. Okay, I would argue though

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's just throw out this TV example for a second there because Americans are now watching like five hours and 42 minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're not really not what you would have you would have predicted that would go down and internet viewing would go up and it's not  The case both have gone up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well overall television overall video content viewing has gone up the slice of it happening on  Mobile and non television networks, but we're still watching  Traditional we're still watching a lot of tradition. We're still watching TV, but it's not growing that what we're watching a traditional TV is not growing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know so much watching a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I may how much I think there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Much for four hours a day. I think it's like roughly four hours a day or three hours and fifty minutes or I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but but if I may speak on behalf of the great unwashed masses  I think it's a little haughty to say oh all these people are doing all that and it's just awful for them people do what?  They want to do in their lives and it's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I'm not saying it as those people I am doing it too much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So well, yes, your judgment is too much, but others are doing it to what they ever want to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not trying to tell somebody to stop watching TV. I would argue that television is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The opiate of the masses no, that's religion, but I would say that there are repercussions to television

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think we are distracting ourselves to death

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  not just that but think about like I look at someone like my father who watches a lot of Fox News and  Well, there's I think I think the things that television brings out or  Certain types of television and I'm not trying to throw Fox News under the bus. There are programs on I would say all

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  24-hour news is bad for us  Some is worse than others, but any 24-hour news channel has an imperative to ramp up  Everything because they need to fill the time  Everything becomes important even the smallest detail and I know because I remember having to fill 12 hours a day  On tech TV. Yeah, and that's the result of it is you go every story is a big story

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I wrote it. I'm not gonna drag you through this by wrote a long and esoteric see I've confessed that so watch out  post today  About I think I mentioned this in the past this it was inspired by this book  Oh history gets things wrong the neuroscience of our addiction to stories. Yes, and I gotta read that that's a really  It's so I say yeah in this post today, which is on the rundown right minutes long and esoteric but you can  plug it anyway, I  Go through his rationale about this and  You know part of what he says in there is we is we love stories and part of the reason we're addicted to stories is a  Story with conflict gets the oxytocin. Yep  Going. Yep, and I then is what I went into  various of the academic  Not that I'm an academic, but I try to play one on TV or on podcasts  Search engines for papers and started reading through and it's fascinating they're doing experiments about whether oxytocin  If injected or up the nose makes you  More or less likely to connect with other people just by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're not talking oxycontin which is an addictive opiate and a real problem in the essence. We're talking oxy  Tocin which is they call it the love hormone which is manufactured by your own body

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's manufactured when you have an orgasm or nipple so it makes you feel good or or hello

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  After you give birth or when you cuddle a baby or even when you pet a dog when baby's nurse

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It causes the phone to write  When baby's nurse the stimulating the nipple that stimulates oxytocin  Tocin I said we have to get it right and you feel love and that's a very it's a it's a if you think about a  Great hormone, but it is also an addictive hormone. It's a pleasure hormone, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so things are set up and structured for this now you could imagine using it for good  In the sense that so this is great line. I quoted hold on. Let me get this because I love this. I love this part

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Medium so in fact this story says it's not  Attachment that's going on it's addiction to oxytocin that right we interpret as attachment. I love my baby  No, no, I just want more oxytocin

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we can hear from the card  I feel like I fell asleep for a minute. No, no, it's moving fast and I'm gonna keep it moving fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, cuz you've got to go get queso or something. I can't remember but there's no no, no, I'm sorry you guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was like, wait a second. Did I just like have a narcoleptic moment?  No, no, everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everybody's the show has had exactly that same experience. So thank you Stacey for mirroring our audience

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What the hell is going on conversation just a just a little bit? Yes to but stay in the same rut

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, it was Harvard. Yeah, havas in EU votes to create giant biometrics database  They're going to create the common identity repository CIR  Which is fingerprints?  DNA and and and the idea is it'll be used across borders by law enforcement everywhere in the EU  Well, you really that was a headlaid from oxytocin to that  And so all I was attempting in course correction, but I feel at this point a little whiplash

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just going back to things that could possibly go wrong. Okay, what could possibly go wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I've really want to know what could possibly go wrong  I got something that could possibly go wrong if you made queso out of Cheez-its  You oh, man, I'll count on me. It's called  Cheez-it queso fundito  Liven up your snacking routine with some zesty cheese it queso fundito baked snack crackers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're out of queso not queso out of cheese. We're putting the queso back in cheez-its

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So  That is like pepper jack cheese. Wait, wait, wait, let me explain. Is it just queso flavored or is there like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's got pops out of your mouth. This is this is the weasel word  It's inspired by the taste of chilies peppers and scrumptious cheese

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was when you bite into the cheese it get a little burst of case like a cheesy lava cake

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, or that gum that you chew and it's got inside its got instead of it's got fruit flavors  It's got cheese now queso inside. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My god, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can I ask one off-purpose question?  Could it and I'm asking this of the queso Queen could you make a keto queso?  In other words a no non carb queso because I could eat isn't isn't cheese not it is but there's flour in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't there or something like that? Oh, no, that's like a turn it. No. Yeah, that's a bechamel sauce or something. Oh, no  Yeah, you're fine  You put milk in your quesos to thin it  So it's not like you got to get the right consistency heavy cream cheese and jalapenos is all you need  Well, there you go. You're fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  heavy cream well

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, Velveeta is not free. He does not really cheese but it is the key to most

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Text Mexi quesos so heavy whipping cream is keto friendly and that's why I choose heavy whipping cream that I choose it  It is keto I found a keto queso there you go  Okay. Sorry about that digression back to the undersea cables

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's clever

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anyway, we're excited about Google I oh, what do you think we're gonna see at Google I oh will they hand out?  I think the rumor is we're gonna see the new inexpensive pixel phone  Exciting although is it for one day only yesterday Google was offering half off the pixel 3. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should have taken that up because I'm about to need a new phone actually  No, I'm six months from a new phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Idea actually you didn't miss it $200 off the pixel 3 and 3xl right now  So it was even more. I think it was even more as I remember 500 bucks. Oh, yeah  still these are  Usually when you see a company doing this kind of deep discount it means  So I don't you know what we had thought is this low-cost pixel  3a would be not a replacement  But in addition to a less expensive version of the phone trying to broaden the market this pixel 3 has been successful the pixel 2  Did not sell a whole lot of phones. In fact, it sold the equivalent of one weeks of iPhone sales all year long

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Cooked it's pretty much done  So here is an example article from Android police Google's considering replacing Android's back button with a gesture in Android Q that I'm not looking forward to  Now I  Thought they'd already done this don't you have gestures that go back in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Android P you're thinking of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Selecting all the previous things menu. Yeah. Well, and also I'm thinking of my galaxy s10 plus which has  It's all gesture. So I take on my s  10 plus I don't have any  Indicators at the bottom at all if I swipe up from the middle that's home  If I swipe up from the right that's previous and I love that close all button  Even though it's not necessary if I swipe up from the left, it's normally it's the previous thing  I did since I haven't done anything previously. I just closed everything. It's nothing but  gestures are big on  Android and I think that this isn't surprising. So this is the video Android key

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I can I still can't get the gesture that says what's open on your Android now  I keep on messing that up every time. I can't get that one, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just what you just saw me do it on the now that's an aesthetic feature  You swipe on the right so you think of these three buttons as being below the screen  so they're kind of invisible and the swipe you and you can change this on the Samsung but the swipe is  So you swipe up from the middle for home?  So let me go to the wrong page the swipe of the middle is home. Well, that wasn't for home

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the one where you find everything. Yeah, I'm showing you all three of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This one on the right is what you did previously, but I don't have any recently used apps, but I don't know if that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android or so you see that I get no here's the problem. Yeah, that's non-standard

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  About the s10 see that little chat head a Facebook pioneered these little pop-up notifications now with the s10  I can have every notification be a little pop-up and I tap it to open it up  Which is great or I can throw it away by swiping it off the screen somewhere. I'd rather have fewer notifications  I'm like, well, that's what I do. I only so that's Lisa see I see a little picture of Lisa  So I know that that's a Smith text message from Lisa, which is why I by the way, I'm not opening it  Okay, she's yelling at me or something she thanks you for that  Okay, let me see what she said oh  Actually, let me show you because I also have one from the New York Times  So when I tapped Lisa's head, it's what opened and so I could see there's also a news  Thing I will tap that to open it and then it opens as a window  Which I can make full screen or I can shrink away or I can close away. I think that's a really nice  that's a Samsung UI feature, but  Apparently that will also be in queue or something similar to that will also be in queue  This is the just if you want to see the gesture. This is the  version queue gesture, you see that he just swiped up  He's swiping left right. I don't know what he's doing now  It's happening unless you swipe from the edge of the screen to go back just as you would on iPhone 10 iPhone  Kind of did pioneer this they had it  So it's not enabled by default in the current version of queue  You have to use and some ADB command. This is geeky some ADB commands to to turn that on  That's something very in XDA developers. Oh, what is that?  command lines  ADB shell settings put global prototype enabled one  ABC AB TV shell settings put global squicks. I love how Stacy is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  pot for the dog

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where do you do that? Where do you go to do that? So ADB, which is the debugging interface you plug your phone into

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Windows or a computer and then you can run the ADB program which you have to download separately and then you can issue commands  That's how you also route it you've probably done it because if you've ever rooted my phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I wasn't like 100% sure what I was doing. That's the Android Kevin was helping me because he's so nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not you know  I don't normally care that much about the rumors about what the next version of Android's gonna do cuz they may or may not do it  You know, it's it's one of those you can spend a lot of energy and I got this from doing an Apple podcast for so many  Years, you spent a lot of energy on rumors

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That never happen. Well, and it feels like I mean  I'm thinking about the things in tech right now that I'm excited about and they are not things on my phone  And it part of it's because I'm an IOT person, but I'm even thinking about things like VR and I'm kind of like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well interesting and a be the big National Association of broadcasters conference, which ended last week  In years previous last few years augmented reality virtual reality huge not at all hardly at all  Right, and I think that that portends something now f8s coming up.

And Bob said yeah, I can do this and he built this thing that takes the mouth  Cavity plays the sound from the guitar into the mouth cavity through a hollow tube and then you you  Keep your mouth near the microphone and go like that and the sound comes alive  And Frampton came alive as a result

Transcript:  Oh my god, they'll probably show more of duplex. Although remember how much heat they got  From showing the duplex making restaurant reservations last year and then everybody said you ought to tell people when you're doing that  and  Apparently they are rolling it out still  I don't know. I think you know  Sometimes I don't want Google to announce new things because I know they're just gonna kill him

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's just I think it's important to start those conversations. I think that's kind of the nice thing about duplex and I'm sorry  I'm not torturing my dog you guys she's just scared of thunderstorms and she's just gonna whine and she's like a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Transcript:  She's usually I mean I can usually shut the door, but I'm in an apartment only for like a few weeks. Sorry y'all

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no apology necessary  we love  the sounds of life in our podcast  Because frankly we love podcasts  Unlike the Washington Post columnist who freaking hates podcasts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see that today? No, I didn't see this one. So on the rundown

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it should be if it isn't let me let me find it because  Yeah, no, I didn't put it in the rundown dummy. We spent about two seconds on Twitter  No, we're getting back to that believe me  There's a lot of the back button a lot. There's a lot of the back. We did we did we hit the back button on this one  this is a  squirrel, this is more like  I  Don't know what what this is. This is more like a minor digression to make time for  Stacy's dog to get over its fits  Our podcasts killing music or just wasting our time. This is your choice  Killing music or wasting time. Oh, she's music thing, right? It's a pop music critic named Chris Richards  He says I'm about to kick a hornet's nest and if this were a podcast  You would now hear the crunch of a boot perforating a hive  Following by I don't know what podcasts he listens to have we ever  Sweetened our podcast with sound effects like that. I don't think so  He says he thinks podcasts are radio lab is what he's talking about. Yeah, this is the problem  He listens to the wrong podcast. I think they're tedious and samey and sedative and when I'm feeling especially cranky  I consider them an enemy of music  Most podcasts are conversations for people to eavesdrop on yes  Rick. Oh now this is where he's really cutting cut into the quick recorded talk that precludes  Real life talk about real life  Was that me?  With zombie talk about podcasts also. I like music  He also he does although some of the things he says I kind of I kind of like  He says he says I hate podcasts because of how they sound  Forget the lousy microphones and the dinky interstitial stock music  Do do do do do do do do do do do do do the thing that derails most podcasts  And as the king of derailed podcasts, I'm gonna pay attention here. What is that?  I'm gonna pay attention here. What is that? It's the blab  There are two kinds more or less and I by the way, I do not disagree with him on that  The first is that saw right now? Yeah. Well, we're doing the second kind  The first is that soft inquisitive staccato popularized by Ira glass on this American life  Jeff Jarvis was a normal man on a normal day  He walked down the sidewalk headed to the end  The source from which so much pod voice appears to have sprung the second podcast mode  This is ours by the way is performative in a different way and you hear it on most round table podcasts a  tone that people use at parties when they want to be heard by people that aren't they aren't necessarily talking to and  It's pretty much one of the other be podcasted to in a cozy overly considered way or be podcasted at in the hastier less considered way  I prefer to be the hastier less considered podcast as club hasty and less considered  So I can't completely disagree with him except for the part where podcasts are killing music  I hope we're not killing music and I don't think we're killing music and I think there's a place for people who

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who can listen to a good podcast or for a lot of people a good podcast is like listening in on your friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have a conversation about something. I think that's what our shows are at least we're trying to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think there's a place for that for people especially if you don't have friends who are  Necessarily interested in the same things you are so like I  Don't know  I listen to people talk like I listen to podcasts about like pop culture and stuff because I don't really have a lot of friends  Where I can sit there and talk about the latest in fashion with  You know and I like them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Podcasts are just talk to real people one more way and in this case a very I think democratic egalitarian way of  Sharing ideas and voices  In case of podcast voices that are often not heard elsewhere  And they're very intimate and I think a lot of people certainly our listeners spend time  Listening in the car when they're on their way to work  It's sir. I don't I you know, we compete with audiobooks. You could say audiobooks are killing music  We compete with all kinds of different entered, you know your entertainment and I think that's good  You have a lot more choices when you're sitting in your car  Stuck on the 404 than you used to which is great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Listening to radio voices telling you the next song. It was awful broadcast radio was terrible. It needed replacing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I don't know there was

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, hi there everyone this is Brady recording live onto a wax cylinder  Record to promote our hello internet episode which is going to be released on a wax cylinder

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ironically, they are also recording it with high quality audio and video equipment across the room so that we can see it on YouTube  Anyway, I like that I think it's funny that they did it I wouldn't pay 50 pounds for it  Not even to send it to the locker gnome

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should I send it to Chris Chris?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Perilla you think you'd enjoy it  He's the one who broke the Edison cylinder. Yeah, I know I got the reference  although I'm sad to say that that was a  Hoax the whole thing. Although you can see it and watch it on YouTube if you if you'd like to relive it  By the way, he also says this guy writing in the Washington Post like it or not  Podcasts are invading a sound world near you the marquee names of podcasting  Pod save America the Joe Budden podcast and terrible. Thanks for asking  I'm familiar with one of them and many others are currently appearing on actual marquees bringing the discussions in a nightclubs and theaters  Usually dedicated to live music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Awesome. It's so much fun was Carl Castle still there or he had passed away  He had passed by then. Yeah. Well, maybe no I would have liked to have seen Carl Castle before he yeah took the big walk to the radio  Microphone in the sky or whatever it is. We're headed for  All right, take a break. Then we will talk about Twitter  Then we will talk about I'm actually saving my outrage

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because there's no outrageous Facebook stuff outrageous. Oh wait, can we also talk about the Galaxy Fold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or is that crazy? Yeah, no, we could we really should yeah, cuz I was gonna go to the T-Mobile store on Friday and buy one  Samsung saved my  Thousand two thousand dollars. Thank you, Samsung and  AOC  She's quitting Facebook and she says you should too  socialist  meanwhile  I'm gonna show you how you come to our studio when you come to our studio and you are welcome  We have an open studio. We love a studio audience email tickets at twit TV  So we know to put a chair out for you in the past when you've come to our studio  We have candid you a fairly long double-sided document a legal disclaimer and required that you read through it  But sign it before you enter our studio. We have simplified the process considerably  Thanks to Envoy, which is an awesome  iPad app designed for signing people in this is Envoy visitors  They have other apps as well in fact  There's a  Delivery app that the delivery guy the ups or FedEx guy can say, you know show what he's delivered and then it notifies  The employee that their package is at the front desk. This notifies the employee that their guests have arrived  It's nice. See it has our logo you tap to sign in you put in your name  It is it's completely replacing all that paperwork we used to do or the paper log book. That's completely useless  You could sign in unlimited visitors you can if you want connected to a printer print customized badges  You could set up VIP names. You could say if Jeff Jarvis signs in please  Sound the alarm and get everybody down the hall to welcome him  And it will even for security reasons notify administrators about unattended guests when visitors arrive they sign in on the kiosk  They enter their details. They sign any legal documents NDAs right on the iPad  Envoy will then notify their host automatically and it uses all the tools you probably already use like  Slack or box or Salesforce chatter or G suite  So your employee knows the guest is there so you don't have to call them or anything. They come down the hall  By the way, no more awkward meetings  Coming down the hall not expecting somebody and there he is in the lobby. You don't have to worry about that either  You'll boost your office efficiency. You'll add to security without intimidating your visitors  In fact visitors we know because we've used this for a while now  Love it  It's a great way to make your office both  more  Welcoming and more secure and it works  For all companies of all kinds even those in highly regulated industries because it meets security and compliance requirements  So many companies Nike see the Nike swoosh Mazda  Weight watchers Pinterest slack L'Oreal and twit  We all use envoy to welcome over 30 million visitors so far  Protect your people your property and your ideas the welcoming way with  Envoy 10,000 people 10,000 workplaces use envoy worldwide to make a great first impression. I love it because we didn't have to buy  Additional hardware runs in a normal iPad  Envoy is the software and you just put it on any iPad and most of us have a few iPads lying around  Envoy comm slash twit start your free trial today. Welcome to the modern lobby with Envoy Envoy  Envoy comm slash twit. Thank you on by for your support  Thank you for supporting us by using that URL if you want to check out Envoy really is great. Just love it  I've been actually looking for something to do this  ever since we started having you know  We have a guard at the front desk and we have a big sign in process and you have to these days  Unfortunately for legal and security reasons, but this really simplifies it  Galaxy fold  Man, you know, it was so funny because the first initial thoughts as the Galaxy fold started to go out to reviewers like Steve Kovac and  Marquez Brownlee Joanna Stern at the Journal and Dieter Bohn mark German at Bloomberg gets they started the first day  They go. Oh, I get it. I get it  This is exactly what you want a phone to be simple and small for the basic stuff  But you can open it up and get a nice seven plus inch screen  That was day one  day two  It broke. Oh  I mean for different reasons. So Marquez Brownlee and Stephen Kovac  Removed a  plastic  Coating on top of it, which I don't blame them for doing when I got my galaxy s10 and many  Samsung phones they have a pre-installed screen protector. I don't like screen protectors. So I peel them off  I did that on my s10 turns out that wasn't a screen protector. That was  In a way, well, I mean they literally protected the screen. Here's I fixes fixes article about this  It was necessary the problem with flexible screens. They have to be OLED screens. They're very fragile  So they have a layer they're plastic  Plastic on top of it  But they're also sealing it and this is the other problem with the galaxy fold according to I fix it when you close it  That when you see that hinge you can see that it's not that the screen is not fully sealed  And that was the problem Dieter bone had at the verge  He said we think what happened we when we take pictures for our reviews we use a little molding putty  Underneath the device to hold it in place or hold it up  We think that got into the hinge and then that caused a protrusion on the screen in any event  When you send out I don't know what they sent out a couple of dozen  We didn't get one but I know a lot of people did in fact Renee Richie said they had two at mobile nations when you send  Out say a couple of dozen phones and half of them get broken in the first two days, you know, you have a problem  Samsung said okay. We're not gonna launch that phone Friday  You're gonna step back and figure out what's going on. So how many they made I was impressed because Samsung originally was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're not delaying the launch and then like a few hours later. They're like, oh  They had to well, that's what everyone does like that's what I thought I was like, wow, this is I mean  It's pretty you don't want the note 7 thing all over again, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They had to recall every single note 7 and these phones weren't blowing up  But yeah, it was still bad. You would still have to recall it if you found you  Yeah  so  AT&T representatives say June 13th  So it's not that long. It's a month and a half later  Samsung says no, we haven't set a date but AT&T is adamant  So I  Think it's reasonable that AT&T thinks it's going to be then but it but Samsung wants to reserve the right not to ship it  If they think I'll be any problem  Save me two grand that's all I'm saying because I was gonna go into T-Mobile on Friday and buy one  so I because I wanted to talk about it and I was kind of excited because it it is the first really new form factor for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A phone we've seen in a while. I was super excited. I was so bummed when I started seeing this  I was like, ah, I really want to see like again new form factor and I really thought they had it right  I guess I was like Samsung wouldn't put out something that wasn't you know engineered and considered  This isn't like  You know what was Andy Rubin's company? I can't think of it right now essential  Essential this is this is a this is Samsung. They know what they're doing, but no

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and that is a bit of a question. I mean, how could you not see this coming?  Did you never let it out of the lab? Didn't you give it to employees Apple does this we know cuz  Employees have lost phones other companies do it to take into the wild and use for several months before you ship the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They must have so it's puzzling. Is it just because the cover was taken off by people? No or no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, there was another one too

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Joanne a stern  Started to peel hers back at the Wall Street Journal and then said maybe not  Marquez Brownlee and Stephen Kovac said yes, we took it off  But Dieter Bohn did not and his still got damaged  Mark Gurman didn't and German didn't so okay  There's a problem and the problem is probably that stuff can get in under the OLED screen  you don't it's too it is super fragile and that's the  That's kind of like super fragile callistic XB. Alladocia. It's super fragile and you don't want anything to get in there  And and so one of the things Samsung said initially so we're gonna put a big warning on there  We should have told these guys or there's a debate about whether they told the reviewers not to  But we're gonna make sure that everybody gets his phone knows don't remove that that's part of the screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I mean so so does it lock open oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you're working with it, I don't think when you yeah when you want to like watch a movie or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to have to hold both sides open. I always wondered that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't know and then I also read a number of commentaries about the fact that everybody has a different way of closing it  There's no obvious way of closing it  Well, some people might do it like that some people, you know  Samson when they test that you know, they have its testing machine does it in the testing machine? It's even pressure along the entire, you know  Is not a good it's not people are not gonna do that. They're gonna whack it closed, right?  Yeah, we have a case like I have here which is a case of cover  There's lots of ways of closing that case and I probably use all of them if I'm holding the phone like that  I might do that  so  These test machines probably didn't catch this potential problem in any event. I think Samsung I feel bad for Samsung  I've said this before I love the s10 plus. It's the best phone I've ever had  It's just incredible and I was really hopeful and I was willing to set, you know, of course, I have a budget for this  This is my job, but I was willing to put aside two thousand dollars to get this phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They were in it. I was willing to support you spending

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, so there you go anything else you want to say Stacey about it it's sad  Yeah, I'm just disappointed. Yeah  It's not over. It's sad. You know what else is disappointing sprint settled with AT&T over 5g e and  And AT&T is continuing to use the 5g e label on their phones  Sprint suit saying it's blatantly misleading but at but at some point settled  I don't know why they settle. I don't know why they sued if they plan to settle  They didn't settle in a way. They kept AT&T from using it. I  Think it hurts AT&T, honestly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although yeah, but no it didn't I mean remember again HSPA plus that did not hurt them. No people people aren't that techie  I just had someone asked me about what was it? Oh  I have my cable installer today was telling me he's like, oh, you know, I think finally came

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Finally came. Yes. I saw the dog waiting for the cable installer. Sorry, but this is more important news  I saw the door because I don't keep a smaller. I miss all the stuff. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he was supposed to come or the cable person was supposed to come Monday and they never did and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, so I posted a picture of my dog looking adorable waiting for the cable person  But we're sitting we're sitting there today  He's installed the network and it was a 2.4 gigahertz and a 5 gigahertz network and I was like, oh are they the same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Please  And he didn't I mean he didn't he wasn't maliciously saying that no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, he's like, you know and the 5g networks really fast and I was like, it's it's true. The 5 gigahertz network is really fast  He's like, I don't know why people use the 2.4 network. It's silly and I was like, well, it  But but yeah, so he was all excited about 5g he's like everyone's talking about it I was like I know so, you know  There's a lot of confusion out there is the point  on all 5g

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  LT I'm gonna give you an IOTE by the way  I'm really interested to see that your dog wears Nike shower shoes much like Mark Zuckerberg

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the IOT device will join the 5g network 5 gigs network and not work and  So somebody called the radio show and said well, what do I do about that?  Then a guy called in and said I got a solution for you. It works for me every time you start walking  And you get so far away that the 5 gigahertz signal does not go as far as the 2.4, right?  So you have so far away that the 5 gigahertz signal is so attenuated your phone joins the 2.4 gigahertz then you pair it up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's actually a really good idea isn't it put it in your newsletter I'm telling you  Kevin Kevin and I have talked about this. It's actually a very common. It's a conundrum  It's not because well, well, there's there's a couple issues  Not every Google Wi-Fi is actually a huge perpetuator of this problem  My euro stuff almost always works with every device euro doesn't write. No, I agree with you euro does it right? Yeah  Yeah, Google Wi-Fi is funky and a lot of a lot of them are funky a lot of them. Don't be I think is funky  Velops isn't funky. But yeah, there there is and part of it is because what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We should have a funky not funky list. I think would be really good  So we could put that in your newsletter and smoke pass. No pass pass. No funky not funky

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so yes, that is a excellent pro tip and I will I will put that in the newsletter actually  We'll share it on the podcast pro tip. Yeah, you don't have to give me credit. I will keep I always give credit credit

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Where credit is due man? Well, I don't I should give credit to this listener calling  I don't know his name off the top of my head. Oh, I am really disappointed. We were talking for years  We've been talking about the laundry folding robot  Right, right, right sure they just filed for bankruptcy. Oh no on droid. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, there's a new laundry laundry  folding robot and the fun part about this one  Yeah, is that it's the robot with hands  But when the time comes and you want to fold your laundry you tell it and a person comes and operates the hands  That's called a maid  It's like a mechanical Turk that pulls your laundry  It's three thousand dollars it's in Japan and it's kind of an interesting concept because you basically what I mean  It's still a robot still folds laundry. So you don't have to you're just it's laundry folding as a service

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Backed by a human being somewhere in the world. Are you folding as a service? We call that wash and fold

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's like labor arbitrage. Basically, you could have someone in the Philippines come over and  You don't fold your laundry without actually ever leaving their house. If you've been waiting if you've been waiting

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  For the laundry folding robot anxious to buy it by the way only sixteen thousand dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I guess see that one was that one the new ones three  $3 a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thousand wait a minute and you still have to pay somebody to fold your laundry. No, no, that's part of the three thousand dollars  Oh, it includes well, how many hours of laundry folding? You know, I did not investigate that. Is there a person in the box?  Where's this person?  Yeah, they teleoperated oh no, oh no this must not succeed because then I see I imagine an office building somewhere outside of  Phoenix with thousands of people in little cubicles wearing visors

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Folding your laundry with joysticks, but that's not but but what if it was like the the Japanese  robot cafe that's operated by by

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was interesting handicapped people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, so this is this is kind of like let's see. Where should I put this?  I'm gonna try to put this in the show notes somewhere, but I don't know where the government's change log other other

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Put it at the bottom all this all the good stuff's at the bottom. Oh here

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  laundry  I put it in the wrong place Carson. I'm an idiot. There we go. This has been a fun show. I like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This show is I'm sorry, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This robot laundry is excited or exciting and I wrote about this a couple weeks ago is there's a big trend towards  Teleoperations of all kinds of devices from autonomous cars to ferries to even drones  So like Google actually just to bring it back to Google because I I love y'all like that  Their wing okay first of all there's a guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Holding the plug feeding out the wire to the robot so that it can walk on your own  To gaffer  Can walk over to the washing machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, actually what we need is a robot a tele-operated robot to gaff and there's another guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Holding a laundry basket also following the robot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Carefully robot all the way was twitching his fingers. This is not gonna work

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The robot is both of those guys could be replaced by more  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's robots all the way down all the way down. Why don't we just make a washing machine that folds your laundry?  Another guy's a laundry hanging device. Oh  my god  Well, this is a demo. This is it. This is your house. You would set things up  How many engineers does it take to fold a t-shirt?  Apparently three plus a robot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in this guy is your remote operator, I believe yes, I see him there yes  Well, so, you know the reason why laundry folding robots are so hard, right? It's so difficult to do  Why because it's very hard a computer can be trained to do one specific object really well  Right or one specific thing really well  So it can pick up an object at the same size and put it in the same place every time  What's hard is when you do laundry, there's different sized things. So it's like I don't know, you know  It it's it's finger grasping can't always grasp the things correctly and when you fold it, it's so that's requiring

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everything's different. There's no standard. I want to see this demo and shark tank. I think this would be an awesome demo  Incidentally, I hope we don't get the you go corporation taking our video from today down  If our videos taken down by a laundry folding robot that will in fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Be the day I quit podcasting whatever your three strikes, that's the three strikes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, we haven't we don't have any strikes because we always appeal and they say oh, yeah. Yeah, we're right. You were right  We shouldn't have  so  Google walkout organizers are saying they're facing retaliation for organizing those walkouts  They've been some of them have been demoted  Yeah, this is well now let me ask you this question though  And maybe it's because we're in California which is an at-will work state  but honestly if  If our employees decided to hold a workout walkout, I would I would have the right to fire them. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what said answer me this  If it's if it is a labor organizing event or you can't if it's a union if it's a union event that's protected I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can't that be union busting. Although there's plenty of other goes on. What about an organizing event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it whistle-blowing because there's that's protected as sure, but then you'd have to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whistle-blowing they're not whistle-blowing in the sense that there's harsh didn't get back in your desk. They're not don't get the idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're not revealing anything  Illegal that the company's doing they're just saying we don't want to work on  AI that helps the military or  Or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah, so was it wasn't about their work conditions. It was a protest and in fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Meredith Whitaker who leads the leads Google Open Research  Said that after the company disbanded its external AI ethics council on April 4th. She was told her role would be changed dramatically  She said in order they told her in order to stay at the company at Google  You'd have to allow you'd have to abandon your work on AI ethics your role at the AI now Institute the research center  She co-founded at NYU  Chris Stapleton comes her Claire Stapleton another walkout organizer and 12 year veteran of the company  Said that two months after the protest she was demoted from her role as marketing manager at YouTube and would lose half her reports  But is that illegal is my question. It may be you know, maybe reprehensible or moral or  It's not good PR. It's not good PR, but it's not illegal and I think no  I don't a company has the right to retaliate against workers if you see you serve it at the company as well  Say it I don't want to sound like you know  Well, you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Corporate apologists here, but you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he's a corporate mogul himself

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right Karsten you are absolutely positively right? There's nothing wrong with anything you have ever said that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What are you up for review well, but so I mean there's James Daymore right who wrote that  Reprehensible memo and did get fired, but that's that's very different. That is that's different

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is an HR challenge makes it difficult to work with him  I mean, there's a lot of wrote a memo if you wrote an email to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Larry Page or Sundar Pichai and said, you know, I don't think we should be doing this kind of research  They're not gonna they're not gonna demote you for that or are they?  I don't know I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably not because they haven't been seen at the Googleplex in a while. So it would be someone else  Anyway, I bring this up. I think we've got one of these two on Tech News Weekly on Thursday, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can get one of the story one of the demotees  Okay, one of the organizers the Google walkout  One of these employees at Twitter who is known as the  Google walkout  One of these employees at Twitter who is no longer working here  No, I wouldn't I wouldn't fire an employee for doing that. I  Might well, there you go. See  Like if Kevin's watching he's on notice there was a remember we had the total eclipse and everybody went out to see that  All three of you  I  Brought it brought the operation to its knees for 30 minutes  so  the Twitter CEO  Goes to the White House. Mr. Dorsey goes to the White House after  Sending an email to his employees apologizing in effect  He says we meet with a lot of heads of state. We think it's good to have a conversation. I know  Jack Dorsey wrote some of you think I shouldn't  But in the long run, I think it's good to meet heads of state in order to listen share our principles and  our ideas  Like like there's any like he's gonna listen, you know, what do you do?  I so apparently according to people in the room because it was a closed-door meeting  there was no press but some people leaked that the  Primary topic of discussion for the half-hour was President Trump saying why am I Twitter follower count going down?  Can you can you do something that and Dorsey said well mine went down too  Because we're getting rid of bots. It's normal. It's not but those are my Russian friends. Yeah, really

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're the ones who got me elected. Yeah, get rid of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They Twitter Trump had tweeted right before the meeting that Twitter was playing political games  Tampering with his nearly 60 million followers a  Significant this is the Washington Post a significant portion of being focused on Trump's concern that Twitter quietly and deliberately has  Limited or removed some of his followers  Trump said he heard from fellow conservatives who had lost followers for unclear reasons as well  Twitter long explained follower figures fluctuate. I've lost several hundred thousand. I think no fifty thousand your account  I reinstated it but I'll tell there's a long story there. I didn't quit. I didn't kill it. I just  Took a break paused it and I recently reinstated it  Not although I go back and forth as obviously because every time I go on there ago. Well, it's not that valuable  I don't really I'm not sure I really need it. But I I wanted to test the reason I reinstated  I think I talked about this last week of the week before is  Twitter had said we are not gonna wait for abuse  Reports to get rid of abusive tweets. We are gonna be proactively eliminating abusive tweets  And I thought what better way to test this policy  Than to paint a big target on my rump and go on Twitter and so far I have to admit  I haven't seen any abusive tweets that will change now. I'm sure but  But I did notice what I just invited them  I did yeah  I did notice when I came back that I probably lost about 50,000 a lot not because I wasn't there  I think but mostly because one thing another thing I've noticed  Your follower count goes up as long as you don't tweet  The minute you tweet that's gonna cut your account because there's gonna be somebody doesn't like what you say  So the best way to increase your numbers just to have an account and publicize it but not say anything  I don't have that problem at all. I know you and I have very different Twitter's there's Stacy Twitter and there's Leo Twitter  I got no problems. There's Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter is wonderful. Did you ever think the problem might be?  You know, ah  Well, in fact, in fact, I've been thinking about this lately that that we cover the internet the wrong way now  The internet has become so much ingrained what we do that we should be covering the people who are on it  Not the technology right whether it's Sri Lanka or or whether it's anything else  We we're covering Facebook as if it's an entity. No, we're covering the activities of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because the heritage of what I do is oh has always been with the technologies  We do we were not specifically whether it was tech TV or early days of Twitter  We were not we were specifically not interested in people  But you can't covering machine no hope now you have no hope now. That's the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People have gotten into the machine your world the people are in the machine galaxy fold and somebody put some people in it. Yeah  That's your problem there's your problem Leo in a nutshell yes, but that's and incidentally that is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  long-standing kind of  Evolutionary step in all technologies. I think I often compare it to the days and you remember this Jeff in the early days of  Hi-fi you had all these hi-fi magazines and it was all about the hardware  It was all about you know  How much power you could get without distortion and all this stuff and then long around about the 60s when Rolling Stone came out  And suddenly started becoming about the stuff you played on the hardware  Not the hardware itself hi-fi magazines went away Rolling Stone and and other magazines took over and that's exactly the shift  I think that's happened in technology where in the early days of technology we were talking about speeds and feeds and processors and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  More than that because it's not the producers of the music. It's the listeners of the music. Yeah, right. It's the audience  It's the public  Has now entered in your world and so and so it's it's not the tool it's what's being done with the tool it needs  The coverage right?  Right, so there's a great  That is good. Oh, okay. Can we can we can we mark this in the history books? We start Carson  Can you put that in the history books? Stacey?  On me there's a yes, we are there's a great  Leo is the problem I put a great post up on  On  about the UK  Online harm support which we talked about last week  In which he said that basically what the UK is trying to do is to pass an omnibus law against bad behavior without defining bad  Right and and because people are thinking it's a technology. No, it's no different. It's it's soylent internet  Yeah, it's right and and that's the problem. Yeah, and we're not thinking that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is this the Europe against the net post?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, that's an older one that's much older. No, no, I don't like post

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I think you should call it the soylent internet gross. It's made of people  We're to put under government maybe under government, but you're right and this is the point I mean if you want it  This is why we need to have government  Regulations slash a conversation about what this means for people and  This is why diversity is so important now in tech. Yes  Still don't want because you're affecting so many different types of lives and you need to have those perspectives in here because  It's reflect you need to have your tools and services be reflective of the people that will use them  Otherwise you build stupid stuff that either nobody likes or a small segment of the population links  And you think it's all that in a piece of cake  aka Twitter  Did they just change everything about Twitter? Did that just happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you must have the new UI. Are you looking at I have the new UI? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They always complain. I'm not complaining. I'm just like again, I've been moving so  Did did I just blink and Twitter changed? Yes. The answer is yes. Okay, they do that a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't I don't know if that's really what somebody was complaining about not being able to edit a photo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't know you could edit a photo on Twitter. Oh, yeah, you can edit all kinds of photos

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why I did not edit the photo of my dog though, I should have cut out this the slippers

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the Pew Research Center on Internet and technology where they they are constantly doing surveys this one to set  2791 US adult Twitter users who are willing to share their Twitter handles  Survey says US adult Twitter users are younger  Not much of a surprise and more likely to be Democrat Democrats than the general public because they're younger because they're younger  most users rarely tweet  The most prolific 10% create 80% of the tweets from US adult users  Hello journalists  Yeah, and they're probably all journalists a minar a large majority of tweets come from a small minority of tweeters  Here's what's wrong with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The logic behind this survey if I may  It treats of course  How do I say this um  It's treating Twitter's creators Twitter's people as if they're an audio a mass audience that all see the same thing  So to say it's what always drives me nuts when I see a headline Twitter says there's no such thing  Nobody sees the same Twitter  Nobody sees everybody on Twitter the fact that the total makeup on Twitter is absolutely as meaningless utterly meaningless because it's what is really

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but you're saying everybody's if I just follow people in my age cohort my Twitter would be you know  Silver parts. Yeah. Yeah, Twitter silver. Yeah, right. So so to say that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, those are the people  It's the people causing the problems the old farts most Twitter users engage modestly

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The 10% of tweet most often focus more on politics and are here was a big surprise mostly women. Oh  Oh  Huh? Now this is not what you're talking about Jeff because this talks about the entire universe  Admittedly, you know if you don't follow any women none of your two the tweets in your feet are women  But still I think it's it's germane to say that most of the people who tweet are women

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder if that's because we can curate and I mean, yes people can come into our they can slide into our DMS  But you can curate your experience to some effect on Twitter and there's a lot of female journalists believe or not

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think well, I don't want to make too many generalizations because you'll punch me  65% of  The top 10% of tweeters are women so more than the more than half that you would  Anomaly expense. Well, it's a significant large larger portion. That means 35% are men. That's that's a big deal  I think and but that makes sense because women  if you're gonna make the generalization that's gonna cause you to punch me are more like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Communicate actually I wasn't gonna make that generalization  I was gonna say that because women don't have as many avenues mainstream avenues  It's a good opportunity to share our thoughts on ding ding ding ding ding ding ding

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  This is what I had a fit with Farhad Manju for telling journalists get off Twitter  People who had never been heard before in mainstream media who aren't in newsrooms finally have a voice and you're gonna turn your back on them  Oh, that's really interesting  Me to reactivate my Twitter account without Twitter we wouldn't have had me to and living while black  Right and and because those represented

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Newsrooms are more represented on exactly and whether they're represented in the whole world or with each other kind of doesn't matter, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you can  Know I was just gonna say to build on that like you can follow those people like it gives them an extra  Extra resonance in the same in the way like anytime there's a tragedy for example, someone will always  By the way follow so-and-so there, you know, let's say it's a hurricane  They're a meteorologist in the area or if it's black lives matter  They're an activist who is on the ground who's been working in this community for you know, a decade. So there's  When things happen and I actually think this is hugely valuable  I do it to a lesser extent for you know  I follow weird spectrum policy walks on Twitter that no one else follows because I  Want to understand what they're thinking so and then as a journalist you can  Those voices can get a say in the mainstream media that they haven't before  So I again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's where it's where alternative conversations happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're not alternative. So I was going over this so we have a Center for Community and Ethnic Media  we're trying to come out the right name because community and ethnic are quite it and  I hope she won't mind the head of it was email me today talking about it  You know, it's using the word everybody and to me everybody  No, it's not everybody's mass. Yeah, right  But I know what she's saying is now finally it could be everybody  It's also so it's not alternatives. It's not new voices. These voices have always been there  Nobody could hear them because they didn't have the the outlet and and social media gives them that which is part of well

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Except AOC who says

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a health risk a little bit of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hypocrisy there since it made her okay. No, I think again both things can be true  I think there are enough documented studies where we talk about where we see that being online all the time interacting with people  Especially once you rise to prominence, especially as a woman it is a health risk  You can only have so many people telling you constantly how crappy you are

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's gonna affect you that's the difference in Stacy Twitter and Leo Twitter by the way  You have nice people talking to you on Twitter. I  Mean I've had to block a couple I don't get as much hate as AOC does obviously  Clearly see why somebody like AOC somebody who is a public figure and also a  Hotspot is gonna say oh, I don't this is not good and yet your argument  Jeff is really important here. It is a chance for underrepresented voices to speak to her  So there's there's got to be a middle. Yes here. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this goes back to them to the online harvesting in the UK  They would say in the in the bourgeois internet that Facebook should kill all the bad things  But I don't want them in that role particularly. They should not be the arbiter of good and bad  Well, that's what the UK is telling me should be I know I agree literally legal legal but harmful goes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, that's bad, it's it's awful what if

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem is they don't give you the tools to mediate your own experience in a way that you can walk away from that's why we like  Google plus because you could very easily do that and if you could if we could come up with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is that thing that the guy doesn't like podcasts hates by the way just yeah, yeah  Every do we  Whistling

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  especially whistling but actually having  not legislating what they can and cannot do but  legislating or having the capability and technical acumen to say  Here's the sorts of rules that you should implement to give users the tools now one could say that in a capitalistic system  That that wouldn't be necessary because you would just go to a platform where you aren't attacked  Which then gets to maybe we should be looking at you know anti like data gathering and network effects as part of our competition  policy I  This is one of those things where I'm like, I don't know that's that's possible doesn't doesn't Twitter have enough tools for you to you can block

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Keywords, right? You can block people. Yes. The problem is they're still talking talking about you. Yeah, they're still you're just blocking from you  Yeah, but you know what there should not be a tool for somebody like  AOC to say oh nobody can say anything bad about me in public. That's not she's a member of Congress

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not the sort of thing that they would be doing. It's policing violence speech. It's policing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they should okay and there are laws against that side  So they should clearly they should be doing that Twitter says they are accepting cases  Where they leave the tweet up so law enforcement can act which makes no sense to me at all since  Make a print out and send it to the cops you don't have to leave it up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, it's crazy  But this is also where I go back to and we're not gonna go through it again  But my the proposal that I wrote about I think two weeks ago about the Internet Court if it is illegal  Then courts should rule and  You do it that way. Yes, if it's merely bad, then you go to Stacy's point. What's the quality of the experience?  What tools are you giving people? What's the warranty you're giving people about how they can protect themselves and deal with themselves?  And what's what's possible for instance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  some of the heat I get on Twitter is legitimate or illegitimate but criticism of  Performance on the shows or the shows themselves. I don't you know might hurt my feelings  I don't like it, but that kind of thing is not problematic in any real way. It just hurts my feelings  and so and and the problem is from a human personal point of view humans are bad judge of whether this is damaging  threatening or just insulting and you know, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think you are missing a huge class or maybe you're willfully ignoring a huge class of comments  Directed I mean, I'm sure they're directed towards men a lot  But they're that are directed towards women that are not just I disagree with your oh, I know about those

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because I have a wife who's on in public and I am very well aware of those and many of our female  Staffers and female contributors. I have seen you know, the worst of humanity  Attacking them as far worse for them than it is for me. I never have anything anywhere near that bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I wonder so one of the if you think about it as a public square problem, right  And if I think about my ability to walk outside and hang out in Austin, for example  And not have people walk up to me and yell hateful stuff at me, you know, is that protected by law? I probably could

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ask no, it's actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I could ask someone's like a cop and they'd probably be like dude  Stop stop harassing that lady. Just stop go do it. It's not it's probably not illegal or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacy here's what I'm happy. So other good people would come up and tell him to shut up one would hope but can you imagine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're kind of invective that Alexandria Ocasio  Cortez faces in public not not just not done with okay, go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what's okay in Austin, let's say, you know people running around topless, you know, we had Leslie the naked guy  He would just run around either naked or in a bikini, right in Austin. That's totally okay in rural Kansas. That would be  Not okay in part of the problem here is we have  These platforms that are international and they're trying to cover social mores for so many different  Communities that they really can't and the tools have to be flexible  But you're also going to run into people from Kansas who are seeing people from Austin and get offended and I'm not talking about  Hate speech. I'm just talking about people getting offended by things on this platform. This is why it's hard  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Stacy, let me go back to what what I interrupted you and I apologize  I was trying to agree with you. But if you do that on the street, right? Let's say it's a crowded street  One would hope Austin be in a nice place if somebody somebody walks up to you and just starts saying horrible things  That forget the cop that other people would say man  Cool chill relax, which is let the lady be alone. That's what we need  In public. That's what we need online too. We see too little of that  We don't see anyone reacting to the bad behavior because part of it is we say don't feed the troll which is a proper tactic  But the other part of it is that I think we and we too often send people a lot. They're yelling at Stacy. Ah  Right, and we encourage the behavior  How do we get our norms?  recalibrated  for all of us to have a responsibility for bad behavior I

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think some of it people just don't see like I know that for a while there was a movement  You know to retweet some of your hateful things. So people like holy cow and  There's also you know, I don't actually want someone sometimes people defend me on Twitter  I'm like, let's just you know, ignore them  So I think it is hard to I mean the point  To say you can't read the situation as well as you can online as you can and like a street if that also makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Though but but I do think in general I rarely see people coming to the defense of someone  I rarely see someone shaming somebody for just bad behavior. I mean I try to do it but I come off like a nanny

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But yeah, how about Sri Lanka let's bring in Sri Lanka into this because  horrific the horrific horrific  bombings in Sri Lanka and hundreds dead very sad  One of the topics that came up though on twit on Sunday was the fact that the government in Sri Lanka shut down social media shortly thereafter  Saying it's problematic. It's inciting violence and  I at the time  Twisted it to serve my anti Facebook techno Valley  And I'm quoting from a tweet by you had Jana  Ida can't pronounce this is a great threat. This is a killer  The love of whatever you hold wholly right stop twisting this incident to serve your anti Facebook techno Valley politics right now in a country with  tight government controls on  traditional media  Social media is a boon for us  To make an effort to understand violence in  Sri Lanka began before social media internet telephony to a large extent much of race hatred is still fueled by print media in this country  You want to point fingers at least do your research into a complex history take a look at statements by local politicians  See how they are reacting  Look, this is too much work for American journalists  But okay look up the patterns of violence around elections race issues politics  Leave your biases and baggage at the door. Keep in mind that some of the voices you hear  You will hear pontificating or not from what is what is hashtag I key K a  It was the bombing was I think okay and have not been for decades and understand the zeitgeist about  Zeitgeist about as much as my cat understands Twitter look for local Janet journalists on the hashtag  LKA tag I get well Sri Lanka  I don't know anyway  Whether you like it or not the overwhelming mind share your platforms have enabled you to set the global narrative around Sri Lanka do your job  Be responsible. So what he's saying is  In fact social media is is the truth-teller in this case  not the mainstream media in Sri Lanka and the way that another

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thread which I think I put in right above there on the on the rundown said it's also where you can find your family  You know, there's a lot here  That again goes to the people who are not in power who have a communication do bad things happen there  Yes to the bad guys using it but the truth is you close social media the bad guys are going to  Plenty of platformers means they have yeah, it's the victims who don't have a means anymore. Yeah, so that is really

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  important and interesting point and highlights  How hard it is to judge this stuff because of cultural assumptions whether it's Austin versus Kansas or the US versus Sri Lanka

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is Kara Swisher jumped on to her  She had a New York Times column and jumped in quickly to say that, you know  her first reaction was she was happy about this and people a lot of people sent her a lot including  Rasmus Kleist Nielsen at the Oxford Reuters Institute for the study of journalism, you know  Got researchers out who were talking about what the research is and what happens when you shut down these kinds of networks. It doesn't  but according to the research thus far it doesn't end the violence and  So we've got to deal with the reality and evidence of what's really happening rather than these emotional responses. Is it still shut down? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't know. I was wondering it myself. Yeah, so if it were that would confirm this which is basically it's the government saying  We we want to could tightly control the story  probably in our favor as opposed to  Let  Original and honest voices come out see in the United States. It's it's usually  At least we hope we feel like it's the opposite that social media is where?  amplification occurs for all the you know  weird dystopian and  and violent

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, we just we just in the media tend to focus on those things  I mean again, you see some really good things black lives matter like this all of that like this tweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like this is very informative. This is hugely valuable  It's good. It's great. You know, so that's that is the value of Twitter. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go. Wait a second. Did I just hear you say that is the value?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's one of the values of Twitter and I never just disagreed with that  It is a chance for all voices to be heard just as the internet is just as podcasting is just as YouTube is  But we can't we can't ignore the  You know baleful

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But even there Leo's, you know again you're a celebrity and Stacy you're a female celebrity and so that has an impact but  My Facebook feed is fine. There's nothing bad in it. Nothing. Yeah, except did you read this thing that Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  did

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Well now that they you're going to a bit of a non sequitur here. You're gonna complain about Facebook, which is fine  I was playing about the company. I'm not complaining. That's fine. That's a different thing  But remember this is the feed is managed by this company that is clearly immoral  So that's my closure. I raised money for my school from Facebook. I'm independent  I don't think you're defending Facebook for that reason. No, no, no, I'm not but I'm just gonna let full disclosure before we get into it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Facebook  unintentionally, they say uploaded email context of one and a half million new Facebook users since  May 2016 it turns out that when some people were  Joining Facebook it was asking users to enter their email not email address  email passwords  to verify their identities  Face on you know, that's ridiculous. That's ridiculous  Yes for millions of people  furthermore  So, okay  So first of all a normal site says is this your email and then sends you an email and says click to confirm  That would be sufficient you control this email address  Facebook's asked for email addresses and passwords to verify  What they did was logged in and imported all your contacts without telling you  Facebook disclosed on Wednesday to Business Insider that one and a half million people's contacts were collected this way  Fed into Facebook's system  Where they were used to improve Facebook's ad targeting  Yeah, maybe build Facebook's web of social connections. Definitely and oh, yeah recommend friends to add

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep, that's how they got those creepy things about your therapist and everybody else showing up on Facebook. No. No. Yeah  We now and it was exactly what everyone's worst-case scenario was  Suspected I mean that's and you cannot

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Facebook this is not unintentional. Oh, well, wait a minute. How do you unintentionally ask for a password?  login download the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great I agree. No, I agree. I was like, no, that's a feature. You actually specifically had to build that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you built it somebody coded that and improved it and it got into the code base  So my point is that yeah your feed might be fine, but the company that controls what you see in that feed does stuff like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nothing Facebook does surprises me. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's not a scrub that is  I  Mean that I recently think recreated a new Instagram account, please don't ask to follow me. It's private and you will not be allowed  Can you can I get in no for one reason I Lisa said look I post all of our vacation pictures on Instagram  Right create an account follow me. I only follow her and you will be able to see them that made sense  I cannot tell you how many times I've lost count  Account has asked for my contact list again and again and again and again and again and it continues to do so  Yeah, it's growth hacking but but honestly  Please do not forget that when I give my contact list to a company. I am NOT selling myself out  I'm selling every single person. I know out their name their address their phone number their address  I am giving that to Facebook every single one of my 4000 contacts. I would be giving every one of those 4000 people  Personal information your personal information Stacey yours Jeff to Facebook  I bet they asked for that again and again and again and again and  They pretend that it's just so we can tell you when your friend joins Instagram truth is they already have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so surprised that they I  remember so I  Very early in my journalism career my publisher actually so as a journalist I have all my sources and contacts, right?  It's it's a pretty great list, right and our publisher really wanted it because they wanted to spam our contacts with ads or  ad pitches basically buy from us and so we actually  She went into our shared server. So our Microsoft Exchange server  I think it was it was trying to pull our content. Yes. Oh my god. I hope she was fired. Um,  She this was she thought this was awesome  so we actually had to pull all of our contacts off that and had to like keep our contacts completely separately in  To me it is such and this was this was in 2000, right? So it is so weird to me  how much that mindset has shifted for people because like  Not not just as a journalist, but again, like you said, it's your friends. It's your family  Why would you sell them out, especially if they did, you know don't want you to share that so  Yeah, it's nuts. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Never tried and what has evolved in our understanding of this is we you used to be for oh they want it for a mailing list  That's valuable. You could sell those names. It's not about a mailing list  It's about building such something so much more sophisticated a social graph  friends of friends Facebook  really  Deeply understood this early on they understood how valuable a social graph was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well getting your email password is phishing. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would hope I would I would hope that  Would say no, but no, right  People do because it's they're innocent people. They don't know this. They just there are friends and family  They're not geeks if you and I were asked for a password from Facebook  We wouldn't give it to them talk about it for an hour on the show. Yeah  I mean you've worn people off in your radio. Oh, it is we should make the point. It wasn't universal on Facebook  Maybe it was a pilot program. Maybe they were just I don't know. I mean, I don't it wasn't something everybody that's the problem was so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Much of this at all the platforms is there's there's a there's a  Back to the early days. There's a very low tolerance for always just a test  Yeah, move fast and it doesn't represent policy. We were just trying something out  You can't use that excuse anymore because what you're doing is gonna be seen and it speaks for you as a company  But that's that that's that's so historic and the way these cultures work

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and it was I had real trepidation about creating an Instagram account because I don't want to give Facebook any  Information and just the fact that I have that Instagram  On my on my phone is I know giving them a lot of information because there's location information  There's all sorts of information that is now leaking out to Facebook. We it's good. We've become aware of that  We can now we are now a little bit more at choice about how we do that  And of course, I won't we've talked about it not on this show before but about the Journal of American Medical Association  The article they published they got 36 apps mental health if they search for them with two keywords  smoking cessation and depression they got 36  Mental health and smoking cessation apps of the 36 33  Sent information from those apps to other third parties

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How did they I couldn't figure out from the story that they could do that or they didn't warn they wouldn't do that  How do how did they know that they did do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You put a you put something like wire shark on the actual network feed and you can see the outbound traffic  So so you it's a simple device, you know  Like a pineapple that you put on the Wi-Fi and you can well, but it's outbound to their server

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you know it's then outbound in turn wasn't always to other parties? That's what that's part of the problem  Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm just again. I'm just I'm not trying to defend anybody here  I'm just trying to understand if if I'm using an app that tracks my progress clearly is remembering me and my progress  It is going to the server. It is not just staying on my phone  Yeah, it  Do they know how did the authors of the of the of the JAMA piece know that the company then  Sent that to other parties. Well, they wouldn't know you send it  So I'm saying hold on Jeff the story headline should be could do this  But they don't know that they did do this is what I couldn't find out from the story

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can you can so if you run if you run something like wire shark or anything that shows where your traffic goes  What happens is some bits go to like a Facebook server or whoever server and then some will go to like an ad traffic or a  Third-party server so you can see all of that. It's not just one giant stream of traffic. That's you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's no surprise  Listen I think there should be rules about anything that has this kind of personal information  I'm not arguing with that at all. But this but the journalism in the story  The headlines on some of them said did do this and others said could do this big difference and  So what the actual policy and actions of the company are?  In the fact that they didn't tell people that they have the data and warn them all all that. Yes fix that  I'm not arguing with any of that, but I'm questioning  I'm just trying to question the conclusions of the story and how they reported this  I'm not sure that I get how they could have

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you're right you cannot tell if the company if the data is sent to the first of all  It's probably the case that information about substance abuse  You know measurements like that. It's probably the case  They shouldn't be sent to the company at all  If especially if the privacy policy doesn't say it's going to be you can see if it's sent to a third party directly  Which apparently in some cases it was but you can't tell if that's a party was an ad server

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's what that's just the way the web on maybe it's an ad server

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But why would they send the ad server what I ate yesterday? Right there like what data is getting sent there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, we just need to know more about this and I agree with the basic  Premise of this is that when it comes to especially matters of health and mental well  The other problem is there should be standards here

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They found several cases where the apps lied about their privacy policy other cases where they were that's all bad  Yeah, and this is in JAMA because the American Medical Association because it's aimed at

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Care providers physicians. They don't know this. Oh you guys this happened to me  So I actually had a conversation with my daughter's pediatrician. So I went to their office and they were using a service. Oh  Gosh, what was it called?  I'll have to look it up, but they were using a service and when I to to check in basically and at first  I was excited because I was I always hate filling out the paperwork and every year you have to fill out the same paperwork  And you're like god if this were online you just have this data and I change it if it changed  But it was the service and as I was clicking through the the end and the HIPAA compliance and all this  I came to a page that told me that my data on this particular form  Which did ask for like my daughter's like is she experiencing neurological things or these kind of things?  That it would be shared with both the company providing the service and its third-party  advertisers and  No, because it's not actually her medical information apparently it's just me filling out symptoms for my doctor  So it's not my doctor's data. It's me saying to my doctor. What's wrong with her while we're while why we were there  So I talked to my doctor about this because I was I refused to sign that part  but you know, I'd already filled in everything right and the  Physician was like the doctors admins were like you need to this is our check-in process now  This is the process and so when I showed it to her she's like, yeah, we'll just decline that and I'm like, oh  Boy, I bet nobody does that so I declined it. Yeah, nobody does  I mean kids were filling this out and they were having tablet. It was exciting  And then I think it was freesia  Maybe it was the name of the company and then I talked to the doctor and she's like I was like look  It's it's not cool that you force your patients to give up this data and she's using it  she's using it because she didn't realize that was the case and  she  Got it's a discount for her like it's cheaper and easier for G. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  why they gave her a discount right well, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean I like our I like our pediatric is a lovely person  She's not  Yeah, and this is  This is scary and it's frustrating and when you are a patient, for example, we were we there for I don't remember  We were there for something but you usually when you go to the doctor you're sick and you need or it's an appointment

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're a little bit  Vulnerable. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got like no appointments for the next six weeks, so it's not like you can say hey, I'm not gonna sign this I refuse this  They're gonna be like, well, we can't see you and then you're like, yeah, I'll just take my tumor and go home

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, you should be very suspicious anytime you're filling something out on a tablet not a piece of paper that immediately  Raises my suspicion. Well, it's freesia. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  P H R E E S I A  H R E E S I A

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When we do envoy they don't ask for any personal information, I'm just  They don't ask for symptoms, so let me  Point you Jeff to the actual article on the jamma network. Okay. Good. Thank you because I couldn't data transmission  To one or more third parties was identified for 33 of the 36 apps  Almost half  Well, you can always tell third party because it's a different third party could be could be well they talk about this  They say Google advertising services Facebook Google and they talk about where it went  Almost half the apps transmitted data to a third party but lacked a privacy policy  Nine apps failed to disclose his transmission and policy text five apps or explicitly  This is the worst stated the transmission would not occur three apps  81% transmitted data to analytics and advertising or marketing services operated by Google and Facebook  What here's the next question?  Leo what data but the fact that this user is on this app and you can send them an ad the ads there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's obvious. That's how that's how it works. Well, but if if if if I'm but if matter any information about my depression  No matter as greatly as to what the data is  Presence on the app and there's an ad there. Yeah, it's gonna be sent to an ad server the  It's gonna be sent to an ad server duh  It's a question is didn't send other data and use it another way that matters. That's all I'm saying  No, baby, they've done bad things, but I want to know the details

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you were getting if you are on a site or on an app that's for depression suffers, for example  And that data the fact that you're on that app is damning in and of itself  you know even  The information there is damning so  Just the fact yeah  It's like when someone sees you walk into an abortion clinic  If you're on an ad supported site for depression

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an app  The ad has to come to work with a good party

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's an app and the challenge here is doctors are not being given this information  About how these things are sharing data and so they will tell their patients  Hey use this app to help manage your depression and a patient thinking the doctor knows  Okay, and then their depression has been outed to Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely agree wait wait wait wait wait, I absolutely agree for the need for standards here  I agree that stuff could be bad. What I'm questioning is very narrow here is the specific reporting in JAMA  What I'm about to get the answer? I'm gonna answer. That's what I'm asking

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the conclusion of it is users should be aware their use of  Ostensibly standalone mental health apps and the health status this implies may be linked to other data for other purposes  Such as marketing targeting mental illness  critically this may take place even if an app provides no visible clues like a Facebook login and  Even for users who do not have a Facebook account  This study was not designed to answer your question to identify  Was not designed to identify whether linkable information was actually being used by advertisers for example to subsequently drive tailored advertising  Future work could consider looking for direct evidence of likable information being used in this way by looking for changes in advertisement content

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Suggests that's critical and all the headlines that then came out of this story  Jumped right to I'm gonna say it. I'm gonna say it the moral panic line of saying oh my god  All these places are telling the whole world that you're nuts

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think I think the it is a completely appropriate warning  To health providers and people who might want to use these apps. I agree with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but the but the journalism here, especially in those that we wrote it is shoddy. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  would say  No, you do headline everyone does this headlines are designed to get people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To read the store that's a scare headline that is a scare  Selling your data. Well, if it has an ad on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is that's a scare headline, it's a scare headline. It's a scary word, but you know what

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a good that mental health app might share your data without telling you that's a good headline. That's the verge. I think yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm fine with that  The time very narrow point here, but this is how these things get stretched  And this is how we end up with the UK online harms report wanting to ban speech. That's what scares me  Should there be standards here? Absolutely our place is doing some things wrong. Absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The other conclusion is  That these privacy policies lie and are not being there's no enforcement going on to make sure that they are accurate and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's that FTC fine that just happened against Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it's some of its being enforced but but clearly on these apps  I mean nobody has ain't nobody got time to read all those privacy policies and see if they're accurate  You think the FTC is doing studies like this. I don't think so. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think I think that the JAMA is quite right to look at this and to  Lobby to have standards in anything matter around health

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think this Washington Post headline is that inaccurate smoking and depression apps  Depression apps are selling your data to Google and Facebook study finds

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there's two problems the headline number one, they're not necessarily  Selling the data per se  They are putting in that  Avail in there every damn site on the entire an app the internet works number two  I  Said to let me get to number two number two is the implication of that is they are selling data about your depression and your smoking  To that and they do not have the data to back that up. It's a matter of journalism  It's all I'm saying now you can get that up date

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're saying this person's on a depression site. Are you saying specifically just because I'm on a depression site?  I might not be depressed and that's the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The stories were written in turn was that they're sharing your progress against this they're sharing details

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Where you are and JAMA admits that that would be a fertile ground for the next study  Which is to see if it changes the ads you get  What do you think what do you think what do you think the answer will be Jeff do you think I'll change the  What do you think the answer would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember my story about how could you say with some certainty?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You say with any certainty no, it's not gonna affect the ads that you went to a depression site

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not gonna affect your ads. Here's the oak and now can I answer?  You also could jump to a conclusion there remember I talked to a journalist who talked on Facebook about falling down a lot  And he got an ad for multiple sclerosis and thus found out that's how he found out he had a mess  Right. And so the fact that someone is targeting a word doesn't mean that Facebook said hey, we got one here and that's patient  Right didn't happen that way there are triggers and keywords that are bought and  That have implications. I agree with you guys have implications, but the simplest  Simplistic nature of that headline is misleading

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's bad well folks if you want to get diagnosed for depression  Make sure you download and use a depression app and that way your Facebook ads will offer you antidepressants

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here's here's the other problem. This is like a good benefit  Oh, that's a good problem is a lot of people are getting a lot of benefit out of a lot of these apps  No, I think that's and and no no, I'm Leo  I know people who are getting benefit out of these apps  Yeah, and so the if they are misused that makes it a triple sin. I'm agree  Yes, but don't don't go to the point of saying never use these apps. No, no, I'm not saying that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm saying we ought to make sure these apps deal honestly with their users. I we I've agreed a hundred times

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and Stacy you're not gonna blame me on your migraine  Nor on the fact that we just told the world that you get them and not my fault

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I already know that you told the world because I got all bunch of tweets from people saying hey  Sorry, you weren't on twig because of the mic rights. No, I think it's the head. It's kind of pushing a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We gotta get you a better headset

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I just think it's it's the yelling in the headset

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll be honest you pack your stuff or you pack your nice thing your microphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't have I mean I'm in like a two-bedroom apartment I'm working at a kitchen table right now so

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We should mention that that fine has not been applied yet, but this is so this comes from Facebook's  Quarterly results which came out today. The company has set aside  Three billion dollars related to the FTC's investigation. They're predicting it could be a fine ranging from three to five  Billion dollars and so they're putting they're putting the money in the savings account  They're putting in a sock so that when if the fine should come through but again  Facebook stock by the way went up 10% in after hours trading. So clearly everything else in the quarterly result was positive  There's good money in this depression

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they did say that portal your favorite device Leo is quote-unquote very valuable to the company  Really? They're making a lot of really really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You just said it was very valuable. Wow, that's interesting. I have two I'd be glad to sell anybody  I'd like to make them more valuable to me. Did you try to give one to your mother?  Not yet. Actually, Burke asked if he could take one apart. I said be my guest so Burke's gonna do something with one of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Brooks gonna do something with one. You'll get a story out of it one day. Hey run see what data

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Facebook is gathering from that. Oh, you know, we could put a Wireshark on it. That's an interesting  All right, let's do the change log and then we can go home. How about that?  This is why podcasts suck  Google change

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Carson I think that was hostile you should walk out

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We give Carson lots of props he is a great producer I couldn't be happier  We've had you know, we've had a string of great producers and I know you guys especially Jeff has loved our producers starting with Eileen  Remember and a Chad, right?

Transcript:  Can I ask you a question Leo? Yes, so if you don't have a  Tesla if you have  Yes  You can't use

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tesla charging no, no, no, the superchargers are only for Tesla's and Tesla's even have a different connector

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's kind of Tesla in turn can't use others

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tesla's come with adapters so that you can't yeah  Here's my question given all the stuff Elon has said about the new  Self-driving capabilities of the next generation Tesla's any Tesla you buy from now on we'll have that new chip and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want to talk about something scary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You are you gonna talk about the part where he says and  There's a setting where you if you don't mind a few fender benders you could turn it to aggressive mode that one that  And how he doesn't trust light? That's my driving style. Yeah, he doesn't like lidar. Would you turn on the aggressive mode?  He says you can do it all with cameras radar as we do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he said that forever though. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He sells he's a good salesman. He sells the capability  So I'm in the cusp of deciding should I get another Tesla or should I get another?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ask you what you're thinking was okay. Last time you said no done. Yeah now I'm thinking maybe Elon is a good salesman

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe I should well so this gets to would you lease it or would you buy it?  Cuz I don't feel like yeah, you should not buy any new tech new car  Yeah, I feel like you should always lease cars as long as for well we and we lease it through twit

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so as long as it's as I have a company I will I will do my car executive vehicle through the company so  I'm interested in the Audi electric. I  Drove the the Jaguar I pace. I wasn't that crazy about it  I'm I don't know the model three pretty cool. He also says next generation model three won't have a steering wheel. I  Do not want a car that does not have a steering wheel. No, no, no, I'm not ready for that  Continuing with the Google  Change long wing which is Google's drone delivery service is the first to get FAA  approval  pretty exciting  Wing now has the same certifications that smaller airlines get from the FAA  It plans to begin routine deliveries of small consumer items in two rural communities in Virginia  Where there are apparently no sidewalks within months?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we are the only journalism school in New York that teaches drone reporting  Oh, wow, my colleague Travis Fox  I saw him going out the other day with this huge case  He has and the students going over that they do this and I didn't realize this he has on a g-lay Joel  The yellow jacket. Yeah, it's required by law  I know the back has to say FAA licensed drone operator so you can say who is that bozo doing that Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I  Do know that you're not supposed to fly over people and  and that's why wing has has to operate in a rural area of Virginia because  You know, you can't operate over crowds

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which makes it might make more sense anyway, because your density your population density is right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Makes it harder to deliver FAA required wing to create extensive manuals training routines and a safety hierarchy just like any air carrier  So it's interesting, but I don't think it's gonna bring drone deliveries to a home near you yet  Damn  Do you do you wish to step into childish Gambino's world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There is a childish Gambino  Avatar in playground, but this is even more you can go through an AR portal to explore an augmented cave  Where you can find and interact with hidden glyphs  While still being able to see out into the real world which is helpful and not getting run over  it's a AR app called pharaohs AR and  I will get it and I will report back  Pharo s  AR I'm much more excited about playing the Harry Potter wizards unite game in augmented reality where you can actually  Catch a wizard in the studio

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's still nothing happening in it though

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Carson down side loaded it because it's available in New Zealand  Next will be Australia. That means you're getting close. I would think  Google is testing a distraction free reader mode in chrome canary. That means it may be coming  To chrome soon. Nobody likes to be bombarded with ads says Google and  General clutter when reading articles on the web. So reader mode  For years, we thought that Google and advertising company would never sign off on such a feature  Who's writing this thankfully  It looks like we underestimate. Oh, I see. This is the reader mode version of Scott Scriven's  article from Android police  Nice. I  You you select distill page from the menu  You can't apparently turn it on on  Other versions of the browser you so you have to hashtag enable-reader-mode. That's the flag  So go into chrome flags and look for reader mode  Enable it Safari has this it's a really nice feature. I like it Apple does it on its browsers  it's surprising though to think chrome might have it and  finally  It's easier to find work from home jobs in Google search  This is I didn't know there were job search features in Google search

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can find jobs there and what's interesting is that this uses a schema org  Is something in my world of news that people are using a lot to try to put date and metadata on and and Google's using schema  That order stuff a lot. So job sites that in their schema org structure  Label work from home jobs now in search you can run really neat

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go annotation

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, yeah, this is a non visible annotations to web pages  Right hidden in the schema and if you do the Google search say you search for customer service jobs click location  There will be a bunch of tags. You can choose including work from home. I  like it and that's  And now I do the thing that I do every week which is to ask you Jeff Jarvis professor of journalism  And Stacey Higginbotham  Stay at home mom. No iot expert and  just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I mean, I do stay at home, but you write time all the time  Do work I am a mom. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was just teasing you but anyway, this is the time when I ask you if I've missed any stories that you would love  Oh that oh then I missed a ton of stories. However, there's a lot. I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a lot but I don't want to do any of them tick-tock band in India now back in India. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Love tick-tock  Tick-tocks cool. You're I bet your daughter uses it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She doesn't but it's because she doesn't have a lot of friends on it and she's actually very concerned about  appearing on cameras. Oh good for her  But good for her. It's she we watch it a lot the issue in India was pornography

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you see a lot of porno on tick-tock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My daughter and I do not know but we're mostly you follow it's another case of it's who you follow, right? I  guess I'm like I  Didn't even know she drives that well, of course. There's there's porn everywhere. It's you can't get away from it. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  men men men  Anything I missed that you wanted to talk about Jeffrey

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm not fine anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, so let's get from Stacy what wait the bottom how about you Karsten the very last story  They oh, yes, actually Stacy was all excited about this. Oh, yeah, they asked artificial intelligence to create a game  Listen to the games it created first and then the game it finally did first it created a game in which an exploding  frisbee  Relay race racers run in a track while discs that explode on impact are thrown at them  I actually think that sounds like a great game  But maybe not for the runners. How about this a hot air balloon based sport?  Where players balance on a line tethered between aircraft and pass balls back and forth again?  Loads of fun to watch maybe not so much fun to play  How about pommel horse sawing two people sit on pommel horses on opposite sides of a giant log and rock back and forth with  this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've seen that at the lumberjack games. That is a game. I read this also goes to there. There's what is it in Sweden?  I saw this  girls on hobby horses. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The New York Times did the hobby horse thing, but that's not a game. That's just something I know but you have just seen the conversions

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here. Yeah  Well, you have to it's all depends on what annual hobby horse championship that probably the AI was

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  saw  Yeah at a saw make it fun  Apparently a lot of the the AIs at least didn't think it's peril is fun. Maybe they're getting that from what they ingest  I don't know an underwater relay race

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at football. Yeah, that damages people baseball has really fast flying objects that if they hit you it hurts

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the one they  Implemented actually does sound cool a form of rugby with obstacles that require  gymnastic style maneuvers  to avoid here it is  And it's kind of like parkour meets rugby and  You said that you thought this looked like women. There's a drone. Oh, no, that's yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This this doesn't require the job gymnastic. Oh, this is a different one. This is speed  Speed gate is the one they came up with that was actually viable and people could actually play looks like quidditch to be honest  Yeah, it's it's not super quit itchy  You have to get your stuff in the center gate before you can unlock points at the other gate  So you your first move is that and then there's rules about?  Yeah, it's it's kind of a neat very good guard the gate and guard the goal  Yeah, right and then you can't go into the gate. I don't know. There's a ball there's running

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would be very bad at it. Whatever it is. I would be bad at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So their goal is to get to the point where you'll hear somebody say, oh, yeah speed gate Mike my kids play that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it could happen. I mean it looks like a fun game

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oregon Sports Authority has recognized speed gate is the officials as an official sport in the state of Oregon

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go. I mean if we can play ultimate frisbee, we can certainly play speed gate. I'm excited

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so  this was a  An effort of whom I don't I'm trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, or is it Nvidia marketing it I couldn't tell

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah  It's a design firm  AK QA I  Bet they were engaged by in video or something like something along the lines video. There's a lot of artificial  Intelligence and machine learning stuff. They make the chips  That do it so that's cool  Stacey do you have a thing this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have two because I forgot that you guys probably would like this one more  So I'll tell you about this one. This is IOT inspector, which did you guys talk about this while I was gone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I made it my pick of the week on Mac break weekly last week  I think this is and I and I'm really glad that you you talked about this  it's not available for anything, but max yet, but they're gonna do a  They'll do something eventually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, so I actually had one of the co-creators of it on the show  Some things to know about it. Just what it does is well if it's already pick I've got another pick

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have a backup tell I want to know because you know more about it than I did. I installed it on my Mac. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, good. So yeah, this is this is a device  So you install it if you have a MacBook you can install it and it runs in the background and what is it? It's doing  Traffic spoofing so it sends everything that you're all the packets that your devices are sending. It's actually  Running those through your computer so IOT can inspect it and then  So the first thing you learn is all the devices you have phoning home

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know all the devices on your network the second thing you learn is are they encrypting this information and many of them are not by the way  in my house anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's three options weak encryption  no encryption and  Insecure yeah, so we talk about the differences there  It's not designed to run all the time and you'll also see where your traffic is going just like with Wireshark or something like that  So it's pretty handy like I noticed that like my nest for example has  I can't remember if it was weaker insecure. Yes mine does too. Yeah, I was surprised. That's a camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't want that to have weak encryption

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and he explains what the weak encryption is so something with weak encryption  So something with weak encryption is running an earlier version of TLS, right?  The insecure encryption is a little bit different. Oh  Wait, yes  Insecure is more like unknown because what it's using is using weak cipher suites for it and it's basically allowing  To it to connect with servers that use weak cipher. So it doesn't necessarily mean that it is it's just it's available

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not surprised. That's a big issue on the net in general

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So so that's what that is and  Yeah, download it see what you have they're using this for research purposes  So you have to choose all of your devices you want to monitor monitor you have to opt in so think about that as a very  progressive  Policy about data sharing you are sharing your data with them. So if you have sensitive data, you may not want to share it with them and  You can delete it actually so you could run all this even your sensitive data and delete it and they'll just be like smell you later

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a Mac only for now, but they are working on Windows and Linux versions  I think this is really cool and you have to sign a fairly extensive consent form because the information is being sent to Princeton  But I think they're I'm glad to know you talked to them. So they're trustworthy. Yeah, it's like an IRB kind of thing for your data

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was kind of fun. Yeah, like, you know just for this research data. So that's IOT inspector. There's a link  It's a little wonky to set up you don't want to run it all the time because it will wreak havoc on your network  So, you know unless you're just up for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So here's the screen from their video just so you can see what your what kind of thing you're gonna get  You get all all the devices  You get a lot about how the devices are working. It's a it's a pretty cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was really and they want you to label your stuff  So like I know some of the stuff was mislabeled  But you'll help them be able to identify different types of devices different traffic patterns

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and then you can actually look at the network activity coming out of the device, which is pretty interesting  What's your other pick

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, this was before I remembered that I had an actual tech pick because  but this is a really good book if you have kids in your life who like  Who are geeks who like comic cons fanfiction that sort of thing. This is a  recently issued book by a 12 year old daughter loves it and  I don't really know what else to say about it other than it seems like a fun book  She really enjoyed it. It appeared in her Easter basket

Transcript:  It's called the princess and the fangirl a geek arela fairy tale  Once I can't believe I forgot to say the name of the book by Ashley. That's my job. Don't worry Ashley Poston is the author

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, so it's it's it's really good if you have a teenage girl maybe a boy I don't know but I'm always on the lookout for things that  That are fun and not you know that they're good for that age group that have

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a sequel to geek arela

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  Let's go with this one  Google has saved over six million pounds of food waste in its cafes  Wow in the last in years five years and you know, naturally a data driven company  They're trying to find all ways to to to brag just like this. They're being smart  So among the things they do of course is repurpose things which any you know, we see this happen  We used to go to a resort in the Poconos. We'd see you know tonight's dinner. We guess what is gonna be tomorrow at lunch  So they'll leftover risotto becomes our and Cheney was that he said  Yeah, they're so good, yeah  You know bananas go into banana bread, obviously  They also try to reduce waste earlier up the stream so I didn't know this  coffee cherries  The fruit around the coffee bean is normally wasted but they're making a flower out of that and experimenting with it in brownies tortillas  And other foods Wow  They avoid preparing too much food ahead of time  Near the end of the lunch. They might change to shallower pans at the salad bar to give an impression of abundance  It's all about fooling people  Obviously, we know that they went to smaller plates to get people to eat less some time ago than fool me. Mmm  take two of them  but smaller portions and so  189 of Google Google's cafes and 26 countries they use lean path systems to figure this out nice  There's one other number which I just amused me but the Boston Herald won't let me get to the story now because they were looked  at it once  but a  Guy in Boston is Winklevih cubed guy in Boston  Tried to get some money from the Winklevoss twins that they got from Zuckerberg and the court just said no.

Yeah for some reason a couple of guys Dylan Cassidy and Kelly Craft have redubbed  The Don Bluth movie the land before time with Scottish voices  It's not your mom's fault  And I don't know why but it just tickles me but his fault  I'm sure it will be taken down  Pronto  So go get it while you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I miss her so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm hoping that this will spawn a slew of Scottish remakes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What movies would you like to see done in Scottish
