Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not a karaoke face right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but that's exactly why I want to see it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stray and  I'm just imagining you in the bar right now with that posture singing Journey or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stop it's believing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even that's fine. Even that would your hand you're quite right the thing  I hate most about any gathering anywhere is the icebreaker  Hate icebreakers. I despise. I don't do ice breaking. I stay icy  I respect that I am ice don't break  I do not fall

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have to hear it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's yeah, let's talk about stock splits Google for one  Has has a plan to split some stock because I guess it was you know, too expensive and now they're like we want more people  To get on on this and it was by the way a really good earnings  report  Over the breaking 200 billion dollars of annual revenue for the first time  pretty big deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you just imagine 200 billion dollars in breath. I mean, that's not even real money. No, it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I you know, I can't imagine it  It actually it kind of makes my brain hurt in the same way as when I think about the vastness of space  Like I start to break down when I think of money in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it came in cash how long would it in hundred dollar bills how long would it take to count that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What percentage of that is from the ad revenue

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's lower now, yeah  Used to be 98 percent. I mean was it was they were so dependent upon it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me see if it's in there. There was it there's a point to me asking that I meant to grab it before the show  There's a point to everything you say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know the true answer to that question  But I mean I have to imagine it's it is still absolutely the majority and blows everything out of the water

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know it also separates. I think it's interesting to look at the ad  Infrastructure versus Google ad versus YouTube ad. Yeah is also interesting to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More than 80 percent of the company's revenue and it grew 41 percent in 2021, which is a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Insane oh  Man, you know, I'm pretty well percent. Oh, you're over a year  to  257 billion dollars  So what's interesting about the stock splits?  Yeah, yeah tell me tell me a little bit about stock split because I'm not I'm not  incredibly familiar with  With the why I mean, I guess I understand the why when a stock gets too valuable splitting  It allows more people to get in but if you own the stock and it gets split you're like you're you're part you're celebrating  Right because that doesn't matter little go up, but not always it doesn't it doesn't always have that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a 24 for one split. So a share valued at 2753  Goes into 20 shares values at 138 dollars. What interests me though is this  That gets below the threshold of going on the Dow Jones  So what that says is Google becomes a  Economy-driving grown-up company. Oh  Finally they grew up  Exactly. They finally finally could shave. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unlike us. Well, that's that's if you still think the Dow Jones industrial average is  Like a good proxy for the economy and I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a media thing. I agree. But but it's like I don't think most investors are like, oh, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know Google who cares? It's not on the Dow Jones. But yeah, yeah, like us think it's a I  Don't know. It's it's like the actual graduation ceremony. You're like, yay, but really, you know, of course you're graduating  That's a really bad. What did you learn? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've been getting a's your entire life. Of course you're graduating Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The journal says that Apple and Tesla splits helped extend rallies in their shares

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It did yeah  usually a split is a great news for everybody because you only split when you think that your stock is way too expensive and there's  Demand for it. So then you split  everybody gets excited and  more people buy it and brings it down to like reasonable levels and  You see this all the time, you know only I  Can't think of a poorly performing company that has done a stock split, right? It's just it's a sign that things are going well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alphabet stock right now at  $2,960 a share so  Not bad. So that so then would that be factored essentially like that number divided by 20?  And you've got your new share price. Is that how that would have seven percent today because of these results last night

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, that was a huge jump, you know, cuz some people I mean you really want to buy a share in a company, right?  so yeah for sure gives you if  You're that type of person now you can buy a share instead of a quarter of a share  Yes, or any can give it to your like, you know, like your grandparents give you like five shares of a stock that they feel is  Me. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was given I was given one share of Reebok when I was a kid  And it was wow a single share of Reebok

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know. I mean that's that's a way that you teach her. I mean we did it with our kid  It's a way you teach your kids about owning stocks. You're like have them pick that you just are like hey pick out a stock that you  You know, and then they get to follow it you teach them about you get to track it  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember tracking that stock tracking Reebok in a ledger every day  Opening up the newspaper and tracking it until I got really bored of doing that and then I just forgot about it, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Today's kids get a beta crypto. Yeah. Yes exactly. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kid

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, hard is always watching Bitcoin because the likes of PayPal and  What's the cash app made it easy for people to buy into a share of Bitcoin?  So they're always sort of just looking well my oldest is anyway  Just sort of looking at it and seeing if he's gonna get any kind of money out of it  Like dude, you don't have 30 grand so just just sit it and leave it, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, do your kids own NFTs and no sir

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure they would ask me about it. They asked me about a lot of different things  If they're not quite sure when it comes to trendy stuff in tech  They'd ask me or they go look up something Michael Sargent said on one of his shows is what it falls down to  But no, they haven't gotten into NFTs yet  They knew that I started doing them and just sort of okay. Good luck and went on about the business

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean it is interesting from from the perspective of you know  Kids who are growing up now like like your kids old enough to be aware  Aware that there is a thing called cryptocurrency and that there's something going on there and that maybe you can make a lot of money  Maybe you don't or whatever but that awareness like they're young enough to evolve and grow with right technology  And it seems like they tend to have more than you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They tend to have more of a grasp on it than most adults our age. Yes, what I think is fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if they have a actual grasp or they just understand the social shenanigans  So like my daughter for example, she has her school has a computer  She's an IB school  So they have an IB computer science program and those kids actually built their own NFTs and sold them as part of like learning about them  She I was like that sounds really fun, you know like way to way to get a sense of  Understanding this and she's like, yeah. Oh my god mom. It was so stupid cuz all the crypto bros  Do I even want to be lumped in with that? I'm like, oh wow  Biggest I roll for those guys those crypto bros

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got the theater kids you got the brain yaks and you got the crypto bros

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not our friends it's it's not the high school clique  It's just everybody on the internet who talks she's just like they're just she's like, it's just a pump and dump  Which I'm like, how do you know what? Wow, she knows a pump and dump all the terminology. It's out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  He's heading to go  Exactly what I mean, I mean they but they might not have a deep a deep-seated  Understanding of exactly what's going on man as hard as I do  I have I can barely understand so much about you know crypto and web 3 and all that all that craziness  But but if they're starting at a point where this is  It's not even at the point of maturity  It's it's really still at the point of like proving it's that it is a thing and what is that thing and defining itself?  But they're young enough to kind of grow and evolve with the development of it  And I mean a part of me has to believe that  I don't know I I guess I just don't feel like something like cryptocurrency is automatically like that's totally shady  It doesn't have any legs. It's not going anywhere  Like there's enough there seems to be enough energy with it including this example that you know  Maybe it maybe it leads to somewhere and maybe they they will ultimately end up understanding a way better than than us  So Peter Kafka did a really good piece of the book  I think it's a really good piece of the book  Which he tried to figure kind of figure out I don't understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Crypto and I tried to get into it and and and went through and tried to do things in it  So it was it was a good piece, but what really strikes me is that there's a couple things one is that  It's still a solution looking for a problem  Two is the people who represent it are generally obnoxious  And then three it can be very difficult to define  Yeah  And then three it gives cooties to a technology that could be useful  If people turned it around the other way and started with the need and said oh that could solve this problem  But instead is people saying this is so hot. You're not going to believe it  And if you don't you're stupid that doesn't help the cause very much  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like a gold rush. There are actual use cases

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah for distributed ledgers and blockchains  There's I mean  If I look at  Cryptocurrencies as an incentivation incentivization. I don't know that was a way to incentivize people to  Like participate in like a network, so i'll go with helium because it's the most obvious of those  But there are several others that are coming around maybe that aren't as hyped as helium  and  I I think they might be a good incentive for like a distributed network. So I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I I think stacy I think so I wrote a piece years ago now 2015  Talking about what I called credit rate as an alternative to copyright where you want to have a way to record and reward  Contributions to a chain of creativity. I did that not knowing about bitcoin not knowing about about crypto or blockchain  But in fact what I want to do could be done on the blockchain  Or another example i tweeted about today is is that what I buy I buy mine tons of used books lately because of research  And I wish that the author could get you know 10 cents of it  Yeah, well you could set up a contract such that if the book gets resold  Something can happen. Of course a physical object. That's not so easy. I know I know I know but you can imagine those kinds of models  Where you say that there's an ongoing reward to someone and it's okay to pass it along  And and and profit from it because you do have first sale rights and you do own it  But but you can also set it up so that it benefits others along the way along the chain of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of ownership those kinds of things then it would create a used market for digital books, which would actually be lovely  Yes, bingo

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you had the rights to get them out of the  Yeah, you don't sit in prison then but yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, by the way, we got folks in chat  Yeah, um folks in chat we're we're correcting us it's no longer nft by the way, it's neft apparently apparently that's how  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Glad they brought this up because I have real strong feelings about this and I saw this article and I was like  One who is this like somebody who's just trolling us all with like a gift  Yeah, kind of felt like that like hot dogs being a sandwich because that's what it feels like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I say it's not neft, it's nift. It's nift. I did not be obnoxious. I'm gonna insist on nift

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just an nft y'all really we gotta say neft  I mean who out there show of hands is gonna call it a nift. The bigger question is did y'all funge today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Say funge yes, but I able like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That just sounds wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, what is the rationale for it being called a nift? I'm sorry. I have to go back

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a really great question and and know something you don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, come on the verge wrote a whole article about it. It's got to be something  What is it? Let's go find it to be quite honest. I did not I did not read the article

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw the headline and I was like, yeah now I don't even know that's what I did too, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they've got a really good reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you see stacy's always so nice. She always thinks that there's got to be some people have to do things for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, i'm just a journalist I want to understand I know  All right, i'm i'm reading the article  It's just taking forever to load

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's almost it's almost like  In I mean in my very very, you know brief scanning of this. It's almost as if  Oh, no, this is just the verge  Yeah  The folks who wrote it had some sort of like a a chat  Like a slack chat or something like that where they went off on this and then ultimately ended up writing an article  like one of the points here is that  nft is already filled when you phonetically spell it out with tons of e's therefore why not just have it be neft  as an eft right as  That's sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those articles are pure gold we used to do them all the time at kick-off our slack  Activates over silly things and everyone clicks on them and gets in the comments and we all talk about it on twitter  It's kind of what the internet's for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that's true. That's very true  um the other the the other part of the results were um had to do at least that a lot of people were you know, kind of  Writing about had to do with a comment that sundar pichai ceo of the company made  about the company's hardware  A division said in q4 we set an all-time quarterly sales record for pixel  this came in spite of an extremely challenging supply chain environment, so  Internally like we don't actually know if the pixel 6 is their best-selling pixel device yet  You know, we've still got the rest of the year of sales for it to get there  but  uh google sounds pretty uh pretty happy with the performance that it has  Received and i'm kind of not surprised either if if the performance was was good google was very  Very vocal in the beginning about its plan to market the heck out of this device  Prior to it even being officially announced. There was a lot of energy and excitement about it  It's a very different looking piece of hardware. So it's really easily  Identifiable when you go into a carrier store a number of reasons why it would do better than their other pixels, but  Doesn't hold a candle to you know, any of the other major hardware players  Let's let's be honest google is not the next samsung here with uh with their pictures and it's too heavy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's too premium miss stacey is premium not heavy. Yes, it's too heavy for my delicate floppy wrists

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which has damaged me forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you got rid of it, right? How is your wrist by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, I did get rid of it and my arm is getting better but it's still not great  Um still hasn't recovered from the pixel six. Wow. It wasn't the pixel six. I got some shots in attendance last week

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's go. It's that it did not like the pixel six did not help my arm beforehand for the reason I needed the shots  so sue them  No, no, I just instead I bought a pixel five and i'm so sad I do not like that phone at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't oh, i'm sorry. Maybe it's a five. Is it a 5a? No, it's a five

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a 5a. No, I got the five I had to buy it used

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and what don't you like about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exciting I still have the camo case on it  I don't like that. It doesn't have a phone jack. I just  It's just a boring not very exciting. It's like a meh phone. It just feels like oh  I upgraded but I didn't really upgrade

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, it's it's kind of like the six felt like an upgrade until the next

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The six felt like an upgrade but it was an upgrade. I literally could not hold for very long  so I couldn't I literally could not use it so it was  I'm like, you know  It's kind of how I feel like when you go buy a car and all they've got is SUVs and you're like, but I just want a car

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish I've gotten the six not a six mondo. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well I wonder about that too, I mean I do really  Love having a telephoto  So that's kind of the primary reason that like I want the six pro because I have a lot of moments where I want  To use a telephoto and I don't want a digital zoom  If it wasn't for that, I probably would would be absolutely fine with the six  I think the six it was probably the better value all around  Yeah between the two  But and then and then there's the ants of the world who it you know, all this kind of doesn't matter  It's just kind of a a craptastic device. It sounds like you've you've been no no no no no no  The device is he hates android 12. Oh, it's the ois. That's right. That's right. The device is okay  But okay, but at what point do you find any sort of confusion separating the device from the os?  Because I I don't know through my experience. They're so intrinsically  Kind of connected to a certain degree, you know the pixel I just think back to my previous

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The previous phones that I've worked worked with or what have you and  The os got out of the way  You know the phones were not necessarily rated to be the best of the best kind of thing  But it didn't matter because the operating system allowed me to do whatever it was I needed to do  Where here with android 12, you know up until this last update  It was a buggy mess. Everything was just a flat out mess any type of  Navigation the freezing and crashing and  It wasn't good. It's it's better now, but it's still not quite perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  Yep, I don't think you're alone as far as as far as but i'm glad they're selling because they'll make more of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, and I mean there's you know  There's uh been some leaks and some kind of details getting out there about the next a series the pixel 6a  Sometime in may it's gonna have you know, it's gonna be a different a series phone  Um my understanding it's gonna kind of follow the design aesthetic of the six which makes sense, right?  They'd want to keep that  That um, so it'll be heavy family  Well, that's a good question  Actually because like like are the materials going to be glass or is it going to be plastic, you know, or right?  Which is what they've done on the a series prior is kind of go for a more plastic design instead of the glass and that  Might reduce some weight. Is it going to be smaller? Like I don't really know the answer  We you know, we don't have the answer all of this stuff here is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good and interesting or whatever, but I just wish google would prioritize just core functionality of that operating system  There's been a lot of talk about this update like this. We're just going to do this and this  Service will do that this ai service will do that for you on the cloud and yada yada yada  but yet just swiping through is a pain in the butt because it  Hangs so often or crashes so often  Fix the core functionality before you get into all your bells and whistles

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what is it? Mine doesn't crash. What is it? You tend to is it photographic stuff that makes it crash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this was before the update but just you know swiping from the tray back up to your main screen or even going to the  The what's that feed all the way to the left the news feed thingy swiping over the scanner or whatever it is  Yeah, and even launching stories out of that would crash it  You know, I have never you're trying to get me to read this stuff and you won't let me read it because it's just  Constantly crashing. Um, but it's but that's way better now now i'm just seeing  I still see some bluetooth toggles off  Here and there but nowhere near as much as I used to so i'm not even going to sweat that right now because that may be me  doing it

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Transcript:  Yeah, and what's so frustrating too is when you're talking about a device like, you know, like the pixel six is  Not everybody has the same experience, right?  Even when you're talking about software and hardware inconsistencies or frustrations that one person has  Has it you know  When I have when I experience something it feels like this should be something that everybody that also has this phone has also  Experienced but that isn't ever the case right? Like there's a number of people that never experienced that  And so he's like so then you're left, you know questioning what you just said like no  Maybe it's just me and how i'm using my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You gotta you gotta try so let's see are we gonna talk about more google stuff or facebook or meta earnings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We could yeah, I mean I I think we go from earnings to earnings and we get uh,  Get these earnings out of the way the facebook, uh earnings just posted  I haven't had a chance to read through these because literally it happened right as we were going to showtime has anyone  Pulled I went through pretty quickly, but it wasn't it wasn't dreadful, but it was but it was warning

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  saying that um  Things aren't going to be so quite so rosy in the future and that's what they buy is the future and so  But it took it took a real nosedive 20 drop in stock one fifth of the value of the stock  I'm sure it's a dead cat balance that'll come back up. But still  A lot of stocks all the tech stocks are testing new bottoms, you know  It's been happening the last week and a half or so and so facebook hadn't hadn't finished finding the bottom

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you think this is because of potential regulation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold up. Hold up y'all. All right. Y'all are talking about  A financial report  Only from the perspective of the stock market as opposed to what they actually did  So I feel like we're like looking at the you're right  But it's really the shadow in playdoh's cave as opposed to the item so real fast show it off there  They they dropped  Because they didn't meet their analyst expectations  They only reported ten point three billion dollars in profit below a ten point nine billion dollar profit and the profits declined a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, the same thing to say about apple every single year  Where apple is in trouble because they didn't meet the analyst's expectations even though they made a gazillion hours killing it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well apple apple usually

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And found a way to to to uh, bring the expectations down that was apple's game for a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and the other thing is  You know facebook is like hey y'all we're gonna do this whole virtual reality metaverse thing. That's our new  That's our new jam, right? Right and wall street's like, all right  A month and a half later, let's see how that's going  And you know what it's going really poorly because the metaverse isn't real yet  They're just figuring and you know, they're doing their their reality labs unit that sells the hardware and stuff  they posted a three point three billion dollar loss and so  Wall street all of a sudden is like oh my god, you're betting the company on this  And freaked out but you know what?  They do that all the time like remember when they freaked out about facebook not having a mobile strategy  And to be fair facebook felt a little late on that  Um here they feel a little early but facebook was like well, we'll see. Oh, we're the great evil empire. We'll do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook had also, you know definitely put out  Kind of the warning signals ahead of their earnings to say, you know, we're  This is this is a different road that we're going obviously with the metaverse and everything. I think they said  Uh that you know, it's going to cause a 10 billion dollar hit in 2021 profit  And that the the division would not be profitable anytime in the near future  So really kind of setting the groundwork. Not only that I think the apple  the apple decision  That that happened not too long ago with you know  The privacy and apps and everything that kind of has a longer standing effect on facebook that you know  They say they're still kind of struggling with  But at the end of the day like like you pointed out the company's doing okay  It's just they said they were going to be here and one centimeter below that is where they actually were and so right  So the stock market loses their mind, you know  What does that mean? I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, I mean would I like to see facebook just crash and burn utterly yes, I would love it but you know  And also I would say  You know the market is probably rightly asking questions that facebook is doing a great job answering partly because they don't know about  You know antitrust and they're definitely in the crosshairs of the government  So that's a big uncertainty for all the tech companies going forward. Yeah, indeed indeed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was the first earnings report by meta by the way where they are actually breaking out their reality lab segment  Which is their their metaverse efforts division and that unit posted a 3.3 billion dollar loss  Just for for giggles there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would think that facebook would have been saying we've had such a good two weeks. Everybody's paying attention to spotify  Nobody's yeah, right  And then then they released this report. It's oh heck. Here we are again

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meta meta, yes indeed meta  Yeah, well  You've got a nice little entree into spotify. How about we do?  Uh, how about how about we take a break?  And then we come back and we talk a little bit about the developments there because last week  I think we were on like the the cusp of things happening with spotify and then this whole week  It's been spotify everywhere. Yeah, you know, it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just been on i would be so grateful when I no longer have to think about joe rogan again

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes  I agree wonder when that or or his people who when I went after rogan while they've been on me. Oh  They think they're so clever

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, i don't know i've seen those conversations. I don't know when you're not gonna have to  Yeah, yeah. Yeah  Let's uh, let's take a break and then we'll talk all about that.

Uh last week. We talked  I think we talked about neil young basically making the threat saying it's me or rogan  And uh ultimately they tuned and then we didn't know where it was going to turn out. Yes, and we didn't know where it's going to go  Uh, ultimately neil young's music is no longer on spotify as a result  And he's not alone. Joni mitchell, uh nile's here  Logger is logan logan from the east street band lofgren. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Of course it is. I just had a typo  Um, so others are kind of following  It really is  Apparently, I I live by typos today apologize. Um other people are following, uh, nile young's example  Um, I don't know how much  Impact it's making on spotify. I mean spotify really it really seems like they're kind of doubling down and saying hey  We've got this, you know this content uh policy we're gonna let you see it and everything  but uh, you know, we want diverse opinions and and yada yada on the on the spotify platform, so  I don't know. What do you what what are your thoughts on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I I have a question for jeff because this this to me feels  A little bit different like spotify, you know, there's the argument that it is a content platform  You know it can host whatever it wants  and I feel like there's a distinction between being a content platform and actually being more like a  a cable news  Station that's actually paying for a particular person or content. So jeff. Do you think?  They're within their rights to argue that they're free to be a neutral content platform  Or are they more akin to like afox news that hosts someone like tucker carlson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're within their rights as a private company to do whatever they want. Well, yes, that's sorry. That's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So are they being disingenuous in their arguments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I think I think so and and you know, I constantly argue that the internet is not a medium  That the platforms are not media. They are a place for people talk but spotify is different because they hire joe rogan  They pay him 100 million dollars. They own his rear end  And they are responsible for that. Now, what does what does responsible mean responsible to whom responsible for the market?  Responsible to who else wants to be associated with them or not what advertisers want to be associated with them or not?  um, I I listened to twit this weekend because I was curious to hear the talk about about that leo said that the  the um  The minimum in ad buy for rogan now and pardon me is a million dollars  well, you know somebody's gonna that that's not just oh, yeah, we got put on the show by  Uh some automated stuff. No, you could have spent a million dollars on joe rogan  Then customers are going to judge you you by your association so you're responsible to  Uh the marketplace as a whole the stock market  critics  other artists and advertisers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And and so right now they're consumers the people who pay for it  Yes, I feel like they're seeing defection from

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the a few small people in the audience and then a few

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Content producers that they want on their platform. Yeah, I don't think you're ever going to see I mean  And and it's not boycotting by the way to my mind  You know, I don't want to associate with joe rogan. So I I I deleted spotify from my phone  It's my perfect right to do their perfect right to have them. It's my choice in a marketplace  And and rogan I think only makes it worse. Of course his video. I thought was just pathetic where he didn't apologize to anyone  But spotify he basically said i'm sorry. You're going through this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the back end we'll be doing things like I mean look  I know like as a journalist sometimes I would get out ahead of my editorial people like when I  I may have actually called comcast evil  In fortune and you know fortune came back and they were like look stacy  I don't want to tell you like what to write  But i'm going to tell you that we're not going to call comcast evil in a headline  That's just not how we do it here  So it's possible that spotify's having those same conversations in the back end with joe rogan saying look you've gotten here this far

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, what happens if he actually has a a contrasting view?  um  Or somebody on the show that has a contrasting view from the things that he's been talking about and that seems to get out of airwaves  Uh, because I thought I heard him mention something along the lines of saying hey, I I want to have a conversation  I want to have a conversation from both sides of the aisle  What happens if if if you know with the masses if he's actually putting his money where his mouth is and doing stuff like that  But there's not a real both sides to some of these things

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But man, that's the problem. There's not there's there's science and then there's stupidity  And and and iver meckton is not another side is not and so what rogan said was well  I still want to have controversy he kept on calling he called everybody who says wrong unscientific dangerous things  He caused them calls them controversial and then he drags his heels and says well  I might have some other views on that is to say the experts  So he's trolling the world media has become whether whether it's making elon musk the person of the year on time  Or whether it's joe rogan this doesn't just happen obviously in in online  It happens now in all of media in in such a crowded marketplace  Trolling is now the business problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well in trolling is a little  Different I mean, let's think back in the days of howard stern or someone like andrew dice clay  both of those people got in a lot of trouble because they were  sexually they they were  I would say misogynistic but um women hated them. They they used terrible language and were pretty  pretty misogynistic and  That was controversial and yeah objectifying and all that good stuff so if you look at  That and that was the controversy at the time today's controversy  And that was a winning strategy for them and I think controversy today is still a winning strategy  it's just more people are  I guess you're moving from like objectifying women to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Public telling people with bad medical advice

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd look at this dude and i'm like, why does he have so much attention?  And I guess i'm just in a real real small minority because i've never listened to this cat show  I have no desire to listen to a show and the more I see stuff popping up on my twitter feed or whatever about him  Pissing off some group or whatever. The last thing I want to do is go and listen to one piss off another group  It's why is he getting so why does he earn so much attention from from us?  Spotify has a whole lot of other content that we can go and depend on  And then listen to and enjoy and not give this guy  It's so much credit and attention to where Spotify is probably going to give him even more money because he's just getting more eyeballs  On their platform. Who knows? That's how crazy this crap works nowadays

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, and there's a whole audience of people who  are excited by  That sort of thing like the boys will be boys argument maybe of the spigot errors now it's the so there's  there's definitely an audience and you know if you just  You we have always had  Media organizations that pan i'm so sorry  We have always had really  unethical  Media organization that pander to the lowest common denominator and we will always have that going forward  and that's  What this is?  It's just that the type of pandering you do now  In this particular era has like real world consequences that are killing people  You could actually argue that, you know people arguing for anti-semitism  Have also killed people and that's been a feature of papers forever. So  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's I don't know it's not we're also we're also incredibly sensitive right now to the topic of health right after the  Which which is not to say that this is not important any other time  But right now of all times in the past, let's say 10 years  Everybody has like this idea of of health and staying healthy and protecting ourselves from this  This nasty covet thing on the mind so when it comes to  any sort of topic or or conversation that that that does  Attempt to illuminate something that maybe goes against the mainstream  I think that you know people react much strong much more strongly to that on either side, right on one side  It's how dare you you bring that person on because you know, this is this is disproven and this is just this is a fault  This is false information that's going to make people  You know sick or possibly kill them and then on the other side it's well  But you know as rogan said right I bring guests on that are highly credentialed very intelligent very accomplished people  And they have an opinion that is different from the mainstream narrative  That's what the other side of that equation is saying is well  Do I want to live in an environment where everything that I watch doesn't challenge this?  This you know that the mainstream narrative as rogan puts it and that's all wrapped up around this thing  We've had the last two three years fearing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there's science at some level. No, no question. I have a right in is not a proper treatment for covet  And so to say well, but people have that opinion  Yes, people have anti-semitic opinions, too  So people have racist opinions too  So people have have sexist and misogynistic opinions too for sure  Doesn't mean that we need to give it and I think that that you know, I celebrate speech online  So I i'm i'm with these folks about that. I celebrate the fact that voices too long not heard in mass media are heard now  To my mind what we need to build is the next layer  which is a layer of recommendation and authentication and fact checking and and  Relevance finding and and finding the stuff that's worth listening to and that's what the media need to become now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what rogan actually  Advertises himself as he brings on people with ideas and lets them have in-depth conversation now  I may look at joe rogan and be like well that is not a guy  I would listen to based on his lack of science credentials, right?  whereas I might be like hey rachel meadow, you're my bud because  You really seem to understand and do the research on things  Yeah, i don't really do a lot of research i don't research i just have a conversation yeah, yeah, right  So some people I mean people will always find that interesting  But the reason that spotify is doing it is because he supposedly has 11 million

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listeners, I don't necessarily believe that number neither do leo on twit  But yeah, he has he has a he for this world. He has a big audience  But yeah, he has he has a he for this world he has a big audience right the new york times is celebrated right now  They just got 10 million subscribers because they bought the athletic joe rogan by that measure is bigger than the new york times  Which of course is ridiculous. I know it but but but that's we're still in a mass scale business  where  Substitution revenue or advertising revenue still goes to scale rather than to quality and and that's  always been the case places

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know I think it goes I feel like I am quality over scale and I have  Lovely revenue and I make money off of it and it's it's fine. So I think  I think the mass of that is what i'm saying  Well, I think the mass mindset you will always get if you if you want to get to the mass  You're gonna have to buckle up and accept the controversy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is probably there's no such thing as a mass that's what i'm saying what i'm saying stacey is that is that I mean  When I see we need more of you and less of that. I don't know. I think of mass as an insult  Mass says that people are the same  And and so it becomes this target of talking down to people who have no identity and who have no respect  As we can just draw them in there's an audience

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's an audience for people who want that and they're you know what?  I'm that audience after the end of a long day in certain areas not in generic  Newsy things because that's what I care about like that's my job but like  I will totally page through vogue or vanity fair and be like, haha  Okay, those are probably not as mass  But you get the point like I would I would want like wander through like  bustle or

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're but you're not going to weekly weekly world news  Joe rogan is the equivalent of weekly world news

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How is he the equivalent of weekly world news, that's what I don't understand  How does he even get to that? What the heck is wrong with our society? You know, it's not everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of people like weekly world news at most that's true percent of the society watching listen to joe rogan  It's a tiny portion of society and so but we act as if if it's big  We we extrapolate as if that's everybody it is not  No, box news is a tiny proportion of society  Yeah, the new york times is a small proportion of society  Right, but we act as if scale is all that is is is what matters in judging  Their impact and their importance  and it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've not listened to a show but I have watched I do recall watching a couple of his youtube snippets  because of the people he he had on there like  He usually have some power lifters and and people like that on there and and because he's got a fitness background  So I was I would tune into that because youtube's algorithm knows how aunt likes watching people lift weights and bodybuilders and  And those conversations were were fascinating and that was the end of it  That was the end of my relationship with joe rogan because that's that's all he earned  No, let no more than that period and I just don't see why this cat continues to get  So much attention especially from people that  I don't know that that I know can do better and have better taste, you know  Why are you giving this dude so much attention? Stop? It's not it's not worth it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But and is it some of this these days that there's there's a there's kind of a thorough going  Anti-institutional world and and being against doesn't matter what you're against you're against something  Is sufficient it's contrarianness, right?  And I got accused of that because I take opinions that that aren't leo's  Um, right and leo takes opinions that aren't mine, right? And so so that's part of the dynamic of what we do, too  But but to to dislike and want to dismantle the institution for its own sake to be seen that way  Is a lot of what's going on these days?  And a lot of institutions need to be challenged and and need to change and i'm not defending all the institutions  I just wrote a testimony to the senate arguing that the the news industry is an institution that needs to be challenged  um  But but it's this is for its own sake. It's it's the againstness  For its own sake which is where we are right now and that's not productive and it's not constructive and it's not  Useful but it's where we are

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is you mentioned the whole qualifier of of having people go in and do more fat checking and and and  And  Raising awareness about okay. This is this is a fact. This is an opinion  uh  When is that going to happen because we're whether it's joe rogan or whether it's the new york post  We're still just going to get click baity discussions  That are controversial and usually are all just opinion and it's going to rile up society and get people all in a tussie for no reason  When is this going to change?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Never because that's what drives clicks. That's what engages people  That's our tribalism at play. I mean you have to rise above it and when you do  Yeah, it's super boring and that's why we always come back to things like gift. That's why i'm the boring person. I guess then

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or nfp versus neft

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're so reasonable

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Important issues like it has the important things. Yes, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  jason

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know that I just put a story in quick takes. I don't really know if it belongs there  But we should talk about it because it's bonkers  Let's see it. Um, but we can do it later. It is line 37. That's right. I did a jeff jarvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You pulled a jarvis. Yeah, I see it. The question is do I use one of my wired stories of the month or not?  I'll wait for you to do it. Oh  Is it worth it? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a subscription  How about this before we get to that story first of all, I want to circle back one one quick moment to jeff  And then we'll get to your story stacey. Okay, jeff  You wrote this post on medium and i'm curious to hear your take because you you only just briefly mentioned it  In the context of the spotify  News, but I want to give you the chance to kind of set that up a little bit because I read some of it  But I want to hear hear what you have to say about it. Nice to ask jason. It's another it's another jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm being polemical. I will confess here. Um, there's a subcommittee hearing today that ended this afternoon  uh, the judiciary subcommittee breaking the news and  What upsets me here is that people in our industry and journalism are now lobbyists  the actual news organizations and their publishers and  Their associations their what were trade associations are now lobbying associations and I find that to be an abhorrent  Break from the independence and integrity of journalism  We're supposed to be watching people in power not asking favors of them  But that's what's going on is that the news industry is going for protectionist legislation and regulation  And we've talked about it lots of times on this show in australia. We've talked about it in germany and the eu  Um, we've talked about it in the uk. Well, it's happening in the u.n canada  It's happening in the u.s now and so there was a house hearing earlier in today's senate hearing  So it doesn't mean anything and I sent it to my senator who's cori booker and try to get it to the record  Uh, my last one was in the record who cares? It's there. That's that's cool  but I put up a medium, um, and and  Part of what i'm saying here is that I I love news. I love newspapers and magazines  I care about the future of journalism. We all do  but  It's not necessarily in the best hands with the legacy people who have owned it  The majority of newspapers chains in this country are now controlled by hedge funds and I worked with one of them  I was on I was on an advisory board for one of the companies they owned and I know that they don't fund  Innovation and I know that some of these tax breaks and credits are going to go to the pockets of the limited partners  Not to the journalists not to the public  And so I just wanted to be contrarian and say  Senate before you act as if all these newspaper publishers are pure as driven snow and wonderful  uh  think twice  About about the news we want and and the news that we need and the kind of innovation we need and not just  protecting the past so that was my  polemical spiel  And at the same time by the way, it was interesting that um  The intercept dropped a report about how media companies are lobbying  Against regulation of advertising targeting  Because they depend upon it now there i'm contrarian is that I think we got to have advertising  We got to have targeting in some form fine to regulate it  But so i'm i'm not in line with the intercept says but there again is an example  Of media companies that are charged with watching government watching institutions of power now asking favors  From them to protect their business. That's not right  So that was it. Thank you for asking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  Absolutely. Thank you for walking through that appreciate it  and then  There was north korea hacking some dude. Then we get to bonkers north korea and some dude hacking north korea back  This all right. So here's the story that stacey was setting up. Yeah, tell us about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will save you a click, but essentially a security researcher  An individual security research goes by p4x  he realized that  His he was getting hacked and he was trying to figure out why and he realized it was north korea  And he was kind of miffed about this because nation states attacking individual security researchers seemed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unfair stacey had he done something north korea to to warrant this or they just kind of picked him

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this is part of like a general like nation state just checking in on you know people like every every nation  tracks hackers in other nations  They they all it's part of the like I see it might be participating actively in the zero day market  but it might just be like  they know who's  Active in security research. So north korea was just  Well both that and just to see like has this guy figured out anything cool that we can steal great  so  It really upset p4x and  Nobody did anything so that that didn't sit well with him. So he said you know what?  F it i'm gonna hack him back  So here's his quote it felt like the right thing to do here if they don't see we have teeth  It's just going to keep coming  Said the hacker  I want them to understand that if you come at us, it means some of your infrastructure is going down for a while  So p4x went and found unpatched vulnerabilities in north korean  Internet systems and basically took the country's internet down using ddos

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he's the guy who did that we mentioned that last week. There was yes. He's the guy who did that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, he's that guy and he was doing it because he felt  pissed  um, so this is the debate about hackbacks, but I just thought it was bonkers that  This dude in his pajamas  Has the power to take down korea's internet or north korea's internet  Yay, such

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Such is the internet in 2022, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So many people have you know, so much power, uh, yeah, they can just do it from their pajamas and the writing is you know, it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's wired. So it's really good wire. It's good writing, you know, they're yeah. Wow  So  Here i'll do this because as a as a journalist I like it but responsibility for north korea's ongoing internet outages doesn't lie with us  Cybercommander any other state-sponsored hacking agency?  In fact, it was the work of one american man in a t-shirt pajama pants and slippers  Sitting in his living room at night after night watching alien movies and eating spicy corn snacks  And periodically walking over to his home office to check on the progress of the programs  He was running to disrupt the internet of an entire country  jeez

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Holy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so that was my bonkers cyber security story of love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right on thank you for throwing that in there. I missed that somehow somehow I missed that it just came out today  It literally came out stories  Yeah, all of these google stories that we haven't talked about yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right back to what it was android tablets. I know I just we'll get we'll get back to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. No. So so here's what I was thinking is I don't know. What where are we at right now?  Oh, yeah, I think we're we're about good for um for a break  And how about on the other side of the break? Nothing but google. It's like nothing but no, it's google. Whoa, stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We got a lot of google a google show about google  Talk about surprising our audience

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute, so you're telling me this week and google has some stories about google in it  That's amazing  All right, so let's do that  but so  You know, maybe maybe take a look at the google stories and if you have any any that you are  Totally, you know a big fan of us talking about, you know jot that down and we'll talk about them  But first this episode of this week and google is brought to you by our crowd  All around the world tech companies are innovating. We're talking about them all the time and on these shows  In fact, they're driving returns for investors. In fact, and our crowd  Analyzes companies across the global private market and then selects those that have the greatest growth potential  And then brings them to you. It's a really good opportunity from personalized medicine to cyber security to proton therapy  A 20 billion dollar total addressable market  Yeah, it covers the gamut in in state-of-the-art labs startup garages  Anywhere in between our crowd is identifying innovators so you can invest when growth potential is greatest and  As you probably know that's early you want to get in there early  And then you've then it's all upside  Hopefully our crowd is the fastest growing venture capital investment community our crowds accredited investors  Have already invested over 1 billion dollars in growing tech companies  21 of the portfolio companies are unicorns in fact and many of our crowds members  Have actually benefited from over 40 ipos or sale exits of portfolio companies  Accredited investors can participate in this in single company deals  and in doing that  You know, you only need as little as ten thousand dollars to get started or one of our crowds funds for as little as  50 000 dollars a minimum of 10 000 is required to invest and investment terms actually may vary  Depending on where you invest so you want to find out more information when you go to the site  You can actually input the country  That you're investing from and you can find that information there  Now you can invest in hil applied medical who's using nobel prize winning technology to bring the most advanced  radiotherapy treatment to cancer patients  HIL's world's first laser-based system has earned them an agreement with proton international  That happens to be the largest proton therapy operator in the us and europe and you're gonna find that  in our crowd invest in hil applied medical at  Our crowd and i'll spell it. Oh, you are  C. R. O w d our crowd.com  You can join our crowd for free at oh, you are c. R. O w d  our crowd dot com slash twig join the fastest growing venture capital investment community right now check it out our  Crowd dot com slash twig and we thank our crowd for their support of this week in google  all right, so  Google all the time here. I guess we can start with this one  Which doesn't really have a whole lot to it. But man did it get a lot of attention. It seemed like  Everybody was was talking about oh wait android tablets are coming back google's getting serious about android tablets  Basically, this has to do, you know  There were a couple of articles jr rayfield from computer world and then nine to five google spotted a job opening  Essentially, there's like a number of things happening right now android 12l is right on the cusp  They're testing the beta that's meant for foldable devices, but  Inherently because foldable devices become larger devices it ends up also being really good for tablet form factors  So there's that happening nine to five google spotted a job listing for a senior engineering manager of the android tablet app experience  And in reading through that  There's one quote. We believe that the future of computing is shifting towards more powerful and capable tablets  So that ends up being a clue from from google that you know, perhaps they're kind of putting more effort and energy into their tablet  Ecosystem and then jr rayfield who I mentioned from computer world also spotted that rich miner  Who was a co-founder of android is actually now he had stepped away from android for a while to work on other projects  He's now back and has involvement with the tablet  Efforts and of course anytime this comes up  Anyone who's been following android for a while?  You know is reminded of the nexus 7 which was google's  android tablet  Product to beat I suppose because when it came out seven or eight years ago  I can't remember how long it was at this point  It was a really fantastic tablet and everybody was super excited about it  and then somewhere along the line google does what it does and it just kind of like  dropped the football I guess but  Do any of you have uh have?  Any optimism that google can reinvigorate android tablets and uh make it compete I suppose with the ipad at this point  It feels late to me. But what do you think? I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, here's my thinking  All right. These are very small data points I  Use today an ipad as my home tablet for connecting gadgets that everyone in the family needs to control  But the gadget makers are idiots and haven't made it possible for multiple account holders, right?  So that way everyone my husband and I can both control it despite having two phones, right?  So there is a demand or a need for like that sort of device in homes with smart home stuff  there's also like we  Individuals in my house grab either the ipad or the ipad mini to wander off and watch their television shows  Almost no one watches tv on the big tv  So I think there's a market  for  More tablets that are maybe more economical  My mom freaking loves her tablets. She had a  android tablet  Then she got like a samsung tablet and then she got  Like a kindle not a kindle an amazon fire tag fire fire tower  Yeah, she's so desperate for a tablet. That's not as expensive as an ipad that she will buy an amazon fire tablet  I mean  I feel like there's a market there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But doesn't samsung already own that space or people that are just looking for something less expensive than an ipad because their tablet seems to be okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but don't you want more I feel like people love more options, but maybe that's just me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff you're a tablet. You know, I loved I loved loved loved loved loved my nexus 7  Cried when it became obsolete  Uh, I wanted I complained and I  Stopped my feet did all kinds of immature horrible things. Um, um, and so I was thinking well, what if it came back?  One idea is I think what what google was playing with was trying to come up with chrome tablets  No, I love the chrome os, but to run apps on chrome  Is kludgy as hell still it doesn't work. So that was a that was a big detour that went nowhere in my view  I'll be really curious to hear jay's you know, dr android's view of this  um, um  You know  so  Uh going back to android tablets would make sense  The question is do I really need anymore when I have this, you know phone that weighs according to stacy  uh 40 pounds

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, and then I actually when I complained I gave you the actual weight of the phone. It is roughly half a pound

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, it's roughly it's almost seven point something ounces too much for stacy's wrist scale  Floppy wrist full floppy wrist scale. So, um, you know, do I need a tablet now?  And part of the problem is i'm not traveling anymore what I love the tablet tablet for was I would watch  It was it was small to carry and i'd watch it and I had a bigger laptop. My laptop now is tiny and thin  Uh, you know, it's a google product. So as much as I loved it  I don't know that I I see a market need myself for it right now. I think you're right stacy  I think that there are needs  I don't I don't think it's very big. I think and to your point about samsung  Is that people some people are still allergic to samsung cruft?  Uh on it  So, you know a google pure android version of a tablet  Would be nice  And I might get it because I get well, you know, I get stupid things. I don't need a point of privilege  Um, but yeah, I don't know that there's a big business there. Dr android. What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dr android, I feel like I need a name tag at this point. Um  Yeah  Oh that that that's even better. I like that lab coat  a green lab coat  Um, yeah, I don't know. You know it kind of feels like this is this is one of those  One of those things where google has tried and failed and tried and failed like I get the same taste in my mouth about tablets  On android as I do about wearables on you know running android  Is that google has been really interested and excited about it and then wavered and then got excited about it again and then  you know, yeah, and even after that with wearables like  Okay, cool. So they they released the new wear os, you know last year  And uh had a had a primary device, you know with samsung the galaxy watch 4 to launch it with  And then we haven't really heard much about it. It's kind of like, you know, maybe there's some action there  Maybe there isn't but is it lighting the wearable world on fire?  I I don't know that it necessarily is yet  I'm not saying that it couldn't at some point and I kind of get that same feeling about tablets like  man, they you know if if their  Strategy right now is hey, we're getting serious about tablets because we think it's the future  They're about 10 years behind the bus that's leading that charge  And and they were in a good position then to do something about it  Absolutely  And so it's kind of like really now, okay  Like sure you got to be in all places and maybe maybe google's hardware division, you know  It really does seem like you know, there is more energy and attention in their hardware division to pay to all these different things  You know, we hear rumors about a pixel watch we hear rumors about a  A pixel foldable. I'm sure there's some sort of a pixel tablet or something like that that might come out  So, you know, maybe this is just part of their effort to like be in all places and have a hero device to point to but  And and I would totally support it  it doesn't address the chicken and egg scenario of the fact that  Having the hardware is one thing having software that works really well with it  Uh is another and if android 12l is the thing that makes that happen great  But then you've still got to get developers excited about it and that's just seems like a really tall hill to climb

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's what I wanted to ask miss stacey about was just the  hardware side of things for uh chip wise because apple has the pro the ipad pro and they're running their own apple silicon and  I think it's nice. It's it's  From a productivity standpoint. It's quite nice  Is this the time where google has the opportunity to to be able to?  Um, even with this pandemic and the supply chain stuff. Can they still have some have enough?  to be able to create a tablet that's going to be powerful like the ipad pro and and still draw developers in because  I I say no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, um  No, i'm just thinking like if you're using basic android apps, you know on the tablet, which is what I would assume they would do  Then they're fine. Like you're probably not going to get someone to develop specifically for your like a tablet form factor  Um, but that's going to run like a snapdragon, which is an arm-based chip in which developers are already building apps for so  I don't know  Like I don't think google's going to build their own chips for their tablet experience unless they're going to just fundamentally  Rethink what a tablet is and can do  right, I mean we're roughly  If you look at like eras of  Like when the ipad came out  We could be due for a new form factor. I know we talked like that's why i'm excited about foldable phones  um  My hunch is the form factor coming next might take a little while while and it's going to be holographic versus, you know  Another slab of glass, but I could be wrong  um, and if they're thinking about a new form factor for that then they would need that kind of developer and chip support, but  I don't think they're doing that  They're not like super innovative on the hardware side. I guess yeah, that's what i'm right. Yeah, I think you're right  They'll buy somebody who's doing they'll buy the danger equivalent of the holographic thing or whatever, you know, right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they tend to buy for a lot of that stuff. You know, uh, what was it fitbit for for the wearables and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that was a late deal fitbit has always to me and since they haven't done much with it  I'm just like the hell they haven't no totally totally and they bought with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was the glasses company that they bought was it focal? Um, you know and now we're hearing, you know the  I can't remember if it was focal or what the name of the glasses company that they bought but  That that's fueling, you know their development of um of ar glass  the the next generation of google glass even though google glass still exists and google was there first, but  You know, so um, so even when they buy to to give themselves a leg up  Sometimes it doesn't really it's not really obvious whether whether it made sense or not, you know, it's like, okay  Well, they did that and I get why they did that. But what did you do with it? I don't even know  Yeah, I would love to know or pixel watch product was focal

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was focal you would  That was the company was going to just running

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, it's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, I'm saying I would love to have a watch that's running just pure clean android a smartwatch that  With google assistant and all the bells and whistles that actually runs but android wear in my experience a couple years ago  It's horrible  You know, so why would I believe in it android 12? Yes. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I mean sherman  Take the way back machine. Dr. Android sherman sherman android. Dr. Sherman android sherman take the way back machine  To the last days of the nexus 7  Why do you think google let it drop?  It was a beloved product. I don't know how much it sold but it was beloved product. It was a good product  Why do you think that they got bored with it just general google boredom or was there a market reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a really good question. I'm trying to i'm trying to get that comparison to the ipad  You don't remember selling that many. Yeah. Yeah very different product  And I mean apple was pocket sized  Dominated with the ipad. Yeah, totally totally. Yeah, I can't remember  I'm having a hard time putting myself in the way back machine and remembering the market forces or whatever was going on at that point

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was it the fablets at samsung that killed it was it i'm just trying to remember i'm just  Why would they get out of it and then come back to it now?  And I think your point about timing is really right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  Um, yeah, I mean I I couldn't tell you right off the top of my head. Um  the  You know, i'm having to resort to wikipedia right now to try and kind of remind myself but that the the last nexus 7  Uh lasted until june 28th. It was the fourth most popular tablet used in the world fourth most popular tablet used in the world  That's a pretty  That's a pretty notable stat there right like so google was doing something. We didn't have that many tablets. Well, that's true. That's true  right  If ipad was one and then you have everything else fourth probably doesn't matter that much when you don't have that many out there but  Still, you know, it was cute  Yeah, sorry still the the nexus 7 was it was a really great start and I don't know the reason why google didn't continue to  Kind of develop it and iterate it  I think part of it had probably has to do with just the fact that like their whole hardware effort prior to  The hardware division as it is now under greg australo  You know and being kind of like a pixel family and everything  It was all in that like nexus era where they were making deals with other companies  Anyways, it wasn't truly theirs  And I think it was just it was just kind of murky  What exactly it was like we understood why they were creating these nexus hardware to give some sort of like a hero device for  Developers to use and know this is the true android  But but outside of that like what was the motivation for them to keep continuing to create these hardware  Certainly wasn't to sell devices because they were hardly selling these things  Maybe the nexus 7 but even then that's still you know  It's part of the nexus line and the nexus line ultimately was it was kind of like an experiment. It seemed like to me anyways  So I just don't think google really got serious about hardware until recently

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Didn't recognize why they should be still seems like a bad time to get serious about hardware right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think serious about anything. I really don't i'd like i'm not kidding. I think no, I know i'm really smart people  Yeah, other than ads  which it makes sense, that's the bulk of the revenue and they know they need to like  figure something out but  It's you know how they joke about like changing the engine while the plane's going down  Google knows that one day their plane is going to go down  but it hasn't and maybe it's like slowly losing altitude like  By a meter each year  but it's at no point ready to rush and it's just like  oh  well, let's  Grant this person the power to change the engine and see what they come up with, you know, and it just feels like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As long as the ad machine is still chugging along  Everything else is kind of like yeah. Well, let's just see what happens and I mean, you know, we've heard time and time again  kind of the  incentivization inside of  Google if you are an engineer at least my understanding of this anyways is if you are an engineer or a creator of  One of these services or whatever, you know  You get this thing to a certain point and your incentive is to it's it's almost like you graduate from that  To something else right google recognizes your brilliance and they move you to a different place and when that happens  It seems like these things rarely  Survive it's like they needed the energy of that person to really kind of be the one to go to bat for it  And once that person is gone because that's their incentive right that they end up getting paid more  They get more accolades all that kind of stuff. Then the product dies on the vine and  That is not, you know tenable long term or it certainly doesn't always work  Certainly doesn't ultimately at a rhodes customer trust  I feel like that's that's where we end up in this position where we're like damn google kills everything good because and we don't  We don't believe anymore that anything is long for this world coming from google  Um, maybe i'm speaking for myself, but I think there's a lot of that right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they throw their spaghetti at the wall  Yeah, but they're also like how do you measure if the spaghetti sticks when you're measuring it against what is it?  80 of 200 billion dollars in totally I mean right nothing looks good next to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So my guys had a really interesting theory that I put I put down in my number just so I would get to it  So you can do it now  um  That said that what we're what we might be seeing in google's report  and facebook's report is  tim cook  That by cutting off the visibility on data and advertising  Um people went back to search went back to google like crazy and they abandoned facebook  Uh, and then he has a there's two tweets in a row there  um, the next one after the one I linked to looks at pinterest and twitter and other companies that depended upon  apple  For data in a way that google does not  So I found that really interesting as a as a if you go to my um to the rundown under my number  Oh, okay  Sorry  Down. All right. I guess I need to give a line number  Uh 146  146 uh, so the charts are there  Yeah  So so it goes to your point stacy is that is that you got 80 percent of 200 billion  Right. It's still if you put attention into that that's still where the money is  Yeah, it's not 96 anymore. And yes you do. Yes. They need to get higher than six percent share  For uh cloud versus 40 for amazon. There's growth there too, but that's hard hard. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there we go  Ooh charts  It's beautiful the audio listeners love charts  They love what we just stare at charts don't say anything  Big  All right, we've got other google stories here to talk about what should we talk about is there anything that that stood out to to y'all  um  From this last week going on with google. There was what was it? Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll surprise you. Yeah, go for it hit this stuff. I used a tablet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so, um  I'm going to agree with republican about right or uh adding regulation to google  Hmm, okay. How's that? Okay. Um, i've always said that google's uh, uh achilles heel when it comes to regulation is not search  It's not shopping. It's not any of that. It's advertising and mike lee  uh republican  Is about to introduce a bill  that goes after google's control of the buy side and the sell side and the marketplace in between  and and at a at a  At a architectural level I agree that having one party be dominant in those three parts of any transaction  Is trouble and needs?  um  Investigation if not regulation so put this in the history books  That I said this may be a good idea  A good way to approach regulation when it comes to to google in the area that matters where they have domination, which is advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, hold on. Excuse me. I think I hear hell freezing over

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is sloshing cracking noise ice melts and uh, it was for our for our audio listeners. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this has to do with the with with google being the broker  For a buyer or seller i'm trying both a buyer and a seller. Yeah, buyer and the seller. That's right. Yeah, right  While simultaneously owning the exchange i'm reading from the article where where the ad space is traded  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's and how much they take out of every transaction. You know, there's an argument here  They I don't know how much they do and it's not just them taking stuff out. It's agencies and others as well  Uh, but when when an advertiser buys  Space time people whatever we want to call it now advertising  um  Uh, the guardian did some experiments couple years ago where they bought their own ads just to see how much actually landed  in their bank at the end of it and  A lot got taken out along the way by various parties  Not just google  All right, that was my turn stacy and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh more i thought the chrome i was reading about facebook. Oh, sorry chrome

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well I thought the chrome os story with the gaming capabilities I thought that was pretty fascinating  Uh, even though it still doesn't quite sell stadia. It just says hey  We're going to put another piece of hardware out there that you could play games, you know, such as stuff that's on steam  You know, there's one mention of stadia

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In this piece, I mean there's there's so much cloud gaming happening, you know in all different directions  Stadia is just one one component of it. And uh, I mean there's no reason why chromebooks  Couldn't participate right that's if that's what it's all about streaming from the web  I think it makes perfect sense that there would be gaming chromebooks  I mean, I don't know what what exactly makes a gaming chromebook that it has, you know, uh leds behind the keys  Yeah, that was like a super fast 5g connection

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, I think that makes perfect sense, um, i'm not too thrilled about it being

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Something that you would have to run in a virtual machine at least that's what it says here on nine to five google  But I guess they got to start somewhere  Um do any  I'm assuming you guys don't game like that  But i'm wondering if any of our other listeners that are all pro lennox and things like that  Are they using vms to do gaming or are they just doing it natively through the cloud?  Good question any survey says watching in the chat  Nobody says anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're like we're not a gaming audience. Yeah, some of them are gamers, but  Yeah, I think that makes sense though to have a gaming chromebook. Sure  I don't know how many people are going to rush out and buy them  But I think it you know, it will it will suffer the same kind of uh challenges  That regular chromebooks have is like why would I spend the the money on a gaming chromebook when I can spend the money on a gaming pc  On an actual gaming rig blah blah blah. Yeah, exactly exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This truck is behind me. Sorry. It's loud

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all my my story that I am super questioning  is the story about  Google's cloud business trying to build  features for blockchain developers  and what's  Whackadoo about this story who is by actually  My mentee jordan, so he's he's a savvy smart fellow  Which is why he's pointing out the weird hypocrisy happening here, which is a lot of people focused on  blockchain and distributed ledgers are also worried about the power of too many people only they do it they do a lot of lip service to  Too many companies, you know having a chunk of the internet and the centralization of that power  um, so it's weird that google's like  So he's pointing out that it's weird that google's trying to build something for people who ultimately hate the fact that google  Is one of the three cloud providers, although as the smallest I guess it doesn't have a great enough concentration  And then I think it's kind of a bunch of bs because thomas kurian is like, you know  What the biggest areas are for this is retail healthcare and other big industries  Which are the big targets for google cloud as a whole so I just is this blockchain washing? What the hell is this?  That's all  Thoughts

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You lost me at blockchain

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was kind of thinking the same thing. I well I just think I really want to understand this stuff more  But anytime I try it makes my brain hurt

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the question here is if you're gonna print I mean  What can google possibly offer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're gonna like to a blockchain developer, and that's what I don't understand  because  The benefit of a blockchain is you're gonna run an algorithm on as many places as possible  so that's  In nowhere in this does it answer it sounds honestly like google's just like, uh, we're just gonna do something  There's potential growth here to to go with the you know, they gotta find another way to make money

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I just want another avenue for our cloud to be relevant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To be used. So yeah, they they've basically created a new blockchain group  And

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It feels like you're just throwing around like  Like terms like hype terms. Okay, that's all I was just hoping someone could explain this to me, but no one can  I'll just I wish that I could

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I cannot  I have no explanation on that one. No one in the chat anyone

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think line 66 is worth mentioning it's not yeah, I was actually it is worth mentioning

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I was I was circling that as well. Google is making some changes to their parental leave policy  Um actually some really fantastic changes  Uh, they are offering man. Their benefits are crazy. Sorry. I have text overlapping here. Um  Expanded parental leave to 18 weeks for all parents. It had been 12 prior  So that's pretty nice. Basically a half year. Is it paid leave?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's my it's my understanding. Okay. Yeah, sorry i'm like, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what i've  I was like I didn't have paid leave 15 years ago when I had my baby

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, things have changed right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like a half year, I mean i'm glad I helped push for paid leave for our employees  Before I left giga because I was like, yo, come on  And I think they got it yay them outstanding

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, I think this is great news about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead  Well, I was just gonna say 18 weeks for all parents 24 weeks for parents who give birth  uh previously 18 weeks as of uh  April 2nd also eight weeks of caregiver leave for employees to take  Which doubles the previous allowance? What are we gonna say jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  just um  There's nothing to do with google. Um stacy can kick me or punch me. Uh, but starbucks  um  I asked the crew one of my local starbucks where they were closing  Earlier all the time and one of them around here has not been open for two weeks  One of them closes every day at noon  But I said what's going on they said we can't get anybody to apply for the jobs  We just can't I said did they finally raise your salaries to credit me said actually yeah, they did even so  We can't get anybody to play for jobs. We're all short-staffed as heck  And and so that's obviously not the case at google  But it is the case that in the great resignation, which is actually probably great  redistribution  uh people um  Are a lot freer to try to find other jobs the job marketplaces change  You know the complaints about about inflation  are also about redistribution of  Wealth in the hands of salaried employees, which is a wonderful thing and needs to happen  and and so  Uh, you know, I think google does these kinds of things because they're the right thing to do yes  but they're also the smart thing to do because uh  If you're if you're going to start a family and you know  You can work at google and get that kind of benefit then I think you'd be a lot more loyal to stick around

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, well they agree although again for low-wage workers or for other googles  For anyone who isn't an engineer google's a crappy place to work because engineers kind of look down on you  And they try to contract out as much of that as possible. But yes, if you're an engineer, you're fine  Although I might go try to work at starbucks in the afternoons

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they want you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I take  I actually I absolutely hate going to some of the stores around here because they're so short staffed and  I go in there and i'm paying more for food  You know that I that I normally would have to pay  and then i'm doing the checkout myself and  I'm like this this just is it's bad, but I I I salute the people that says you know what I I can do better  Elsewhere, you know, I uh whether it's getting money from the government or just trying to start something on their own  But man, it's really making  shopping, uh  Here locally just a bit of a pain in the butt for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not you aunt but my brother worked at starbucks another it's not just pay it is that their customers

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, their customers are horrible. I guess yes. Yes. I mean like customers like even if

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it'd be fun to do that for a little while, but I mean I have had  I mean I worked in public store like I worked at a grocery store when I was a kid, but  I mean you did get some real awful people and my understanding is we've only gotten worse and more aggressive

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, people are feeling way more entitled nowadays according to my hard head up in college  not gonna say where he's working but  He he doesn't like people anymore because people are so entitled where they come into these places and  You know want this and that and want it to be this way versus that way, you know as if they're at  Burger king where you can have it your way, you know, it's and they and they want it fast which you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they want to part of the snake eating its own tail of where we're at with the great resignation because I because I completely agree  I'm all for people  Recognizing and standing up for themselves and realizing hey, i'm worth more  Both from a value standpoint and from like an emotional standpoint, you know where we work like I I deserve more than i'm getting  But because of the those shortages caused by that then you end up with the people coming in and saying okay  You're short staff. I'm not getting the service that I expect and then those people, you know, it feeds itself  Yeah, it's a problem. Did you see the golden corral brawl?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no  Oh, there was a brawl. I mean everybody was throwing that old chest first  They were throwing high chairs then chairs then tables at each other  Carrying up the whole place because one guy got a steak  It was rare before somebody else had got a steak that was I guess medium and it was quicker  And so one of them got enraged and tempers went wacky

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, to say the least that's what happens when you have hangry people  Yeah hangar it's real it's a real thing I've been working at ponderosa steakhouse myself  Let's see here google is going to possibly be introducing limits to whatsapp chat backups  And apparently I didn't I didn't realize this so apparently whatsapp  I mean I did realize that whatsapp backups end up on drive, but I didn't realize  Until I read this article that apparently this has been freed it doesn't count towards your google drive storage quota or your account

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had no idea about that. I had no idea about that either

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of crazy and it kind of blows me away  Google has its own efforts that are counter to you know, what what meta  Facebook does with you know, whatsapp  It's chat efforts and yet google's just been kind of to a certain degree like bankrolling their their free storage for backups  So apparently this is going to be changing here pretty soon  Google's probably going to be  Implementing some limits  I think this might have to do with some code strings that were found in the whatsapp beta that show a preparation towards this and  I don't know something tells me facebook will be fine. They'll they'll figure it out. But  Still I had no idea. I didn't know. I just I thought everything counted against your storage quota at this point

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a nice google nugget  Yeah, good nugget

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um  Are we still on google? I want to ask and a question that's non-google. Sure. Go for it  We can go where a line since I feel like the cat's away. We can we can we can say right?  He's not going to complain you decide he doesn't have to scroll  uh  Line 39 and I don't know if you have an opinion about this but a a c2pa  spec  to assure provenance  And and and cream creator credit for media, especially photography photography  is this something that's music to your ears or

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Doesn't matter. I remember adobe talking about this a couple years ago. Yep, and  It's it's quite promising but uh again with standards  Uh, you got to get everybody on board and that's that that could be part of the problem right there  It's just getting everybody on board with doing things a certain way  But yeah, I remember this a couple years ago. So this is there's been an update to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, now they have kind of the first standard out. So you're right. That's that shows how much time it takes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, version 1.0 1.0 is now out of the tech specification

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Outstanding. Okay. I didn't catch that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So i'll be curious that if you try to implement that on your photos

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have not I have not um  Again because I when when adobe was talking about it, it was all the the whole beta talk and stuff and yeah  It was 2019. You're right  I didn't want to take chances and have something get screwed up. So no  But it's nice to see that now we do have version one  Ready to go. Yeah, that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Will will this ever come into play with nefts?  NFTs, that's a good question. This is just his thing today. Do not make neft happen jason

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trust me 15 years from now and having to say i'm coming back to you in the verge

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is how it this is how it starts, right? You make fun of it  And then at some point it's you're not making fun of it anymore. You've just adopted it. So you're right  I will stop it calling stop the net

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, when irony goes too far  It just becomes reality

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right  That's right. But I mean seriously, I wonder if that would that would be uh useful for for nfts  Just because we you know, we hear about these nfts being repurposed and oh, that's not the real one that that person posted that person's image  over here

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But at the same time blockchain was supposed to  Give you that authenticity was supposed to yeah supposed to well it gives you authenticity

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that  well  It depends on who creates the contract. I mean that's yeah. Yeah, I mean  Basically, it says the the digital item you have is the digital item you have now if someone says  like if I lie and say i'm the creator and I create the digital item and I  you know put it on the ledger as the  I am the creator of this item  then  You know, i've just committed fraud but my fraud is  It has a provenance. I guess is how you should think about it  The interesting thing is if I decide if I am a creator someone steals my work puts it on the blockchain  I have a very clear trail back to who created it when i'm seeking redress  And so i'm wondering when we'll see those kind of court cases  Because it's perfect for that and what effect that will have on some of these nfts. Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, should we pour one out for um, what was it called dm for uh meta's dm, which is now shutting down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I was like direct messages, they're still here. Oh, sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dms are not going anywhere. But dm once known as libra launched back in 2019. It was facebook's  New brand didn't help didn't save it  Yeah, nothing saved it. Apparently, uh, they're selling it to silver gate capital corporation for 182 million dollars the assets  of that and uh  Yeah, based on what I was reading through and you know  Of course jack dorsey's weighing in on it too saying like it was a total waste of time  They should have just like put all their efforts into bitcoin. That's that's what they should have done  But ultimately it sounds like you know, um the people who were really close with this just from day one  It was all about you know, federal regulators had had a problem with it and uh, there was just nothing they could do to undo  Kind of the the view of facebook  Creating its own currency in light of you know, all of its other kind of uh chaos happening the past couple of years and it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ultimately, it sort of makes sense for facebook to have wanted to to  Create its own little cryptocurrency like that because they're a platform  um  If they're if they're a platform and they're building out worlds, you know  Years down the road where people can exchange goods. It makes sense to have their own  Own in inclusive, um exclusive currency to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But then yeah, I guess regulation would be well what about jack's point is just go with the currency  Why have to build all that? Why not go build it buyer build kind of the old in the old ways?  um  Why not support which he's doing with with his?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Transactional platform what exists? Yeah, but who's to say that bitcoin is really accessible, too?  I mean hick some people feel bitcoin is exclusive exclusive because it's not as  um  Accessible  You know I I can put up digital money out there but getting digital money and turn it into bitcoin is quite a challenge for some people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not obvious. It's certainly not an obvious process. It's way easier now than it than it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now but it's you you also I mean not obvious you also want you have to establish some sort of  Friction in these because otherwise  Yeah, people would be stolen their money would be stolen. That's right. Although they begin big time trouble. Yeah, you're right  But you know what? Let's not talk about it because it died

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, okay. So see you later. Oh how cruel how heartless how soon forgotten?  Jim we hardly knew you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right  But dms, you're still cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know dms are okay. Yeah. Cool. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, how about we do a little changelog? We've got some actually really great stuff in the changelog this week. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm excited about some of this when you're doing it you give yourself good stuff when leo's doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have nothing to do with the quality of the news. All right, I just lucked out this week. Nice. Nice  Sound the horns

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the google changelog

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Starting with google announcing a new layout for gmail  It's going to be changing how google chat meet and spaces are  Sorry are integrated onto the page  Uh used to be these things kind of had their own little modules and so you could see your email  And all the other things kind of you know, like your chat down in the bottom corner or whatever  Now things are going to shift so that I think it's so that there's icons along the side  So basically you have like a g a mail icon on the side when you click that the entire window represents your gmail  If you click chat, then I think everything changes to chat. It's a more  I don't know what you call that but it's definitely different and uh, stacey  It sounded like prior to the show you were talking about this a little bit. You have some thoughts on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I just I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I  Know I just want to be clear. This is for the g suite  That's right. I failed to workspace. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I failed to mention that it's uh, it is for the workspace suite tools. So workspace so we actually get a benefit  Apparently you've waited long enough jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, okay, because like as a workspace customer, I think i've had  Oh no, I have  Okay, I can't tell what's the new view and what's not is what I I don't have thoughts. I have confusion  I was trying to figure out which view I would have sounds like google  Each of like because I am I have my personal google account and then I have my workspace account and they both look different  right, so i'm like  Which one am I getting? I don't know  So that was my question

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so if you look at if you I mean if we if we pull up that that uh, the  article  On the screen I can I can kind of point out to you the the basically the hero image on the screen if you  If you take a look at this and you see the far left you see how  There's that like very first toolbar on the far far left and it's got mail chat spaces and meat  And my understanding is when you tap the mail button  Everything that you get what you see on the screen right now, which is just like a general gmail layout  But that control kind of tab on the on the left underneath the sandwich, uh icon  You know if you hit chat there, I think oh guessing the entire screen  To the right of that shifts to the chat functionality and then spaces and then meat  It's it's just it's laying things out a little bit differently  It's kind of cleaning it up a little bit  But I think some people are going to have a problem with the fact  That it doesn't give you everything on the screen at one time the way the current layout kind of does right like I can  Have my chats on the screen along with my email and that's what i'm used to right now this  This implementation I think changes that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's what I was worried about. I was trying to figure that out because I don't want that  Yeah, yeah, i'm working within my email and i'm chatting with people while i'm working within my email so i'm like right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is not good. And so  If you're in your email and the chat comes through instead of seeing the chat on your screen like down in the little module  You'll get a little uh a little color or a number next to the chat button on the left  That says oh you have a new chat and then you have to click over there and and  You know, it'll pull it up  So, I don't know if it's any better but it's different and apparently it's rolling out soon  Yeah, so there you go. So i'm gonna  Knock you off that  Of any sort of excitement that you may have had about a gmail redesign  Uh, I don't know we might end up growing into it, you know and liking it. I don't know. I'm multi-tasking my inbox

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, it comes out february so we'll see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll see very soon. Uh, but I mean their plans are like yes  This is uh, we're starting it in february. It's the default option in april  It's the only option by the end of q2 2022. So they're like, this is the future  So look for it  Um the g-suite legacy free edition a couple of years a couple of years ago kind of feels like that a couple of weeks ago  um, there was the whole thing where you know  Users of g-suite legacy free edition have had like free access to this for like the last 10 years google  Stopped supporting it but never like booted them off or made them pay  And then they said well that's ending you're gonna have to pay and here are the service prices and people  You know lost their their minds about that as people are wanting to do these things  Uh, so apparently they're making changes  There will be an ability to transfer your non-google workspace paid  Content and most of your data to a no-cost option  I don't know if we know exactly what that option is yet  But it seems to be something about transferring the the legacy free edition to a regular gmail.com  Address that's likely anyways, so  So if you fall in that category, there will hopefully be still a uh an alternative for you  I think a lot of people did I I was not one of those free users. So but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hurtful quite i've been paying and angry about it every time I get screwed my new function. Yes  exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pain and wonder wonder and why?  YouTube's rolling out a new  A new mobile interface for full screen video. Basically just  Kind of cleans up the the presentation. This is on android and ios to bring comments  Share that sort of stuff onto the screen in a more elegant way  So, I mean not a whole lot new to you know, talk about there  It's just kind of a redesign of the player on android and ios this started rolling out on monday  Um, so yeah, I guess look at look for that. It only appears if you're watching in full screen  So there's that  Uh google one, uh vpn is now offered for iphone  So I guess this was only  For android I didn't I didn't realize that you couldn't get this on iphone before but apparently you couldn't and now you can  So that's yeah, I thought it was cross-platform too. Yeah. Yeah  Uh available to people in 18 countries including the us uk canada and mexico  So if you are an iphone user and you want google one's vpn  Apparently you can start getting that right away  This one's cool and I haven't received a message from an iphone user since this has hit my phone  but  Uh, if you use google messages and you were chatting with someone who has an iphone and they do some sort of reaction to your chat  That is to say instead of saying like oh, I like what you just sent they hit the heart  Before if they did that you would get a message that said so and so loved and then quote your entire message  Higher message. It's like all entire darned message. Yeah, it was annoying and ugly and it's like, you know  Once once we started knowing that google is working on actually taking that text and converting it into actual like images  It was like why didn't you do this sooner? And finally it's rolling out  Uh, and I I have the setting on my phone. But like I said, I haven't received a message from is this an rcs thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mr. Howell, or is this just google magic? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is google magic. This is only in in google messages  This is google basically saying taking the string that i'm by understanding anyways taking the string that comes back from an iphone  and recognizing that string and converting it in the way that it knows how like if an iphone says  Loved then we put a heart next to your message period. Yeah, gotcha. Yeah. Okay. Yeah  But I do know that some people have had kind of mixed  Experience with it like sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't like I think ron richards all about android co-host  Uh, he said that he didn't think that it was working on images. It worked on on some of his text  messages back and forth  But if it was an image it didn't work. It said liked the image or something like that. So what about google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder about google voice  people, yeah  I don't know. You used the um text and featured through that instead of messages. It's still a google product and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, I don't know but I mean even if it fixes  Let's say two-thirds of of those comments coming from an iphone. That'll still be better than nothing, you know  And it does look nice when it works. It looks nice based on the screenshots i've seen so  So that's neat um  Any pixel 4a fans in the house?  If so, you're not gonna be able to buy one. Yeah, I liked it. Okay  I thought it was a good phone. Yeah  um  Yeah, maybe maybe that's the device you should have got stacy instead of the five, but you can't too late. It's gone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I got the I was moving from a 3a and I didn't want to go. Yeah one up that felt lame

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, totally and also it's you know, it's it's an older phone. It's one year older than the five more or less, but  um, but yeah, this was uh  This was 350 at launch if you remember it was delayed  Um, this was 2020 right so it was the beginning of covid  It was supposed to come out like march or april or somewhere around there and it ended up getting delayed to late summer  Um, it was the shrug phone  It was uh, we're look we're trying our best here. We got it out. We should be happy that we got it out at least  Uh phone and uh, it is also the last a series device  To get a wide release the the 5a 5g  Uh actually was very limited to a handful of markets because of the supply chain. So  so anywho  Uh, you won't be able to get that at the google store anymore. It is so it is out of stock  And not going to be sold anymore  And then finally if you have the pixel 3  You may remember google's promise that you would have unlimited original photo backups  Until a certain time well that certain time has happened that certain time was january 31st 2022  It seemed like so long  When you first bought that phone, I know but now  Roughly three and a quarter years later

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That has expired come home to roost. I worked for an employer that had lifetime job guarantees and then they had to redefine life

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is life? Yeah, who's life who's still around?  Um  Leave  It's important to determine. Yeah, whose life are we talking about here?  Or what's life anyways?  All right, that is the google changelog

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I feel that that I may not um  Farewell against a shark or it might be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure yeah, I would not either  Ant on the other hand, I think ant could single-handedly take down a shark. I'm just saying. Oh, yeah, i'd give it a shot  You'd try your best I think we'd all try our best I think you just have better success

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What kinds of sharks I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some people jump the sharks. Yeah, but I she's not worried about it crashing. She's on the water

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's worried about the shark then coming together

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what the sharks that live in the bay are pretty benign, but there are 11 species of them  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well, they might not they must not be that bad because there are um,  there are  a lot of people who you know challenge themselves by swimming across the bay and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently they do have a lot of riptides. So that would be bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah  I would never swim across the bay. That just sounds like a nightmare to me, but  I mean it's hard to be cold

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very yeah, I mean I landed up in the pacific up here  In the summer and I was like I am gonna die hypothermia. It was so cold. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How about how about this one in it how did you land like I fell out of a boat

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, oh my goodness, no way

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can swim. It's okay involved. Yeah still was a who was gin involved

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I have a friend named gin and I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about this one lord metaverse real estate  to top 500 million dollars  Projectors schmuck board every minute  This is just like it blows my mind, but I mean you need a place to put your fake hay  Yeah kind kind of inevitable though right that that there would be some sort of value out of these this virtual  real estate because if there are virtual worlds built and if there are virtual worlds built with  uh  epicenters or places where everybody is positioned and then you know worlds outside of that something closer to that is you know,  If you sell it anyways, if you choose to sell it would be worth more than something that's far far off  So this is kind of inevitable, right? I guess I just didn't think it would be this  Expensive are we missing out on an opportunity? Should I invest in virtual real estate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I find fascinating and my friend yanko did a story for protocol this week about like who owned who owns his address in the  Metaverse yes, i'm talking to him tomorrow on tech news weekly. Yeah about that story  Yes, you know he had a dedicated fan place of like women who thought he was so hot when he was doing our shows for  Uh giga ohm and he's adorable. Anyway, the point being that yanko  His story is so fascinating to me because i'm like not only do you have to buy like the company that's going to actually  Create the layer that's over your house, but there's going to be multiples, right?  so  You're basically just investing you're basically betting on a horse  So do you spread your bet across all the possible horses probably if you're smart?  And then we haven't discussed rights, but it's probable that you will have rights  We had all this back in pokemon go remember when we were like, oh so  And then there'll be best practices like should you buy out like a museum or do they get to own it?  i'm sure some senators are going to be like  Uh, no, you should own your own house  You don't want to be like, I don't know your kids walking up with their ar glasses and seeing you know  nudes in their bedroom  Actually that your kids might like that. I don't know  Like wait a second this might be ideal for certain people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

So we are on the I think leo calls it the back of the book. I believe  We've got the tips the tricks  the things  Uh, let's start with you stacey. What you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  y'all  I have an exciting book for y'all because I am reading neil stevenson's termination shock  Actually, i'm listening to it on audiobook which is unusual for me because this is a 23 hour audiobook  Okay, so this is neil stevenson's latest you make it go faster  Yeah, I do. I make it go it. I went with 1.25 for this one  I like when I can go all the way to 1.5. But okay, here's the thinking  Oh, I can do it a lot of them are pretty slow, but this is a man reading and he's a little faster  And neil stevenson  I am not a neil stevenson fan. I'll just just throw it out there y'all  Not a fan usually didn't like many of his books. I did read  You know, what is the metaverse snow crash way back in the day? Anyway point being  This is an okay book if you like his stuff you will like this it starts out with the  I cannot curse  I have to curse on this. I'm sorry get ready to beep a  crazy intro involving pigs an airplane crash  In meth gators and rednecks in texas and the fact that I lived in texas made me feel real close to this  So that that was the positive side the downside is it took for freaking ever for him to like describe this like way too long  Needs an editor, but I think the engineering types will like it because he really goes into everything you the research shows  It might actually be like talking to me  Okay  So I put this in the category of kind of boring  But at least it sort of tries to have a plot climate change novels. It feels very much like kim. What's his name?  stanley  robinson's  Book that everyone was so hyped about ministry of the future  Which had a really killer beginning and then really devolved into like a plotless  List of things you could do to help prevent climate change. There was a moderate plot  This is  Has more of a plot, but it's such slow going because all of the engineering  But if you like neil stevenson, you'll probably love this. It's a good book. It's a good audio book  There you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's going to occupy a lot of your time so if you got time to fill  This like sometimes when i'm looking for an audio book  It's like I want the really long one because I got a lot of extra time coming up here  And I don't want to have to like, you know find another or something  So sometimes i'm like looking for the book that's going to take a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm getting like it  Yeah  If you've got a long road trip or in my case because I can't for my  My arm thing I couldn't hold up a book very easily to read so I was like well  I'm just gonna pace and listen to this book and let me tell you  I've walked many miles to this book now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice stuff right on. All right, so that is termination shock

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The novel oh kim stanley robinson. Yes. Thank you  I was really struggling there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kim stanley robinson. Oh, yeah. Thanks out of sync in chat  Awesome. Thank you stacy  Uh, let's see here jeff. How about you what you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So a quiz if you haven't cheated and already looked at it, which company do you think makes more money netflix or youtube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've cheated I can't answer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, i will go with netflix

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would say  No, i'd say youtube

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ding ding ding and we're gonna have a winner. I was surprised. I was surprised. I would have thought that stacy did

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That netflix spends a lot of money. They spend a lot of money on their on their original content  So right, but this is revenue about profits. This is just revenue revenue

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, and they just raised their prices, but okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, um, yeah, I was surprised and youtube's is from advertising  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean they have they had the youtube premium but I gotta believe that's debinimous  I think it just killed off part of that. It killed off their original programming for that. So I don't know if youtube

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am hearing you all wrong instead of de minimis. I heard it's too venomous and i'm like  I'm really enjoying you today jeff with my inability to hear your voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Down to 0.9. I think I think that's my advice here  I don't know what's happening here 1.25, which is the normal speed I speak at is about 1.5  A little too fast for you, I think  Oh lord, jen, jen wouldn't throw me off a boat. How would you dare say that about jen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was so confused. She's my friend

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's like how does he know chen also, why does he think she would throw me off the boat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She got really nervous. There's so much you don't know. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a great three beat response to look at like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What wait a minute? Yes, tried to pick it apart  Yeah, confused stacy face  Yeah, so uh youtube 28.8 billion dollars in advertising revenue in 2021  And what I guess what's coming to mind for me was another article that we had in here  I got a scan for it. It was somebody from a creator on youtube  Where is that?  Talking about the take for the queen. Oh, is it hank green? Yes. That's what it is. Okay, and uh  TikTok tick tock  Yeah, and I just I don't know in reading through that just made me realize man  You know if you are a creator on youtube  You have so much potential to make some serious cash there  Like I guess I just never really considered the fact that the partner programs adsense split 55% to creators 45%  To youtube so that number that you're seeing, you know from youtube. I mean obviously not all of that  You know you you couldn't apply that that math to this and and come up with an accurate number  but i'm sure a lot of that like  Take take from this number and then apply it to creators and the creators are making some serious bank not not that we didn't know  That's creators are making ridiculous money. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Two things that hank hank  Makes a point up here one is  That the ads are associated with you in your video. So it's attributable and you get the money but second  Uh tick tock puts out a 200 million dollar fund and the more popular people get the less people get  Yeah, right because it's static youtube doesn't have a ceiling

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right, no  youtube is just primarily like  Of all the money we make from placing ads in your videos  You're gonna get 55 of it and we will get 45 of it and tick tock says we've got a fund  And you can have some of this fund, but the fund is  Finite right like it has an end point. It's just 200  So the more people that get on tick tock and are creating it's actually bad for the uh for the creator ecosystem  Because the more people falling from that fund

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love hank. I love both brothers both john and john and hank and and and at  Vidcon, I don't know probably five years ago now, uh, he started  a a guild  For creators it ended up dying because the companies just wouldn't negotiate with them kind of  Uh, and it wasn't worth worth keeping going but but he always looks out for the creators as a class  And god bless him for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah, really interesting. Uh look into how how all that works for creators in the back end. So  Uh, just kind of reminded me of that  um  And would you what you got? Would you like to go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure. Well first up I  Want to say thank you to the san diego mobile film festival for having me  I was interviewed by them here recently because I am a guest  Judge for their film festival that's going to be held.

No, sorry monday  Uh that they're they're going to they're you know, the the terms of the deal were not disclosed  Uh, but they noted it was in the low seven figures, which you just have to imagine like man the person who made that  Probably could have done better than that if if they had any if they had the ambition or desire to really go the monetization  Route which it really sounded in interviews and news that I read sounded like that person created lots of really interested in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's he's a kind of guy who's like, oh i'm gonna just try he built like a smart button for the you know  he's done a couple like just crazy things and I think he just  I i'm with him man. I mean who wants the monetization slog if you could make something that was gave people joy  How much is it really worth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. It's a fad that's gonna go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think he made out like a bandit. Yeah, he did. All right, you can just kind of  You know be be done and walk away  um, if you uh are wondering what new york times is going to do with this  They uh say not at this time when asked are you going to include ads?  So, you know that that might happen they say, uh at this time no changes will be made to its gameplay  So who the heck knows what's going to happen here?  But if you like it the way it is and you don't want to have to go to the new york times  Hey, guess what?  All you have to do is right click and save and you can save this game to your computer hard drive  And run it the same. In fact, all of the words that are used in the game are embedded into the the game itself  It's not pulling those words forever like a cloud database. Yeah  Yeah, I mean it's it's all it's a standalone game  You could literally just right click and save the whole game and have it and no matter what the new york times does

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the new york times is gonna do like a gameplay subscription like they have cooking  They have the wire cutter. I know they already have like a crossword subscription  but I think they're just gonna put a bunch of these for like  You know  So you can like get sudoku and a crossword puzzle and a word find and wordle and right and they're counting  silly things a subscription

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
