It's time for Twig this week in Google.  Leo Laporte of course still doing his gallivanting thing  around the world, literally on the other side of the world,  having fun, but he's gotta have that kind of,  that pang at this point because his trip is nearing the end  and he's gonna have to come back  and jump right into work again.  So Leo, I'm sorry about that,  but I hope you're having a good time.  I'm Jason Howell, I'm happy to be here.  My phone is yelling at me apparently,  so I'll have to silence that.  And I'm just thrilled to be here once again.  I was here last week, had a great time,  and I've returned for more great times,  starting with Jeff Jarvis, buzzmachine.com,  professor at the CUNY School of Journalism  and live from a hotel near F8, Facebook's F8.  And come back to us, Jeff.  Wearing the Oculus Go, obviously.  So you already have the Oculus Go, that didn't take long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it under the chairs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was at the partner breakfast yesterday,  so they gave it to us early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lucky you.  And you've lived the last 24 hours in Oculus Go land?  I'd be more fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I finally set it up, so it's pretty cool.  It's nice, it's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no phone to put in.  No, it's all one piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you see yourself in that?  Or if I'm looking at you in that, do I see my own face?  Because that would be super creepy,  but it looks super shiny.  Like on the outside, it's super shiny?  It's like a mirror?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not that shiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a mirror to everyone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was like, they missed a really big opportunity.  Well, actually, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just took off the plastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that'll do it.  You're one of those that keeps the plastic on there  because you don't want the technology to get all scuffed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Could you go snorkeling with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's the you know how I wasted.  Oh, I'm sorry, finish your introduction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, just real quick, Stacey Higginbotham,  you were out last week.  I'm super happy that you're back this week,  creator of the IOT podcast at IOT Podcast dot com  and Internet of Things newsletter at Stacey on IOT dot com.  How are you doing, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am doing super well.  Back from Sweden.  Yay. Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How long were you in Sweden?  A week. Nice.  And I know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where were you in Sweden?  Were you in Stockholm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I flew into Copenhagen, stayed there a night and then went to Malmo.  So southern Sweden.  Me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's great to have you back.  Welcome back to the states.  And also joining us once again, Matthew Ingram, he was on last week,  making a return appearance, chief digital writer, CJR dot org  at Matthew I on Twitter. How's it going, Matthew?  Good. Yeah, great. Happy to be here. Excellent.  Happy to have you here.  You and your Star Trek shirt,  which thankfully appears right above the lower third.  So I represent.  Yeah, I understand.  You got to represent.  So obviously, we probably have to start with with Facebook, right?  Because, Jeff, you're there.  Like you were surrounded by the Zuckerberg and all of his glory on stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he he started off with a confession  and then asked for penance and forgiveness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So from a from a general sense, the tenor of the show, I mean,  this is a very important year for Facebook.  And, you know, I imagine they're they're placing a lot of emphasis  on their place in the world and the responsibility  and security and all that kind of stuff.  Was that apparent from the very beginning of the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that led off every single talk.  I mean, the hair shirt was there in every case.  And Sheriff Sandberg at the partner's breakfast beforehand  talked immediately about the responsibility that they have.  Zuck, as you probably saw in keynotes, started off with that.  But the the I mean, a couple of things about this one.  This is before thousands of builders of developers.  And so the reception here is going to be different.  Now, their approvals have been shut off and now they're back on again.  So they're happy about that. They can get back to work.  And but but yeah, there's there's a sobriety to it this year,  I would say definitely.  Also, interestingly, it was a much larger this year than last year.  Much larger. They had a different different hall,  the keynote, different hall down here.  Nothing terribly new.  So the dating service, I think, was new.  The the security stuff we knew  to meet little bits here and there, I would say.  I just I went to the technical keynote this morning on on what they're doing  with AR and and AI and a lot of neat stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like the clear history thing is actually a big deal, right?  They announced that they announced that they're going to allow you.  I don't know if you have controls yet, but they're going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it's up yet, but I think it's I think it's important  to know. Interestingly, it it's the next one.  Those who argue that Facebook tries to be the web,  that it needs to give you similar functionality to the web  and browsers and so you can get your history of browsers.  You should be able to do the same on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think we should point out that Facebook didn't make this kind of change  just because Mark came to the conclusion it was a good idea.  These are things that Facebook is doing to try and get ahead of  the general data protection regulations in the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So. And I think the government general, by the way,  I should do my copy out here, my disclosure.  I receive funds from Facebook to start the integrity initiative.  I'm independent of Facebook and I receive no money personally  from any of the platforms. End of disclosure. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What were they talking yet about Cambridge Analytica shutting down there at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, because that just came out.  I think I saw it after the morning, you know, today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was just an hour or two ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was just this morning, Wall Street Journal, NBC News reporting that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it sounds to me, I just did a little bit of research, but it sounds to me like.  So Cambridge was a subsidiary of this large SCL, I think was called.  They're both shutting down.  But it sounds like the principals are effectively starting another company.  So, of course, they are starting a company.  They can change the date. Yeah. Rebranding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The name is poisoned at this point. Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm. It's like Philip Morris to Altria.  Is it Altria?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. The Oxford Analytica is like that now.  Yeah. Yale Analytica.  I'm sure Cambridge Analytica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cambridge University will be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So did you are you are you talking to developers, Jeff,  about their plans for monetization and what the kind of looming privacy crisis  or the constant privacy crisis right now means for how they're building their stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a really great question, Stacey, and not so much developers  as I am media people.  And I talked to a major European publisher  who has warned his staff that they could lose 30 percent  of their business where GDPR comes in.  And so you've got journalists who say, oh, yeah, GDPR.  Wonderful. And he said, watch it.  You know, one of the people next to you could lose their job because of this.  So there's there's that because because programmatic is going to go down.  Advertising in general is going to go down.  This has nothing to do with Facebook per se. It's general.  The second piece of this, though, Stacey, is right now the the the laser  furor of the publishers is going from Facebook back to Google  because Google is making the publishers  get consent from users on behalf of Google.  And if they don't, Google will pull its ad service for the three months.  And the publishers are going berserk with, I think, good reason.  So I'm sure this will get negotiated.  But GDPR is it's exact right questions because it's it's panic time.  A lot of people still do not know what it means.  One of the publishers also told me that that the EU has to do things  in four hundred seventy six languages.  You know, it's Canada times 10  that there were new translations of the regulations  and word changes here or there that made tremendous difference in the execution.  And so they're tearing their hair out.  Everybody's turn their hair out.  The presumption is it remains that Facebook and Google have the resources.  They'll be fine. They'll probably be stronger.  But publisher, large publishers go through suspense and hassle.  And small guys are going to be screw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry. You go ahead. Oh, no, I was going to tie this to because  and we're skipping ahead a little bit to Google because someone put this  on the story rundown and I thought this was actually really interesting  is this idea of four publisher groups telling Google their GDPR  proposals all short.  Yeah, I was curious why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, that's because that's that's what it is.  It's because who gets the permission for what? Right.  And so it's wildly complicated.  The other thing I've heard from some publishers is that is that  they could be losing 80, 90 percent of their email traffic, you know,  subscriptions, because they're going to go back and try to get permissions  that they don't have now.  And they're going to lose tremendous amounts of that.  Plus advertising targeting, advertising value,  plus other kinds of targeting.  And then a lot of these publishers just don't have the mechanism  to do this stuff and store it.  They don't know what they have.  So it's going to be a it's going to be a cluster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As I understand it, the problem with the Google proposal is that  Google wants to effectively get publishers to give it  the right to be an intermediary for the data of their users.  So Google's saying, right, assign us the right to to handle that data  to do to be the party of record for that data, which I don't think.  Makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it makes sense because Google is apart from AppNexus.  Google is the ad server for most every publisher out there.  And it has the infrastructure.  Or by the party.  Yes, exactly.  So it does make sense.  I get that.  But there's all kinds of nuances here and difficulties.  And this is.  Boo, this is not thought through.  And basically, the Google changes came, I think, less than a week ago  was a May 25 deadline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that's one of the big complaints that the publishers group  is is placing upon Google is kind of how dare you make this announcement  so close to the switch over, which is happening in just a little bit  more than a month at this point.  It does feel like they're putting them under the.  Less than a month or less than a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to agree, you know,  you have to agree within two weeks or something bad will happen.  And I think it's important to note  there's a there's a significant  viewpoint that GDPR, I think Jeff kind of got at this GDPR  could actually help  Google and make Google and Facebook more powerful or sort of entrench them  in a way by by kind of building walls around their data.  Companies that could theoretically compete or build up new services  won't be able to do a lot of the things that Google and Facebook  were able to do because GDPR won't let them do it.  But Google and Facebook already have businesses that are, you know, up and running.  They have all that data.  They don't effectively it'll protect them.  And in many cases, make those walls higher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The the paradox here is always that that when you try so right to be forgotten,  Google has too much power.  We must take away their power.  We must erase things that people don't want on the Internet.  Well, who's going to do that? Well, we don't know how to.  So we'll make Google do it.  And Google ends up with more power.  And every time they try this new regulation, they do that.  The publisher I talked to said he's sort of frustrated  because the regulators don't understand the media business.  And I said, it's because the publishers spent so long trying to fight Google.  They didn't explain their own business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And Google, I mean, this is this is how laws work.  And I mean, Google and Facebook had people at the table and publishers did.  But their message was not as unified.  And this is just the way the world works.  So your next innovation is going to have to come after these rules have settled.  And then we're going to start seeing people figure out how to work around them.  And there's there is definitely opportunities here for innovation  around data collection, permissions and that sort of thing.  We just we have to wait just a little bit to see one  how the how these are actually going to be enforced, because that's still  very few countries are talking about how they plan to enforce these rules.  So we've got to see that first.  So don't despair just yet.  This is this is a common cycle in the world.  Just to spare a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, who's going to who's going to die in the meantime is is  I just for those folks, I talked to somebody who said  you really should have kind of tiers of regulation  where the big guys are expected to do the best.  But at the beginning, you give some slack to the little guys  to let them adjust and figure it out or come up with new vendors  or other things to treat them all the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think we're going to see the EU come after the tiny guys.  I really don't.  I mean, they're not going to be able to come after everyone all at once on May 25th.  That's going to be impossible.  They're going to pick and choose who they focus on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I imagine you can't be you can't be assured of that, though.  Right, Stacey, there's no problem as you want surety.  And that's not surety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think any business today who can't adapt and expect surety, they're crazy.  I mean, I it makes me sad.  I would love that.  But I don't think that's a reasonable thing to expect today, especially how fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We know that many organizations are nothing if not adaptable and  quick to evolve.  It's especially a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's and by the way, as far as Cambridge Analytica is concerned,  the new name as far as I can tell is an Amer data or email data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems to be what the emir of data like emir data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One word.  So that'll be the new word that we start hearing every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're now the emir of data.  Are they serious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not emir like M-E-I-R.  They're just M-E-E-R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like emerging. Right.  Emerdata. OK, that that makes more sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, which is a Gaelic name.  Ta-da. Is it so say at the Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google knows all anyway.  The Mercers are going to put their billions somewhere.  So it doesn't matter what it's called. Right. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see here.  So all right. Secure our privacy.  Obviously a big deal, especially with just like the crazy timing of the Cambridge  Analytica announcement anyways, or revelation today.  But what what else about Facebook? Dating?  You mentioned this.  And that's that's fun to talk about.  Match is pretty, pretty upset.  Or maybe they're not.  Publicly, they're not upset, but their stock is not doing very well.  Investors are upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At the moment of the announcement of somebody next to me in the hall  showed me the screen, it was down 17 percent in a flash.  Wow. What's interesting to me about this,  it's kind of what I already presumed Facebook was from the beginning.  And they never they never did it.  And that's what I think it was.  I think it was Chris Cox who said, you know, I already thought  that's what we were, but we kind of never did it.  And they're doing it now.  The interesting thing to me is that.  Facebook has been strictly focusing on introducing you to people,  you're connecting you to people, you know,  and this is an effort to protect the people you don't know.  And at the dating level, they also say that they want meaningful relationships.  So they said, what is more meaningful than, you know, getting married to somebody,  falling in love with somebody, getting married?  And they said, you know, this is not for for hooking up.  This is for relationships.  But that idea of connecting to people you don't know,  I've said on the show many, many times that what I hope for Facebook  is it starts to make strangers less strange.  If this is the start of a new expertise  in an area that's fairly safe and well-trod, I think it's interesting.  Now, of course, on the Internet, everybody's, oh, my God, privacy, Facebook.  The world knows how to do dating, I think, in lots of ways without the newspapers  used to do it for years, where I don't think privacy is trod upon.  They're thinking this through where your friends will not see your profile.  Only people you allow to see your profile will see your profile.  The transaction is obvious.  I think I think this function is obvious.  And plus, they can tie it into things like groups and interests.  And it becomes a lot richer.  And I presume that interests are the right way to find somebody.  You know, it could be that, you know, because right now, how do you  my day, how did you do it?  We happen to like the same bar, you know.  So so what are the commonalities that will bring people together  for a meaningful relationship?  And are they on Facebook? Really interesting to me.  I wonder if this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if this increases the filter bubble in a sense like  dating is one area where you and it's been a long time since I've dated.  So let's let's say that we can't play with this.  I know I'm like, I could, but I think my husband would be upset.  So it's it's an idea where you actually you meet someone  without knowing all that much about them.  And then you go in and you you encounter these bumps in the road  where you're like, oh, my God, this person voted for Trump.  Could I really date someone who voted for Trump?  Oh, but that.  That presumably wouldn't happen on Facebook, but it's kind of a fun.  I mean, that's kind of the interesting part about dating or right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's whether you find other interests that tie you together.  That's the secret to civility is going to be when we stop,  when we get off the Trump v.  Clinton world and start to say, oh, we both like surfing, you know,  and we like literature, we like other things and find other commonalities.  That's special, by the way.  So this is going to be image free for security at the start.  At some point, you obviously connect and meet each other and see each other.  But at the first, this is not about doing the origins of Facebook and the lookbook.  Oh, I wonder if it's a good guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's an inch.  Like, I can't imagine I can imagine women being like hot diggity.  So I guess guys will go where the women are.  But that's that's an intriguing option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really interesting, isn't it?  So you'll have a profile, right?  But you can put whatever you want.  You put your cartoon avatar in there, your your your your Oculus avatar.  Who knows?  But but the you won't be sending back  porty pictures or anything, you'll be talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, people will still send back porty pictures.  Sure. I'm I'm married.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Going to be asking.  There's going to be asking porn.  I mean, there was in the text.  You know, someone will just highly realistic asking for it.  But I have to say, I don't really see this as having a chance in hell of succeeding.  I think this is going to be one of those things that six months from now, Facebook  is going to shut it down and and, you know, it'll it'll die without a ripple.  I just don't see.  This is a company that everyone is talking about privacy and their data.  So now they're everyone.  Matthew, everyone or just us in media.  Everyone, everyone.  Lots of people I talk to mention it.  Normal people, civilians.  And so now they're going to think, you know what I should do?  I should give Facebook a lot of dating information and, you know, my  my sexual proclivities or something or whatever I should.  Is this information that people are going to want to share with Facebook?  I don't think so.  Plus, I'm a those things are perfectly successful.  What what I'm intrigued by putting sexual proclivities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On your dating profile, Matthew, that seems real forward.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As a user, how much of how much of creating that that profile  that that exists outside of your friends profile?  Like, do you build that from the ground up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you build that yourself.  Yeah, that's the thing.  That's what you're doing.  And, you know, of course, there's a big age problem here is because when I  when I was young and single, the only thing you could do then was,  you know, personal's ads in the New York Review of Books.  If you were studying a little actual right.  And there was no such structure.  And young people today, I mean, a couple of a couple of  eyes to meet online, online, online.  Right. There was a stigma about that in the time that went away.  I talked to a woman some years ago who spent seven years in Japan.  And then she came and she did a great blog about being being single.  And then she came back to the US and she was just gobsmacked  about how suddenly that which had had cooties before was now the way to date.  And it changes because when I was involved in  Connie Nast and bridal, yes, I was.  What I learned was that the that the audience for those kinds of things  spins out very quickly.  So the norm can change very quickly.  So when we own brides and modern bride and elegant bride,  we thought we own bridal along came the knot and they stole the market  because they had new functionality in a new way.  So, Matthew, I think it depends strictly on how smart they are and what they add.  People may not like going through match  or may not like going through these services and paying for them, by the way,  was the point.  Now they can do it in a place where they already have some comfort  and some and some other content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in I mean, the key to something like match, according to,  you know, their commercials, is how well they can actually connect people in Facebook.  What will be interesting is how much of the iceberg  you actually create versus what Facebook uses to match you to someone,  because I may say all kinds of things in my dating profile,  but Facebook knows who I really am.  Yeah, it's true. To a certain extent.  And if it finds people based on that versus just what I put on there,  then it becomes really interesting.  And if people do meet their their life partners or whatever in these things,  that's compelling. People will use it.  But I think there's going to be lots of people who don't want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there's going to be lots of people who don't have to opt in.  You know, yeah, they don't opt in.  Yeah, I just think those are going to be the majority of the market.  I don't think Facebook it just it strikes me every time Facebook tries to launch.  I saw a list of the things that it has tried that have failed.  Remember, it had a Groupon clone.  It had a I mean, there's a long list.  And I think every time they try and sort of target a vertical like this,  it seems to fail because people, I think, want to go to a site  or a service that's dedicated to that thing.  They don't want to mix it all in with the other stuff they do on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  However, maybe what's different, maybe what's different with this  versus something like a Groupon clone.  And, you know, we we could, you know, talk about the many different avenues  that Facebook makes money that might be one way.  But when you're talking about Facebook at its core, relationships is like  its biggest selling point.  And this is a very major other aspect of the relationships  that we as human beings enjoy on a daily basis.  So from that perspective, it kind of makes sense to me  that they might actually be really good at this if they're not using  if they're not using the wide range of information  that they've been gathering on users over the course of however many years  to help inform how those matchups happening.  Then I think they're doing it wrong, you know, from their perspective,  because that's the that's the power of the Facebook network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the problem will be obviously that that is where the privacy is going to  it could could. Right.  Is if oh, oh, how did it know that I'm a foot fetish is like you are?  What do we reveal that?  I'm not. But but but yeah, those those moments where you  when you don't know what's going to come out.  So how do they fence off that?  And and but on the other hand, it becomes really interesting.  With enough data, they could make better, longer, lasting marriages.  Right. And we don't know what it will be, why that is,  but they can find that that that AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we might just inherently trust distrust them rather.  We might be like, oh, my gosh, you like weird esoteric thing.  And I like where Facebook, what kind of shenanigans are you pulling  when it's really just natural?  Because, you know, when you there's a name for this,  when you think about something and then you see it everywhere.  So once once you're suspicious, you're going to assume the worst.  Or maybe just we will. What is the name for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Carson, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's that is the Bader Meinhof.  Yes. Yes.  Now you'll notice that in all media for the.  Yeah, you'll see Bader Meinhof.  And you know, it's a big reason why many people probably think  that Facebook is recording them through their through the microphone.  Exactly. Exactly.  It's like once you start seeing it, you see patterns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Talking about this.  And then Facebook showed me an ad.  I don't know. I've had that conversation.  I don't know how many times. Yeah. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it occurred to me.  So I've been doing this project about the moral implications  and and imperatives around some of the decisions being made in this world.  And I had a great interview with my friend, David Weinberger,  one of the co-authors of the Blue Train Manifesto.  And and he was saying that if you're Google or your Wikipedia,  your goal is clear, right?  You're organizing knowledge, one that information one way or the other.  If you're Facebook or Twitter, they weren't clear.  We are with this place where people can come in and talk to us.  I thought about it more.  Data is clean. People are messy.  Everything people do is messy.  And it is not people.  We can't make it clean.  And we've met the enemy and guess who?  And so what we're asking these platforms to do is to clean up human behavior.  Because I don't believe they caused it.  Right there. There there.  We didn't expect the phone company to clean it up.  We do expect Facebook to clean it up.  And that's that's a very tall order because we are messy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is true.  We I actually talk about that in the smart home all the time.  I'm like, you know, we're expecting our houses and our devices in them  to mitigate things that we as people can't even mitigate.  So this is a man. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you also said, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I want to savor that moment. Record.  Oh, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Time we just agreed about a high level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or 0 for one may second.  I don't even know what it is. Call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Stacey, you said data is not clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Data is not clean.  We think it's clean because it's right.  Because we think it's one thing or the other.  But when you start actually trying to apply real world data to things,  you have to convert it to that one thing or the other.  We actually ascribe meaning to our data for the data.  So we declare that a these numbers are going to represent temperature,  for example, just for something easy.  And then we're also we also say we write the algorithms that say  when this happens, this happens.  So data is no cleaner than our world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it is.  It is right up until we interpret it.  I mean, in every case, and this happens with Facebook, too.  The algorithm gathering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, the reproducibility crisis in science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Implementing it. Yeah.  So I was at the technical keynote this morning  and from the end of it was a great I want her name, unfortunately.  I missed it, but I'll get it somewhere.  But she gave a great 20 minute talk on algorithmic responsibility,  on the diversity of the sources of the data, on the biases  in the gathering of the data, on the biases and the impact of what they're doing.  They're trying to show that they are thinking about this.  They have big brains on this.  And then I went to a session about preventing suicide.  You want to get personal, right?  And and it's fascinating how they because they have a responsibility.  Right. And one thing you can say, what a terrible violation.  Let people do what they want to do.  Well, no, they have a responsibility.  If there's something going on under their nose, they want to try to fix it.  And and having weight like election.  Well, yeah, that's that's exactly where they're going.  That's exactly it. Right.  So I'm sure they did quite on purpose to say, you know,  look how we're trying to do use the data responsibly.  But it was it was really fascinating because somebody says,  I have so much homework, I want to go myself.  Well, that'll trigger it.  But then they look at the behavior and obviously the discussion.  Oh, yeah, me too.  I know that I know how you feel the discussion.  They don't want to judge it.  But otherwise, the AI is now faster than the people  and flagging really dangerous ones.  And it's flagged.  I forget the number they had like a thousand of these and thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, thousand actions.  It was a thousand actions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thousand actions, 100,000 something else that they did.  Yeah, a thousand actions taken.  Right. And thank you, Stacey.  And but that gets really close for comfort, too.  I think we would all agree that if you see a suicide potential under your nose,  you should do something about it.  But you can also argue it's invasive as hell.  It's privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just find it this is kind of off topic,  but I find it amazing that in interviews,  Zuckerberg has said a couple of times that for the first 10 years,  10 years, all Facebook was focused on was the positive things that Facebook could do.  And so it's only recently that they've thought, wow, all this stuff could,  you know, actually have negative consequences.  I find that mind boggling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So either that's not true or I think that's what we're supposed to do.  It's incredibly late.  No, I think we're fundamental.  I know I'll put myself in the exact same boat, Matthew.  I'm fundamentally an optimist.  They're going to be an optimist.  I have William said it too, at South by Southwest,  recorded the show before where he said we didn't see the extent of the bad behavior.  The bad behavior does not come from all of mankind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think that's true at all.  I think they did see it and they chose not to pay attention to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's this. I'm going to say it's a little bit more nefarious in the sense that  I think they honestly didn't see it and didn't pay or they saw it.  They didn't pay attention to it because of and I'll say it,  their positions of privilege as a woman looking at a lot of tech services.  I have always brought up the fact that, oh, you know, I had a stalker in college.  This would be a freaking dream for him.  And no one ever pays attention to it because the people building this stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, you're right. You're totally right.  And and let's say they were also they were also focused on growth, right.  And the way to grow is to just get more people on the platform.  And if they're bots or trolls or that's engagement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's another thing, Matthew, and they will never say this  on Facebook again after Zuckerberg said it and got smashed.  He might have been right in his first response to the election when he said,  listen, the amount of fake news stuff was very small  and couldn't have had an impact on the election.  I think that may very well be true.  The actual impact, the actual harm, we don't know.  We don't have good research.  And what we're saying to them as a society is, well, whatever it is,  it's over our tolerance and do something about it and fine.  But the actual impact, you know, when they saw how much bad stuff was happening  or how many Russian ads at first or that kind of stuff in the scale of have,  they didn't think it was necessary to do it.  Here's the number that blew me away, blew me away from the one thing  that blew me away from all of ethics was what Zuckerberg said yesterday.  They kill and he'd used a singular.  And today they used a plural of this.  But he said a million fake accounts a day,  a million fake accounts a day, they catch and kill.  The scale of that is just mind blowing.  So somebody said in the Q&A session, well, when I find the fake account,  I want to report it to you.  They said, fine, please do.  But that doesn't help with our scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the scale of Facebook is impossible to sort of  comprehend to begin with.  I mean, if Zuckerberg says fake news is like one percent,  that's one percent of 800 billion pieces of content  that are uploaded every day or two billion users.  I mean, it's impossible to comprehend the scale that Facebook exists at, I think.  And so maybe it's unfair to expect them to manage that  in a way that you would if it was a lot smaller.  But that's still it's their job.  You know, that's their business.  They're supposed to be doing it.  It's not, you know, I didn't make Mark Zuckerberg create this giant entity.  It's his problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, hold on.  He part of it, absolutely.  But all of society's problems, I think, I think the problem here  is that there's this presumption that they call this society was just fine  before they came along and they screwed it up and they got a fix with that.  And you heard the discussions we had in Perugia, Matthew,  where I had two sessions where I asked people, OK, let's bounce the problems down.  What do we want them to do about it?  And the answers were 180 degrees.  And so as we rarely have that discussion about actual solutions, expectations.  And Jay Rosen is the one who said to me, we've not had this conversation.  We don't have the terms of this conversation.  There's presumption that they're all screwed up and they've got to do something.  But we we haven't what show me the law.  They show me the regulation that says the defines exactly what they screwed up  so we can define exactly what they've got to fix and how we have to have  that conversation. I say, yeah, I agree that it's not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree. But because we haven't had that conversation.  Because because it's on Facebook is unlike anything that ever existed before.  We don't have any terms on which to discuss it or to describe it.  There's never been an entity that had that kind of power before.  And I think that I think the past books could do that, too.  Yes. Right. But I forget.  I forget who it was.  I wish I could remember who used this analogy, but I said I was going to steal it.  They said that I think it might have been Jonathan Albright, actually,  who said that Facebook or social media or whether it was the election  or or the filter bubbles is not that didn't create problems, these problems.  It's it's what he called an accelerant.  So it social media effectively pours fuel on existing  human behaviors and human nature.  And it it metastasizes those.  They they grow faster and and broader than they ever could have before.  That's not so I'm not saying that's their fault.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People people raise two hundred fifty thousand dollars for the hero  of the Waffle House was impossible for people saved other people from suicide.  Facebook started a whole structure for donating blood  because they saw the necessity of a one of the help.  The dystopia of saying that  society is all screwed up is really not about Facebook at all.  It's what you're saying is about us, us messy humans.  And I'm not where I am more optimistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I don't think the dystopic view or the utopian view are.  I mean, the truth obviously is somewhere in the middle.  The Internet, social media, the web effectively enable all  all the good aspects of human nature and all the bad aspects of human nature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Data is not clean. Humans are messy.  I see this is all going to be on the exam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lots of 101.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. I've got those bullets on my sheet.  Oh, good discussion there, you guys.  What about I feel like there were there was like a whole laundry list  of announcements from Facebook.  We probably don't need to go into all of that.  At the top of the list, we're just talking about what are some of the other things

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that really quickly I think a group calling comes to more of  more of their platforms.  The AI enabled  AR stuff comes to the platform.  They're just expanding this stuff now.  They're proud of WhatsApp.  You know, I think I think one thing that we in America have a huge blindspot  about is the use of WhatsApp elsewhere in the world.  And as as the largest encrypted network out there,  where bad things, by the way, are happening, we are in Colombia and India  and other countries, hates being spread there.  And it's an issue. But also safety is possible there.  But anyway, fun is now there, too, because you can put a mustache  on somebody's face. Finally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I've seen that before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, that's probably that was a great line from from from Zuckerberg,  where he puts some pictures on his face.  He said, my daughter loves seeing this.  Oh, look, that is a buddy.  That is an ogre.  It's just like reading about it in the press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually liked I liked it when he introduced the the watch features  so you can watch something with somebody.  And he said, let's say your friend is testifying before Congress  and you want to watch them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice. What about this 3D stuff?  I didn't catch this in the in the presentation, but love 3D.  Yeah. No kidding.  Turning your feed into 3D, but taking still photographs  and obviously applying the, you know, the the machine learning,  the neural networks to it and then 3D 3D  of finding them in your feed, that kind of looks pretty cool.  Right. Depends on this. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the tech in the tech keynote,  they showed how they just take multiple images from two cameras  and then just use that to create a different kind of image.  And then when you're going to view in a more immersive state,  you get a different view of it.  I think I think there's two camera stuff because we talked about the show before  with phones starting to have two cameras and the stereopic possibilities of that.  I think we're going to see a lot more 3D photography  created through AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think this is a chance.  This is an effort to make the two billion dollars or so  that it's spent on Oculus payoff, because the biggest  the biggest issue for a 3D is, well, there's several.  There's there's a lot that they've got to do.  They've got to create the devices that are capable of viewing it.  And then they've got to create stuff that's worth viewing.  So being able to jumpstart one side of that market  so they can get the other one makes sense, because Facebook,  Facebook is very like Mark Zuckerberg seems to sincerely believe in VR.  I don't meet a lot of people who sincerely believe in VR.  So I think this is just another example to try to push that.  And yeah, more powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Remember when Bill Gates loved pen computing?  Remember when the future was going to be pen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, that's exactly what this feels like.  Like, all right, keep going, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or maybe he cares about VR because he spent two billion dollars on Oculus  and he kind of has to care until maybe they figure out a way  that they don't need to care anymore.  Or he could be he could be incredibly forward thinking in five, ten years from now.  VR actually is a big deal because the technology is advanced and they were there first.  I remember the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but the iPhone, the iPhone came out  when all of these tech things aligned in a form factor that was great.  And then they came out with an app developer program that created  demand that continued to push that engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  VR is all of those things together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. The tech isn't even ready for VR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, this is so Stacy, they showed this morning.  You're right. You're absolutely right.  And that's the way they position it.  They say here are the milestones we need and they're huge.  And they're going to take a lot of time.  So they don't they show the hardware, Stacy, where because you're in  like, I guess, is 10 feet radius of focal length.  And you want to look, you get your hands, you're going to look at something close.  It's out of focal.  They're showing actually physically moving the screen in the viewer  as you do that, as you look up at something right.  Wacky stuff.  But you're because you're right, Stacy.  They know how far away this is from usable.  And I'm going to agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm getting vertigo just listening to you describe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know I'm like, oh, my God, I don't I hate VR.  I never feel safe.  Yeah. Like unless I'm in my home.  Like every time I'm trying these on it shows, I'm just like, God,  someone is going to come up and run.  I'm just afraid someone's going to like, like, I don't know.  What is it when they they lick their finger and they stick it  like in your ear on your neck or I just feel like someone's going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Really, you're afraid of that specifically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just hate the idea of someone coming up and being in my personal space  without me being aware of them.  It's like anathema to everything I've been taught.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My problem is every VR thing I've ever tried has made me physically ill.  So unless they can figure out some way that, you know, it won't.  I guess it's just a problem I have.  Lots of other people seem to think it's great.  But I'm much more interested in augmented reality.  I'd much rather have data, you know, popping up as I'm looking at things  or or sort of entering reality with me.  I don't necessarily want to go into a whole separate environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Me, too. I'm a VR optimist, even though even though what I've seen  you know, little bits and pieces, I'm like, oh, that was really cool.  But it never lives up to like my dream, my hopes, you know,  from as far back as watching Lawn Mower Man back when I was younger.  You know, that like set the stage for me for this like immersive world  that you can kind of go to and lose yourself in.  And we're kind of there with VR, but it still feels like early days.  I still totally believe that we will get there some way some day  and that we're very early on at this point.  I don't know how important it's going to be, but it'll be cool.  We got there. People still companies will still be  developing it and figuring out how to make it immersive,  because that's a that's a big wall to break down.  It's a big barrier, you know, to look at this like flat surface  to an immersive environment.  I don't think we're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at the early days of look at the early days of photography or,  you know, how horrible everything was and how long it took.  And I'm sure lots of people thought this photography stuff is dumb.  Like, it's not really looks stupid.  It takes hours to take a photograph.  No one smiles, you know, because it takes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they have forgot about this.  So when I did try it out for briefly this morning, because for the show,  because I do everything show  the business model really struck me. I forgot this.  So this is only 200 bucks, hundred and nine bucks.  All of those have done, you know, that's fine. Right.  Well, you want to use this or that like the first software purchase  about what he uses. Forty dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm. Is it like a very high price console model?  Like a gaming console model? Oh, I know.  You buy the console.  The games are like 50 or 80 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Prices are high. Yeah.  So that's becomes a becomes a I see.  I'm old enough, Stacey. I'd call it a razor model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, fair enough. Right.  Still use those.  I was going to add the one thing that VR has going for it  or that could really change the scales in a big way for VR  is if we utterly destroy the planet, because then you actually.  I'm serious.  I mean, it's like the most.  It's special today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is a good chance.  You know, already, player one happening. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Ready, player one. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's you got the at least an element of the plot point right there.  I don't think that's a spoiler anyways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which I actually lives in Austin, Ernest Klein, the author.  He lives in my neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In the trailer park like that. No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a nice neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm curious to check out Oculus Go.  I didn't realize it was based on on Android.  It's running Android Nougat underneath.  So which makes me wonder, like when you're pricing,  it's like this this these the sliding scale between what we've had  with Daydream VR, which is totally mobile VR.  This is a step up because you don't need the phone to slide into it.  It's all standalone.  Google's also working on a standalone VR, but it's not quite premium,  like a full blown Oculus Rift. There's no room tracking.  It's all in the goggles meant to be sat down  while doing the experience and everything.  And I just don't like I don't know if that's worth it.  Is that worth two hundred dollars? I guess we'll find out.  I guess, Jeff, you'll find out and let us all know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let us know. I I'd say that it's the right question.  I mean, is VR part of what we're saying in the show is VR worth anything?  And and to a great extent, am I going to go out of my way to get VR? No.  Yeah. Right. We're geek people.  We do this. But then I saw plenty of people lined up for the demos.  But it's their geeks.  Sure. The phone is a limiter.  It's it is it is a clumsy thing to get the damn thing going and get it in there.  And then it goes off and it does this and does that.  And having it all is a necessity.  The phone was a step toward this.  I think this is where this goes down.  And so if you want VR, yeah, I think you'll buy a container.  I think that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think it might be I mean, oh, go in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I keep saying this, but I think there's going to be a lot of people who  are interested in VR for specific purposes, whether it's education or medical or,  you know, let's say you're housebound because you're quadriplegic or I mean,  VR, really good VR could be something incredibly liberating.  Good 3D could be incredibly liberating.  So it might not necessarily be a mass thing where everybody you see  is wearing an Oculus or a Magic Leap or whatever.  But it could certainly find markets, I think, where it's applicable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I talked to somebody who's at Johns Hopkins, the hospital.  They're one of the he's a.  Innovation guy, so they actually created a program  where they while people are doing chemotherapy, which takes a while,  or dialysis, they send they put VR goggles on them and then they send volunteers  out to like the Washington monument and they like video and they go places  on behalf of that's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can share. And that's a great idea.  I would actually pay money for that.  Like if you were stuck in a situation like that, you know, that'd be a huge  like something that would change your life in a way.  Seeing, let's say you're bedridden.  You could walk around Rome virtually or you could walk around Paris virtually.  That'd be a massive improvement in your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah. Interesting stuff.  Facebook, F8, any final thoughts before we venture into Google News?  We've we're about halfway through, so probably should get some Google News.  I thought it was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We didn't mention this, but I thought it was interesting that  that young can't remember his last name who started WhatsApp has left.  Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was hoping to get some opinion on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was it Coombs?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Yon LaCoon was there.  Their AI dude. He's gone.  Oh, OK. The founder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. What is his name?  I'm looking for it.  Yeah. Yeah. Young, young Coombs.  Yeah, Coombs. Yeah, it is. OK.  And if he and if he leaves now versus hanging on a little bit longer,  giving up a billion dollars, giving up a billion dollars, which says something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But he's got a bunch.  I suppose so. Yeah.  But it was interesting that it's a billion.  Yeah. Yeah. What's a billion?  The reason he gave was that Facebook is going to start using WhatsApp data,  basically blending data, which which he understood was not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so he felt that when it encrypted, that's what I don't understand.  If they brag constantly, the Facebook, the WhatsApp is end to end encrypted.  So your messages are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can you pull your messages are, but not your profile data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, your profile data and what about your phone, like location data,  that sort of thing associated?  I mean, you're not encrypted.  I don't know what's encrypted.  So like knowing that I'm using WhatsApp would be at in where I am  would be very interesting, especially to authorities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For Yon to give up a billion dollars to leave Facebook.  And also, it was, you know, thanks for your service.  Glad to see you later. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'll let the Facebook door hit you on the way out.  You know, we will.  Let's take a break.  Then we'll come back and we'll check in on some of the top Google news from the week.  We got Google I.O. literally right around the corner.  So we can kind of talk about what we think we're going to see there and everything.  But before we do that, let's thank the sponsor of this episode.  I've been drinking the coffee that is the sponsor of this episode, Trace Pontus.  I've been drinking their coffee for a while.  My mornings have never been as amazing as they are with Trace Pontus.  It is such good coffee. We're brewing it every morning.  I have a new ritual right now, by the way, where I wake up at five thirty  every single morning, my alarm goes off at five thirty.  I get up, I meditate while I'm meditating.  My coffee's brewing.  When I'm done, it's the first thing that I do afterwards.  And my morning starts off right. It's pretty awesome.  You've heard of single origin coffee, but Trace Pontus takes it to another level.  Their coffee comes from a single family farm.  The race family coffee farm, it's located near the town of Trace Pontus in Brazil.  The Trace Pontus mountain range is famous for growing some of the best coffee beans  in the world for over 100 years and three generations.  The race family has been growing some of the best premium gourmet coffee in Brazil.  And this is the first time that they've ever exported their coffee to the US.  The coffee beans are roasted to order. They're shipped out immediately.  Every bag of beans has the roasted date printed.  So, you know that your coffee is fresh and you can see it right down  on the bottom of this package right here.  You can see it was especially roasted for us on April 11th, 2018.  That's printed on the bag.  So, you know what you get.  And you can learn more about where your coffee originated  if you use a QR scanning app here.  I'll try and do this on the stream without reflection.  I scan the QR code. Come on, grab it.  You got it. Grab it.  My scanner is not working, apparently.  Let me try this again.  It's the scanner, to be honest, there's a million of these.  There we go.  And it's going to pull it up on Google Maps and show you exactly  where this coffee came from. Isn't that awesome?  It launches a Google Earth satellite image of the exact farm  where this coffee was born, where this coffee was brought to life.  And you've got the awesome coffee inside.  You can go ahead and unwrap this.  I actually have to cut into it in order to get to the beans here,  which I want to do because I really enjoy the waft of  of the smell of coffee.  Apparently, I can't use scissors.  There we go.  Looking good in there. That smells awesome.  There's a huge difference between drinking coffee  that's been freshly roasted versus coffee  that's been sitting on grocery shelves for weeks.  Trace Pontes only uses 100 percent Arabica beans,  certified non GMO and certified kosher, picked by hand,  roasted by hand in small batches, pulped natural, processed naturally.  It's not washed.  And then you'll get freshly roasted beans sent to you every one,  every two or four weeks.  So you can kind of get on a shipping schedule.  Twelve ounce bags in both whole and ground coffee.  Personally, you probably want to get whole and then grounded yourself.  That's how you keep it as fresh as possible.  Light, medium, dark and French roast and free shipping in the US.  I've been drinking it throughout the course of this show.  And it's just great coffee. You got to check it out.  Sign up for a subscription.  You can save 10 percent off every bag of coffee.  Our listeners here on this week in Google get an extra 10 percent off  when you visit Trace Pontes dot com slash twig and use the code twig.  T W I G.  This means you get a total of 20 percent off every bag of coffee  in your subscription. And don't forget about mom.  This is actually a perfect Mother's Day gift.  Mother's Day is right around the corner.  A couple of weeks away.  Freshly roasted coffee subscription makes a great gift for Mother's Day.  Send her the gift of coffee.  I think she'd probably appreciate that.  You can also order on Amazon,  but you'll only get the 20 percent of every bag  off every bag of coffee in your subscription when you visit Trace Pontes dot com slash twig  and use the code T W I G.  And we thank Trace Pontes for their support.  And I thank them for waking me up every single morning.  It's a really great and you should check it out.  All right. Google News.  We are almost Google I.O. Eve.  It starts a little bit earlier this year instead of starting on a Wednesday.  It starts next Tuesday morning with a keynote.  And I know it's right around the corner of those of us on this show.  Who who will be roaming the the fields of Shoreline Amphitheater?  And 50 50 percent can't hear you.  Do you have them muted?  That's right. We had we had you muted.  Sorry about that. Oh, OK.  No, not me. No, no.  OK. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll be roaming the fields of Microsoft Build at the Seattle Convention Center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Because there's kind of a there's kind of a big  keynote collision going on. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, Jason, you know whether you and I can join into the afternoon  tweet from there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question. I think Twig is it shifting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to do it on Tuesday.  I mean, I think we're going to shift to Tuesday.  We do it from.  Can we do it from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Carson is yelling at me. Yes.  So. Oh, good. Good. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You should tell everybody who's watching the show now  when we're actually going to have it, because I'm curious to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So we're having that on Tuesday.  I should have prepared this because I'm not remembering it off the top of my head.  Do you do you have a time after the heat?  There we go. Carson says Tuesday at 1130.  Thank you, Carson. 1130.  30 Pacific.  What? They won't be done early.  Oh, the keynote is when the keynote show.  Oh, I see. Immediately following the keynote or as soon as we can get our act  together after the keynote. OK.  It was earlier. Right.  Yeah, because the keynote starts at like nine or something like that.  That morning, it's going to extend as long as it does.  We are going to have live coverage on the on the network of the keynote.  Stacey, you're going to be there for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm hmm. No, I built.  OK, I'm going to be interviewing.  I'm actually interviewing the creator of the Misty to personal robot.  Woo. Oh, I'm excited.  That launch today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have not heard about the Misty to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you look at it.  It's way better than Misty one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the electric Boogaloo sequel.  So Google, I know we're definitely going to hear about Android P, the next version.  We've got the developer preview one out.  I'm still using it.  And I have to say, I mean, I'm using it on my daily phone.  You know, it's it's my Pixel 2 XL.  No backup.  And I've really encountered very few issues since they launched this developer preview.  So it can only go up from here.  And, you know, we'll hear more about that.  We've got anything particularly good in it in what we have right now.  I mean, kind of the design touches are, you know, kind of nice.  You got the little breakout volume, which I actually use a lot  when I'm connected to Bluetooth.  It like breaks out and I can jump right into a Bluetooth connection.  Sorry, let me move my coffee.  But yeah, I mean, you know, just in general, I'm enjoying it.  Some of some of the stuff that they do in navigation or sorry,  in the notifications, kind of grouping things is is kind of nice.  You've got a lot of the the different design touches, you know,  different changes that make it almost look a little like a third party launcher stuff.  But but yeah, so far so good material design.  Well, yeah, I mean, that's going to be a big part of what we're going to  what we're going to find out.  There's a lot of different redesigns, including the Gmail app  or the Gmail desktop app that that got its big design overhaul last week  that are showing a very consistent new UI  style that's close to what we've expected from the legacy material design,  but adding a bunch of new things like oblong pill shaped  fab buttons and, you know, very white open layout,  very particular type of font that matches the Google font, things like that.  So I have a feeling we're going to see a lot and also an explanation around  what material design the sequel is. And  and kind of how developers can use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So can I ask you a public service question, Jason?  Sure. How do I get the new Gmail design on my Google apps account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google apps account.  So when should I expect that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I've been like waiting for this and I'm like, bring it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you go into the setting?  I don't know, because I haven't tried it on my apps account.  But can you go into Gmail?  And there's the little gear setting.  If you go in there, if you have the ability to switch to it right now,  there should be a try the new layout or the new UI.  Yeah, not on apps.  And I grow up slowly.  I turn from what I understand.  It was either tasks or it was Gmail.  But from what I understand, they made this available to apps users  is just that the administrator needs to allow for it prior to you getting access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am the administrator.  OK, then it might be tasks and not Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Stacey. No, it's the problem I go through with with Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't tell me that this is the same problem.  I refuse to hear it, Jeff.  I will get off and find I need another.  I'm going to bet it's the same problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Administrator rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, I'm just going to give up.  I'm giving up on Google apps. I really am.  I'm sick of this.  I want my email from work to work with all of my Google stuff in a dozen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't feel like a lot to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, and it's not a lot to ask.  I'm sure it's on someone's to do list, you know, to fix.  What is this doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What happened, Jeff? Did you just go portrait?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, yes, I don't know how.  Now I can't get back.  I'm going to have to call it is the new landscape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're such a portrait rebel that you do portrait, but sideways.  Just now you need to lay down to do the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can rotate the monitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, Jeff, you go ahead and give us a call back.  Maybe that'll fix the problem.  OK, we'll do.  Some of the other things, apparently,  assistant slices, which is a way to kind of bring app  functions into notifications similar to like smart replies.  You know how those have started to appear in notifications.  And I can't remember if that's an Android P thing or if that's also on earlier  versions, but slices would bring other functionality from apps  into there so that you don't have to go into the app and, you know,  waste all that valuable time of yours doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I just noticed something else.  So I just first the reason the reason I went sideways is because I was signing  into my other account and it was asking me to verify and I'm on my tablet.  So it was doing an Android thing. Right. Sorry.  So I'm in my other my Gmail account on inbox.  It is lost. The switch.  It's lost the switch to Gmail button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It ain't there. Do you find that?  I feel like I went to the left column.  Yeah, I feel like I went digging one time for that and I was able to find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I could but I can just go to the outcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, inbox side left side panel, go to the bottom.  There's a settings button.  Click that and then go into other  and you will probably find redirect Gmail to inbox dot Google dot com.  Checked uncheck that first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First, I have a wizard with a sword and a bucket in front of me.  I had to figure out how to get through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry. Oh, lucky you.  You found the dragon.  Where the dragon?  I've been looking for the wizard for so long and you just happened upon the wizard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, Stacey, I can't get to on my apps account.  I can't get to it either.  And God knows how we're going to get to it. Oh, well, that's disappointing.  You know what, Stacey?  It's just it's just telling you you should use inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, well, no, I'm going to go back to my admin console and see if I can do it,  because I've got it on my my personal thing and I love the calendar feature.  Yeah, I know.  We'll probably talk about this last week, but I'm just like  embedded calendar and there is nice.  I agree. It makes it more like outlook of like 10 years ago, which is  actually was like the definitively awesome professional email program.  Come at me, guys. Come at me.  I will not lie. It was amazing.  All right. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I hope that you are able to get access to the new Gmail,  although in my week of using both of them, like I've I'm basically just using inbox  still like it's hard for me to to switch over to Gmail, even even with all the changes.  It's nice, but it's just I'm so used to inbox.  Apparently we're going to see or I'm guessing smart displays.  We've been hearing about these for a little while.  I can't wait to buy it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am ready to shell out money for one of these.  That is that is what I have to tell you guys after CES.  It's a it's like the Amazon Echo show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or, you know, it's like a Google home with a screen, essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  FaceTime. That's that's cheap enough.  They might give us one. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's I mean, they're like, too.  I think the Lenovo was at Lenovo had a bit.  The big one was 200.  I think the smaller one was 150.  So I would love that.  I mean, because right now you can get some interesting functionality  through your Chromecast with like your Google Nest  cams or your Nest Hello doorbell.  But like having kind of a screen you can just go to and see, I cannot wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So our ours, Tecnica says it's probably not coming in time for I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so here's a yeah.  And I saw that Ronam audio has a really great walkthrough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, don't shoot the messenger.  You're a party pooper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, shoot Ronam audio.  He's the one that's saying that.  It's a really great walkthrough.  What I wonder is that maybe we will see it to some degree,  not that it would be released there, but maybe we will see it to some degree,  because apparently these smart displays and that platform  relies on Android things, Android things, by the way,  two years in on the developer preview still has not had an official release.  There's eight sessions of Android things at Google I.O.  this year, which makes you wonder, OK, so are they focusing more on it  because there will be a big major release?  And if these are these are based on that, we already know they exist.  They showed them off at CES like maybe this is the coming out party.  We might get a date. Yeah.  Yeah. They'll show them. Right. Yeah.  Totally. Let you play with Kevin and I are hopeful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We we've actually wanted to send Kevin to I.O.  just so he could attend these and try to figure out what the heck is happening.  Part of it is probably tied up in the Nest reorg is my hunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So that's a little messy and complicated for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He also mentions Ron mentions a mid range pixel phone.  That would be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that's that's a rumor that we've been hearing is that there's  a potential potentially a mid range pixel.  I just don't see I.O. is the place where they do that.  Like, yeah, it seems like their hardware announcements from the smartphone side  of things is usually left to near the end of the year, October is time frame.  Yeah. Maybe we hear about it.  I really doubt that they would they would release anything then.  But maybe we hear about those efforts. Yeah.  Flutter SDK slash Fuchsia, their kind of  experimental operating system that we keep hearing about little pieces  of information over the course of the last couple of years.  Everybody scratching their head, wondering, like, what is Fuchsia?  Is this like the the buildup of a replacement for Android or for Chrome OS?  And apparently, you know, they what did I see?  Art Android runtime.  They've built in built Fuchsia with ART support.  So that suggests Android app support on Fuchsia.  So it's very confusing.  I think this time last year, we were also thinking,  we're going to hear about Fuchsia Google and that didn't happen.  So it's probably not going to happen this year either.  We're probably a few years out on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are they trying to get off Linux or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I want to have their own.  That's a good question.  No one really knows, but they know this exists and Google has, you know,  really, I mean, somebody put installed it on a Pixelbook not too long ago.  So it exists is just not 100 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll I'll say this that that so I'm talking to you right now on my tablet,  which being an Android device works really well across lots of things  on Android, on Chrome still ain't there.  Yeah.  By my Netflix and Showtime and that kind of stuff doesn't really work.  Some other stuff doesn't really work.  It's it's really rough.  They do need, I hope, an integrated operating system across all possible  platforms, and I'm guessing that's what they're trying to do.  That's just trying to start to explore  that because I know how complex it is and how much retrofitting would be needed.  Right.  What that frees up in the future to not be to have a wall between platforms or to  have this clue, just as it's a clever conclusion, they do a pretty good job  with it, but it is far from fault free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is kind of interesting.  Flutter SDK is the app platform for Fuchsia.  There are six sessions devoted to the Flutter SDK at Google I.O.  And Flutter SDK, from what I understand,  is more or less, you know, it's it's obviously it's an SDK for developers,  but it's really geared for writing something one time and having it appear  on both Android and iOS, probably doing a horrible job of describing that.  But this idea of building one thing and having it be compatible with multiple  systems, including in this case, the Fuchsia operating system,  Ronam Audio and Inars Technica pointed out, maybe this is laying the groundwork  for a big transition that happens somewhere down the line, maybe 2020, 2021.  And this is a really great way to get  developers kind of working on that now so that when that transition happens,  there's support for it, you know, but that's a lot of guessing.  So we'll see what happens there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you see, sorry, someone in the chat room mentioned that someone at Google is  working on a social gaming startup. Did you see that?  Yes, absolutely. That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That actually seemed to drop shortly before showtime.  A startup, a gaming startup, and they're working on an,  I don't know if it's the app or the division is called Arcade.  I think it's the division called Arcade,  led by Michael Saman, who actually began at Facebook as an intern at 17 years old.  He's now 21 years old.  So, you know, he's all grown up.  He moved on to Google and he's working.  Senior executive. Yes, exactly.  Working as part of Area 120, which is one of their experimental  divisions on this social gaming startup.  Their initial app is a trivia app that's slated for the summer sometime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It seems like a natural way to go.  I mean, I see, you know, even things like Word with Friends,  Words with Friends, lots of people are obsessed with games like that.  Playing them socially, it seems like a  natural area for particularly for Facebook, but also for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know, we could we could go for another Farmville.  Social gaming experience.  Fortnite, Fortnite, Fortnite.  That's probably more like it.  But yeah, that's cool.  We also let's see here.  What else? Android Auto.  There's there's some information in the  rundown that shows that they're going to be showing off Android Auto and some sort  of a new media experience in Android Auto.  Who knows what that means?  I hope we find out about chat, which is the RCS  universal profile powered kind of chat thing that we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google killed.  What did it kill last week?  It killed something. Aloe, Aloe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was Aloe.  It didn't actually kill it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. But I mean, it's not going anywhere anymore.  They took all the right.  The people working on it and redirected them to chat.  OK, so it's still technically exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just I just have to know which of the eight Google messaging things I can do.  For my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Remember when Hangouts was going to be sunset and then all of a sudden it's still

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  here. Yeah, I love Hangouts.  I'm going to be so sad when that goes away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But is it going to go away or will it just continue but not be supported?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They will all continue and not be supported.  That's just kind of the way it goes, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe looking at the schedule, it is going back to its roots.  It's very developer.  They live on some of the dumb outsiders in the past.  This is this is purely for developers, which is good.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love the developer sessions.  I think they're so rich in content and I don't know.  I just I love it.  I hate when they get all normal for people.  I'm like, you can just read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Muggles. Who wants Muggles at I.O.?  For anyone paying for the conference.  I mean, what is the value proposition for someone to drop in and be, you know,  and sit through a product announcement like it really doesn't make a whole lot  sense. They go there because they want to walk away with a with a leg up over  everyone else that wasn't there. And that's that's why you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They wouldn't drop in, Jason. They would hang out.  Oh, drop in belongs to the Amazon ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dang, I'm getting my ecosystems confused.  I apologize.  Yeah, I don't know.  Is there anything that you guys are hoping that you see at I.O.  outside of this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm like, I want the screen.  I would like I mean, I would like the update on Android things.  I would like actually to see a little bit more on Weave,  but that's just my IOT self speaking.  But yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're hearing I thought I muted you.  We're hearing a couple of other things because Google, this is like the pre I.O.  time period where Google's like, we got to get this out before I.O.  so that we have something to refer to and be like last week we told you about.  We're getting those now, starting with  Google, who's investing in early stage startups that are focused on integrating  assistant into the business, they're providing not only money,  but support, early access to features, tools, Google Cloud Platform Access,  Google Marketing and developers can sign up via form if you're interested.  They're they're targeting this at startups  that are at a stage where this money actually makes a difference.  So they're not looking to to do this sort  of partnership with the really big, big companies out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I noticed that I don't know if this is in the rundown, but someone again in the  chat room posted that Google's working on a transcription of podcasts so that they  can index that information, that would be hugely useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of.  That'll be awesome.  But sorry, as a podcast person who I get  transcripts of my guest interviews, not the whole thing, I'm a little concerned  because Google has that now.  I mean, I guess it's good for indexing.  Never mind. It's only a good thing.  I won't be why wouldn't it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why wouldn't it be good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Depending on how they use it, are they going to send it back to me?  I really want, you know, my ultimate goal as, quote unquote, a media company is to  get people's email addresses so I know who's listening to me, who is who is  reading my content and the only way I can do that is to have people opt in.  I mean, that's the only way I want to do it is to have people opt in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But let's put it this way, if I was searching for Internet of Things stuff,  Google was indexing your podcast, your podcast would come up and I would see it  in my search and be like, that's interesting.  I should go sign up for that and listen to it.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it is it is a good thing because I know and this is why I started  transcribing my guest interviews is because a lot of stuff is said on the show  that even news is broken on the show, but people don't realize it because they're so.  Yeah. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think if you don't like I don't have as much time to listen to podcasts because I  don't drive and I don't yeah, I never go in my room and I just don't have a time  where I've kind of carved out that I can listen to podcasts and I would love to  like the ones that do post transcriptions are hugely useful to me because I can skim  them, lots of them I go back to.  That's the main way that I consume that type of content.  So if it's not transcribed, I miss the whole thing, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you ought to be podcast on the on the boat, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The boat in the kayak can you can you casks?  I could do that.  But usually I'm just listening to the bird can you cast for connects?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should do a podcast in the kayak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like the little rippling water in the background.  Yeah, yeah. Very peaceful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You lose.  Do you lose a little?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course they have loons. It's Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They wouldn't it would be noisy  interrupting a podcast, but it would be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really like the name Canoe Casts for Canucks.  There you go.  As the title of your trade market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's probably the show that I've ever done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or you could do the canuck or the canuck canoe cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there you go. Can you cast?  Can you cast?  Oh, boy. OK.  Any good ideas? So many.  Yeah. Just take your pick.  Whatever you don't use is the title of today's show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That you apologize for going off cupping, not knowing that's what we we are here to  do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the M.O.  Another thing that we might be hearing that we are hearing, and I'm sure it's  ahead of I.O. for a reason, a big update launching for Google Maps API platform  begins with a new name, Google Maps Platform is what it's now called.  New features for businesses who are looking to embed maps into their products.  The example that they give is like your  ride sharing companies that need that want to integrate turn by turn into their  ride sharing apps. So Google's turn by turn.  You don't have to switch between the Lyft app and Google Maps or whatever,  whatever you're doing good for managing fleets, as it were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's one put that on the Tesla, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just got the update on the Tesla.  Smarter navigation. The voice is different.  The navigation is slightly better, but still,  I try I trust Google Nav way better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Does the Tesla Nav do the smart kind of like traffic analysis and be like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it does. It has a tie in with Waze.  So it does do that now.  That's nice. But  I probably should upgrade from the 3G modem in mind.  Oh, Mother's Day going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There you go.  I have this ongoing battle with a friend who claims that Google Maps is terrible  and Waze is fantastic, but I'm not.  I agree with your friend, Matthew.  But wouldn't Waze data incorporated into Google Maps?  Like, don't they mean they actually reverse it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's more Waze data than Google Maps.  Google Maps UI. I do not like nearly as well as Waze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I know the UI is not as good. I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's other? Why are you defending Google Maps over Waze then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just so used to it, I guess.  I'm used to the crappy UI.  And so it's true through your friend under the bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now you're coming around and saying your friend's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He can stand up for himself.  That'll teach your friend.  Yeah, I don't like him that much.  You're Canadian. Apologize to him.  Apologize.  So his point is that the directions are significantly qualitatively better.  But how can they be better if it's the same data effectively?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I think that's why like the UI is all that.  We're all like, oh, data is awesome.  But no, no, it's what you do with the data that counts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought it was fascinating.  I don't know if you guys talked about this on other shows, but there was an article  about how Waze and I guess Google Maps driving apps are pushing people on to  secondary and tertiary streets and they're causing chaos in small  neighborhoods because Waze will tell you, you know, get off the freeway and go  and take this side street.  And then all this traffic pours onto these streets that aren't used to it.  And so people in what were formerly quiet neighborhoods are seeing  lines of Waze drivers basically plowing through their neighborhood.  Yeah, I just thought it was fascinating  that kind of the way that those apps are changing  our behavior and kind of changing the way cities function.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I've read articles similar to this.  I haven't read this particular one, but it is very interesting how right Google Maps.  I use Google Maps.  I don't use Waze. Apparently I have to use Waze.  But how Google Maps will route me and I trust it.  And then I realize I get there faster.  But so many times I'm following that path and I'm thinking about that.  Like if it's directing me to go this way, to avoid that traffic,  it's directed many people before me and many people after me.  How does that impact this neighborhood?  Because sometimes you're driving through neighborhoods.  It's like, and that is the benefit.  I mean, the benefit is taking that stress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're all our road system, right?  Yeah, and I mean, there's theoretically alternative benefits for that neighborhood.  They might not like having all the traffic go through,  but it might save the highway from getting congested.  So there's an overall benefit.  But I could definitely see neighborhoods  bitching about, oh, this Waze traffic, clogging up our side streets.  For sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do.  And we talked about this a couple of weeks ago on the show with, I think,  an L.A. street that was really steep, but I will say I have been in the car  following the directions and had them change as the cars backed up,  which was kind of cool.  So the rerouting, it's not even rerouting.  It's like, oh, now I've got this option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's cool.  The interesting thing to me is when the latency is an issue, as with any of this  data, and so I was driving on the highway, it started to get clogged up.  Waze said, get off, go down the service road.  By the time I got off and got on the service road,  the thing that had clogged up the highway was cleared and now it's stuck on a  service road and I had to get back on the highway.  So whereas if I had waited 30 seconds or a minute,  I probably would have been better off.  But at that moment in time, getting off  onto the service road was the best option.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have two wishes.  One.  Sorry. Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I was just going to say this is why I want my car to open the sunroof,  launch a drone so I can see what's happening overhead and then come back to me  with information. So that's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mama, I want my car to open up the sunroof and have the helicopter  propellers rise up and I can fly over it myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll take the drone, though. That would be cool.  Jeff, what were you going to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I have two wishes.  One is when I get in the car and Waze or Google Maps doesn't know which way I'm  pointing, let me just point the point to say this way.  I'm pointing this way because then I start driving.  Oh, no, I thought you were going the other way.  And you get around and around and around.  Oh, that's so annoying.  It's got to be solved. It's got to be solved.  Second, Google Maps and walking really sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Really?  I cannot calibrate my compass and GPS properly for that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and that's a problem in cities for sure.  Because I do the figure eights till my arm falls off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, Jeff, are you sure you don't want a third wish and that's for the drone to go  out and fly and tell you what's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would take the drone for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's where Amazon comes in and wins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Amazon's not going to talk to my Google gear.  This is an important issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what the Amazon drone does is it comes over to your sunroof and delivers  you a burrito while you're waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Or Amazon is going to give you a car  for free if you just deliver five packages on the way to where you're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or if you let strangers pick up their packages in your trunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would do that. Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. Yeah.  The future is freaking cool.  I love the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I should ask anyone because this isn't really for this show.  But what the heck?  Amazon Prime cost increase.  We're all for it.  We're all still going to continue with Prime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want my new master.  Yeah, I'm a prisoner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Still cheap, cheap at the price.  Actually, I saw an analysis somewhere.  Somebody said that in order for Amazon to even break even on Prime, it would have to  be two hundred dollars plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, my little my little reminder that comes up right.  It actually came up right before that announcement was made.  It was like, by the way, you saved three hundred and something dollars on Prime.  Like, oh, thanks, Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just kind of assumed with Prime like, yes, I use it a lot and we all use it a lot.  But I assumed it's kind of like the gift certificate approach, right?  Like you pay for the prime, but you don't really know throughout the course  of the year what your usage actually adds up to.  So there's going to be a large percentage of people that pay more than what they  would have used regardless.  And it kind of helps make up for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they subsidize everybody else.  Right. Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see here.  Other Google News of note has nothing to do with I.O.  I think we're out of the I.O. section.  We have one little tiny note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's after we all dissed ARV earlier.  Note that that number one in I.O.  there is a whole session on immersive experiences.  ARV are the future of the web that they're still flying the flag.  And they're investing in YouTube is investing in a bunch of VR content.  They're still these guys are all trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're still trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ten something we don't know.  Ten multi episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  SNL Vanderpump rules had Riles in there.  That's wrong. SIFI,  sci fi wire, all partners at this point, 360 degree and 180 degree VR episodic  content. So they have the two different cameras.  They've got the jump system, which is the 17 cameras are rigged for that kind of  immersive 360 degree thing, and they've got the 180 degree VR  for a locked down but three dimensional VR, you know, shot that's relatively easy  to make. And we're going to see a bunch of episodic content along those lines.  And maybe we will watch it.  Maybe we won't. I don't know.  Vanderpump rules.  I don't know if I've ever watched a single second of whatever that show is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But so I'm really intrigued by the like I get stressed.  I don't know if anyone else gets this  stress, but I'm the type of person who read my choose your own adventure books,  like all like all of the adventures I had to do them all.  So 3D content freaks me out because I'm like, oh, I have to look up.  I have to look around. What's happening behind me?  Hold on. Yeah.  Like there's no indication.  And I think this will be really important for telling stories correctly  in this medium is indicating where a person should look.  Right. And we don't think we don't have those context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all that.  So one of the things they said today was  basically VR now has a range of vision like this, or we tend to be more like about  200 degrees. Yeah.  What if what if what if the experience, Stacey, was not that you ever had to look  behind you, but instead that you had more of the field of view you actually have.  You have 180 at least.  Would that be useful?  Some of the concert stuff is 180 only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that that would be useful.  But OK, the first time I watched Alien with a surround sound system and you know  that you hear it coming up from behind you, you got to admit it would be awesome  to look around and be like, oh, crap.  So that's just me.  I feel like there actually are really cool  storytelling possibilities if you give people the right clues to create that kind  of immersive experience, and would it but but yes, truly.  I also want to podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's CUNY. I wanted to do a podcast in 360.  So that when I'm talking, yeah, that would be look at your face and see your eyes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  roll. Yeah.  So you're all surrounding the camera that's all around you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't Google have didn't they do something with AI telling you who's speaking  in a video clip? Oh, wait a minute.  Yes, they did.  I remember that two weeks ago.  It wasn't even.  So I'm just that's technology that could help you make that possible, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can do it for years where you can tell that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I did a demo, a VR demo where you were watching Cirque du Soleil and you  could turn to either side and see performers sitting on the stage sort of  near you reacting to the show.  So it was kind of like just watching the regular show.  But then there were other things added to it.  So it wasn't full kind of immersive or 360.  I thought it was really powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The article we've resurrected 360, you know, I don't know.  But I'm done.  Now we're 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it would be interesting to get those VR 180 cameras and play around with  them. I feel like when they were when they were showing those off and first  releasing them, it seemed like their idea was anyone can get one.  And you can see. But I don't know if anyone actually is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So can I have a little Jeff fit, a little fit at just a minor one?  Sure. Fit light. Sure.  Light. So the story of oh, my God, Twitter sold data to Cambridge Analytica.  To me reveals for the problem with this whole storyline, Twitter sells the fire  host, whoever pays enough money, and you come in and you say, I'm going to  buy the firehose from you.  You can buy it. It's a product you can buy a B.  I presume they're not selling DMS or anything.  They're selling data that is public, that you chose to make public on Twitter.  So why there's a lot of pearl clutching about that, I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just because it involves Cambridge Analytica, right?  So, right.  So it's part of my  Cambridge Analytica's code for, you know, using data in ways that's not supposed to  be used or using data to target people for foreign election purposes or something.  So it's not so much the data they got.  But what what else is that data doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but but even so, it's a there's no  secret to this product you can sell.  It's the firehose.  It's public data and anybody can use it.  So they used it.  They're schmucks. They're bad.  I'm glad they're out of business.  You've kind of.  But I don't see any candles there.  That's all.  See, it was a minor calm fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that wasn't even really a fit.  That was like a like a end of rent, a mild rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It felt good to get it off my chest.  Maybe it's because I'm in California.  I'm just more mellow right now.  That was yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that was therapy.  That wasn't a fit.  That was just therapy.  Therapy.  What do we think of the Sprint T-Mobile thing?  I feel like this was bouncing around forever and ever and ever.  And then finally, they announced that there's a deal.  Twenty six point five billion dollar deal in stock for T-Mobile to acquire Sprint.  They really talked up the idea of, you know,  we are behind China in 5G development and this is not something we can allow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's playing off the Trump administration's apparent freak out over 5G.  However,  however,  back in what is it, 2013, I think it was.  Oh, no, no, no.  It was AT&T that tried to buy T-Mobile back in 2012.  That's right.  That's right.  And then everybody wanted T-Mobile after that happened.  And Sprint was the talk of the town.  And then someone bought Sprint.  Who was it?  No, SoftBank dude invested a lot of money in Sprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Oh, yeah. Masayoshi.  Son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, so.  There has been ever, ever since we've basically been saying, hey,  you know what, the US is a three carrier market.  We just four is too many.  So there is actually a lot of scholarship.  And if you look at other countries  based on just like straight up countries, three is a good number.  If you look at it based on population, surely we could support more.  But  it's not really viable.  There's a huge economic case to say that it is not viable to have four different  carriers. Really?  Yes, those arguments exist.  They are actually.  Compelling, they are not like completely persuasive, but they are compelling.  It's based on the cost, the capital costs of leasing towers, buying the spectrum,  running a network.  So it's not it's not crazy, but it is probably not good for the consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you read Tim Wu's piece in The New York Times?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. And again, I've been in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He basically said it's a terrible idea.  And it is a terrible.  It's bad for consumers.  Yeah, the moving to three carriers is bad.  So maybe there's an economic rationale for it, but that doesn't make it good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a economic rationale as a business to do it.  It is very expensive to operate and maintain a good wireless network.  It is hard for both Sprint and Timo to compete against AT&T and Verizon for a  bunch of reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I think if Canada can have two, surely the US can have more than three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, again, consumers, this will suck for you.  Yeah, but there there is a compelling argument to be made for the Department of  Justice and the FTC, who are going to have to decide if this is worthwhile,  that we do need this.  And I'm sure the FCC, you know, Ajit Pai is probably like, yeah, yeah, make it happen.  This is why this is happening now, because Tom Wheeler was against these mergers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I mean, it seems maybe I'm wrong,  but it seems to me that that T-Mobile was was all about, you know, we're the  consumer friendly phone company and we're looking out for you and we're fighting the  big guys and I don't understand how that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then the CEO shows up with this Trump

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trump, because they have shareholders, because they have to make money in a  market that is  they're fighting against Verizon and AT&T and Timo actually has done a really good  job, but they do lack capacity from a spectrum point of view.  So they need to solve that problem.  Both Sprint and Timo have to pay AT&T and  Verizon for access to the Internet itself, so to connect their cell towers to the  Internet. So they're.  Again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just thought  Tim said, if you want the mobile industry  to look more like the airline industry, then this merger is the one for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it's it's a crap deal for consumers,  but it is a rational deal from an economic, like from a shareholder business perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But there's probably a rationale that you  should only have one airline company and one phone company and one TV company.  That would be by far the most economically efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not in a capitalistic society, but in in like a socialist society.  Sure. What the heck? Or a communist society.  Yes.  I am against the murder, so I am against the merger because I am pro consumer.  I have I've prided for having as many carriers as possible, but.  I would not bet against this deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think the time is right for it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's obviously why it just seems hugely ironic that T-Mobile was pushing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  like their whole marketing campaign was consumer.  The un-carrier. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but they also did some things that were very smart from an economic  perspective, like in brought them subscribers, which was like they did the first deal,  the first zero rating deal that was T-Mobile.  So, you know.  They're not like some sort of crusader  for like awesome broadband and competition in the telco industry.  They are a business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you could argue zero rating was actually consumer friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can in the short term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not competition friendly.  To consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, short terms good enough, I think, for a lot of people like.  Well, yeah, you get stuff for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that gets us into all kinds of fun places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I should note that CanoeCast.com is available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  CanoeCast. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, then I think you obviously have to get it.  You have to buy it right now.  Somebody else is going to get it now that you mentioned it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll have to register it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  CanoeCast.com is just fun to say.  It is. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait. Oh, here we go.  Ready? Segue.  CanoeCast.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  .app. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, nice. Very nice.  OK. For a second.  I was. OK. Yes. You guys were all there.  I'm there. No, no, I'm with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Google paid 25 million for exclusive rights to the .app domain three years ago.  Now Google is going to require HTTPS for all .app sites, which is basically making  those domains, the .app domains available now through May 7th via an early access  program and then opening it up to everyone May 8th to go on sale to the general public.  So does anyone here have the have access to early access programs so we can  nail down CanoeCast.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do actually. CanoeCast.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  CanoeCast.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not 100 percent sure what what domain we're supposed to be getting, but yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we get them all. This is very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Anything with CanoeCast.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any combination.  There you go.  Any combo of CanoeCast.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Kevin has bought some, but apparently we ran into a domain,  a pending trademark claim on one of them.  But that's OK.  You know, we do what we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sort of feels sort of feels a little.  Do you remember .mobi domains?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that I don't know.  Did that was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm trying to remember what was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It seemed to be mostly marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the TLDs, there have been a couple that have actually is that top level domain.  Yes, there's been a couple that have been sort of worthwhile.  What?  Well, hold on.  Let me ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  XXX too, I think.  Yeah, you have an expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do. Only successful TLDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Talk about talk amongst yourself.  .mobi was for those.  Well, OK, the Wikipedia says anyways, indicating it was used for mobile devices  for accessing Internet resources via the mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was like the follow up to WAP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Domain approved when we had a mobile web instead of just the web.  Right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  2005 was when that was approved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it would fit on your palm, your handspring in your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not the electronic musician, Moby.  I think Moby actually sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a trademark dispute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably so.  That sounds like something Moby would do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's with the Y.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but it sounds the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does sound the same and also Moby with a Y.  But it was all just, you know, easy listening sort of trance music every website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're a trance DJ, this is the perfect domain for you.  So requiring HTTPS to be built in, that's that's kind of cool.  That falls in line with Google.  You know, Google's also making this transition with Google Chrome browser.  I think that happens in July where if you visit a website that doesn't have the  HTTPS built in that you're going to get a warning.  So before war, that'll happen.  Obviously, if they're launching these domains, they would make it compatible with that.  So that doesn't happen on those domains, I'm guessing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here the only the only top level domain  name success that my husband apparently has seen is dot AI.  And that was an accident.  So  and that started out as a country or that was a country code.  But, OK, which is why he's calling it accidental for what country?  Oh, what is that AI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was it the islands?  That'd be my guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dot TV had its own.  Anguilla, Anguilla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's Anguilla, Anguilla, Anguilla, Anguilla, Anguilla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it was Tuvalu that was TV.  Tuvalu, yeah.  They actually they sold off the rights  to the domain to raise money because they basically have no economy.  And they're sinking into the ocean.  I thought that was fascinating.  Hmm.  And then Libya had a big resurgence with dot L.Y.  Everybody wanted it.  Yeah, bit.ly and musically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Good for Libya.  Yeah, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I always remember fondly the every time I had to go to delicious,  I had to think for five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Del is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Will.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Del is the OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and I think Matt Mullenweg, he's got ma dot T.T.  But I forget what T.T. is the domain for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And why would that be good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, unfortunately, Matthew, you couldn't use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I couldn't because I don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did your parents do that so that no one would call you Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was the theory.  Yes, my mother loves the name Matthew, but hates the name Matt.  And so  so I explained to her later that you can't actually say the name Matthew so that it  only has one T. So as soon as you say it, people start calling you Matt.  But she actually at one point when I was in high school, people would call and say,  as Matt there, and she would say, no one by that name lives here.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you sure that just wasn't some sort of passive aggressive thing against your  friends? Oh, this explains so much.  So much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you know, here's my first stick into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say that's admirable, right?  I'll make an offer to you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My husband is volunteering to come up and talk about top level domains and dot app.  If you would like a domain name expert on this, however, yes.  You oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, however, come on up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His wife is hungry and doesn't want to talk to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, well, that's what I'm like.  I'll go down and get a snack.  Yes, this is only if you guys actually want this.  And he's he's coming up.  So now you're  we're locked in.  Ask all ask all of your questions, man.  OK. And while we wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. What else?  What else? Final, final things before we get the the TLDR or the top level domain

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  primer, I think you did a good job, boss.  I think you went through all the good stuff.  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see.  Do we dive into tips and all that kind of stuff with the time that we have?  Oh, yeah. You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to make my husband my tips since I didn't bring her.  There was kind of lazy.  So that's a good idea.  I'll go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's like when you're in kindergarten, you bring your mom for show and tell.  That's right.  Yes, mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is bring my husband to work day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think I don't know if this is an I.O. question, but do you think that we're  going to see that Google is going to straighten out the whole sort of music  service, YouTube, I don't know, play thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's a big question, Mark,  because we're hearing these rumors and everything.  I mean, if if you're following what Ron  Amadio wrote in his article, no, they probably aren't going to mention very much  about that, if at all. But yeah, I don't know.  I feel like if there's any mention of kind  of a podcast strategy like like you were talking, that involves play music  potentially. We're hearing a lot about, you know,  they're making public comments about the kind of future of YouTube as a music  platform. Maybe this is all happening right now because they're preparing for  sort of an announcement. But I would certainly mean they need to fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They need to straighten it out for.  Yeah, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. So, Jeff, you want to do your number?  Oh, wait, my dude. Oh, wait a minute.  He's trying to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, my my dude, the formal formal title.  All right. I'm going to pass the stuff to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, we're passing the stuff to Stacey's dude right now.  So everybody stand by while the stuff is passed by.  Do not adjust your set.  All right.  Here's hello Stacey's dude as as you are introduced to us.  How's it going, Andrew? Good.  Good to meet you.  Nice to meet you as well.  Welcome to the show. All right.  So you're going to give us you're going to give us a primer on T on  top level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A top level domain name is a worthwhile or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, this is an interesting one.  I think they're going to sell a lot of domain names and by a lot.  I mean, it's all relative, right?  None of these new top level domain names has really taken off.  I mean, dot com has 135 million domains registered somewhere in that  vicinity that the biggest of these new top level domains probably has a few  million domains. And the only reason that many got  registered is they literally gave them away or sold them for a quarter or a penny.  So it's relatively speaking,  I think that Apple will be one of the bigger ones, but it still won't be humongous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And what would be the benefit of having one like why is it easier to remember?  Are you going to be like what? Why would I want one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you might want to get a dot app  because you could get a short one that matches the name of an app you're  bringing out rather than a long dot com.  You see a lot of times on dot com domains like they'll use get something because they  can't get the actual name of the app and dot com.  So it'll be shorter like that is in the dot app signifies exactly what it is.  Of course, you can do the same thing with a dot com.  You could do the name of your app, app dot com.  So I wouldn't say there's necessarily a  benefit to using a dot app domain other than maybe you can get a better  domain name than you can get in dot com. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point.  I mean, the dot coms are so clogged it's  impossible to get a half decent domain anymore because someone's got it or,  you know, it's related to some other thing that's got the same name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there any data on consumer recollection of noncom, so to speak, domains?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a tricky one, you know, because even some of the names that have been out  forever that aren't considered new top level domains, but like dot org,  which has been around for almost as long as dot com, really.  Even with that, sometimes people will go type the dot com by accident.  So there is a challenge there.  And there's also with new top level  domain names, sometimes there's a singular and a plural.  Like there is a dot loan top level domain and then a dot loans top level domain.  So people have to remember that.  So it can get confusing.  There are a few that have been relatively successful.  Dot Club is one that's been fairly popular.  They put a lot of put a lot of marketing  muscle into that one, and that's part of the reason there's a site called in TLD  stats dot com in like new.  And you can see the number of registered domains there for each of these new top  level domain names, but I give you the caveat again that the ones you see at the  top of the list, they're mostly there because they've offered heavily discounted  domain names, and that has been somewhat of a challenge.  So, yeah, if you scroll down here, you'll see the top domains on the right hand side.  So dot loan  China has what about to two point six million there.  But again, they've done that by basically giving names away.  All those top ones you see there,  dot VIP has been pretty popular in China.  So, yeah, overall, obviously these numbers are fine.  But again, dot com, one hundred and thirty five million names, dot org over ten  million names, it's kind of hard to compare them.  Even ones that like dot info and dot biz,  I don't recall the most recent numbers, but we're talking single digit millions on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  those. Is it better to get to to go the route of say, like company name dot obscure  TLD versus company name with an extra attachment in the URL dot com?  Like, is there any benefit to one versus the other?  What do you think about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think I think the having the dot com again, like you guys said, it's do  people remember dot com or will they remember one of these new top level  domain names when they go to type it in?  And so again, that's the struggle there over time.  I think people will become more comfortable with these new top level  domains in these extensions. But right now, in twenty eighteen,  at least in the United States, the the recognition there isn't very strong.  Now, you know, there's a lot of debate within circles on which one,  which is better there, the longer dot com or the shorter new top level domain name.  But I think right now, again, in the United States, states, at least,  the dot com is your safer of the bets.  In some places in Europe, dot com is secondary to like the country code domain  name, right? So non dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tell Karsten that your last name is Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh,  Stacy Chompton.  My last name is not Higginbotham,  but I do get called Mr.  Higginbotham.  How much did you pay them to do that?  So my last name is Olloman, A-L-L-E-M-A-N-N.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so Higginbotham is a fine name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a fine name.  It's very long and it's difficult to spell.  I guess my last name is too.  Yeah, so I write about all this about domain names.  That's like Stacy does something important.  The Internet of Things.  I write about something not as important domain names on  DomainNameWire.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I live and breathe this stuff.  Do you own many URLs attached to many obscure domain names to kind of live and breathe it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have about 1300.  Yeah, I'm a domain owner.  So and some of those are new top level domains.  Most of them are dot com domains.  But you have to understand in the circles I'm in, 1300 names is not many names.  We're talking people of hundreds of thousands, in some cases millions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I stupidly let a four letter domain go.  How much would that be worth, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Four letters.  It really depends on the letters.  Probably low single digit thousands.  It's the three letter domains where you  start talking at least 10 to 15,000, oftentimes much more.  Two letter domains, at least a half million dollars.  And then there are a few one letter domains out there and those are in the millions.  So we're talking about dot com here.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Matthew, it was it was one of the names we tried for Daylife back in the day.  And it was what the world knows.  So WTWK.com.  But we didn't take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the interesting thing is a few years ago, before Bitcoin, before cryptocurrency was  a big craze in China, people were investing in a lot of these short domain names and  they're treating them almost like a cryptocurrency.  Right. It was it was an asset.  They buy a huge swaths of these four letter domains, five letter number domains,  and they invested millions and millions of dollars in these.  So that's why these three four character  domain names kind of really started over the past few years to take off in value.  So, yeah, it's it's it's a fascinating little corner of the world.  So when you have that, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead. I was I was just going to ask, like when you have when you own that many  URLs, domains, like what do you do with them?  Just collect them. Hold on to them and wait for someone to come along and be like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  actually, generally, yes, I wait for someone to come along that wants to use it for  their website. And so just to be clear here, these are kind of generic or dictionary  terms, right? I'm not I'm not cyber squatting on brands and that sort of thing.  So generally speaking, I'll just put a page up there that says it's for sale.  And if someone comes along and they they like it, they make an offer.  And if we if we can strike a bargain, then we do a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I own Schmitternet.com as an Internet Schmitternet,  which was a which was from the show years ago.  And see, if I if I try to stop Karshtan  from having to put this, I own S.H.I.T. widget dot com.  I can't even remember why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why not?  Why not? That's the answer to a lot of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  situations, although it has widget in it, which means it's already dated.  Right. Right.  The thing of the past at this point.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I've owned my share of domain names that were once popular terms that no longer  are so well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And at what point do you kind of pull the trigger and be like,  this this is no longer needed by anybody.  I can let go. Right.  Right. Exactly.  Not an easy decision to make.  I any other questions?  I think that's thank you.  Yeah, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll pass it off to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll pass it off to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let us apologize for holding your wife  too late on afternoon on these afternoons and delaying dinner.  That's so to you go out to dinner.  I apologize.  But but but Stacy, too wonderful.  So we hold on to her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Awesome. And you can leave the Alam in up for her.  You can do Stacy Alam in now if you want.  Just even things out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Andrew.  See you guys.  Take care.  Alam.  That was fun.  That was worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gold. I'm going to share that with everyone.  Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Higginbotham is great.  And I think I think the tool or the tip is NTLDStats.com, a site I never knew  existed. And it's very interesting to look at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't realize Wang was in the top 10.  Yeah. Number eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Number eight down four hundred and forty somethings.  Yeah.  From what it says there.  Cool stuff.  Jeff, what is your number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, she's so.  So I was going to do the fact that a quarter of all Taco Bell orders had  nacho fries in there, but I'm not going to do that.  I respect for Stacy.  But I am going to say that there's a  one of those kind of gift, Jeff, fights is going to drive us nuts for years.  A Bruin, thanks to BuzzFeed, which is what they do.  Well, yeah, I am a show.  I am a show.  What does the H stand for before we do anything?  A poll.  Each of you say that even a question that's I agree with you, Matthew.  Humble, humble, humble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anybody who's over 25 knows that it's humble.  Wait, what's it 35?  Well, it's honest, honest.  Over 50 percent of people think it's honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  According to their own scientific Twitter poll, but that's very disturbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's crazy. It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is. Yeah. OK.  Yeah, that's that's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, acronyms are hard.  I had someone who their mom thought LL meant lots of love.  And so they would put LL at the end of,  you know, after us, like a sad message in a text, they would put LL because they  thought it meant lots of love until their child said, it sounds like you're  laughing at me, but no, no, I thought it was lots of love.  I mean, it is hard if you don't know what things stand for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's obviously humble.  It's humble and they're wrong.  Everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, in our humble opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  Matthew, what you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do I got?  I was interested in something that this isn't a tip or trick or anything,  but I was interested in something that was in the lineup we didn't get to,  which was snap has gotten snapped their stock tanked.  Results not great.  Lots of people don't like the redesign.  I just thought it was fascinating that, you know, for a long time they were the  bomb and they were going up and to the right at a huge rate.  Their MAU and TAU numbers are not great.  Might be the redesign, maybe.  Anyway, I thought it was interesting that it's something that I watch from afar.  I don't use it a lot, but my kids do.  And I find it fascinating as a company.  So interesting to see if they can kind of get back to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, superstar again or now your kids are using snap.  Have they been  lure, have they been interested in kind of heading over to Instagram,  which seems to be the kind of biggest direct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah.  And I think certainly when Instagram  launched stories that I think sucked a huge amount of oxygen out of snap,  because that was one of the main things that certainly my kids,  you know, who are in their 20s, that's that's almost all they did.  And they certainly didn't really look at any of the other snap stuff like discover.  I don't think most of them even knew what it was for or why they would care  that CNN or Time put something up on snap.  You know, it was all about the stories.  And so Instagram, Instagram is also much more social.  So snap is very private, which is good.  But if you're interested in the social  aspect at all, then Instagram is much better for that.  So I noticed a lot of  uptake sort of in Instagram stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting. Yeah, it's it's very  I like I'm not a Snapchat user,  but I feel like the dialogue around Snapchat has been all over the map.  But just in the last couple of years, like you were saying,  so top of the world and now can do no right, you know, even with the redesign,  which Evan Spiegel, you know, had had mentioned during this this earnings  announcement that, you know, there were big changes to the design.  And that's going it's just too big of a thing to avoid some disruption.  I guess the question is, is that really the entirety of the disruption?  Is that the entire reason why or they're dealing with a number of different forces?  Spectacles, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  probably, yeah, spectacles.  I mean, I don't know.  I never saw that as being much more than a marketing thing.  It doesn't. Yeah.  And it's interesting that they're doing it.  But then they call themselves a camera company.  You know, I just it feels like they need like a second act kind of they need  something to move on to, you know, because lots of people use it  and they think it's great, but some of them are moving away.  So it's got to be something to kind of juice things up again.  I mean, when your stock drops,  I think Chrissy Teigen dissed snap and the stock dropped like 20 percent or something  like billions of dollars in market value.  You know, when that happens, you know,  you got to branch out a little bit, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Wait, didn't they piss off Rihanna, too?  Was there an unfortunate Chris Brown reference or something?  They did an ad campaign featuring.  Yes. Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They did. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So you can't alienate your celebrity people that people follow.  Right. Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Yep. Nope.  Mine is a tip if you didn't know.  Well, you all know about assistant.  This isn't great.  It can do so many things.  Sometimes it can be hard to know just how many things it can do and how good those  things are. I'll show you this.  If you launch assistant, it's a new feature.  You can go into your thing.  It'll take you to your explore tab.  You can go to any of these and jump in.  And not only can you rate it and also review it now, you can leave reviews on  these actions now to get it and leave a review, read other people's reviews to  kind of get a nice sense and hopefully kind of bring more awareness to all the  things that assistant can do for you, because I feel like I get lost.  Like on one hand, it's great that it does so many things.  On the other hand, it does so many things that it's really hard to know what to  focus on, maybe.  But anyways, if you want to find out more  information about some of these, you can you can leave a review or find out what  other people are saying about talk to universe facts and that sort of stuff.  But more context and discovery never hurt anyone.  And I think that is it.  We've we've we've come up with the title for Matthew's next big podcast called  Canoe Canoe Canoe Canoe Canoe Cast.  I really have a hard time saying that.  Not easy to say.  It's a Canadian.  So obviously you'd be really good at saying it then, Matthew.  And that's why it should be the name of your podcast, Matthew.  You have to do it. Sorry to do while you're out of the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say you could do can you can you cast dot a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  dot a that's a good one.  Does that exist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, can you cast dot sorry?  Or sorry.  Yeah.  And I apologize about that, Matthew.  I mean, it's jokes.  We've just used them all.  OK, all right. All right.  So not offending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We haven't we haven't referenced strange brew or hockey yet or

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Justin Bieber or Mike Myers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matthew, what what do you want to leave people with?  Where can people follow all the stuff you're doing online?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the place I spend the most time, of course, is Twitter at Matthew.  I with one T and I write at CJR dot org.

Transcript:  You know, go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, here. Here's an interesting  fact. So dot E.H.  Is not actually a country level top level domain, but it is reserved in case  Western Sahara becomes a it's a disputed territory.  It's a disputed territory.  So if the Western Sahara conflict results  in an agreement between Morocco and the armies in the territory,  then Western Sahara will get the E.H.  domain name and then I can get it.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think it was that on Wikipedia?  Because it was awesome.  And now I feel like I could go on.
