And you know, I want to say right up front,  just so you don't know, false billing, no false advertising  here, Google, the cloud, Facebook, Twitter, whatever  the hell we want to talk about, including occasionally  Chipotle, Glee, and Habermas.  Speaking of Habermas, here he is.  It's 430 in the morning, or some ungodly hour in Korea.  He's in Seoul at the airport, Mr. Jeff Jarvis,  flying home from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From Seoul after Sydney last week.  And then I finally get home.  I leave at 10 o'clock this morning, Seoul time,  and arrive at 11 o'clock New York time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Were you doing a conference in South Korea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What were you doing?  Yeah, this was the Seoul Digital Forum,  which is a big broadcaster here.  It tries to do, I think it's kind of their TED-ish thing.  Neat.  So it was fun.  Tim O'Reilly was here, not Bill O'Reilly,  Tim O'Reilly and Kevin Kelly and some other good folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, neat.  Is it an O'Reilly event or just?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, not at all.  No, they invited him.  They got the O'Reillys.  It's interesting to watch him watch a conference being run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I bet.  He's had some of the best, actually.  He's very good at it.  Well, we're so, I can't tell you how grateful we are.  I know what a hardship this must be for you, Jeff.  You even changed hotels, I think, so that you could do this.  So thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My honor and pleasure, because I was in the Seoul subway  yesterday, and someone came up and said,  are you Jeff Jarvis?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No way.  That is amazing.  That is, that's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's very cool.  Jeff is the author of this great book,  What Would Private Parts Do?  I think I've combined two books into one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't ask me that question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  His previous book, What Would Google Do?  is current book, Public Parts from Simon and Schuster.  And very, very good stuff, very, very good stuff.  And I love it that on the back, it's all Twitter.  Instead of the normal log rolling, it's all tweets.  Good job.  Gina Trapani is also here.  She is from SmarterWear.org, founding editor at Lifehacker,  also a big Android user and an Android programmer.  We like to get the programming point of view.  Thank you for being here, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great to be here again,  just kind of living my boring life here in San Diego.  I'm just kind of hold up alone in my home office all week,  and this is my one hour of the week  where I get to talk to other humans.  So my one social hour,  unlike Jeff who's traveling the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you coding, coding, coding?  Is that what you're doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm, yeah, I'm basically coding full-time on ThinkUp.  Oh, that's exciting.  For the most part, and a couple of other little projects,  but for the most part, ThinkUp, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's really great.  Are you headed towards a big number point release  or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we're working on 2.0 right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ooh.  It's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, yes, it's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, and let's not forget Gutenberg, The Private Part.  That's another book that Jeff wrote.  Sorry.  Big story, and I think it's a good one for you, Gina.  This just broke.  Moments ago, the jury ruled on Oracle versus Google,  no patent infringement found.  10 person jury found today  that Google did not infringe two Java related patents  that Oracle had used to sue the search giant.  That means Oracle is probably not gonna get anything,  maybe a tiny amount of damages from one copied function.  This is the end of a six week trial.  Must have been very expensive.  Some of the best lawyers in the nation trying the case.  The judge noted it was the longest civil trial  he had ever presided over, six weeks.  The waste, oh, the waste.  What a waste.  Oracle may still get the opportunity  to retry the copyright case.  So understand there were really two cases,  copyright infringement and patent infringement.  And then the verdict on the copyright,  it was just kind of weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was kind of a weird non-verdict, right?  It was, you know, the fair use decision  was never really made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they didn't decide on the most important thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, right.  But this is a big win for Google, right?  Because basically, I mean, the most they're gonna pay is,  I think it's like 150 grand of damages  for that one copied method, which is that range check method.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Xerox bill for the lawyers was more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  And I think there were those eight other test files,  which were also copied.  There might be minor damages for that.  But this is, yeah, Google keeps that kind of money  in their bathrooms.  So it's a big win for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Robert Van Nest, lead attorney for the Google,  said we are grateful for the jury's verdict.  Today's jury's verdict that Android does not  infringe Oracle's patents was a victory,  not just for Google, but the entire Android ecosystem.  Oracle spokeswoman, I don't know what that was,  Deborah Hellinger, we're doing sound effects now,  presented, Oracle presented overwhelming evidence  of trial that Google knew it would fragment  and damage Java.  We plan to continue to defend and uphold Java's core  right-runs-run-anywhere principle and ensure it is protected  for the nine million Java developers  and the community that depend on Java compatibility.  In other words, we're gonna appeal this one.  This is not over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not quite over.  But the judge was pretty great.  I mean, roundly sort of lauded for how level-headed  and clear-minded he was about it,  the fact that he knows how to code, kind of love that.  I mean, this whole trial was kind of a bummer.  I kind of felt like Google was in the right,  but I still don't love the way,  I still feel like they mishandled the whole thing.  As a Java developer, it's like Java's right-ones-run-anywhere  ethos is very much in line with Google's commitment  to openness, and it bums me out that the two companies,  that it came to this,  that they weren't able to figure this out earlier, sooner.  I mean, Oracle saw dollar signs, Sun was not thrilled,  but kind of went along with it.  It was just the whole thing was kind of a bummer.  That said, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if I was rooting for either side, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hate to see patent cases over stuff like this.  On the other hand, if Google really did just kind of say,  hey, we don't have to pay any,  we're just going to use Java, we're not telling anybody.  That's not so cool either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  It isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, I don't know.  I just don't know, but anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In a world without software patents,  which is what folks like us are saying we need,  what would the impact be?  So, let's say Google did, Nick, use of the software.  Oracle wasn't really hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the question.  Yeah, who was damaged?  What is the assertion?  What is the damage that, well, you should have paid us.  You should have given us money.  Is that the only assertion?  Because there are lawyers saying it's fragmenting  because they made their own Java virtual machine.  It's fragmenting the right ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, there's an issue of control over your invention.  All right, well, that's more legitimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think it was more like,  the idea that the Java APIs,  that if you buy a Java license,  it has to adhere to a set of standards  that Oracle kind of puts forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't change the API calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, like, I mean, you don't want to change the API calls  because it does create fragmentation.  And now suddenly Java developers are building  against two different interfaces.  And that stinks, right?  It leads to this fragmentation and non-standardization.  And so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And yeah, we don't want to set up a world  where you could copyright an API and say,  that's copyrighted.  Do we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, I mean, I don't see,  I don't think there's anything wrong  with anyone making a different virtual machine.  I mean, the whole point of Java  is that you write the code once and it can run  on lots of different devices.  From what I understood,  the Dalvik virtual machine wasn't the issue.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought that it was because Dalvik implemented APIs  that were non-standard.  Is that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, if you're not writing a virtual machine  that claims to be Java,  you could have any API you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, right, I mean, that's part of the issue too,  is that Android never used the Java name  or trademark symbol or branding.  But the reality is that Android got Java  into the pockets of millions and millions of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Linux, let's not forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It made Linux one of the most used operating systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know, I just, I don't know.  We tried to get some expert people,  nobody wants to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't want to touch this.  Everyone's just sort of exhausted by this whole thing.  This is not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Six weeks is in bed,  didn't the Microsoft thing go on for years?  I mean, I don't...  I'm just glad it's over.  Maybe it's not over, maybe there's more.  Okay, I do, there's much more we can talk about.  Well, as long as we'll do patents,  we'll do one more patent story,  which is the Terahop story,  which is kind of an interesting story.  This is almost like Google helping out  Terahop customers or something.  So Terahop, and they're two startup companies,  Tamarack and Terahop,  which were run by a guy named  Seattle investment professional named Mark Spangler.  He was indicted last week on 23 counts  of fraud and money laundering,  saying he funneled $46 million of investors' funds  into startups that he held interest in  called Tamarack and Terahop.  Terahop flopped last year, filed for bankruptcy.  A court-appointed receivership was established  to manage the assets.  And apparently Google has now paid $10 million to Terahop  for their patents.  Most of that money will go to those investors  who got ripped off by Spangler.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Google's just beefing up their defensive patent board.  Yeah, it's kind of as a happy ending for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The fraud investors get some of their money back.  The patents actually are not insignificant.  Terahop was gonna sell to big companies  to manage their shipping containers and stuff.  So the patents include an antenna in a cargo container  monitoring and security system,  visually capturing and monitoring contents and events  of a cargo container,  and radio frequency identification based sensors and others.  They're mostly RFID type patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they're gonna track us.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I put that Do Not Track story in the rundown, Jeff,  just because I wanted to hear you talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love that.  We will, we will.  That's a good story.  We're gonna talk about that in just a little bit.  The Twitter...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I figured at 4.30 in the morning,  Jeff needed a little extra...  This is better than coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, it's what we did.  We talked about a lot on security now.  Twitter doing the right thing with Do Not Track,  but we'll talk about that in just a second.

Google, it's official, the acquisition.  That went through pretty quick.  The $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility  by Google is done.  Google is now a hardware company, babies.  This happened May 22nd  at 5.53 a.m., or at least that's when the blog was posted.  Blog post was posted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what are they gonna do with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're not clear about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Motorola made the StarTAC.  I've had Motorola phones for ages.  I wasn't really crazy about the Droids.  They briefly, the Droid was like the best Android phone,  but quickly eclipsed.  The Droid, but Verizon is pretty much a Droid heavy place.  They love the Droids.  So the CEO Sanjay Jha, who was there,  has stepped down and a Googler, Dennis Woodside,  is now the CEO.  One of Dennis's, now maybe we can read the tea leaves  about the guy who's running this.  He built the Google business in the Middle East, Africa,  Eastern Europe, and Russia.  He was president of the Americas region  for the last three years.  So he's an administrator.  He's Tim Armstrong's successor, I guess.  Yeah.  Committed partner to their customers,  now he'll be an outstanding leader of Motorola.  He's an Ironman triathlete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well that doesn't.  I don't know.  The only thing that-  He can do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The only thing that I think might be germane  is that he has experience in Middle East, Africa,  Eastern Europe, and Russia,  which are really gonna be growth markets  for Android phones, I think.  These are areas that are dominated by Nokia  and ripe for the plucking.  Perhaps maybe China as well there.  That would indicate, if that's the case,  that would tell me that Google wants to make phones.  Or maybe it's just that they wanna go  to the existing phone manufacturers.  I don't know.  That's the real question everybody's asking.  Certainly, if you're HTC, Samsung, LG,  is Motorola gonna continue to make phones?  And will they have special access to Google?  And how soon can we sue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  CNET did a pretty good piece on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What'd they say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did a piece of three or four possibilities  of what Google could do with Motorola.  One of the more extreme ones would be  to sell off the business, to keep the patents  and sell the business.  I don't think that was the point.  Yeah, no, I don't think that was the point.  But they're saying kind of down the road,  because I guess Motorola's been losing money for a while,  so it's gonna be a tax write-off for Google  in the short term, in the long term.  So just run it independently.  The new Googler, the old Googler,  who's the new CEO, has a Motorola email address,  so it sounds like they're gonna maintain  a separate brand.  And another possibility, and this is kind of  what I'm hoping for, is that Google's gonna use Motorola  to kind of put out reference devices  of the pure Google experience, phones, tablets,  and Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of late, they've been using, the first one was built by HTC,  the G1, and the Nexus was built by HTC,  and then Samsung of late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Nexus S, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.  So instead, maybe Motorola.  If they get rid of Blur, nobody's gonna complain.  Right.  Motorola had the least attractive  customizations of Android,  and never made a pure Google phone, to my knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, I mean, I would really, I'd love to see,  I know Google works with vendors,  so I think the way this works is that vendors pitch Google  for their ideas of what the kind of reference device  should be, and then Google chooses one,  and then they go with them.  I think that's how it's worked.  Oh, interesting. That's how HTC got.  So, I mean, I would love to see Google work with Motorola,  or for Google to just put out the pure Google experience.  I think it's perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I kind of like Motorola's hardware.  I'm trying to, you know, the Droid Max is not bad.  That's the current Droid.  It's got good battery life.  It's not, but it's not as, I mean, the truth is,  the top of the line Android phones right now  are the Galaxy S3, which is coming out  at the end of the month, and everybody who sees it  raves like crazy, and the HTC One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Over here in Seoul, I was dying, you know,  to go buy a Note, since I'm jealous of you, Leo.  Thinking it'd be cheaper here.  It wasn't.  To match the price on Amazon,  and I'm going to do very bad currency calculation,  it was 770,000 won, was what I was looking for as a price,  and they were 900 won over here.  Anyway, there's this amazing place called the Techno Mart.  There's this huge, huge Techno,  place with 20,000 vendors.  I didn't get to go there, but the Techno Mart,  you go around this whole floor is nothing but phones.  You do see a few more things.  There were, the notion of the phone tablet  has spread more than I knew HTC.  Really, not just the Note.  Yeah, not at all.  No, there's a few others.  Little slightly different square,  different shape factors.  The LG has a square one, yeah.  Yeah, but there's more variety coming.  And it's amazing in the phone world now,  Nokia owned the world for so long,  Motorola owned the world, Nokia owned the world,  and now how quickly it can just pass hands.  It's phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a very high-risk business.  It is, although I think Samsung  is rapidly achieving a sentence.  Again, though, HTC's one is arguably the nicest one.  I ordered a Samsung Galaxy S3.  I couldn't resist, I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does look really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Scoble saw one at Flipboard and said,  "'It's incredible.  It's fast, beautiful.'"  He says it's the best screen he's ever seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I love how little chrome there is.  It looks really, I'm looking at pictures of it now.  Damn you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not a good business to try to keep up in.  You can't, because there's a new one every month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's true, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I'll probably have to retire the Note  because I'm gonna use an AT&T SIM.  So I guess I could use a T-Mobile SIM,  but I think it's only edge on T-Mobile.  I can't live with that.  And it's big, it's big.  It's not quite as big as the Note, but it's big.  It's 4.8 inches, right?  Something like that.  So it's a little bit bigger than the Nexus.  Well, I don't know.  Okay, so what did CNET say?  That either they could just be getting it for the patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was one of their less likely scenarios,  but possibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They could leave it as it is as an independent business.  Right.  Let it go.  I don't know why they would acquire it  if that's what their plan is.  They were losing money, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're losing money,  so that's good tax-wise for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  It's a write-off.  Yeah, it's a write-off.  I never understand.  I know.  It's too complicated for me.  Yeah, well, I mean, it makes the process seem less.  It's cash flow versus bottom line,  but I don't get it either.  Yeah.  It doesn't make sense for an individual, right?  Like, oh good, I'm gonna lose a lot of money,  so I pay less taxes,  and then I don't lose quite so much money.  Or it's a showcase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Showcase, Android showcase.  So putting out reference devices,  the pure Google experience, phones and tablets,  and the Google TV too.  That's the Motorola set-top business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder, I wonder  if the set-top businesses, maybe the MacGuffin,  maybe the real point of all of this.  Mm-hmm.  Now, you've got, people are raving over the LG TV now  has Google, in the TV, has Google TV,  and people are really flipping over it.  Sony just announced a new Google TV device.  Even though Logitech has not been happy,  there seem to be plenty of takers for Google TV,  so does Google need another manufacturer to make  Google TV? Remember Eric Schmidt's prediction

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of Google TV, six billion copies  or whatever the hell he predicted?  Wasn't there also a rumor at one point  that they were gonna get rid of the TV piece of Motorola  that was confounding us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we haven't seen that happen.  No.  Motorola makes these big set-top boxes,  but I can't imagine that they made much interest at Google  and continue to make the kinds of set-top boxes  Motorola makes with your crap.  So maybe...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know, that's interesting.  If you suddenly, do you create a market pressure,  because set-top boxes are just the world's worst computers.  Right, they're cheap.  Slow, horrible cheap. Right.  If suddenly on the market there were a whiz-bang cable box,  then I guess there's a few questions.  One, could you create a consumer demand for that on its own?  Would somebody, you know, basically,  do you start buying your own cable boxes?  Does that affect the whole DOCSIS standard  and how things operate?  No, that's interesting.  Right, could I end up replacing my cable box, finally,  with something that's really good?  Because it is a cable box, it will match the standards.  There is a standard to how to do this.  You can't say, no, no, no.  You know, the idiocy of the cable company,  refusing to work with my DVR or other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Most Comcast customers, I think, have Motorola set-top boxes.  Does this look familiar?  Ooh.  Bust.  Yeah.  They're just terrible.  Or this, my current one, I just got a new one.  It's a Motorola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And not to sound too buzzwordy,  but talk about ripe for disruption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, man.  Gigahertz tuner, it supports MPEG too.  This is the latest.  It's got DVR, HDMI, DOCSIS 2 cable modem built in.  DOCSIS 2 is kind of obsolete, by the way.  So yeah, these just are not state of the art devices.  I can't imagine Google.  God, you gotta think that Google,  these people love shiny stuff.  They're not gonna wanna keep making this.  That would be an argument.  If they can't just kind of come in,  the problem is they've got,  I'm sure they've got millions of these out in the field.  There's some-  Oh, it's a huge install base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's two questions here.  One, if you had a powerful computer finally as your box,  what all could Google do with that?  Imagine.  And the next question is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you gotta get the cable companies to buy these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm asking.  Because the cable companies want to lease these things to us  because they get back N times  the investment in the box over time.  And speaking of companies that lose money  that are wonderful to have, right?  On a cash basis, the amazing things happen,  but on a P&L basis, they lose money like crazy  because they have such a huge investment in the stock.  I mean, in the physical stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They would just piss off the MSOs if they dropped these.  Do they care?  Do they care?  So what happens is-  Only if you wanted to get in that business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's one possibility.  But Google comes along and just says,  hey world, here's a better box.  We're gonna undercut the price of the market like crazy.  Screw this idea of paying $12 a month for a box, right?  It's a ridiculous price to your cable company.  Here, buy the world's best box 100 times better for 100 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh God, they'll just kill,  oh geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love the idea.  I love the idea.  Oh God, yeah.  I'm velling over the,  and of course it's purely speculative.  We have absolutely no idea, world, what's gonna happen.  But that's our dream scenario.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I could see just somebody,  there's somebody at Google who's got asset reflux right now  because he's trying to figure out what the hell do we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's gonna be either Apple or Google, right?  And Google has a vested interest  in being the first one to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  True.  But that's where they almost have a conflict  because they have acquired a business now  that has a huge customer base  using really crappy, slow, cheap boxes.  And they'd love to move,  they'd love to move them over to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the beautiful thing, Leo.  The customer base is B2B,  and Google could enable B2C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it, as Gina says,  I understand, but by doing that,  they're gonna kill, well, maybe they don't care.  It's money losing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why they don't care, right?  Money losing business.  And so at some point in fiduciary responsibility,  so the cable company is gonna say,  no, we refuse to buy a far better box for less  because we wanna keep our crappy service  and control on you and keep strangling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wistful has a good point in the chat room.  He says, really, Google should have gone to the FCC  and got a regulation that said,  customers have the option of buying their own set-top boxes.  Because you know, that is the case in modems.  You could buy your own cable modem.  I did.  So I got a much better one  than the one that Comcast would give you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If FCC said, all right, cable companies,  you have to let the customers bring their own.  I guess that's what cable card was all about.  Cable card was, what a failure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a flop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cause I couldn't find the,  and that's the example of,  you can tell the cable companies what to do,  but if they don't wanna do it,  they can really screw with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, and this maybe changes that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's exactly what happened.  Well, we'll find out.  It's now official, it's Google Roller or Motorola.  Motor-rugal.  Google Roller, motor-rugal.  Google Roller.  Google Roller.  Yeah, cause it's really a small company  acquired by a big company.  Yeah.  It's a big company, should get pride of place.  Did you see the Google Doodle, by the way, today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How awesome.  How awesome is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a full synthesizer on your Google.  It's a Robert Moog's 78th birthday.  And this, not only does it have like all these features,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  it has a great radio.  It has a great radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It has a great radio.  It has a great radio.  It has a great radio.  It has a great radio.  It has a great radio.  It has a great radio.  But it also has a little tape recorder here,  so you can record your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, Leo, I'm waiting for you to have a fit  that it has a G plus button on it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, I can share my immortal masterpiece to Google Plus.  What's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's also a permalink button.  That's true.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On the reel to reel, on the Revox 4 track.  So that's what I recorded and now I can do track two.  And now I can try...  I've got a 4 track masterpiece.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm viewing source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it...  What is it?  It's JavaScript?  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks to be all...  It's apparently like huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just see if Gibson was saying...  It just like takes...  When you open it up, it takes up like another gigabyte of RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a huge file.  It's all HTML5, CSS, JavaScript.  No flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the Google Moodle, Moogle Doodle.  I wonder if anybody has uploaded compositions  from the Google Moog.  Be fun if...  Well, I guess we just watch Google Plus, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder if they get hashtagged if you share them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they should.  But who knows?  Yeah, because I would like to see...  I'm sure there's somebody, not me obviously,  but there's somebody who can use this.  Google must make four, not one, not two, not three,  but four antitrust fixes to satisfy Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Psy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was waiting for that Psy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Wall Street Journal just had an editorial,  and the editorials in the Wall Street Journal are,  everything every company does are wonderful,  but just saying that this is not consumer-focused at all.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, in fact, the commission concluded  that Google's business practices are unfair to competitors.  And Google says, we disagree with the conclusions,  but we're happy to discuss any concerns they might have.  One, I'm not sure I disagree with any of this, by the way.  Listen, these are the four things  that the commission says are concerns,  and Google now has a week or two  to propose how they'll address these concerns.  One, unequal treatment of third-party vertical search links.  What are vertical search links?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think in things like travel or whatever.  Specialized search engines.  Yeah, and every time I say this, it was the journal.  Far be it for me to quote a Wall Street Journal editorial,  but they said he was that case.  What's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is the case where if you search for a flight on Google,  you'll get Google's own IAT here.  I'll search for a Sanford.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Google flights over a kayak, for example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  So that's unequal treatment of vertical search links.  That's concern number one.  I don't know.  That's what we've been saying.  And it's hard to tell,  does YouTube show up more than it should?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The journal says,  let's stipulate that some of these charges may even be true,  but how does it follow their bad?  Consumers presumably benefit when their search tools  provide more valuable information,  not when there are more different tools  to deliver that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is that church and state thing  that I always bring up.  We had Matt Cutts on triangulation last week.  We talked a little bit about, poor Matt.  I don't know why I always put him in that position.  But, you know, I mean, you can absolutely make the point  that Google has the right to, it's its business,  to do whatever it wants to promote its own properties  from within a search.  There's no law that says search has to return  ecumenical results.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's the free speech, you know,  the algorithm being covered under kind of,  you know, the algorithm is like editorial  and it's a free speech issue.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they have the right, in other words,  to do what they want,  to skew the algorithm in their favor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Google's never made that argument.  Like other people made that argument,  but Google's always said, our results are, you know,  we provide neutral search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, Gina, that's where they shifted,  where they had, oh, Chatroom helped me,  the libertarian law blogger.  We did this story last week.  Florian Mueller from Foss Pants.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, Chatroom will tell me in a second.  We did the story last week where he wrote the white papers  defending Google as opinion.  Oh, Volok.  Yeah, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Volok, yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, so that's, Gina, I think that was a big shift  where Google was endorsing a view that search is an opinion,  and thus search is editorial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But so they commissioned that paper, right?  I mean, but they didn't write it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that indicates their thinking, I think, then.  Right, so I think you're right.  They never made that editorial argument before.  I think that you're right onto it,  that that actually changed last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's funny, because Matt Cutts even said,  yes, we believe we have a trust, a great trust,  to have keeping search agnostic  and accurate not to favor our own stuff.  And we endeavor to do that.  But it's just like the New York Times,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  not just the New York Times reporting its business,  but why does the New York Times have its own reporters  rewrite stories to get under their own byline?  They do? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of course, all the time.  I know the Huffington Post does that, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's not what I was trained to do, right?  Yes, you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ah, there's a good story.  Let's steal it and put it under our own byline?  No.  Oh, yeah, that's what that's.  Plagiarism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not, because you're rewriting it entirely.  You're taking the information  which cannot be copyrightable,  and you're adding whatever value you think you're adding.  That's part of the egotistical part of this.  But every newspaper in the country, I do it all the time.  We write.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like a box of clips.  Write much better.  Well, that's all we do at Twitter, so I'm not.  Right.  I shouldn't complain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing is, though, that Google's damned if they do  or damned if they don't, right?  So if they're gonna go this way and say  that our algorithm is protected under free speech,  that we're exercising editorial control over our algorithm  so that's protected under free speech,  then things like searching for,  I forget what story that was.  It was searching for some name  and it suggested Jewish after it  that was considered anti-Semitic.  They can do anything they want.  Then they have to take responsibility for that.  Then suddenly they can be charged with hate speech  if autocorrect. In some countries, yes.  So either way, they're kinda screwed.  Yeah. You can't have it both ways.  But this is the same analogy,  and I think this is what he wrote in that piece,  was that this is kinda like the New York Times  pretending to be neutral,  but actually being run by humans  who make a lot of decisions  about what should show up in the paper on how.  This kinda faux neutrality.  And that's what Google's sort of been doing up until now.  But it's good to ask the question, and it's interesting.  It'd be interesting to see if they really make that switch.  And I think Jeff is right.  I think that shift has started to happen with that paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do real people care or is it just us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't think so.  At all.  One more point on this.  And I'm having a senior moment.  Gene started that earlier before we were on the show.  It made me feel old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's 4.30 in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have every right to feel old.  I have ice on my knee and it's empathetic.  So the band-aids too, you don't wanna know.  So Bill Gross sold his ad company way back when to Yahoo.  What was it called?  Oh, I don't remember.  The original ad company.  Overture?  Overture, thank you, okay.  So remember what Overture was.  Overture said you could pay for position.  And Google came along and said,  no, that's not a very good experience.  We're not gonna do that.  But as a precedent, as an ethic or a standard  in the industry, paying for position  was the way the industry worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Google, I really believe Google was almost started  in response to that.  And certainly the don't be evil  that Paul Buhite suggested as the company mantra  was exactly in response to that.  Danny Sullivan said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, so now you can look at that two ways.  You can look at that one way and say,  well, it is evil for Google to promote its own stuff.  And I would argue that's what every media company does.  But you could also argue it the other way and say,  well, Google's still way better than that.  Which was an industry standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is your point, Gene,  I think is well taken.  Google has to decide, are they a media company?  Yes.  Or are they somehow agnostic search company?  They can't have it both ways.  And they have, because there's different rules.  And they can't say, well, and sometimes,  so well, no, we're above the fray  in order to preserve their safe harbor.  And other times, no, no, we get the right to say  whatever we want, First Amendment,  in order to put advertising in their results.  And you can't have it both ways  because there's different rules.  Pick the way you're gonna be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And to your question, I don't think people really care  because people trust the Google brand.  But the minute that people start to not trust the Google  brand, they are gonna care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they may not even care.  They may not know overtly.  It could happen just because they go,  these results, I don't know.  I don't like this anymore.  I'm gonna go try Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, right, exactly.  You're exactly right.  It would manifest itself more like that.  That's how it would be.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think that's gonna happen.  Number two from the European Commission,  concern number two, this would be a concern,  copying content from virtual search engines,  or vertical search engines.  They think they're copying stuff from,  like restaurant reviews from third party websites  without authorization.  Now, remember Yelp complained  that that's exactly what Google was doing.  So Google stopped as soon as Yelp complained.  Because I mean, they index the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but there's a big danger there  is that yeah, they copy the content of the entire net  in the sense of being able to index it  and being able to analyze it.  Now, do they present what they copy?  Well, yeah, they do in search engines.  How much of-  That's the nature of search.  What's fair use.  That's the business they're in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's why if you're a search engine,  you can't be a media company  because that confuses the issue.  That's my point.  If you're a search company,  then you are off the hook for copying  because that's what you do as a search company.  You put excerpts up from search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's not necessarily.  I mean, if you run a blog, if you run a media site  and you quote an excerpt from another article,  that's not copying, that's fair use.  That's commentary, right?  And so the excerpts in Google's search results  are a certain length.  Well, I would only complain if I'm Yelp

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  if nobody ever went to the search result,  but just said, oh, I got what I wanted  right here on the Google page.  Then you got a problem, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google's stealing traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I met somebody here in Seoul,  and I don't think I'm revealing anything,  said doing some work with Google on fair use  and said it's a huge issue around the world.  Listen how we were talking about fair use before  in the Android case.  Now fair use here, fair use in the US.  And the US has a fair use doctrine  that isn't the case around the world.  And then even so, fair use confounds people  because there's no definition of what fair use is  on purpose because fair use is different by context.  So this whole notion of Google,  then Google resting on fair use is a critical,  critical strategic necessity for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, here we are,  Twitter media company, and we're talking about  excerpts of the information week's article  about the antitrust fixes that Google has to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and you're right, and we should,  and we think we will put a link to that full article  so people can read it.  Oh, absolutely.  And you know what I should do,  I don't do this always, and I should do this,  is quote, say, oh, this is from an article  written by Thomas Clayburn in information week.  But we will, we show it and we put that in the show notes.  But I should actually, I try to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but even then, all Thomas is doing,  no offense to you, Thomas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's just recapitulating the easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is fine, that's what journalists do,  but there's no great holy writ in that.  They're summarizing something  that we can link to directly now.  And it's a service, thank you very much,  it's great to do it, smart stuff.  But.  Is that some kind of holy fleece, only net thing?  I don't know what that means.  Holy fleece?  I don't know what that means.  Holy fleece, Batman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Holy fleece, Batman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a minute, there's like a term of law  called holy fleece?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, it was holy grail and finding the fleece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, there is the Church of the Holy Fleece,  the Order of the Holy Fleece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's just punchy, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Charles V of 1556 was dressed entirely in black  except for the red collar of the Order of the Holy Fleece.  Holy fleece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Holy fleece, you have to be wearing a twit fleece  when you say it. So wait a minute,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so there's the holy grail and there's the holy fleece?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you brought it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sleep deprivation.  Snaps is crossed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Holy fleece, I like it.  Is that because the moths got to it?  Search item three of the four,  we got to get right through this here.  The Search Agreements with Partners Commission says  that Google is asking for exclusivity  when you put AdSense on your,  you can't display ads that might be confused  with Google ads on your website.  You cannot use another site's search service  and you can't display, quote,  any non-Google content targeted advertising.  So it's not-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the one that does hit most  to a potential monopoly issue  because monopoly, I argue, that Google has  is not in search at all.  Other kinds of choices, the market gives them  the penetration it gives them.  Where Google does have power of God is in advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's interesting.  If I put AdSense on my website,  I can't put anybody else's ads on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think for you, Leo, they care, no offense.  I think that those are for big corporate deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, if you agree, I mean, those are AdSense's terms.  You don't have to use AdSense.  But that's exactly right, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so if you look at, let's say,  Google's deal with About.com,  you bet your bippy that Google puts those conditions on  because Google gave About.com guarantees.  And Google gave them, it was a negotiation.  So what does Google get out of the negotiation?  Google says, okay, we'll give you a good deal,  but we're the one in town.  And About.com says for $50 million a year,  okay, you can be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I bet that that's similar in other ads.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's the other thing.  You know, there's category exclusivity too, right?  An advertiser will sell and say,  okay, I'm only gonna use GM for this category,  thus I won't sell to Ford, right?  Which limits you greatly, but that's negotiation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Finally, they say you cannot,  Google prevents people from moving their AdWords campaigns  to other non-Google ad services.  If you quote, if you run your own advertising network  and the AdWords API client offers functionality  that copies data between Google  and your advertising network,  then you must ensure that end users  must manually select AdWord campaigns  or campaigns that are for copying  so they may optimize them prior to each instance  of import into or export from that network.  In other words, you can't automate copying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't imagine such portability.  Who else offers such portability?  I wouldn't be surprised if Google  brings the data liberation front to ads, that's fine.  But I can't imagine anyone,  and again, I don't know what I'm talking about here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're right though, that seems a lot to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Europe, like going from,  what fascinates me about the story is,  I think Europe knows the EU has the weak case  because before they even decide to drag Google  through the mud, they're saying,  okay, if you just do these four things, you're clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point.  That's all we ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not gonna happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but Google's not gonna do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google should be hanging tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe Google will come back and say,  okay, we'll do maybe a third of maybe two of these.  How does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what's happening, right?  This is a negotiation.  Negotiation.  So the EC says, do this,  and it's just a letter to Eric Schmidt.  Would you mind, these four things kind of bug us.  And Eric said, well, I'll do two.  Exactly, Gina, I'll do two.  And I'll cut you some slack on the third or something.  The EC said, Google has a matter of weeks  to propose remedies to the four concerns  or face formal proceedings that could end in a fine  or remedies imposed by European regulators.  Google says, it disagrees with the allocations.  Competition is already increasing in the search market.  We've only just started to look  through the commission's arguments,  Google told Ars Technica.  We disagree with the conclusions,  but we're happy to discuss any concerns they might have.  Competition on the web has increased dramatically  in the last two years since the,  they're so far behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love the skill that it is to write a grin effing  response to things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We respectfully submit to the European commission,  two letters, F and U.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, here is our offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google says, the competitive pressures facing Google  are tremendous.  It sounds like they got a headache.  We got pressure.  Innovation online has never been greater.  But Google's net share of the market,  of the desktop search market is down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Search is yesterday's war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So just take that EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the irony is, one of the other stories in there  is that Chrome surpasses IE.  Microsoft owning IE was supposedly gonna ruin  the whole world.  Right, right, right.  Google was the next one in to fight that.  And now Google's gonna own the whole world,  but then Facebook comes in and it's gonna own that  and somebody else is gonna be coming in.  That's the new world, folks.  Regularly moves you behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, just stuff moves way too fast for governments,  which are built, at least in the US, to work slowly,  because the founders didn't trust speedy government.  And you know what's happening?  It's just gonna get faster and faster.  It's a pretty soon government just won't.  It's such an impedance mismatch now.  It's not gonna ever get anywhere.  Gina and Jeff are here.  We're talking about Google.  We gotta talk about the Facebook IPO.  That's turning out to be just a mess.  The issues, it sounds like people got ripped off.  Then there's a great quote from a business insider  that talks to a hedge fund manager on the Facebook IPO  and what went wrong.  And the anonymous hedge fund manager said,  basically he said, well, we're mad  because we thought we were gonna get a lot of money  off of Muppets.  That's what they call us, little normal investors.  We thought the Muppets were gonna get suckered  and they didn't, and so we're mad.  You Muppets didn't fall for it.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  Right now I wanna talk about Ford  and the Ford electric vehicles.  So great.  The 2012 focus is here, the electric focus  at your EV certified Ford dealer.  Oh man.  Some people were complaining.  I remember this.  Couple of companies already had their electric vehicles,  Chevy and Nissan and so forth.  And everybody's saying, where's Ford?  Where's Ford?  And I remember talking to Alan and I said, where's Ford?  I said, they're saying, where's Ford?  And he said, we wanted to really do it right.  We did not wanna rush into this.  We wanted to make the right electric vehicles.  We wanted to make sure that we could make it across the line,  not just a token electric vehicle.  And they did it.  The 2012 Ford focus is, I mean, they're using  state of the art batteries to give it the most fuel efficient  five passenger vehicle in America.  The best city rating in its class, 110 miles per gallon E.  That's the new equivalent for electric vehicles, MPGE.  It has the best in-class driving range of 76 miles.  That's good.  That's good.  I mean, we'll drive across country on this,  but I have another choice for you if you're gonna do that.  But for getting around town, that's plenty.  And it charges up in three to four hours.  That's the best in class 240 volt charge time.  You of course have to get the 240 volt,  optional 240 volt home charging station for that.  But that's like half the time the leaf takes.  That's really fast.  The 2012 Ford Focus Electric, it's available now.  And they've updated so much.  Well, it uses regenerative braking.  So that in fact, they were able to capture  more than 90% of the energy that would be lost  in a braking system and put it back in the battery.  That's one of the ways they get this range so high  and this efficiency so high.  The sync and Mi4 Touch have been updated to an EV status.  So they do things like monitor the battery state of charge,  maximize energy efficiency, let you control the vehicle  charger, preconditioning settings,  find the most equal friendly route, all of that stuff.  In fact, they even have smartphone apps that do that,  including a value charging feature powered by Microsoft  that is basically one button push to take advantage  of off peak and reduced rate utility hours.  All of that built in automatically.  Take a look, this is the website, ford.com slash technology.  Ford.com slash, it's little things.  It's little things like the light on the where you plug in  that shows you how far the charge is.  It's all so, so nice.  See that?  It goes around and it shows you, shows you.  You always know when your car is fully charged  and ready to go, because it lights up.  I like that.  Isn't it fun to plug your car in?  Now, if you are gonna drive a cross country,  then you might wanna take a look at the Ford Fusion Energy.  That's gonna be available early next year.  That's a plug-in hybrid.  I think this is the one I'm gonna get.  So the idea is you've got a gas engine and a plug-in.  You use gas when you need it.  You use electricity when you need it.  You get 100 miles per gallon E, 100 MPGe.  This is gonna be very cool.  This is the energy, 2013 Ford Fusion Energy.  They say it'll be available early in 2013.  Really cool stuff.  Visit the website, ford.com slash technology  and go to your EV certified Ford dealer  and drive one today.  Scott Motte posted a great,  let me see if I can find a great picture of,  they did this yesterday.  The Ford employees got together on the campus  and they made a blue oval.  Let me see if Scott's got this on his Pinterest.  He Pinterested it, I thought.  No, I can't find it.  Anyways, pretty cool.  Scott's awesome.  Okay, let's move on.  Let's move on.  Next story, ladies and gentlemen.  Larry Page says Facebook is holding users hostage.  He told Charlie Rose how unfortunate it is  that Facebook has been closed with the data.  He says, I think we would, certainly,  we're in the business of searching data.  They would like to see that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yes, they would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They would like to see that.  I think the idea that you'd hold your users hostage,  kind of, in the absence of reasons for it  doesn't make sense.  There's reasons.  Larry, there's reasons.  From a user's perspective, Page said,  oh, it's great, I'm joining Facebook, I want my contacts.  In Google, we said, fine.  He says, you know a lot.  You can get them from Google.  And the issue we had is then that Facebook said,  no, Google, you cannot do the reverse.  This is when they let you use your Google contacts  when you sign up for Facebook, but not vice versa.  He says, users don't understand what they're doing.  They're putting data in and they don't understand.  You can't take it out.  So we said, we'll only participate with people  who have reciprocity and we're still waiting.  This is gonna be a shooting war.  You keep talking like that, Larry.  Google versus Facebook.  Any thoughts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was looking at a place on Facebook  and I clicked on the address and it launched Bing maps.  I mean, obviously Facebook and Microsoft and Yahoo  have figured out ways to work with one another  and Google's just out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's talk about the do not track.  I don't want Jeff to fall asleep.  I'm gonna have to hold it out.  Steve Gibson just reviewed this on the security now  and he says, Twitter's doing everything right.  So there's do not track in the browsers now,  Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari.  Not in Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not in Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not in Chrome.  There are extensions of course, but not in Chrome.  Do not track is a simple way for users to,  you check the box in your browser to tell a web service  that you don't want information about their visits  collected across websites.  Keep the data where it is, not share it with other sites.  Do not track me across the internet.  So Twitter has announced they're gonna do this new thing,  which I think is kind of cool.  I'm actually curious what you guys think.  Twitter is going to track you across the network  wherever there's a Twitter share button,  which is a lot of sites,  kind of like the Facebook like button.  And then based on the sites you visit,  this is the only thing Twitter is gonna do.  They're gonna suggest other Twitter user accounts to you  saying, well, you hang out at Starbucks a lot,  you should probably follow Starbucks.  And here it is in your suggested user list, customized.  I think that that's probably a good use for it.  It's also a trivial use.  Should they be following us around  just so they can suggest better users?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'd be following us around.  They're following us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not following us around.  The widget is embedded in these other pages.  So if I read an article that Leo's written  and there's a follow Leo button on that article  and I do that 10 times in a week,  then I go back to Twitter, it says,  hey, maybe you should follow Leo  because you seem interested in his stuff.  That's not following.  Those widgets are there anyway.  They're just saying that they're using that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's paying attention to the signals you're giving them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, that's paying attention to the referrals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  This is, I mean, listen, Twitter's been doing  some really very good things lately,  like it's patent stuff and all that.  But this is slightly disingenuous, I think.  It has an impact on the debate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, to finish the thought, they've been very clear  that if you have Do Not Track on Your Browser turned on,  they won't do it.  They'll respect it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the point, Leo, they never tracked you  because they didn't have any business reason to do so.  Because Twitter has no business model and no ads.  So the fact that Twitter doesn't,  it's like saying that Ford's cars aren't gonna track you.  They never did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, why should they?  So now if you go to your settings on the Twitter,  let me do that, you'll see that there is a button  that says, Do Not Track Me.  Well, actually, it's the other way around, sorry.  Personalization, tailor Twitter based  on my recent website visits.  But then, and I think this is to their credit,  preview suggestions tailored for you,  not currently available to all users,  and learn more about how this works  and your additional privacy controls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but Leo, it wasn't here.  It was for the press release.  And the press release says, oh, we're wonderful.  We're Twitter, we don't track.  Yeah, look.  Because Twitter never had to track  and has no reason to track.  And so they basically created a new feature  so you can turn it off so they can say it.  And the problem I have with that is it affects the debate.  It says, oh, well, good, somebody's not tracking me.  Everybody else who is is evil.  And we're back into that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because now everybody who says,  oh, well, how interesting,  because Facebook doesn't say they support Do Not Track.  And those like buttons are everywhere.  What's Facebook doing with those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina's sitting there shortly and thinking,  ah, wowed him up this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you're saying it's disingenuous  that Twitter is really using this  to take a pot shot at Google and Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, quite right.  But that's how services sort of differentiate themselves.  I mean, DuckDuckGo's whole business model  is like we don't keep your search terms.  I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.  Look, the Do Not Track is a feature  and that's the name of the feature.  Twitter is not calling it tracking.  I mean, that's the name of the feature in the browser.  And I feel like it's akin to saying,  I'm a search engine  and I'm gonna respect your robots.txt.  If your robots.txt says that we should index your stuff,  then we won't.  And I think that's a good thing.  Look, the reality is a very small percentage of users  are actually gonna turn on Do Not Track in their browser  and then go to the settings in Twitter  and turn it on.  And yeah, of course it's a PR move.  It definitely is.  They're trying to differentiate themselves  and say, hey, we're respecting this browser feature  and the implication is these other guys aren't.  I don't know if that's a bad thing though.  I mean, for the people who do care about this stuff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it seemed like-  But they basically turned on a new feature  just so you could turn it off  so that they can come up with a press release for doing so  and thus put pressure on their ad-supported competitors  and not act very collegial in the whole internet thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, okay, so you feel like they're undermining  other services' business model.  He says it's very cynical.  It's so cynical.  He's saying it's completely cynical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Okay.  Okay.  They would never have considered turning this on  except that they can zing Facebook and Google by doing so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, listen, I'm not trying to be anti-Twitter.  I was at first suspicious  when they did their international revealing  when they're forced to take down tweets by governments.  And I thought that was first bad move.  I was wrong.  It was actually a better move.  So, I could be wrong about this,  but yeah, I see it as highly cynical.  And ironic, what it also points out is once again,  the Twitter has no business model.  Right.  The reason to track is because  you're gonna serve fricking ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they've closed that door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do have sponsored posts.  Are there not sponsored posts and such?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but they don't use tracking for them.  They don't use tracking to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just random, whatever you get.  That's the problem.  It's a very clumsy advertising structure.  They wish they had a reason to track you.  Oh, they so wish they had a reason to track you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But since they don't, let's make a virtue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Since they don't, what the hell is turned off?  Right, exactly.  The second problem is this whole third party  other sites thing.  If you believe as I do that content is gonna become  more embeddable all around the net, right?  That everything becomes more like a YouTube video  than this idea of going site to site.  Oh my God, they're going site to site to site.  Well, so will the content.  And the content should travel with analytics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If a YouTube video is embedded on my blog,  I can't very well say to YouTube,  oh, but you can't check out who's looking at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  So that architecturally where the net is going,  where the web is going, I think,  is to enable more of that kind of embedding.  That's part of what Twitter is part of.  But now they're kind of saying, oh, well, no, no,  if it goes across sites, we won't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's really interesting point of view.  It's really-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like Twitter knows so much about me though.  I mean, five years, 6,000 tweets,  they've got data on how many times I've clicked on links.  They know a lot about stuff that I like,  who I'm friends with, my political views.  But like they can advertise to me using information  and I overtly entered into Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you use Twitter page, you could, but I don't.  If you use a Twitter client,  which is what spread Twitter in the first place,  if they started pumping in ads too much into that  on that basis, people would be having a fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like the idea that it's a cynical manipulation  of the media.  I don't know how sophisticated they are if it is,  but I like that idea.  I think you're giving them a lot of credit.  I think they might deserve it.  You're right.  They have no reason to track.  So, oh, we're going to come up with some Fakatka feature  just so we could tell you we don't track  if you don't want us to.  We will if you would like a better suggested user list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it seems like Twitter is positioning themselves  to cater to the sort of more tech savvy audience  or the kind of, you know, between the patent stuff  and the bootstrap and the MySQL modifications they released.  They're pretty active in the kind of open source world  and the world of advanced users,  the kind of users that might check off, do not track.  Maybe Jeff is right.  Maybe it's a PR move.  Maybe it's a hostile PR move  that's going to take down the advertising business model  for the rest of the internet.  And how could they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's too late because that horse is sailed  because if horses could sail,  what horse would have sailed?  Because-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're in search of the fleece.  Of the golden fleece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of the holy fleece.  Holy fleece.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Holy fleece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That horse has sailed in search of the holy fleece  because already it's going to be in the browsers, right?  So the people who are a fault here,  Jeff, really the ones who should be angry  are at Firefox, Safari.  Yes, I am.  I actually am.  Because those are the guys who created this whole notion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the support of media.  If I'm going to be conspiratorial,  the reason that the Wall Street Journal goes after this  is because they are abandoning the ad market  in favor of a paid market corporately.  News Corp is.  I'm not suggesting that that's,  permeates every decision made there,  but I think that's an impact.  So those that are supported by advertising,  which to me is going to be the key of media and journalism,  the more it gets hurt, the more problems we have.  Now, once again, I will always say in this case  that the advertising and media industries  did a terrible job of informing people  what they were doing, why they were doing it,  what benefits came out of it, why it was necessary.  And so they've made this dead.  I agree with that.  But through the emotional reaction to this,  of the tracking.  And Gina, you're right,  Twitter didn't make up the word tracking,  but it still plays into that game.  And then uploading those so that you would get the big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right now, something's going on  at the Google Plus Photographers Conference.  We're going to keep an eye on it.  Max Braun from Project Glass is about to take the stage  to show pictures they've taken with the Google Glasses.  So that's coming up a little later on.  If you're on Google Plus, you could see it.  Just go to the Project Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Google's hosting the Photographers event?  I missed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a Scott Kelby event for Google Plus.  And Photographers is the gplusc.com, the Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's officially endorsed by Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's an interesting question.  Google's certainly there.  Oh, that's cool.  It's very cool.  It's a Scott Kelby, Kelby trainings doing it.  And actually, Catherine Hall, one of our Twitter hosts,  our Twitter photo host is there doing a photo walk  and so forth.  But I'm curious.  We'll watch the stream  and see if they show any interesting pictures from G Plus.  I'm sorry, from Project Glass.  I almost misread this.  I read this article that says that  Android smells like Axe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That article is my fault.  I think it was ReadWriteWeb did an article  on why the iPhone success has women to thank.  And there's just a subheading, which I just couldn't resist.  It was the Axe-like scent of Android's dooddom.  And that's a reference to Axe body spray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which only guys like, women do not like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which only guys like, right.  But they'd have you believe that women like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, guys think women like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't.  Anyway, this isn't anything we haven't discussed before,  just about how so many of the Android ads,  especially the Android ads, are very much geared toward men.  They're very, very masculine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And now T-Mobile, which had kind of this youthful little...  First they had Catherine Zeta-Jones,  which I don't know why they changed.  But then they got Carly, who's a young Catherine.  And now she's like riding Harleys and stuff, like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, she went from the pink dress to the motorcycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And skin-tight leather.  She's basically the GoDaddy girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, not as bad, not as bad as that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The slogan is no more Mr. Nice Girl.  So do you think, I mean, Gina, you're a woman.  Do you think that Android appeals to men and iPhone?  Is iPhone from Mars, or from Venus,  and the Android from Mars?  What is the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're judging purely from ad campaigns, definitely.  I mean, most of the Android ad campaigns  are like robots and explosions  and robot arms using the phone.  Whereas the iPhone ads are like regular people.  I mean, granted, is it rain?  Like those ads drive me crazy.  But there's still, there's chocolate, regular people,  beautiful children smiling on the beach.  It's much more of a kind of family-oriented,  everyday life kind of take on things.  Like this one's gonna make your life better.  The Android message always seems to be  for the people who want more power,  want to do more.  Droid does, you want to do more.  They focused on power.  Yeah, they focused absolutely on power.  And I think that that's a pretty clear...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the Zoey Deschanel ads for Siri  are aimed at guys though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well...  Who are they aimed at?  I would say probably, probably both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samuel Jackson is making risotto with organic mushrooms.  I mean, that's pretty, you know,  heterosexual.  And Zoey Deschanel, I think, has appeal to both.  I mean, women want to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you seen the parody?  Have you seen the parody?  No.  Here, this is Lindsey Doolin from Coachella Kilchella.  This guy crying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do not understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, she talks.  Find nearest banjo store.  Is this the close-up where I look around all quirky  with my bangs?  No, that's next.  Hey you, who's the director?  We're good with the singing.  Siri, play my song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you've seen the Siri ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does this phone match my bangs?  Are you ready?  Siri, is my album gonna go platinum?  Can I have a raspberry juice?  She thinks it's a magic eight ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's shaking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One time I burped a cloud.  I'm feeling like Indonesian food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And just need one more take.  One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is this the shot where you get my bangs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's so great.  Only if you've seen the originals, but yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  I don't know.  I think you can make the argument that dancing  around your dirty house in your pajamas  on a rainy Saturday and ordering tomato soup  appeals to women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you're right.  I don't know who it appeals to, but yeah,  I think you're right.  She's just so cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's adorable.  Let's just play a couple of those just so that you,  for fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it appears to be raining.  Oh, let's get tomato soup delivered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I found a number of restaurants whose reviews  mentioned tomato soup and that deliver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good, cause I don't want to put on real shoes.  I don't know which is funnier, the real one  or the parody.  They're both equally dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the fact that she's staring out the window  at like pouring rain and says, is that rain?  It's ridiculous.  Is the sky crying?  Google.  So I had to drop that story into the background.  I love it.  The Axe-like sense of Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I misread Axe, but now that I know it was Axe,  I feel better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The dude dumb.  I can't remember who this was, but just two days ago,  somebody on Twitter thanked an airline for moving them  because they sat next to someone.  I think it was David Carr of the New York Times,  I think, for saying to someone who thought he was  the poster boy for Axe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the worst.  My son wears it.  It's actually, yeah, young.  I need to pull him aside and say, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've done an amazing job of convincing young men  that it's the right thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, in my day, it was, remember High Karate, Jeff?  No.  It was a cologne that the guys had to fight women off  with karate chops, and then Brute, for years, owned that.  So I think Axe is just following a long tradition of,  correct me if I'm wrong,  and I'm probably asking the wrong person,  but I think most women just prefer guys  do not wear cologne at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you probably are asking the wrong person.  I appreciate my humans just smelling clean.  Yeah, like humans, clean.  Yeah, like humans.  Like as if you've showered today in a way  that you care about being clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I can't stand perfumes either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dr. Mom says she likes cologne if it's subtle.  Yeah, I don't like perfume much either.  It's like it's too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm allergic, so I can't wear it.  There you go, see?  Yeah. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google, did you ever wear a burl cream?  No, I'm not that old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute.  No, I did when I was a little kid.  When I was young, my dad would put Dippity Doo in my hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He'd comb it, because he's trying to,  I don't know why he had the conceived,  the conception of it might be true,  that you have to train the hair to part.  So he would put Dippity Doo,  I never did that for my son, and he has no part,  so maybe I'm not a good father.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's me showing off my ovaries.  That's adorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a picture, I'll find it and I'll show you.  My sister really has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's just imagining a mini Leo with your hair all, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually do have a picture of it.  I'll find it while we're talking about our next commercial,  which is Carbonite.  Oh, I can do that in my sleep.  I'm a big Carbonite supporter.  Carbonite is online backup, done right.  You know, you gotta back this stuff up,  because there's pictures of you wearing Dippity Doo,  and all sorts of stuff on your hard drive,  and you lose those, you'll be sad, you'll regret it.  You'll never be happy again,  and that's why Carbonite is such a great service.  It's automatic, huge.  It's, let me think, it's automatic, it's continuous,  so you don't have to kind of remember to backup.  It's to the cloud.  That's important, because what you don't want is,  you don't want your data to get lost  by sitting on a hard drive right next to your computer,  and there's a fire, an earthquake, or something.  If it's in the cloud, it's always available.  Mac or PC, you can get it back any time,  and the beauty of Carbonite is,  it's actually cloud storage too, which is spectacular.  It means that your data is available on an iPad,  an iPhone, an Android phone, Android tablet,  from their free apps, any time you want it back.  I want you to check it out.  Carbonite.com, it's free to use for the first two weeks.  In fact, that should be enough in most cases  for your first full backup set,  and from then on, it's very fast.  It only backs up changes.  There you go.  Carbonite.com, we're ready to back up.  Check it out, two weeks free,  and when you sign up using the offer code TWIG,  you'll get two months free when you purchase.  14 months for the price of 12.  It starts at $59 a year for everything  on your internal drive.  Carbonite.com, backup done right.  Let me see.  I'm trying to log into my smug mug  because I do believe I have a picture of me with Dippity Doo,  but I cannot log in, unfortunately.  Oh well, I'll have to do it another time.  It is time for, well, let me do a couple of quickies first,  and then we'll do our tip, our number,  and our tool of the week.  Oh wait a minute, wait a minute.  No, I think I do have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, it's in the vacations folder here somewhere.  Memories.  Memories of me as a young lad with Dippity Doo in my hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, we wanna see lots of these.  That's my father.  Is that you with, oh, it's my father.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's my dad, actually.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh wow.  Yeah, I think that might be me with Dippity Doo in my hair.  I can't tell for sure.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Aw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you Smokey Leo?  What are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know, I had a habit, young.  You're making a few tokes there?  I don't know what the hell I'm doing there.  There's quite a few.  These are slides at my, oh no, this is definitely it.  These are slides that my sister had scanned.  This is the Dippity Doo.  I was trying to impress a young lady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, awesome.  You look very impressive there.  I love it, like you're so cool.  You're kinda laying your Coke, your bottle of Coke  in your sunglasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's totally cool.  I was singing, I would sing,  I've got some red roses for a blue lady to her  with my Dippity Doo in my,  I look like the Fonz, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do, you do.  That's a good shot.  That is a good shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm probably five or six there.  I think I'm pretty young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The bottle of Coke is old school too.  I love that.  It looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's kind of an interesting picture, isn't it?  I'm glad I have that.  That's an Upper New York State.  Yeah, my new profile picture.  Anyway, sorry about that.  I got a little distracted.  Google giving Cornell 22,000 square feet  of free office space for five years.  I guess Cornell's gonna build a new campus.  It got the Roosevelt Island space, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, this is a big deal.  The Cornell won that,  and we're gonna try to get the Stanford of New York.  Yeah, Stanford wanted it.  Stanford wanted it, then dropped out  because the conditions were not what they wanted,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  which is too bad.  Sure, fairly expensive.  California is about to pass a law  that will allow self-driving cars in our state as well,  as well as Nevada.  Now, I thought we had self-driving cars,  but I guess Google was doing it illegally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, right, the test cars, right?  The test cars, yeah.  People have been spotted them on the freeways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Eric Schmidt told the class of 2012  at BU, Boston University,  to be an adorer of life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty mushy, smushy, good commencement address.  Yeah, I agree.  Every class enters a history that is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  up to that point, being written for it.  This is no different.  What is different, though,  is the chance that each generation has to make history  and make it larger.  Your generation's opportunities are greater.  I like this, actually.  I don't know if it's true.  I think it probably isn't.  Your generation's opportunities are greater  than any generation's in modern history.  It's always good to tell graduates,  the future's bright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no jobs, but other than that, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your future is actually worse  than any generation I could think of,  but I'm gonna lie to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My favorite quote from this is, he said,  people bemoan this generation is growing up  living life in front of screens,  always connected to something or someone.  These people are wrong.  They're absolutely wrong.  The fact that we're all connected now is a blessing,  not a curse, and we can solve many, many problems  in the world as a result.  So get back on Facebook, graduates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He says, you can write the code for all of us.  You're connected to each other in ways  those who came before you could never have dreamed of.  You're using these connections  to strengthen the invisible ties that hold humanity together  and to deepen our understanding of the world around us.  I would agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But don't try to get a job,  because we ain't got no jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, you're gonna be mired in debt  for the rest of your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that college loan, sorry about that.  The guy who invented, he was the founder of Grand Central,  which later became Google Voice,  is now doing a conference calling business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy, is this a welcome thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of scary,  because we do have a conference call advertiser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what it'll do, no, I know that,  but what it'll do is it'll start to set new standards  for how they operate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree, I mean, it looks really cool.  I think it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think innovation in conference calls  is good for everybody and bad for airlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the Uber conference it's called.  And it's pretty cool looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not to be confused with Uber, the car service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, Uber's just the new hot word, I guess.  Uber conference is free.  So you can sign, just like Grand Central was,  and I presume it's freemium,  just like Grand Central was, I would guess.  It looks pretty cool, look at that.  Doesn't that look neat?  And when somebody's making noise,  like it will automatically shut them up, stuff like that.  All right, real quickly, before we get to tool tip,  I forgot to mention this,  I said I was going to the Facebook IPO.  It's kind of crashing and burning.  The folks at NASDAQ admit their software didn't work.  Some say they knew, but they went ahead with it anyway.  In fact, there's an interview on Business Insider,  Henry Blodgett talking to an unnamed hedge fund investor  who was pretty damn peeved.  If I understand the interview correctly,  the gist of it is that the price should have popped.  The price really never popped.  It went, started at 38 bucks, got up to 45, a mini pop,  and then ended up at 38 or something like that,  and is now down below that, I think, the last I checked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's at like 32.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the hedge fund guy is mad, he said,  because NASDAQ wasn't accepting the trades,  it should be accepting.  If it had, it would have gotten us 50, 75 bucks.  And my interpretation of that is he was ready to cash out.  Oh, sure.  He'd bought in big, and he was pissed  that he couldn't make those billions of dollars  from the Muppets, you and me, who are too stupid  to not buy Facebook at a hideously overvalued price.  That's my interpretation of it.  I think it's probably good  that the NASDAQ software didn't work.  Because in fact, Facebook never did pop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what's happening is, it's appearing that it's developing  that institutional investors had information  that the Muppets didn't have, and that's bad.  That's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a really bad thing.  So there were revised estimates on Facebook's expectations  that were whispered to...  Lower expectations.  Lower, that they thought they were gonna have  an even worse quarter than they'd had  the quarter before, which was already bad.  And that when they found this out,  they whispered it to institutional investors,  but it was never told to anybody.  There is no SEC rule requiring that, apparently.  Really?  Yeah.  According to Blodgett, this is an absurd  and unfair practice.  The estimates themselves are material information.  The consensus of smart, well-trained analysts,  who have, and this is what's important,  worked with company management to develop realistic forecasts.  Most investors don't even know these estimates exist,  let alone that they're whispered verbally  only to a handful of big investors.  All potential investors should have easy access  to these estimates, as well as any logic underlying them.  The SEC needs to change the rules here.  So because these are not published,  they are blessed by the company.  So the company, Facebook, was telling big investors,  in effect, we're not gonna make as much money  as we thought we might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's irony there, is that if the Muppets thought  that Facebook was all hot,  then the Muppets would have still bought the stock up.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  So fortunately, NASDAQ systems failed,  and there was no pop.  Nobody got too badly screwed.  Well, maybe they did.  It's at 32 bucks now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now the-  I think I'm buying it.  I feel investors are suing, it looks like.  Yes. Yes.  Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  It's just a mess.  Now, I think the case can be made,  and Robert Scoble was making this case on Sunday on Twitter,  that Facebook priced it exactly right.  Because the whole point for Facebook is,  they wanna get as high a price as they can  and actually sell the entire issue at that price,  because that's how much cash they're gonna get.  Usually, the investment bankers try to get a lower price  out the door so that their premium customers  can buy it at the lower price,  then sell it on the open market to the Muppets,  take advantage of them,  make a big cash out in less than a day,  and in fact, what happened was it went off at 38 bucks,  ended at 38 bucks, nobody made a big killing,  and Facebook made the most cash it possibly could have made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with that.  That's the point of the IPO.  Somebody here in Seoul was arguing  that they're gonna hurt themselves.  A guy who knows his financial stuff,  they're gonna hurt themselves because-  They were greedy.  No, no, because the real value of the stock to the company  is to motivate the employees,  and if the employees don't see a big upside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so now the employees strike price  will be pretty similar to the actual price  in the stock market, maybe even they'll be underwater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, for a while they will be, but that's all predictable.  I think I own Google stock, I own Apple and Amazon,  I think I'd buy Facebook at 30.  You're a Muppet.  A Muppet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a common term.  That's a common term.  Jiggle my tummy, jiggle my tummy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apparently that's what the big shot investors call us  retail investors who are too stupid.  I wanna say Muggles.  I wanna say Muggles.  We're like the Muggles.  They're people that they plan to take advantage of,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  basically.  Right, like the wizards, right?  You know what they're doing.  Yeah, and the Muggles.  They have the back door info, and then there's the Muggles  who are just sort of oblivious idiots.  Exactly.  It's insulting, that's totally insulting.  It's totally insulting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's exactly how they think of us.  I just want you to know.  Ain't so good. No pop for them.  No pop for them.  No pop for you.  The real issue was that the Facebook price was  hugely overvalued because it was,  it depends on what you think the earnings were,  but it was somewhere between 30 and 100 times earnings,  and Google is, I don't know what the Google stock price is,  something like 10 times earnings.  So just really overvalued.  And so it was just too expensive.  It was more expensive than it should have been.  Google's at 20 times earnings, roughly.  Apple, let's see what Apple is.  Oops.  AAPL, there you go.  Apple's at 13.9 times earnings, price to earnings.  Facebook's like 100.  So that means that the stock is too much,  given how much money they make.  And then of course, there's the larger question of  their market's starting to get, you know,  they had bad last quarter,  they're gonna have a bad quarter this quarter  because display ads aren't working,  and more people are using mobile now  than are using the web,  and Facebook hasn't yet come up with a coherent way  to make money off that mobile.  You're buying basically, you're making,  I'm trying to talk Jeff out of it.  You're making a bet on Mark Zuckerberg, I think.  And that he will somehow magically,  and I don't think he's that magic,  figure out a way to make money on 900 million people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just believe in platforms,  and I think that Facebook remains a platform.  Now the problem with Facebook versus Google is that,  you know, it's not an open platform,  and somebody could come along,  but the switching cost is high.  I think that Amazon and Google and Facebook are platforms,  and that's where the value falls these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And this is why I'm so glad that I don't buy tech stocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, me too.  I mean, but that caveat, but it's not an open platform.  That's just the killer for me.  It's a huge one.  It's a huge one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, they're interesting.  That's politics, not money.  Politics is good for money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tom Friedman had a column, I think this week,  I don't know where I am or what we come in,  in which Jeff Bezos said,  the gatekeepers are dying.  The easy thing about that is,  is Jeff Bezos the new gatekeeper?  Well, not if he's a platform, right?  The gatekeeper makes and controls a scarcity.  A platform opens up for whatever the hell happens.  So in that sense, is Facebook a platform akin to Amazon?  Well, Amazon's closed in some ways.  Facebook's closed in ways.  Google's closed less, but still closed in ways.  We have the open public internet owned  and run by private companies.  And that's, Facebook's just part of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I guess as they say,  as the reporter on the local news always says in his closeout,  only time will tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's true.  It is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Will Google and Facebook ever succeed?  Only time will tell.  I think Google, when it went off,  its IPO was at $85  priced earnings of roughly 67.  So it was high.  It was high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How long ago was that IPO?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  19, I'm sorry, 2004.  2004, eight years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or do you think that in eight years from now,  we'll be sitting here talking about Facebook's stock price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The best analysis, simple analysis I see  is that a billion customers at a hundred billion valuation,  it's $100 lifetime value per customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Amazon's price to earning is 82.  It's pretty high.  So maybe Facebook isn't so overpriced.  I don't know.  This is why, I go back and forth.  This is why I buy market indexes.  No load mutual funds, because I'm an idiot.  The readability upward,  Gina, it looks like you wanted to talk about that.  I don't want to leave that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we can probably save it for another show.  It's been going on for a while,  but we can save it for another show.  The readability launch read lists  where you can grab a bunch of articles together  and send them to your iPhone or your iPad  in kind of a clean format without the advertising.  And actually, I feel like Jeff has to have  a lot to say about this, but maybe next show.  Next show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're running out of time.  Let's get Gina Trippini's tip of the week.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last week, we talked about Google rolling out  their new Knowledge Graph search results,  their things, not strings update,  which basically takes the right side  of your search results page  and shows kind of a formatted block of information  about something when Google knows what you're talking about.  I just got it.  It rolled out to my search results a few days ago,  and there are some pretty cool things you can see here.  These results are kind of like one box on steroids.  So one box is like, hey, what time is it in Austin, Texas?  And it would tell you kind of right  at the top of the search results.  But the things, not strings is this huge box  on the right side.  So you can do a few kind of cool things with it.  Lifehacker did a list of five  kind of interesting things you can do.  First, if you search for a person,  like if you search for Leo Laporte,  you get an excerpt from Leo's Wikipedia page

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  where you grab it.  That's what Adam Curry was kind of mocking that.  Like these are the facts that Google finds  in Wikipedia.  This is it?  This is the knowledge graph?  Your Wikipedia entry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's part of it.  Some of it's from Google+, some of it's from Wikipedia.  I mean, Wikipedia provides a lot of structured data  in a way that's very predictable, right?  Not a lot of services do yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It presumably will get better,  but right now it is Wikipedia and Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's basically Wikipedia and Google+.  And some people, like I think if you search  for a big name author like Stephen King,  you'll get links to books and other things.  Like I was wondering, you know,  when are my books and apps gonna show up  in my knowledge graph results?  But you can also search for,  so you can search for cities and places.  If you search for something like Austin, Texas,  you'll get the Wikipedia excerpt, a Google map.  You'll get what time it is in Austin at the moment,  the weather.  You get a lot of facts about that one place.  You can do the same thing if you're looking for a post office  or an Italian restaurant.  You'll get the nearest, you know, one's nearest to you.  So it's kind of like the best of, you know,  Google's sort of semantic search all in one place.  And because they're doing it on the right side there,  you get it, you get it.  They have a lot more real estate to show that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it does have a little link that says  report a problem at the bottom.  So presumably the crowdsourcing will improve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, hopefully it will improve.  I think they can do better.  I think they can add more facts,  but it's getting, it's pretty good to begin.  You can search also, last tip,  you can search for like a venue.  So if I search for Petco Park,  which is the Padres, where the Padres play here in San Diego,  you get the map and the facts about Petco,  but you also get a list of events.  So what's going on at Petco.  And the other interesting bit is you get this  people also search for, which of course,  for an ego search, this is really interesting.  Like, you know, it's interesting to see  if some people search for your name, you know,  what are the other people, who else are they searching for?  And actually Leo, Jeff and Leo,  you two are the first two suggestions  in my people also search for list.  And Sarah Lane and Anil and Tom Merritt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's pretty good.  That's funny, that's almost the same as mine.  I get Sarah Lane, Tom Merritt, Kevin Rose, Steve Gibson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, obviously, you know,  Google knows a lot that, you know,  knows that the Twit Gang is sort of is connected and related.  Now, I mean, that sounds like that's just  from searching search patterns,  but I imagine they're using some circles data as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's gotta be, I bet you it's circles stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's gotta be circles as well.  I think it must be, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right, thank you, Gina.  That's a great tip.  Your number of the week, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I couldn't, for some reason,  I couldn't put it in the rundown, but here it is.  Google Vice President David Lawy said  that two thirds of Google acquisitions have been successful.  Then a hundred companies it's bought since 2001.  Interesting.  I found that vaguely interesting.  And I think, you know, if you buy that,  it's not a bad percentage at all,  given what companies like Yahoo and AOL have done companies.  So he cited DoubleClick and AdMob as successful operations  and admitted that Slide was in the one third.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's kind of sad, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but though he said that 85% of that team  ended up working for YouTube and they've done well there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, good.  Oh, good.  My tool, well, I ordered one  and I'm excited about the Galaxy S3.  Scoble saw one and he said it's fast, it's gorgeous,  and he's saying, here's $700 on Amazon Wireless.  Holy cow.  It will be an AT&T phone, but it will work, I guess,  with T-Mobile, just not on the HSPA Plus network,  just on the Edge network.  So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon Wireless?  Oh, it's a social media-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  AmazonWireless.com, yeah, they have a wireless store.  That's where I've been lately buying my phones.  So-  Oh, that's a new one on me.  Yeah.  Usually, it has either unlocked  or it will have a, from the carriers as well.  It's gonna be end of the month  that this phone will come out on AT&T,  but this, I bought, actually, I went to Expansys  and bought the international unlocked version  because you know me, I like to spend lots of money  on phones I only use for a month.  But I'll tell you what, but the minute it arrives,  I will show you.  It's not unusual.  Usually, they're six or 700 bucks because they're unlocked  and you're not subsidized and all that stuff.  And I don't know what I'm gonna do with my note.  I love my note.  I might be sad.  I might be really sad.
