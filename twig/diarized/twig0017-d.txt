Gina Tripani is on vacation.  She's in London.  Lucky girl.  But Jeff Jarvis is with us from the Buzz Machine,  buzzmachine.com, and the author of What Would Google Do?  A business book using Google's best practices to help keep  your company in line.  Thanks for joining us, Jeff.  Great to have you.  Also here today, Mr. Matt Cutts from Google itself, from the  mothership.  Matt is in charge of killing spam on web pages.  He's the guy you can thank.  God's work.  Yeah, yes, it is God's work.  You can thank him for all those link farms disappearing.  That was, you know, it was a couple of years ago that link  farms were just eating up Google search results.  Can we thank you for fixing that?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Well, the team, you know, they do all the hard work.  I just sort of find the parade and stand in front.  But yeah, they've done amazing work on reducing the amount of  web spam.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you would do a Google search and half the  pages would be just, you know, link farms.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and if it happened for a medical query, then you  really start to feel bad.  So it's nice that it's a little cleaner now.  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, it's a lot cleaner.  It's like it was night and day.  So let me ask you real quickly before we get to the main  topic, which, of course, is Chrome OS.  Google made its announcement this week.  Is everybody at Google now using a Droid?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Not everybody, because, you know, last year for the holiday  season, they gave away a lot of G1s.  So there's a lot of people who still have a G1.  I had an iPhone and I'm thinking after the holidays,  I'm going to reassess and ask, you know, do I want to go for  an Android and if so, which one?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I'm in it.  You know, my sister got an heiress and she says she really  likes the heiress.  That's the less expensive one running 1.6 instead of 2.0, but  doesn't have the keyboard.  So it's lighter and she likes it a lot.  It's very elegant.  And this drives me crazy.  Hers has seven home screens.  I only have three because I have a Google experience phone.  Can you please tell them I want more pages?  Please.  I'll pass the feedback on.  I'm sure they've heard it once or twice.  You like the Droid?  On balance, fantastic.  It's absolutely every bit as good as the iPhone.  And I'm very bullish on the application front.  In fact, that's one of the stories today is a couple of  very big iPhone developers have said, we're leaving the iPhone  platform because we don't like the way Apple controls, how  tightly Apple controls it.  And the presumption is they're moving towards Android.  I think you'll see a lot of exciting stuff happening in the  Android application space very, very soon.  I also got the dock.  Have you played with it?  Oh, the dock is really, you got to get the dock.  You know why?  Because it turns it into like this  executive desk appliance.  You know, it has the time.  It's like a fancy digital clock.  It's kind of like Chumby without the padding.  Basically, it's a Chumby.  Yeah, because you've got weather.  I could play music.  I could do a slideshow.  It is.  It's kind of like a Chumby.  Boy, I never thought of it that way.  You really took all the fun out of it, Jeff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I think I just made it more cuddly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's not exactly cuddly.  But the slideshow is much better than the Chumby screen.  I'm really, really happy with the Droid.  I think it's spectacular.  Keyboard?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's the word?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Unusable.  That's why the Ares might be really a good choice if you  have fat fingers like I do.  I end up using the on-screen keyboard all the time.  And so why have the extra weight and complexity of a  slide-out keyboard if you don't really need it?  Nice job.  Yeah, it's really good.  I think you'll like it, Matt.  Here I am selling Matt on a Google phone.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  I've played with it a little bit.  It looks really nice.  So a few colleagues have it, and we sort of borrow it and  ogle it and play with it a little bit and talk about the  screen quality.  Screen is what blows you away.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The resolution is really high.  It's fantastic.  And very, very, very legible.  Yeah, I really love it.  Really, really happy with it.  I just like seeing competition.  And I'm a little bit with these guys who are saying, Apple  needs somebody to say, ease up a little bit.  And one of them was the guy who did the Facebook application  for the iPhone.  He also did a very similar Facebook application on  Android, and he said, this is it.  He works at Facebook, of course.  And the other, which surprised me a little bit, is Rogamiba,  which this guy is a premier Apple developer.  And if he's saying, I don't want to develop for the iPhone  anymore, I think that's fairly significant.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, not to get ahead of ourselves, but I've been  trying to figure out, since I watched the Chrome OS video,  that if Chrome OS apps really are just any web app, that  truly is open.  And that becomes the model conflict between Chrome OS and  the Apple world.  What they said on the Chrome OS video was the challenge is  curation.  It's trying to find the best apps among hundreds of  millions, as opposed to iPhone.  There is a limited set because Apple limits the set.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  Well, we might as well just get to the story of the moment,  because really, that is the biggest story of all.  And Jeff, you watch the hour, what is it, exactly the same  length as the Wave video?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Same as Wave.  I said on Twitter today that I think that's the standard  length for a Google sitcom.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One hour and 20 minutes, all about Chrome.  Was the video the announcement, or was it just a  how-to video after the announcement?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, it was the announcement.  They showed the three minute what it is video.  The product manager yelled at Michael Arrington and told  him he couldn't ask questions from where he was and had to  go stand in line.  You're kidding.  There was no cheering.  You're kidding.  No, so there was no effect versus Wave, where there were  these wonderful geek moments of people, yay,  plotting every feature.  I think that happened only once here.  But it was really informational as to where  they're headed.  There isn't a product today.  It's just open sourced.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So yeah, well, let's cover the headlines of this  announcement.  That was number one, which is you can build it today, but  we're not going to offer it until roughly September of  next year.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The big shock to me was that they're going to prescribe  the hardware, the hardware set.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, you have to have, for instance, an SSD drive.  And it sounds like it's going to be just netbooks, which  also surprised me a little bit.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Well, and I think what's kind of interesting is with Chrome,  you can look at what they've done with Chrome.  They have Chrome, which is the Google Experience, and then  they have Chromium, which is the open source version.  So if it's Chrome, it has all the official  Google sanction stuff.  But anybody can take the source code of Chromium, the  open source version, and hack it up, do whatever they  want, change how it works.  So the impression that I get is they're going to do the  exact same thing where they'll have Chrome OS, which is the  official Google version.  And then they'll have Chromium OS, and that's the  open source version.  And you can download that, build it.  And if you wanted to slap it onto a desktop or try to do  something really weird with it, you could still do that.  But it just wouldn't be certified.  Exactly.  And the same sort of thing with Android.  It's like if you want the Google Experience, then you  have the official Google Apps.  But Android itself is open source.  You can try throwing it onto any device you can get it to  install on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, forgive me, but it sounds like a very clever ploy  because there are two issues when you offer a new  operating system.  The barrier to entry for a new operating system is devices,  hardware support, and applications.  Google kind of has the applications problem handled  because there are no applications.  You just use your browser.  That's the application.  But the bigger issue is hardware support.  And by saying, well, we're going to support a very limited  set of hardware.  And those are the drivers I presume Google will provide,  or at least work with the manufacturers to provide.  And if you want to run it on anything else, well, do the  open source development.  So they kind of have the best of both worlds.  I think it's fairly clever on Google's part.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that will work pretty well.  So in fact, I'm Skyping on a netbook that I ordered  Wednesday night, or this week after I heard the  announcement.  So there's a page that says which netbooks have been tested  and worked with it.  So I ordered one from Amazon, got Saturday delivery.  So I'm Skyping on XP.  But I've built a version that is a USB drive.  So I can boot this netbook and I can be running Chrome OS.  Oh, how interesting.  So you're already doing that.  And it works really well.  And so once I had the USB drive, I said, well, let's  throw it into my ThinkPad, which is over to my left here.  And that boots up as well.  So Linux.  Are you trying to print out anything yet?  I haven't tried to print anything.  They said they'll have more to announce about printing, but  there's nothing in the dialogues about printing yet.  But what's really neat is officially the ThinkPad is not  supported at all.  But I was able to get it to boot.  The mouse worked, the keyboard worked.  The display was full resolution.  So I have a 1,400 by 1,050 screen.  And that showed up just fine.  The wireless didn't work.  But other than that, pretty much everything worked.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Which is very much like any hardware that  you put Linux on.  Those are the little tricky things.  The fiddly bits.  Well, this is great.  Because I thought we were going to have to wait until next  week, because I know that Gina's running it right now.  So first of all, what netbook did you purchase, Matt?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  If you find there's a web page, and we can tweet it later,  which is the developer hardware that they've tried it on, I'm  running an ASUS 1008HA.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a sweet.  That's the C-show.  I love that netbook.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Yeah, you just ordered it off Amazon.  I ordered it the night that the announcement happened, and I  got it this morning.  And it is really sweet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it ran out of the box in every case.  Every bit of hardware, everything runs.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Now, of course there's still rough edges.  They're shooting for this to be released with hardware.  For example, on the webcast, they mentioned full width  keyboards, which the EPC doesn't have a full width  keyboard.  So there's still a few rough edges.  Alternating full screen versus not full screen and  stuff like that.  But you could have a six hour battery life, and if you're on  a plane with Wi-Fi, you could surf with your Chrome OS or  for the entire plane trip.  So I might try that over Thanksgiving.  Wow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  With the, I usually specialize in having ignorant  questions for Gina, so I'll do this for you today.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Thank god somebody's willing to ask them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  With the far more efficient light stack, does that have an  impact on battery power as well, you think?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  That is a great question.  I don't know.  I'll have to run some tests, because I was planning on just  wiping Windows XP off of this machine after I got done with  this podcast.  But maybe I'll run and see how long the battery lasts and then  see how long the battery lasts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do some tests for us.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Yeah, what I have noticed is the boot time is phenomenal.  Even now, it's really, really quick.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're touting seven seconds.  You're not running off an SSD though, are you?  Or you are?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Well, it has a hard drive.  But I think it also has, I'm booting it off a USB thumb  drive, so it's flash in that sense.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They kept saying on the video that the goal is that it should  turn on like a TV.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Microsoft's been saying that for 12 years.  It's easier said than done.  Seven seconds would be nice.  But one way you get that is by requiring an SSD.  That's kind of a way to kind of fudge it.  My Mac boots very, very fast off an SSD.  It makes a big difference.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  And I think the difference is it's almost like with Chrome  where speed matters.  And Chrome has done very well as a browser.  It's something like 4 and 1 half percent, according to some  of the metrics at this point, after a little less than a  year.  But the big win is now all the browsers, Firefox, Safari,  even Internet Explorer 9, they're starting to talk about  speed.  So by changing the conversation to be how fast do  computers boot and really paying attention to that, or  how standard's compliant, or how fast is your browser, that  just makes the web better for everybody.  And that's really where the win is, I think.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So this all makes sense in the announcements of two weeks  ago about what's it, Speedy, the HTML add-on, and Go is the  programming language.  All of it's about speed.  Everything's about speed.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  A large fraction of what we think about at Google is just  speed.  I didn't even realize that your HTTP connection might only  be able to load two things at once, two images at once on  one stream.  So there's so much optimization that  could easily be done.  I talked to someone who had looked at some of the tools  that Google makes available for free to speed up their  website.  And they sped up their website by 70% without making any  major changes, just sort of tweaking a few things.  So there's a lot of opportunity to make the web  better and make a better experience for everybody,  which will just be a lot more fun.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Part of the assumption, going back when I was starting to  put up websites, Oh My Children back in 94, we learned  immediately, but those were in the slow days, that if you  had a slow site, you lost traffic.  You speed it up, you get more traffic.  But that was also when we had the slow web.  As we all get on broadband, I think some web producers and  content people thought, OK, that speed's not an issue  anymore, because everybody's fast, so I can put up all  kinds of fancy crap and not worry about that.  And that's just, according to Google,  that's just not the case.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You see pages with 100,000-byte images and more all  the time now.  It's as if they forgot what we went through.  When we talked last week about Google might downrank those  slow pages and give them worse results.  Which puts you in a terrible panic.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh my god.  It's Leo Ruhlender's server.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the thing.  You can pay lip service to speed, but it's not, well, I  guess Google's attacking it on many different fronts, and I  hope others will follow suit.  But it's a difficult problem, because slowdowns happen all  over the place, including network latency itself, which  it's not really your fault.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Right.  Well, and we've noticed speed matters in a lot of ways,  because when we moved from, we used to update our index  every 30 days.  And whenever we'd put out a new index, people  would search more.  So it's not just how fast your website is, it's how fresh  your information is.  Wow, that is interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How often do you index now, or is that a state secret?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Oh, it's continuous, so we're always indexing.  If you do a blog post and we don't catch it within a few  minutes or a few hours, if it's a significant blog post,  that would be a failure in our book.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you're achieving that.  Almost every case I can see.  You're keeping track of tweets for crying out loud.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is there any calculation for how often, though, there's  kind of a full refresh of, I don't know how to ask the  question, but are there metrics?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a very good question.  A good way to think about it is that there is a large  fraction of documents in our index that we want to refresh  every few days at most.  And that's probably the largest part of what  people would see.  There are some documents that don't change quite as often,  or that don't have as much page rank.  And so those, it's OK if you refresh them once a month or  they're about something like that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's running already on your C shell.  It's running well on your C shell.  I mean, I guess it makes sense.  I mean, you're running from an existing  operating system, Linux.  Do you know what kernel version it's using?  Is it the latest kernel version?  Is that going to change?  Does that change with every new build?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Yeah, I've just poked around a little bit on chromium.org,  which is the place to go and find more  information about it.  But it's a recent Linux kernel.  I think it's in the 2.6 series.  I don't know whether it's the very most up to date, but it's  relatively recent.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is it customized for this?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  That is a good question.  I don't know.  I know that the canonical folks, the people who are  behind Ubuntu, have done a blog post that said they're  under contract to do some work.  So one big thing from the webcast was that Google said,  we're going to be good open source citizens, just like we  have been with Chrome.  So if we fix bugs or apply patches that go upstream to  WebKit or the Linux kernel or the GNU project, then that's  really nice, because it's not getting held tightly by Google.  The good stuff is making its way upstream.  And so everybody benefits, not just the chromium users.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love this video.  What is Chrome OS?  Great video.  I just think that's just fantastic.  So how hard was it to build, Matt?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Well, there's a couple ways to do it.  You can build it from the sources, and you'll want to be  a power user to do that.  But I was using an internal Google tool, but you would  certainly expect you'll be able to download images pretty  soon, so Gadget, Ryan Block's website.  There were a bunch of places that were starting to talk  about VMware images.  That would be very simple, then.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You just run a VMware, and you just open it up, and you're  done.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Yeah, the only thing you miss is the sense of speed, because  if you're still running it virtualized.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  Well, I'm going to get a seashell and do it, because it  seems great.  So you used a tool that put it on the USB key and made it  bootable and all of that.  Or is that all that available on the Chromium site?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  There are some tools on the Chromium site.  So my guess is within a week or so, there will be people who  are just posting very easy one, two, three step guides.  Right now, it's like 15 or 16 steps, but it won't be long  before people are just like,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm telling you, go eBay, sell the thumb drives with Chrome  L'Oreal.  Just sell them already done.  I'll buy it.  I'll buy it.  Nice little business on the side.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, what's amazing, the canonical Ubuntu took off,  because they would just give you free CDs.  That was the key.  So why not let you have free USB drives?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the new model, less than free.  We're going to talk about that post, by the way, in just a  bit from Tim O'Reilly.  I think a thoughtful post, but he didn't take the next step.  And I want to talk about the next step on that as well.  But we've got so much to say about Chrome OS.  I want to make sure that we get everybody's questions,  answer, and so forth.  By the way, Etchu, who installed the GDGT image, the  VMware image, says it launched in five seconds.  So they may be getting good results.  That was on a 3 gigahertz iMac.  That's pretty good.  That's pretty impressive.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  One thing that struck me about it is that I'm curious about  two things.  What will Apple do about this?  What will Microsoft do about this?  I ask that what would question a lot.  I don't know why.  And in the case of Apple, I think we're about to overload  tabs as a metaphor for our worlds.  I'm sure you're the same.  I end up with 30, 40 tabs open, and there's no easy way  to manage it, and there's no easy way to deal with it.  And it drives me nutty, and there's no tool set to really  do anything.  One thing about Chrome that's nice is you have the pinnable  tabs for web applications.  So your Gmail's always there and so on, which is great.  But your entire world is tabs or separate instances and  windows of Chrome OS.  And I just think if Apple were doing this, they'd come up  with the new version of desktop, the new version of  some metaphor that makes this world more easily organized.  And I don't think tabs is it.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Yeah, and one thing that you found in the webcast is they  were very clear.  I think Sundar Parchai said, this is how it looks today.  When it launches in a year, it's very likely that the UI  will change.  So they showed a bunch of ideas like panels and an almost  overview, expose sort of thing, where you could see a  bunch of different windows and tabs open.  But they also, I think, put up a video of UI concepts.  So they're very open about the fact that they haven't claimed  to figure out the information overload problem completely.  And they might change the UI quite a bit to sort of say,  OK, let's try it this way.  Let's try it that way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How much security, how much attention are they paying to  security?  So much.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Good.  Yeah, so the watch words that they mentioned in the webcast  were threefold, speed, simplicity, and security.  So speed, booting in seven seconds, they showed that in  the webcast.  And that was on a live machine.  Simplicity is given by the fact that it's basically just a web  browser.  If you know how to use a web browser, you're not going to  be too confused with Chrome OS.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No installing, there's no updating, there's no nothing.  You just click and there it is.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Everything's going.  You've got tabs, you just surf.  Everything's a web app.  Nothing at all you have to worry about as far as updates  or anything like that.  And the security aspect, it turns out they've done a lot of  work, and I suspect they're going to do a lot more, to the  point of locking down the BIOS and have cryptographic signing  of the entire verified boot process to sort of say, OK, if  you get malware, you just turn your machine off, reboot, seven  seconds later you're clean again.  And if at any point it tries to be persistent, you're  checking each chain as you're booting.  And if you reach something that's bad, you can restore it  from, I guess, either the net or from another partition.  Yeah, so there's a couple different modes where they can  restore it.  But what sounds really nice is this will be a machine where  all the patches are applied, it's all applied for you, you  always have the latest version of Chrome to run things, but  you never have to worry about viruses.  Now, they were very clear.  They said never say never.  You can never completely stop a computer from being the sort  of thing that's insecure or able to be broken.  But from what I can see, they're putting a lot of work  into trying to verify things all the way down to the metal  so that there's not an easy place for people to sneak in.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, if you're going to build an operating system from  scratch, that seems like something you can make, which  should make, is a goal, obviously.  Yeah.  Somebody, I guess it was Leander Kahaney in his Cult of  Mac blog said they didn't mention touch.  What about touch?  And that may be the buzzword of 2010.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They showed a chart that showed laptop to netbook, one  end of the scale, and then from the other end of the scale  was smartphone to tablet.  And it was almost as if they were only talking about this  side, the netbook side of the scale.  You think so, Matt?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  All I know is that the current system, the touchpad works  just like a mouse, everything exactly how you'd expect.  I have no idea whether they're planning any sort of  multi-touch or touch screen or anything like that.  Presumably, if the hardware supported it so it looked like  a standard mouse, it could support it.  But as far as I know, right now they're just planning a  standard paradigm where you have a  mouse with a touchpad.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The other question I had is that it assumes ubiquitous  connectivity, which is the great dream, which we see all  the more reason why Google wants white spaces rededicated  and so on and so forth.  But I've found that trying to use my Gmail on Gears when  I'm offline just cuts off so much functionality, I can't do  much of anything.  And if everything is on the web and everything is a web  app, I wonder about that plane flight where I don't have  Wi-Fi, would I be able to do anything?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  That's a great question because I think there are two  trends.  There's the Wi-Fi everywhere trend where Google is giving  you free Wi-Fi in airports and airplanes over the holidays.  So you're getting to the number of places where you  don't have connectivity is getting smaller.  And then HTML5 and Gears and offline is getting more and  more capable.  And it's unclear exactly where those will meet and what the  use case might be.  If you go to rural Kentucky or Tennessee, there might be  spots where this wouldn't be the ideal experience.  But I think Sundar said something interesting, which is  this might be your secondary machine.  You might have a machine that runs Windows or Mac so it can  do Photoshop and run executables.  So this could be your secondary machine, but it might  be your primary machine in terms of time.  So if you're looking for a machine where you're going to  meetings and you're just surfing and you're just doing  simple web stuff, you might actually  spend more time on this.  But at least for right now, yeah, you do need connectivity  unless you've got really good caching.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think that was a little bit of a cop out.  He said that in part in answer to a question about having  Photoshop or more complicated apps and whether those would  be things that don't exist as web apps.  And so yes, you'll have another machine.  If you're going to be editing movies, you're probably going  to do it on that machine.  I buy that.  But if I'm going to go off on a trip for a week, I want to  have the confidence that I can use this machine even in a  cave, at least for a while.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Yeah, and the offline capabilities are  getting quite good.  Whether you could use it for a week, I don't know.  But I tried an experiment this past month where I went  Microsoft software free for 30 days.  I used Linux.  I didn't use any Microsoft Office.  And that worked surprisingly well.  The only thing I really used was my browser.  And then maybe I'd take some snapshots that I could upload  them to the web.  So the amount of stuff that you do that's not in the browser  is getting smaller and smaller.  The connectivity is still a key issue.  And that would be sort of an open question.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's a larger question at which Randall Kennedy raises  in InfoWorld.  He says, yeah, it's Chrome's.  It's not going to happen.  And a couple of points you've already responded to.  One is that he doesn't like the UI.  You said this isn't the final UI.  He doesn't like it that it's running on Linux because of  spotty hardware support.  Google's been very clear about how they're  going to handle that.  But his final complaint has some merit, which is the world  isn't going to buy an inflexible OS.  And it's kind of related to this offline thing.  If you're buying a laptop that's kind of locked down to  do it this way, doesn't have applications on the laptop,  they're all web-based applications, you're buying  something pretty limited.  There's no hard drive.  There's no DVD drive.  There's no spindle.  You can't install your own apps.  You can't run your own apps.  You can't have your own data on the hard drive.  Why would somebody do that when inexpensive, small  computers are out there that do all of that?  Why would you settle for the lesser experience?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Well, I can give you my personal take, which is my mom  was visiting this week.  And she had a Vista laptop that she had bought a couple  years ago.  And she had the screen resolution set wrong.  So everything on the screen was jaggy.  She had 15 different programs running.  Go to the bottom of an Apple, please.  We actually did.  So are you, Matt?  No, no.  We bought her a Mac laptop for Thanksgiving or for  Christmas one year.  And she hasn't used it yet.  Oh, interesting.  So she's still on Windows.  When the Vista came out, we tried to buy everybody Macs  so that we wouldn't have to do any tech support.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I make a deal with relatives.  They say, you can buy anything you want.  But if you buy Windows, don't call me.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  I don't want to hear about it.  Several of the family members did switch.  She was one who stayed on Windows.  And she had this suboptimal experience where she didn't  even know how to adjust her screen resolution to get rid  of these jaggy fonts.  And she had a lot of things running in a  memory she didn't need.  So I think there definitely is an opportunity.  A lot of people think these netbooks have to be limited.  But it seemed like in the webcast they were talking about  full width keyboards with pretty good screens and pretty  fast processors, entirely reasonable.  So I think the experience, if you can get it sufficiently  fast and smooth, might be quite nice.  If all you're doing is surfing and web email, this could run  for hours and hours and hours on your battery.  And you don't ever have to worry about viruses.  You don't ever have to configure or  mess with settings.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is really an old argument in the PC industry.  This goes back to Jeff Raskin, who says the computer should  be an appliance.  We've made it far too complicated for people to use.  I would raise one other thing.  It's the security thing.  If the price is I'm going to give up my security for  flexibility, I think there's a lot of people besides your mom,  maybe even some sophisticated users, who would say, well, I  want the security.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Yeah, an engineer on my team bought or was going to buy one  of these netbooks the day after the announcement because  he was going back home for Thanksgiving.  And I don't know about you guys, but it's a relatively  common procedure that the first day back for the  holidays, you're cleaning off scumware and doing tech  support.  So if you can drop off or drop ship a computer and you're  like, OK, just use this and you can surf the web and I  never have to give you tech support or pull off the  scumware, that might be an OK bargain.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I can see that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I think it goes to some ideas of having a partition on  your machine.  Jonathan Zittrain has talked about this, that you have the  safe part and the fun part.  And that you keep your world in the safe part there.  But then if you want to go off and do porn, what the heck?  And get the malware there as a result.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It sounds like this is the perfect porn machine, though, I  have to say.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, except somebody in the chat room linked to this on  all things digital at the Wall Street Journal site and  wondered about, as always comes up, the privacy  advocates come out of the woodwork wearing their I'm a  privacy advocate t-shirt.  But what it does, I think, I'm just trying to read this in two  seconds here, but I think there is an interesting issue  here in the sense that Google knew what you searched for and  clicked on.  But now through this, Google does have through Chrome OS,  one could say through the browser, but not really, but  through Chrome OS, now starts to have a meta view of your  behavior.  Which as a targeting company is a beautiful thing and  potentially a valuable thing, a good thing to help you.  Because what can they do with that to help you algorithmically  improve your experience?  However, they know you went to porn.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know how I'd respond to that as I think about it more  and more is there's plenty of money for Google to make  without being evil.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I absolutely agree.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it would behoove them.  Plenty of money to lose.  By being evil.  Exactly.  So it behooves them, and I think that they must be  sensible to this, to be completely above board and  knowing that people are going to have this objection and say,  look, we do just fine giving you the ads you want and giving  you the information you got without invading your privacy.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Right.  And I think you saw this play out with Chrome and to a lesser  extent with Android and Wave where Google also open sourced  the large chunks of all that stuff.  But with Chrome, there was the initial excitement and then  there was a wave of privacy worries where Google was going  to see everything you did.  And going open source was a big deterrent for the concern  because people could look at exactly when data  went to Google.  And to this day, there are a few people who worry about it,  but most people can dig into the source code and verify, no,  there's no information where Google is spying on you.  And if you're typing in a URL, then some small percentage of  it goes to Google.  But then we've promised to get rid of it within 24 or 48 hours.  So I think you will see some people who say, well, I don't  want Google to know what I'm doing, not even thinking, well,  my ISP currently knows everything that I'm doing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  In a more subpoenaable format.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  They actually have your credit card, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My favorite tweet of the week, there's this wonderful blogger  named Penelope Trunk who made a lot of controversy when she  tweeted her miscarriage.  That's another story.  And so her tweet this week was, there's a  virus on my laptop.  Our tech guy will ask me how I got it.  I want to lie, but he'll figure it out.  So I'm confessing early, porn.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  It's the perfect porn computer.  OK, I'm just saying that.  Not that you care.  Not that I care about that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Just for others who might.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm just pointing it out.  It's my job.  No, I'd say, do you get the sense, I want to ask you this,  Matt, because you work for Google, so we'll recuse you on  this, but do you get the sense, Jeff, that Google does  things like the data liberation front tell me that  Google fully understands the risks to people not trusting  it and is going to bend over backwards to make stuff open,  transparent, because that's their business.  That's the only way they can succeed.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm a confessed Google fanboy.  So I agree with that and believe that, but I think that  Google does have a PR problem here.  When I went out and visited the campus on my book tour,  where I saw Matt, I don't think I'm going to give away a  secret, Matt, that the conversation afterwards was  kind of Google being aware of that, that there's a PR issue.  I think I made this reference when we talked with Oum about  the book deal.  Google thinks of itself, I think, as stuffalupicus.  And little kids look at it and see a  furry monster sometimes.  And so I think that they do what they believe is bending  over backwards, but that's probably not  far enough in some cases.  So when you see these things about these fears of the OS, I  agree with you.  I don't think it goes anywhere because the cost is too great,  but I think Google has to find a way to make promises like  data liberation front so upfront and find the ways that  you can say to the world, hold us to this, as Matt just said,  when you can go in and have auditors who look at the  source code.  Same issue when I found that there were sites being kicked  off of AdSense because there was thought to be Link  Farms, and there was a famous case, I forget the name of the  company, who said, no, no, no, this is what we really do, and  you ruined our business.  And that's the one case.  I argue that Google is an auction marketplace.  It's a marketplace.  It doesn't really make decisions, but that's one case  where Google does have godlike authority to just say, nope,  you're off.  And they'd be better off to have some kind of jury of  peers to decide these matters.  So I think there is a necessity for Google to deal as  aggressively as possible with these questions before the  questions come up.  And I think that they're good at it, but they can be better  at it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Does Google have effectively a public editor, an ombudsman,  somebody who reflects public interest?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  We don't have an official ombudsman, no.  One thing that we do have is this culture where a lot of  Googlers are willing to call foul if they see  anything going wrong.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I know people like Chris DeBona wouldn't be working  there if he thought there were anything going on.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Well, and I recently had an experience where I had  approval from a bunch of executives within the company  to launch what I think is going to be a pretty cool feature.  And we got all the way down to the person who was going to  flip the switch, and they're like, OK, I need to know more  information.  You need to reassure me that this is going to go the right  way.  I think that's great.  Yeah, it's not enough to say, well, no, Larry and Sergey or  Marissa or whoever are in favor of it.  They're like, no, no, you need to convince me that it's  all right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google's been criticized for that governance by committee  thing, but in a case like this, I think that's fantastic,  that even the guy who's going to flip the switch gets to  say, hold on here.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think the Ombudsman is a really good idea, Leo.  I sometimes make fun of him in the news business arguing that  everyone in a news organization should be responsible and  should be an Ombudsman.  And in a sense, I've seen people go to Matt and beg for  things like, oh, I don't know, wave invites on her.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Who would ever do that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Just a really pushy guy would do that.  And things come through.  So in a sense, Google does have its own employees being  public in a lot of ways.  But I've heard Eric Schmitz say, when the question gets  asked, I have to give him credit.  When he gets asked questions, he doesn't say, oh, OK,  that's the 247th time I've heard that same question.  When the 247th time he was asked, well, is Google too  big and shouldn't it be regulated, his response is,  would you rather have government run us or us run  us?  And he's absolutely right.  But I think at some point, somebody's going to come along  and suggest what I think would be the worst case, which is  government regulation of Google.  There's no reason to.  Google has not acted as monopolist.  It just got big by quality by doing things well.  But it still has to get ahead of that, I think.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Well, and it's really scary to think about.  Google has its philosophies where we try to do things in  an algorithmic way and return diverse and  relevant search results.  But imagine if somebody says, well, government's going to  best and will tell you how to rank the search results for  vaccines or something like that.  And all of a sudden, as soon as you take one step down that  path where reasonable people can disagree on what the ideal  search results should be for something medical or for  vaccines or something like that, you start to see the  difficulty where having someone there second guessing the  ranking would be really, really tricky.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's kind of a reductionist argument, though.  It's not an either or.  It's not government doing it or we do it.  Even if a public ombudsman would only be PR, it would be  very valuable PR at least, and maybe have some other value.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But I like it that you're where I write and consult.  They're wonderful and brilliant.  And they don't pay me enough to say that, so I mean it.  They're the only national paper in Britain that has this  role, the ombudsman.  And it is an independent position.  The New York Times does this as well, which is set up by  contract, not fireable.  It's rather like a judgeship.  And I think it could be smart as a way to deal with those  issues for someone we trust.  Is Vince Cerf the granddaddy of the internet there?  Leo, who would make a great ombudsman for me?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think Vince is a very good suggestion.  But there are a lot of other prickly people I can think of.  People like Brad Templeton maybe, who's on the chairman of  the board of the EFF.  There are people out there I think who would be good in  this role.  That's a good question.  We'll have to ponder.  Maybe it's a panel.  That's possible.  You don't want to bog it down.  But I think at least for appearances sake, it  wouldn't be a bad idea.  Hey, let's take a break.  There's so much more to talk about.  We're really glad to have Matt Cutts with us.  He is a Googler, but also in charge of killing  spam on the web.  You missed Gina?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We're glad to have Matt.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina is in London enjoying herself.  I'm seeing her tweets.  She's looking for somewhere good to eat.  So I think she's having a good time in London.  Jeff Jarvis is here also.  And we're going to talk more about Google in just a bit.  I do want to remind you that this show wouldn't exist  without the help of our sponsors, people like Ford,  Citrix, and Carbonite.  I want to tell you a little bit about Ford Sync.  This is the new device that is in my car.  It's the hands-free Bluetooth audio solution that just makes  my car all the better to drive, all the more fun to get  into.  It's a really great demo product.  Because when people come in and sit down in my car, I say,  let me just show you something.  I press a button on my steering wheel.  I say, play the Beatles.  And the Beatles start playing.  And that is just a great feeling.  The idea of Ford Sync really is safety.  Keeping your eyes on the road, your hands on the wheel, and  yet being able to control your audio, your phone calls, even  get information.  Things like sports scores, weather forecasts.  If you hit a fantasy league, you can get fantasy information.  There's a business search.  There's turn-by-turn navigation.  I sent my daughter off to a debate in far, far away today.  And the ability to say, get me to Pinole High School to the  car, and the car talks you through it, is just remarkable.  And I worry about my kids, because they're very  distractible.  And having a navigation screen, to me, is like they're  going to watch TV.  They're going to be looking at that instead of where they're  going.  Ford Sync talks you through it.  It's a little three-line LED display.  But you don't need that big screen.  It'll tell you where you're going.  It'll tell you what's going on.  You could say things like, call Jeff Jarvis at home, and  it'll do it.  Well, it would if I had Jeff's number, but he still hasn't  given that to me.  But that's OK.  Someday he will.  Earn his trust.  Just teasing.  It's funny.  We're so tied to Twitter and everything now, we don't know  how to get a hold of people.  We just have to DM them on Twitter.  I don't even have Matt's email address.  It's a different world we live in nowadays.  But Ford Sync has SMS capability, too.  On properly equipped phones, it'll read back your messages.  And then you can pick from pre-canned messages to send  back, like, why?  It's my favorite one.  I use that one a lot.  I want you to take a look at Ford Sync.  In fact, the best way to do it is to go to the website,  syncmyridepodcast.com.  When you're there, you'll find out how you can win one of 15  nanos or zoons that the folks at Ford are giving away.  Tweet to win.  All you have to do is say, hey, I'm listening to This Week in  Google, love the show.  And by the way, pound Sync My Ride Podcast.  The number sign followed by one word, Sync My Ride Podcast.  And you're automatically entered to win.  We already know that we have some listeners who have won.  I want you to be in that group.  Now through December 9, they're giving away 15  nanos and 15 zoons.  It's a way of underscoring that Ford Sync works not just  with the iPod, all iPods, your iPhone, but your  zoom, it even works with Droid.  I could plug it in via the USB port.  It'll see all the music on my Droid, and it'll let me play  it by command.  Ford Sync.  Go to syncmyridepodcast.com to find out more.  And the next time you're in the market for a new car, make  sure you think of a Ford Lincoln or  Mercury vehicle powered by Sync.  I love it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, since you have influence with them, what I  most want is when you have the canned message go back on  the phone, I want it to be in the voice of  Kit from Knight Rider.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What?  I can't even remember what Kit sounds like.  It does feel like Knight Rider, though.  I love it.  It's really fun.  I got the Droid GPS cradle, too, because it's got the  great turn-by-turn maps in Google.  I don't use it because I have the GPS in the car, but it's  so cool just to have the Droid sit there.  And it has the voice?  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Somebody told me, I don't know if this is  apocryphal or not, but in Italy, most of the voices are  women's voices.  And in Italy, they couldn't do that because no one trusts  women to give you a reference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not going to listen to you, women driver.  You've got to give me directions.  I can't use those.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's terrible.  So it's got to be a man.  Yeah.  You can turn left here.  It's OK.  Let's talk about this whole idea of turn-by-turn  directions built into the phone.  This led Tim O'Reilly to write, I think, a very good  article calling it Google's business model not freemium,  not free, but less than free.  He says, Google's free navigation feature dealt a  crushing blow to the maps companies, Nav Tech and  Telnav, and to the GPS, Stocks Garmin.  When Google analysis Garmin fell 16%, TomTom felt  The point being that they're giving away Android.  They're giving away GPS.  They even says, if Ford wanted to put Android, they're  using a Windows.  I think it's a Microsoft product.  So I think it's Windows CE right now.  I'm sure they pay Microsoft for that.  They could go to Google.  Not only could they get Android for free and the GPS  for free using these maps that Google's making and the  turn-by-turn that Google's doing, but, and here's the  punch line, because Google will give you ad splits on  Search if you use it.  They're paying you to use their mobile OS.  And that's why he calls it the less than free business  model.  And he says it's absolutely disruptive, not just to the  GPS companies and to, Nokia spent, what was it, $9  billion for, was it Telnav or Nav Tech?  They bought one of the two.  Nav Tech, I think.  Nav Tech, $9 billion.  And then Google comes along and says, well, we don't need  you guys anymore.  We're making our own turn-by-turn.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  By the way, Bill Gurley wrote a post under the same headline  that I put up on the front page.  I see it above the crowd.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that the?  Above the crowd, right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google redefined.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So who gets credit?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I got to say that O'Reilly was nice enough.  He used my favorite PowerPoint slide that I did, Do What You  Do Best, and link to the rest.  And he gave me credit for it.  And I got tweeted around.  So I think O'Reilly's very good at giving provenance.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Synthesizing.  So yeah, I won't give credit.  Let's not give credit to Tim, then.  Let's say Bill Gurley.  Bill's post is great.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's a meme I heard from somebody else in a  private email with the same concern.  Spreading fast, yeah.  And from a consumer perspective, free is good.  Sharing the bounty with us is good.  The main concern is one of using market power to dump on  the market.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's the question.  Is this dumping?  That's a very good point.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the question, I think.  That's the ethical question in the end.  But I think it has to be discussed in a larger context.  It's a post I've been getting a headache about.  I haven't written yet.  That says that it looks at the non-monetary economy.  Businessweek, I wrote this much up a few months ago.  Businessweek had a column, or a cover story, on arguing  that America was actually in an innovation deficit because  they were measuring the impact of innovation on  large, old companies.  And my argument in return was, well, that's not where the  economy is now, A. And B, what innovation does today is  reduce cost.  Rather than adding to profit and adding to closed off  barriers to entry so you can extract more from the  marketplace, you now have to give more to the marketplace.  And that's just an economic reality of where we are today.  So is that just Google doing this, or are we in fact looking  at a constant newer efficiency?  I forget where I was recently.  Oh, it was a Foursquare conference where someone said  that Google kills waste.  And that's the real question, too, is that is this just a  matter of Google and Google's size, or is this a reality of  the new economy in which most innovations, Moore's law,  increase value and reduce cost?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  To me, it raises this question.  When you use the phrase dumping, this is what I was  talking about when I said I wanted to talk a little bit  about the next step that Bill doesn't go to, which is, OK, so  Google disrupts this and creates this new, less than  free economy.  But then what happens after that?  It's like dumping.  The whole point of dumping is to put the other guy out of  business so you can raise the costs.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, but the problem becomes then that you also keep the  cost down so low that people can't come in and  compete with you.  So Tom Epslin explained in my book, not that I've now  mentioned it twice, that in network economics, Craig wants  to charge as little as possible, not just because  he's a crazy tech hippie, but because it means no one else  can enter in.  That is the barrier to entry now.  That he charges as little as possible.  And he can do that because he had the technology that  enabled him to take a $10 billion market and make it  into a reported $100 million company.  And he's in great shape.  30 employees, wonderful thing.  And people look at that and say, but you destroyed value.  No.  In the long run.  Craig says, I left the value in the pockets of the  transactors rather than those of the middlemen.  And so there's a shift of key economic value here that's  just happening anyway in the economy.  Google is smart enough to see that.  I hear the same thing happening in the news  discussion all the time.  This email I got from a famous entrepreneur this weekend was  plaintively saying, well, Google comes along in news and  it kind of undercuts everything.  And it's wrong of me to say people should ask what would  Google do and be like Google because Google is like it is  just because it's so damn big.  Well, that's partly fair.  But I think it's partly unfair in saying that I think we can  all follow these lessons and models and take advantage of  these new realities.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's funny though.  Look, we're all media guys.  We've worked in advertising-based media our  whole lives.  This is just the same thing, isn't it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's subsidy.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's different economic models, but it's not like the  ad free media supported by ads is not something.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The other difference, Leo, is that in media advertising, we  sold advertising as scarcity.  There's only so many ad spots, so many eyeballs.  And we're going to charge what the market will bear.  In a network model, when you want to grow as big as  possible, you charge as little as you can bear to become the  big player.  Whether that's Amazon or eBay or Skype or Google or Facebook,  you extract as little as possible to become the big guy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's reverse dumping.  It's dumping also, isn't it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly.  You open a big guy that acts like Staphylococcus, not like  Bigfoot.  But that becomes the issue.  That's just the new network economics we have.  The other thing Google did on advertising, though, was that  they don't charge what the market will bear.  They could have said only so many people search on the word  Paris in a day and we'll charge you as much as we can.  Instead, it sells performance.  And as a result, Google is motivated to  create more relevance.  That's why AdSense exists.  It doesn't deal with scarcity.  It created abundance.  It also means that Google shared the risk with the  advertiser.  The advertiser in old media says, I'll buy this ad on your  show, but I don't know if it's going to work.  The new way is that, dare I say it, Ford would say, how many  cars you sold for me lately?  And you can prove it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm too scared to do that.  I don't want to do that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Don't put any bad ideas in any head.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No.  Well, the truth is, in the long run, that's what happens.  Because if you don't perform, you don't get the buy again.  You can only cheat people so long.  That's not true.  I've always been pretty familiar with that.  It's always performance in the long run.  Or if it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Well, and I think there's also a role to talk about just the  key part of engineering.  Because take machine translation as an example.  There are companies that sell that as a service or as  software that's a package, all sorts of things like that.  And Google had experimented with different companies to  try that.  But what we ended up doing was writing our own software.  So there's a real advantage to having engineers who are smart  enough, and I'm not sure I'd count myself in this category,  but there are a lot of smart engineers at Google who can  look at the state of the art and say, hey, how can we push  past this, or how can we find the innovative thing that's  going to really turn things on its head a little bit.  And at the point where you can do, and they've submitted it  for evaluation and found a few years ago that Google had the  world's best machine translation by a  far margin at that point.  If you can build your own technology that can do things  differently or better or cheaper than competitors, then  that frees you up to do a whole bunch of innovative stuff.  So for example, this week we introduced translating as you  type, so real time machine translation over at  translate.google.com.  And the only reason we can do that and run so many keystroke  queries is that we created the software ourselves and that  it's really robust.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So that you're saying that comes from the size that you  have does give you this advantage?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  I don't think that it comes from the size at all.  I think the number of people who can smartly work on machine  translation or text to speech or speech to text is actually a  relatively small group of people.  It's just you want them to be the world's best people.  And so if you end up with even a single digit number of  engineers, but they can do better than 30 or 40 other  engineers, that's still worth it.  So whenever I look at a lot of the really hard stuff that we  do, similar images or trying to find content identification  on YouTube or text to speech or translation, those are not  necessarily large groups that are doing that.  And they don't necessarily get a lot of benefit from Google  being big.  It's just that they really can be a whip smart engineer  sometimes, and that can really pay off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow, this is pretty amazing.  This is what was in Wave, wasn't it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  By the way, it solves one of the pains and the butts I've  always had with translation on Google.  If you're so damn smart, why do I have to tell you what  language it is?  It should.  And now it has a detect link.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It does?  Oh, good.  The pull down says translate from it says detect.  It always thinks I'm talking in Spanish.  I don't understand.  So this is good coming from you, Jeff Jarvis, because  you're the first person who's ever posted a German article  into our feed.  Do you read German?  What's the deal with this?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I had an ambition.  Not an ambition.  Yeah, I like the headline, because the headline said its  reaction to Chrome OS was, now I'm going to  tell you what it was, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a Chrome OS angatesetet.  So wenig software, so viel newheit.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, so little software, so much new.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  That's actually very good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I thought it was saying was that this was the  minimalization of the OS and of software.  And that's what's so big and new.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's actually very interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I hope I translated it correctly.  I suspect someone in the chat room will listen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Masa is from Germany in our chat room.  I'm sure he'll fix it if it's wrong.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So for chat room, it says, so wenig software, so  viel newheit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're saying, yes, that's a correct translation.  Hey!  Hey!  I'm so proud of me.  You didn't even use Google for that.  Coming up, the weirdest software bug you ever heard of.  And I've got it.  As we continue with this week in Google, and our guest,  Matt Cutts, Googler Matt Cutts and Jeff Jarvis, I just  want to briefly mention our friends at Citrix, who make  so many great remote access products.  I mean, they're the kings of remote access.  And in particular, for those of you who are in the support  industry, whether it's IT or you have software that you  have to support, GoToAssist is so incredible.  GoToAssist Express, they call it.  But if you go to gotoassist.com right now, you could try it  free for 30 days.  If you're going home for Thanksgiving, my strong  suggestion is send an email to mom, dad, aunt, Jenny,  whatever, and say, hey, click this link.  And I'm going to do a little remote session and just see how  bad it is before you go.  OK?  Just check it out.  GoToAssistExpress.com slash Twig will give you 30 days free.  This is remote access but designed for IT support.  So for instance, it'll tell you what operating system's  running, what security software's running, what's  running in the background.  This is nice to know.  You can copy files from your computer to theirs.  So if you've got malware bytes or a fix you want to bring  over, you can do that.  Have eight sessions at once.  You get the whole family.  While you're scanning one computer, check the next one,  and the next one after that, and the next one after that.  This is just a fantastic product.  You can get a day pass or you can get a monthly  subscription.  I use the monthly subscription.  But right now, do it for free.  Go to GoToAssist.com, G-O-T-O, Assist.com slash Twig, for 30  days absolutely free of simply the best remote access fixing  software ever.  If you're in the IT or support business, you must have GoToAssist.  And we thank them so much for their support of this week in  Google.  Now maybe that could help fix this bug.  This is the weirdest bug.  It's on Android.  People have noticed with Android that the autofocus works  sometimes, then it doesn't work, then it works again.  And it turns out it's in fact a calendar-based bug.  One of the weirdest bugs I've ever heard.  It's a rounding error bug in the camera driver's  autofocus routine.  It uses a timestamp.  Now I don't know why autofocus would use a timestamp.  But it fails on a 24.5-day cycle.  Matt Cutts is covering his eyes.  So the autofocus will work for 24.5 days, then it won't work  so well for 24.5 days, then it'll work again.  Now right now, we're in a good cycle.  The 17th, four days ago, was the beginning of a works  correctly cycle.  So for those of us who got the, and you know, it's true, it  started working.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Does everybody share the same?  It's like your cycles get in sync?  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're all in the same cycle.  The good news is I'm sure before 24.5 days passes, 20  days now, there will be a fix for this.  But I just think that's just one of those.  I had the same reaction.  Oh my god.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  And it was funny because within Google, people were reading  the reviews of the droid and people would say really nice  things about the video camera.  They'd say it's DVD quality.  It's really great.  I don't understand why the still camera  doesn't look that good.  And of course, everybody had to keep their mouth shut.  And then November 17th rolled around and it happened that  some guy had been cleaning his screen, like buffing it a  little bit.  And so this myth was going around that, oh, you know, all  you have to do is buff your screen and suddenly it looks  really good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's just a dirty screen.  I thought that's what it was.  I'm going like this.  Anyway, that's a funny bug.  But I feel for the guy, whoever has to get the, I  imagine it's no fun at the Google cafeteria for that guy  walking around.  He's out of focus.  Anyway, nothing more to say about that.  I'm glad they're going to fix that.  Somebody told me, and Matt, maybe you can, this isn't your  department, maybe you know better though.  This Google Experience phone, the reason the Ares was with  1.6 is because if you ship with 1.6, you can customize it  much more heavily than you can if you ship it with 2.0.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  I would believe that.  I don't know that for sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They call 2.0 the Google Experience version.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and there's always a bunch of moving parts  depending on when somebody is probably producing their phone.  So I think now everybody has access to the 2.0 branch.  So people who just wanted to upgrade to 2.0, manufacturers  could do that a little more easily now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My friend at Verizon, I have an inside contact, says that  the Ares, which ships with 1.6, will be  updated very soon to 2.0.  I love 2.0.  I just have to say, I just love it.  So as long as we're talking phones, the G phone?  Anybody?  G phone?  Rumors according to TechCrunch.  The rumor will not die.  The rumor will not die, and maybe this is why they made  up Mike Harrington get in line.  But TechCrunch has said on Wednesday that sources indicate  Google is still working on a Google branded Android phone  sometime in early 2010.  It will be sold directly to customers at retail.  You can, because you could sell an unlocked GSM phone.  You could only use it in the US on AT&T and T-Mobile, but  you could do that.  Kind of like the article on CNET likened it to what  Microsoft did with Toshiba.  Toshiba made a music player that looked an awful lot like  the Zune for a long time.  And then all of a sudden, Microsoft's making the Zune,  manufactured by Toshiba.  I know you can't, Matt, say anything one way or the other,  but it just seems like a strange thing at this point,  especially if Android's really starting to take off, which it  seems to be.  On the other hand, I was very critical of Apple for locking  into AT&T. I really wish Apple had done an open platform.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  It's kind of tricky, because all these speculations and  stories are going around.  You never know quite what to think.  I work in search quality, so all I have to worry about is,  is there web spam or not?  Which makes my life very easy.  I know what to kill, and I go on out and I kill it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I only know web spam.  What is this G phone you talk about?  It's not.  Roll click.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I am ruined by your app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I only know web spam.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's German night here on, speaking German.  One thing that occurred to me about the Chromium OS  discussion, not to go back to topic A, but just as with the  phones, I want to be able to buy a machine and play with it  and have it.  But if that machine doesn't cost me $300, if it really costs  me another account with a phone company and it cost me $2,400,  that's no good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's very expensive.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The economics of connectivity just remain off.  And I don't know, I'm not smart enough by any means, most of  them are like David Eisenberg on to try to think of what that  future means.  But just as the phone companies went through their revolt, as  he put it, about the dumb network, now I think the  economics of connectivity are just all off.  And they're going to affect other industries succeeding.  They're going to affect us being ubiquitously and  constantly connected and the value that comes from that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But this is where Google gets in a weird position, because  they're doing traditional business with Android and  Verizon and the other Android partners.  They're doing a traditional business deal.  But what we just put that link up on the front page.  But what we just talked about is this new business model,  this less than free business model.  And in that context, it would make perfect sense for Google  to give away a free phone almost.  Less than free.  Less than free.  And so if that's Google's business model, then it would  make perfect sense that they would do this.  Is it a little schizophrenic that they're in bed with  Verizon?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It seems like a transitional business model, doesn't it?  Yes.  It's what you have to do today.  It's kick-starting it.  I posted a few weeks ago about Howard Stern talking about the  wonders of the internet.  I think I talked about it here.  Yes.  That he can do so much more on the internet than he can even  at Sirius.  Oprah going away from broadcast to cable.  She can get the money there now.  Howard can get the money from Sirius now.  But clearly, just being on the internet and having direct  connections, especially if you're that big, is better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, notice I still do a traditional radio show.  Yeah.  I mean, I understand transitional models.  But sometimes I think it holds you back.  It's a reluctance to play hard.  And Google plays hard.  Google never struck me as having the kind of cowardice  that would say, well, we want a transitional business model  until we really get going.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that's where things like white spaces come in,  isn't it?  Fighting for white spaces to be unlicensed.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Whites allows.  That's an interesting topic.  Yeah.  What is white spaces?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Matt, you want to explain a bit other than I can?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Sure.  Definitely.  So analog TV needed a lot of spectrum space.  And the digital transition, where everybody is now going  to digital television in the United States,  means that those analog channels are getting freed up.  And if you can use those analog spaces to, for example,  do broadband wireless connectivity,  it turns out that spectrum is really  conducive to going through buildings and going really far.  So you wouldn't need nearly as many transmitters.  So it's really kind of an exciting idea,  because Wi-Fi was this sort of garbage, tiny slice of segment  that was used by microwave ovens and garage door openers.  And people didn't view it as very helpful.  And Larry Page gave a speech, I think it was at the FCC,  where he said, look, this spectrum,  just by being open to everybody, has been incredibly useful.  Think about how many devices use Wi-Fi.  What if you allow the spectrum that  used to be television channels, which is much broader,  with the proper safety provisions so that you don't  get interference, what if you allowed regular people  or companies or ISPs to use that in some way?  And I think that's really exciting,  because broadband connectivity isn't  where you'd like it to be.  There's still spots in the country  where it's a lot harder to get rural broadband.  And in theory, that's the sort of thing  that white spaces could help with a lot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was a little disappointed.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wi-Fi is never going to be it.  Wi-Fi is too limited.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I had a fantasy that Google was going to,  they said they were going to bid for the 700 megahertz  spectrum.  I had a fantasy that they would buy it and open it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They did own it for, they were the top bidder for a few hours.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, for a minute.  They bid the minimum, $4.6 billion.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But with that, the reason they did guarantee the government  the minimum and bid that minimum was  so that they could get concessions back.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They got concessions, that's right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think that we start to see the grand Google world domination  strategy coming into focus here,  unlike their camera phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Every 24 days, anyway.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  In a sense that if the white spaces were open,  if we had ubiquitous constant high speed connectivity,  all Google wants us to do is use the internet more  and make more stuff for them to organize and put ads on.  It's good for them.  And for them to know more stuff to target and understand  our intent better.  So you tie together the discussion of the day.  The speed of Chrome OS, Chrome itself, machines,  ubiquitous connectivity, everything on the web,  everything then targetable on the web,  everything taken off the desktop.  It all starts to make sense.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's good for Google.  And fortunately, our interests coincide.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Well, it's good for Google, it's good for Earth.  Yeah, I think you chalk it up to a grand plan.  I wouldn't, from my experience, I  wouldn't say there's some Google grand plan like that.  But to the extent that when people use the web more,  it is good for Google.  Yeah, we do get to show more ads.  That's true.  The corollary to that, and Ben Parr  had written an equation or a post about the Google revenue  equation.  And the corollary of his idea was  that Google wants the web to succeed  and wants the web to be really good for everyone  and will work to try to make that happen.  And so if the web is faster, more ubiquitous, easier  to use, safer to use, all of those different things,  then people use the web more, which is good for Google,  but more importantly, is good for everybody.  Wiring up places like Africa can be  good for all of those countries, just like getting  rural broadband could be good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And when Larry talked, wherever he was in Washington,  he called it Wi-Fi on steroids.  And when asked, why are you doing this?  He said simply, well, the more people on the internet,  the more money we make.  It's just true.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Right.  It's interesting.  Go ahead.  Oh, just the fact that I think Google  has done a good job of aligning the interests of the internet  and the interests of its users and its own interests.  And I think we consciously try to keep that going.  And you can see that if you read through what would Google do,  if you read through your book, we  try to align those interests such that the things we do.  I don't think Jeff ever read his book.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think he's.  Once you write a book, the last thing you want to do is read it.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  But you really do want to make the web better  so that users are happier.  They use the web more.  It's a really nice virtuous cycle.  And you never want to take an action that would hurt the web  or would hurt your users.  And so it sometimes takes some interesting work  to try to find that alignment.  But it's definitely worth it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What hits me all the time, too, Matt,  is how the mission of organizing the world's information  and making it accessible.  It seems to come back to that all the time,  even in the effort to get renewable power  for cheaper than coal.  If you imagine power in Africa, in those villages,  you can put the server farms everywhere.  You can reduce the cost.  You get more people on.  You get more information.  It comes back to that idea at one level or another,  I think, always.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Totally.  Yeah, I completely agree.  I think Google has also invested in various ventures  that try to bring more internet connectivity to Africa  and various ways to use SMS well.  And all of that stuff is good for those countries,  but down the road will be good for Google as well,  while being good for users and the internet.  That's very interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, it really is the old GM line.  What's good for GM is good for America.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's good for Google?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Except it's what's good for the internet  is what's good for Google, rather than what's good for Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I had this email I keep referring to that was just  private, so I won't say it.  But it was somebody I really, really respect  who was kind of pushing me on this idea of Google's power  and Google's force.  And I kept saying that in my lengthy response  to his lengthy email, I said Google is not,  to put it as these are laws of the internet that rule Google.  Google doesn't rule the internet.  They are just simply new laws of reality now.  And this is how the world operates.  It's what I did try to explain in, I don't know, a certain book.  But that's the point, is that Google  recognized this new reality and found the ways to exploit  and take advantage of it.  And I think that often what happens is, as in newspapers,  Google gets blamed.  Craigslist gets blamed.  I've argued this about Google in newspapers.  I posted about this this week.  I was on a radio show talking about it.  And I said Google's mistake with newspapers  is that they thought that newspapers wanted friends  and they tried to be newspapers' friends.  And newspapers actually want enemies.  They want people to blame for all their troubles  rather than themselves.  And so in my mind, Google should be the friend of anyone,  including new enterprises, not just the legacy enterprises.  But Google inevitably gets blamed for the change  because it is the biggest target and it  is the one that has figured it out and exploited it most.  But that doesn't mean Google made the change happen.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Right, I think you were saying at one point  you weren't happy to be the harbinger of what's  coming for the newspapers.  You were just the messenger.  You didn't bring it on.  You were just acknowledging it and clarifying it a little bit.  And I think Google is often emblematic of the net  when people talk of Google.  And I think Eric Schmidt has said this.  What they usually mean is some sort of shorthand  that says, yes, the internet is doing this or Craigslist  or better connectivity is doing this rather than Google proper.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this is just a great discussion.  At some point, I would really like to sit down with you two.  We're running out of time.  This is the only reason I don't do it right now.  And try to tease out what those fundamental tenets of how  Google runs its business are.  What that is it one basic?  Is it that line, what's good for the web is good for Google?  What is that thing that informs everything Google does?  I mean, is that in your book, Jeff?  Is that something I would be able to tease out there?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm guessing.  I guessed 40 rules like that.  I think Matt lives.  40 is too many.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's got to be because it's going to be something  you can hold in your mind and use as a measuring  stick for everything you do.  And it's not not the mission is it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Organizing the world's information.  Yeah, I do think it comes back to that map.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that your sense, Matt?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  I think it's just I think that's a big one.  I think but there's also the aspect of don't be evil.  I think there is don't trap users data.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Has that been there all along or is that something new?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  No, no.  Eric Schmidt crystallized that at Web 2.0 in response  to a question that John Battelle asked I think in 2006.  And it was almost as if it was a core value of Google  that had always been latent beneath the surface.  And he just pulled it out.  And as soon as he said it, he's like, oh, yeah,  that's what we want.  So I think don't be evil.  Be an advocate for users.  Don't trap users data.  And then the consequences of that  are if you can't trap your users data,  you have to compete on merit.  You don't give yourself any advantage.  Chrome has to be better.  It can't just take advantage of any proprietary API or anything.  So if you have to compete.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that stuff like do you get a handbook when  you become a Google employee?  See, there's got to be some way that they percolate  these core values throughout the company  because the company is such a vast enterprise with so  many different things going on, sometimes inconsistent  as we see here with Android and Verizon versus less than free.  But there is a consistency to how it operates.  It must be somehow communicated to its employees.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  We do have newgler training.  Newglers are new Googlers.  But I think a lot of it just comes from interacting  with people within Google.  And the hope is that the people who apply to jobs at Google  have seen Google's how we operate in general.  And hopefully that we attract the sort of people  that believe in that already.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They don't make it through the gauntlet unless you feel  someone is going to wear the clothes, right?

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Well, there is a question in the typical Google interview,  which is essentially when you fill out your evaluation,  you say, well, what's their cultural fit?  How googly are they?  And that's not something that's like,  do they like bright colored balloons?  Do you think that they would make Google proud in some sense?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Somebody put a link to the Google Code of Conduct,  which is at investor.google.com slash conduct.html.  But that's different from what I'm talking about.  That's the conduct rules.  But there seems to be an underlying fundamental mission.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And Leo, I think the other thing,  Mercer Meyers said this in videos around,  and business people still don't believe it,  I had somebody quizzing me this week about this,  is that Google goes for a great product  that will serve a lot of people first  and then figures out the business.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It has the courage to do that.  Now that got a lot of cooties as a strategy in the first bubble  because obviously people went down the wrong road  as a result of that, so I don't need to worry about money.  Well, no.  You know that time comes when you must.  But if you try to follow the money at first,  you'll probably fail.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Right.  And you probably don't want to just launch a product  that's a MeToo product.  Something like Google Maps was distinctly different.  The idea that you could click and drag your map around  and move it around directly,  that's something where you could immediately see the value.  Gmail, the ability to thread conversations  or have massive amounts of storage.  I think Google does a pretty good job of trying to say,  let's not launch this product  because we're not bringing anything new,  some twist or some innovation  or something that would make it compelling to the table.  I wouldn't say we do that for every.  Speaking of which, rumors this week

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  that AOL is going to sell MapQuest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh boy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm curious if you think the mission involves Matt  or if it's been pretty consistent all along.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  You know, the Don't Be Evil has been around forever  and organized the world's information  and make it universally accessible  and useful has been around forever.  And I remember when I heard that mission statement  the first time, I was taking it back  because it is ambitious.  It's staggering.  And it mentions nothing about being a search engine.  Or advertising.  Or advertising.  But I think Larry and Sergey really hit on a key idea  and it's guided us pretty well for several years.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're going to take a little break and come back  and we'll have Jeff's number of the week.  We won't have a tip of the week,  but I have a tip of the week.  You always get the computer.  I know.  Tools and tips are very similar really, unfortunately.  I'll look for a tip real quickly as we...  Well, maybe Matt.  You know what?  Matt. I can do a tip.  Matt, I bet you have a tip or two.  Easy.  Something you might know.  All right.  We're going to assign Matt this week the tip of the week.  Before we do that though, just a reminder to back up.  This is not a public service announcement,  although it could be.  You gotta back up.  I get so many calls from people who don't back up  and you'd think anybody who is smart enough  to be watching this show must be smart enough  to back up all their data, right?  Maybe you live in the cloud, you figure I'm safe.  But I guarantee you there's something on your hard drive  that you do not want to lose.  And if you're backing it up to a local drive,  yeah, that's a start.  But what happens if the worst happens?  Fire, flood, earthquake, tornado,  or just somebody breaks into your house  and steals your backups along with your main computer?  You gotta have offsite backup.  That's why we talk about carbonite.com.  It's offsite backup done right.  Couldn't be easier to use.  This is another one to bring home with you for Thanksgiving.  Bring the relatives.  Get them set up on carbonite.com.  Automatically backs up your irreplaceable files,  your financial documents, your photos, your music.  Yeah, I said photos and music, even those gigantic files  because carbonite is flat rate backup.  Everything on your computer for less than $5 a month.  Don't worry about how much you've got.  I've been backing up podcasts from this computer.  Gigabytes, gigabytes.  I want you to try it absolutely free.  Just go to carbonite.com, use the offer code TWIT.  That's easy to remember.  And you can try it free for a couple of weeks.  Don't even need a credit card.  It'll just start running just to give you an idea.  Now remember, you do have to have high speed internet  for this to make sense.  And the backup doesn't happen overnight  because it's not going to slow you down.  It wants to do this while you're idle  and when you're not doing anything else.  But once you get stuff backed up,  then it's just pretty quick to keep it always backed up.  Automatically, you don't have to think about it.  It's just there.  You can go anywhere and get any file, by the way,  by logging into your carbonite account.  That's very nice.  And if you're upgrading to Windows 7 or perhaps Chrome OS  and you want to back up your data before the upgrade,  you can do that.  Go to your account to the next machine and restore.

I like a company that stands behind their product  at that point where they say,  nope, you have to try it before you buy it.  Carbonite.com.  Well, traditionally, Matt, we start  with the tip of the week.  So I'm going to put you on the spot here.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  That sounds good.  I could give you a couple tips.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, two, two, two tips.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Two for one.  Yay.  So one nice tip is that if you're doing  any sort of legal research,  Google added United States case law to Google Scholar.  So you can go and you can do a search like Google  or desegregation or Brown versus School Board,  and you can find all sorts  of really readable court opinions.  You can research different companies  and find out what sort of interesting things are going on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's a big one.  That's government transparency  and disintermediating Westlaw all in one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was just going to say goodbye, Lexus.  Goodbye, Westlaw.  They still have citations and a lot of stuff.  This isn't going to replace your law library,  but still very useful.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  But if you don't have a subscription,  it's very cheap to try it out.  There are laws after all.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You should have them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah.  Laws, what a good idea.  What a concept.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  And there's another neat thing that Google launched  this week, which is the ability  to automatically transcribe videos.  So we will run machine speech recognition on your videos.  Now this is going to start out on a small number of channels.  So Yale, Stanford, official Google tech talks.  But we also rolled out something new  that I think every person has access to  if you have your own YouTube channel  where you upload videos.  If you want to, you can take a text transcription  of the words that are being said in a video.  You can upload the raw text to YouTube  along with the video that you already have uploaded.  And YouTube will auto align the text that you uploaded  with the spoken audio.  And it will give you accurate time codes.  Now, if you've ever paid to have a video transcribed  and have captions added, it turns out  getting those accurate time codes  are often what costs a lot of money.  So you might have to write down  what the words were that were spoken,  or maybe you have a transcript  if you already had a script or something.  But it's pretty amazing that Google can align the text  to what's being spoken,  and then it will let you download it.  So if you want to take that information  and leave YouTube behind completely,  you're more than welcome to.  You get what's known as, I believe, an SBV file,  which is the text and the time codes very accurately aligned.  It only works in English for right now,  but as always, we're working on improving our capabilities.  And it's really a lot of fun  in that you don't have to do the tedious thing  of keeping track of time codes anymore.  I think that's fantastic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What a great-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This will all do wonders for finally getting video  to be searchable, right?  That's the real, it's accessible, but also searchable.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Not just searchable, but now, suppose you only read Turkish.  You might get something  that's been auto-transcribed in English,  and now you can translate it into Turkish,  and it won't be perfect,  but you can get an idea about what someone's saying.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love it.  The guy who announced this in the Google blog said,  "'This is of use to me because I'm deaf.'"

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think that's fantastic.  He uses it.  There's one guy who wrote a column who said,  I'm not saying that I watch YouTube videos at work,  but sometimes you want to be able to see the caption yourself.  There's even a project in India  where people know how to speak a particular language,  but don't know how to read it and write it.  And so this has the ability, in theory,  to sort of show you the captions  of a language you already know how to speak,  but maybe you're illiterate and don't know how to read  and write.  So there are a lot of people who can learn how to read  and write just from looking at captions on videos.  So there's a lot of really nice potential  unlocked by this new change.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Very interesting.  So you added, actually, you had translate while you typed,  so that's really another tip.  You got a bunch of them, Matt.  That's great.  Busy week.  One of the reasons we love having you on the show.  And now, Jeff, your number of the week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Simple, just returned to the theme of the day.  And unfortunately, I screwed up the link,  so I can't find it right now.  But Google announced that the number of users  on Chrome browser is 40 million already.  Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  40 million using Chrome.  Not Chrome OS, but Chrome.  Wow.  And the Mac version is any minute now, right, Matt?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that was the other good news.  They said yes, but Mac and Linux versions are imminent,  and I can't wait.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yahoo.  No, I'm sorry, that wasn't the right thing to say.  Please forgive me, Matt.  I'll never say that again.  So my tool is kind of a little different this week,  and it comes from a listener who wrote to me,  his name is Mike Koss.  He said, this question came up at the Seattle users group,  the Google users group, which is GTUG.  You probably know about them, Matt.  How many unique products and services does Google have?  And they've been collecting it into, of course,  a Google spreadsheet.  And in fact, since he sent it to me, he said 151,  it's even larger now.  It is now up to, drum roll please.  I don't even have room on the screen  to scroll all the way down.  224 unique services through Google.  They're all linked in this spreadsheet.  I mean, this is just fantastic.  You know, everything.  So instead of giving you just one Google utility,  I'm gonna give you all of them.  And I promise to be data mining this as well.  Can you believe that, Matt?  Would you have guessed that number, 200, was it 224?  That's amazing.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  I think the last time I saw that spreadsheet, it was 150.  So there might be a few more still to be added.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's growing fast, exactly.  So you are familiar with it.

Speaker: Matt Cutts
Transcript:  I had seen that spreadsheet, yeah.  And it was pretty funny because O'Malleyck did a post  where he talked about some of the things  from Google that have failed.  So he talked about Lively that we shut down, for example.  And he had four or five things.  But if you consider four or five things  that he considered a failure compared  to 224 Google services, that's really not that bad.  You could argue we should be failing more often.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Take that, Olb.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're doing okay.  So Mike sent me a short URL for this.  It is u.go2.me, get it?  You go to me, slash three capital W, capital T.  U.go2.me, we'll put this in the show notes,  slash three capital W, capital T.  It'll take you to the Google spreadsheet  with each and every one of the exhaustive,  and exhausting Google product lists.  That's really great.  Matt Cutts, thank you so much for being here.  And I wanna thank the folks at Google  for letting you be here.  Amen. Always a pleasure.  Oh, well, it's great to have you on.  And it's nice to have somebody who really knows  what's going on in the Googleplex.  You can find Matt's blog at mattcutts.com slash blog.  That's his website also.  And thank him the next time you see him  for the great work he does keeping spam  out of our search results.  We do appreciate that.  Jeff Jarvis, always a pleasure having you.  I'm so glad you're here.  I'm grateful to be here.  The book, of course, What Would Google Do?  available everywhere finer books are sold  with that very colorful cover, WWGD.  Are you working on a new one?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, I was at Web2.0 this week,  and I talked about the idea and got advice from the group.  Leading off, saying moves from what would Google do  to what should Jarvis do?  And the current idea is a book called Beta.  I showed the alpha version of my thinking at a Web2.0.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So was that your talk at Web2.0?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, where by the way, I finally got to meet Gina  face to face, it was just wonderful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She spoke as well.  Yes.  Kevin Marks spoke, did the keynote.  I'm sorry I missed this.  It sounded like it was a great conference.  Well, maybe someday you and I and Gina  will share a drink, but I'm glad that you two got to meet.  Now I feel really left out.  I hope you weren't plotting.  Jeff's website is buzzmachine.com.  I am so glad you were here.  We do this show live on live.twit.tv  every Saturday afternoon at 5 15 Eastern, 2 15 Pacific Time.  Something around 21 15 UTC.  Consult your local Oracle for UTC times.  And of course, you can download the show  from all the better podcasts, places  like iTunes and the Zune Store.  Thanks for joining us.  We'll see you next time.
