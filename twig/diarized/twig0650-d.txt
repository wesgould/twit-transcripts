Transcript:  No, oh nine. Yes. Yes. I was born. I was one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were too young probably to read the San Francisco Examiner  However, I was a devoted devoted fan

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm surprised

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tell us the story cuz Skylab

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead. Well Skylab was a satellite that was up there was with astronauts working in a head of the International Space Station and and it  had its day and  Was going to come back to earth and  And  There was much nervousness about where it was gonna come and NASA was saying no no problem. No problem at all  We got in control, but still there was nervousness and I worked on the San Francisco Examiner  Which was right across the hall the San Francisco Chronicle in a joint publishing agreement and we shared the same composing group  So we weren't supposed to be at all in each other's  Business, but of course were nosy journalists  So I went out there and I saw that they had a promotion coming up for Skylab insurance  That if a reader a subscriber to the Chronicle got hit by a falling pieces of Skylab and lost their life or limb  They would get money from the Chronicle and this was gonna break on I think the Monday or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, this is mostly a joke because the earth is water and the chance of you being hit by the Skylab is pretty  Slim so it's a safe bet man. A lot of newspapers did this. This is a very right common promotion

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we thought we said how can we beat the Chronicle of this and we talked about it  And I said why don't we do a reward for bringing us a piece of Skylab?  $10,000 reward bring us a piece of Skylab. The city editor Jim Willis said ah it's great. The other said yeah it's great  so we had to go to the publisher got in Reg Murphy who became my bet noir and  Trying to talk him into it and he made us he made me call NASA to say what are the odds this has fallen on land  I don't want to give up any money you get their guarantee and I call

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean the United States because you had one additional caveat which it had to be they had to arrive at

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The offices of the San Francisco Examiner by a certain time after you had 72 hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Last like that right yes to get to the Chronicle or the examiner. So the examiner. Yes, so I called NASA

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, I said by the way just in case we do get it  Well, you will you verify that the stuff we got is real. Were you certified? Oh sure cuz we're not gonna happen  Yeah, no problem, right  So then it it came down to earth it fell in Australia  Western around Perth Western Australia sparsely populated Western Australia around Perth  Very few but a young beer truck help drivers helper beer truck driver helper named Stan Thornton and his and his might  Picked up these black pieces of charcoal now  Meanwhile a radio station in Australia because he had he had to come to our offices in San Francisco get $10,000  Well radio station Australia did a whole big campaign that they were gonna pay for anybody to get to our offices to get the damn money  from Yanks  So in fact young Stan who was 17 years old  Flies to Sydney flies to us makes it like within an hour. He didn't bring a passport. He didn't bring a suitcase, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's hopped on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and he said he said he's a miner so he arrives at our offices with this baggie with black charcoal things

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right here, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We do pictures in the front of the building will have Stan rise the airport Stan gets in he makes it in time  So then we have to get the stuff. I'm certified  Meanwhile the managing editor David Halvorson was concerned for Stan. He was a kid. He had no suitcase  He had nothing so they take in Stan into was a baby basically adopt him for like 10 days  So then somebody had to go to Alabama to NASA to get them a certified  So we said Steve cook an editor who would literally LA Times to NASA in Huntsville  And they and they took it seriously they had to analyze it and they couldn't figure out what it was  It's well this this one. It's just  Anything on on Skylab. This is organic. There's nothing on Skylab  Oh, no, they thought thought thought and they said well, it could be astronaut poop  We don't think so  It's great they finally determined that it was balsa wood in the  insulation of the Skylab and  so we then  Gave ten thousand dollars to you're here a few more things you had before so we gave ten thousand dollars to Stan  Meanwhile a Philadelphia rug merchant literally a rug merchant wanted to jump on  The bandwagon of all this publicity so he offered Stan, you know a house full of furnishings and a trip to Philadelphia to see the Liberty  Bell  We don't think it's a good idea. Stan said no, mate  And he brought in his mother and his girlfriend and they went to Philadelphia, right?  And then you know sometime later he guys not paying me. Can you help Stan? We tried to warn you man  So Stan goes back to Australia now. Meanwhile, I got lots of attention  I've made a point of always wearing three-piece suits because I was so embarrassed at this. I tried to look dignified  And I kid the three-piece suit does not look dignified by the way. And so I got tons of publicity, right?  I was I was I was on TV all over everything Reg Murphy the publisher was very jealous of this  He was not happy that I was getting more publicity and he'd given up to ten thousand dollars  he proceeded to make my life pretty damn miserable with the help of  Diane Feinstein's husband Dick Bloom who they didn't like me anyway because I would once in a while criticize Feinstein  they made my life a living hell and I eventually quit to come to New York and conquer Gotham and work for People magazine and  The day after I quit Murphy quit and  destroy I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Had I remember you saying you got a little bit of trouble for this like you had promised there's no way

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're gonna be given yeah, but he got so much more than ten thousand dollars publicity for this. Oh lord. It was all over  And and radio in San Francisco was doing it all the time and Stan was getting interviewed and I was getting interviewed  It was it was it was embarrassing fun. It was it was the last  Gasp of old  Newspaper right old kind of Hirsch newspaper

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz in those days you had the morning paper the Chronicle in the afternoon paper the examiner and you guys were fighting  Yeah, even if you were we had separate owners. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, cuz Hurst owned examiner who owned all the chronicles

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Chronicle yeah, the young family, right? Yeah, and then and then as you know, you and San Francisco know when  The young got out and Hurst bought it  They had to keep the examiner going in some form and they took over the Chronicle name because it was the bigger name  By far, but the examiner was old we ran all first  First paper it was good, you know, it meant something in the company and they gave it up, which is kind of a shame

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they turn it into a to dopey tabloid weekly tabloid. It was very sad. I liked the examiner. It was a great newspaper anyway  That may happen again because the space station is is gonna be in 2035  You've got a little time to save up for that. Are they gonna take it apart and bring it down or they're gonna crash it in the Indian Ocean

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, but they think I said problem with Skylab

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was the Pacific not the Indian the problem with the Skylab was that they hadn't planned for this  So right they didn't have they didn't have any way to kind of aim it on its way in  So it was an unplanned unscheduled  Demise but with the ISS they know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So recently I'd never heard from Stan and then I got two people calling me wanting to do kind of the story of Skylab  And Stan I spent time with him nothing ever happened with it  But through that I got connected with Stan again an email with each other which oh, that's nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and that guy by the way, Stan is now 65 year old retiree  Living in Huntsville, Alabama. So it goes completely full circle  Samsung announced this morning bright and early. Thank you. Jason Howell for actually coming on the air  7 a.m. Our time the phone that everybody already knew everything about in fact Samsung had already  encouraged  Existing owners to pre-order weeks ago. So this was not a surprise the Samsung Galaxy s  22 the s 22 plus and of most interest I think to us the s 22 ultra  Not because it's the most expensive because it is in fact  The Galaxy Note which they had killed but not only does it look just like a note. It's got a stylus  I mean doesn't that look like the note to you? I mean, it's it's and it's big  I think 6.8 inches and  It's impossible to buy  Samsung open pre-orders  Today and Jason Howell and I and many others  Russell our IT guy. We all been trying to bang it on the site trying to get in  I finally just ordered it from Verizon and nice job D dosing them. Yeah, we  Are we D DOS or what something bad happened?  I don't know a 6.8 inch screen built in s pen boatload of cameras for cameras on the back a  Very high quality selfie cam because after all we know that's the most important thing. That's the one that matters, right? That's what matters  They're doing that 100x zoom again optical  Which no not is it 10x optical? It's 10x optical  3x they've got four lenses  I would think you'd want this and actually does 45 watt fast charging  Small battery though 5,000 milliamp hour battery does support Wi-Fi 6e the latest as well as 5g

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Our four cameras like is that like five blades on your razor

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so you get a hundred and eight megapixel main camera a  108 probably by pixel shifting right in a pixel Baning. Yeah, don't don't buy into it. Yeah, it's not really  3x and 10x  telephoto cameras two of them two lenses a 12 megapixel ultra wide and then on the front you get a  40 megapixel selfie camera. What is the real?  Do you know on these when they do this binning? Is it one quarter of that? Is it really 10 megapixels times?  It is usually one quarter. Yeah, yeah  They're gonna do the night mode a lot of you know all to compete with it. I think the unfortunate  Benighted pixel 6 Pro which is really I think you know Google says it's sold better than any phone ever they've ever made  But we don't know that's not saying much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't know what that means  And still people are complaining even after the February update just came out and they're still complaining about some features  How's yours and I know you weren't happy with the pixel set reading and all that the phone is still fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's just the operating system. This is where he screams. It's the software  Yeah, it's it's  Yeah  In this last update  I did it a couple days ago for the February one and I still had a Bluetooth drop this morning on my way to the studio  Just random Bluetooth drop. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's not me shirt that says I still hate Android 12

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the phone, you know, you want me to sit down with it and and  Go through Lightroom mobile on it and process photos great for that. You want me to  Happen to premiere rush and do a little quick Instagram real great for that  If you want me to just go out and shoot footage of the hard heads doing some training in slow-mo  It's great for that. But the OS

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just not my thing. Now. I'm curious cuz Jeff might be interested in this  They also announced their new tablet the s8 ultra with a giant screen. It's really a laptop  Pretending to be no I want it. I want it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to I want to my nix is seven seven inches fits in the jacket pocket fix in the back pocket. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Want that the yeah, no, I'm I kind of with you  Actually, I have a 12.9 inch iPad Pro and I end up using the mini  Because it's a little bit nicer. So well, it's where I'm using it and stuff  Okay, I don't I don't want to and that's the problem. This is a it's a laptop. It's a  14.6 inch screen  2960 by 1848  240 pixels an inch like the phones it has 120 Hertz refresh  The phones actually go even faster  So it's it's a little lower resolution than a 12.9 inch iPad Pro  But it's a big that's because it's a bigger screen and they are I think if you buy right away  They bundle the keyboard with it, but it's still very it's not cheap. It's a very expensive  Device I think 1100 1200 bucks is a starting price  competing kind of head-to-head  against  Apple's iPad Pro. There's a pen. Yes  Comes I mean there's that's a big difference it comes with a pen and keyboard so that does save you money  How about because the screen again?  14 point something it says what confused me whether Brad is the eight

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's the eight and I think it's gonna be eight inches. No, no, no, it's no, sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  14.6. It's a laptop screen. It's bigger than a lot of laptops actually. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that big you know, why not just get a laptop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well  Yeah, I mean I think this has always been the problem with Android tablets is the software is just not there compared to say iOS  This one has Dex built into it, which is weird because Dex was originally  The idea was you take a phone you dock it and now you have a screen keyboard and mouse and it's a computer  Using the CPU on the phone but Dex kind of works on the tablet like another operating system on the because it's a big  It's like a computer screen. I  Think it's gonna be interesting  That's such a big screen. I it's it's really more a laptop than it is a tablet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thing is Samsung has done well in both of those those areas  They make very nice Android side of the phones as well as the Android side of tablets. You don't really see any other  Android tablets out there that aren't Samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the things they talked about in the event by the way  You can watch the entire stream of the event on our twitch news feed  With Jason how one of the things they talked about was you can shoot 4k video  With this and it has a micro SD slot up to a terabyte. So  Unlike the iPads apples never equipped the iPads with their best cameras  Samsung is equipping  These laptops with their best cameras, so they show people  Taking pictures with this giant laptop and stuff like that gives you a bigger viewfinder, but I don't know it is kind of cool  But it's a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ungainly set a function of like remote work  Do you think like I might be actually trying to work on this and I think it's Samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you know it's a function of Samsung throwing everything against the wall that can  Try to compete in a field that is completely dominated by Apple's iPad  They have the resources for it. Yeah, I mean if you're gonna beat the iPad  How are you gonna be you can't I'm not gonna beat on a software  I mean they showed a drawing program stuff. You're gonna beat it on hardware and  So cameras is one way to beat it including a keyboard and pen  It's also competing by the way against Microsoft surface  Which is kind of the same idea web tablet with a key  Detachable keyboard and pen that kind of is like a tablet a lot of people like if you're in the Windows ecosystem

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of people like that surface pro. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wonder what Kevin will think of the tab  Because it's not a chrome book it's not a Chromebook, but it is designed to kind of I think eat away at that market as well  the SA

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No type of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Terminal access unless you install some term. I'm sure there's Android terminal apps. There are an iOS. Yeah  That's right. He likes the terminal doesn't he? I was not to say no Leo. No  Have I showed you how great the terminal is lately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you know you could play wordle on the terminal I think I'll pass sir think I'll pass

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I think it's interesting and of course  Both Google and Microsoft are kind of partners in this they talked a lot about Microsoft  You know with your phone and it works with Windows on the phone and so forth and here's Google's keyword blog  Unpacking seven features on the latest Samsung Galaxy devices, which is not something you'd ever really expect to see  From Google given. Yeah. Yeah, good  But it but as Samsung showed in the event, you know works with Google Duo  You can duo  And it works with a jam board which is kind of interesting  Robert Kinsel who runs YouTube for Google. I  Can't remember he's a content guy. I can't remember what exact title but he was actually part of the Samsung event  You could pre preview YouTube videos on messages by Google on the Samsung  Optimized for accessibility with voice access, which is great for  people who need accessibility  They're port they're saying it uses material you aren't you happy?  Hey, yay easy to set up Google Play apps on your Galaxy watch for that's another thing  Samsung talked about a watch using I think correct me if I'm wrong  Jason I think that it looked to me like they were showing a  Android wear version of the watch the new Galaxy watch is kind of a hybrid ties in wear  Thing so I maybe that was I was just confused by that  Google Assistant is finally gonna come to the Samsung watch for it did not have the assistant  In fact, it still doesn't but it's going to be soon  YouTube music premium will work on the watch. So Google's kind of acting as if

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like they want to play together now, right? Yeah  Remember they didn't want it when Samsung would do these unpacked presentations  They would never even say the word and remember remember they didn't they wouldn't say the a word

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right. Yeah, I forgot about that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason says that the watch for is wear 3  So it's that new that's a version that's a collaboration between Google and Samsung  Is that the first instance of that collaborative? Well that watch came out earlier. I have it it came out with the flip  I think the flip 3 the phone that is now gonna be Stacy's  And the crowd goes wow, isn't that exciting because I  Bought the s22 ultra so that I can review it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What happened when when when print got watch out history coming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When print got mechanized because I don't think Gutenberg ever thought of something like this. That's no no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but when the lineup came along pretty got mechanized what you saw at the same time like in the arts and crafts movement  You saw a movement toward fine print and people who were still doing hand print  magazines with beautiful fonts that they would cut themselves crazy  Really eccentric people doing it and so the same thing is happening now as the medium dies  Raise the art level of what's left. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not necessarily a bad tendency and so what it means is the  magazines like Entertainment Weekly, which are really for the the people the masses just they go away the  Masses have gone. So we have time magazine is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unnecessary with the web Newsweek is a horrible husk of its former self yet when you work at those places

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They treat the web like poop

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep. Yep, exactly  Well, that's that's a story all this time at least as all as the web

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean when we were doing the site on MSNBC the website and the TV side hated each other  No, it was like, you know oil and water  Because it's like the old media guys thought that the new media guys were killing them. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Major Jeff what?  I said that was my journalism major Jeff that I went into magazine journal. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know when we used to pick the medium when they that kind of quaint  Magazine person. I don't I don't write for newsprint. I write for slick paper

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly, I did ask me internship and everything I was like feature writing for the win

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Paper is slick

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because the ink doesn't absorb in as much and it doesn't spread and so you can have more by CRISPR and pretty ear. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. I thought it was to hold the drool  That killed the conversation you're gonna talk about playboy  But  Actually feature writing dying is a symptom of a lot. I mean there are still by the way, there's still great feature writing  That's what New Yorker does is what far fewer outlets for it  But therefore and I think far because they're far fewer readers and I really do wonder  If people are gonna read long form anything in the years to come I can't imagine my kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spending time with a five thousand word article. I think they'll have they have long form podcasts. They have long form. Well, God knows we do those

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those aren't even well researched my goodness are the new Harper's monthly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Stacy, that's really where the feature was feature rating was going

I  Got all excited when I read the headline Mark Zuckerberg considering shutting down Facebook and Instagram and then I saw oh, it's only in Europe  Don't you love those headlines and actually I love it the the German and French  ministers said oh  fine  After being hacked I've lived without Facebook and Twitter for four years and life has been fantastic  German economy minister Robert Habeck told reporters. He was standing alongside French finance minister Bruno Le Maire  Who said I can confirm  Life is very good without Facebook and we would live very well without Facebook  Digital Giants must understand that the European continent will resist and affirm its sovereignty. Oh  geez  So the what's happening is of course the EU meanwhile by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These people are not standing up to Putin who's trying to invade nations in Europe, but Facebook is threatening theirself

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are many kinds of envision, Monsieur  Facebook  The issue is the EU wants them to store  Data from EU users on European soil Facebook says  No  We we need it. We need that here. We need that data at home  This is the so-called privacy shield  agreement  The current agreements say yeah, you can transfer data, but the EU is thinking about changing that and  Facebook's response was well well  Well, if you do that  We probably in quotes no longer will be able to offer many of our most significant products and services in  Including Facebook and Instagram in the so here's a question

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think that there's a chance that they actually believe that?  Metaverse is their future and that Facebook stays are numbered that they don't care, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You think they kind of know that's where it's headed it's too big I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mean, I think they're betting on the metaverse, but it's not like they're gonna just be like they're not burning. What is it burning their ships?  Well, yeah right like Cortez right we can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's  Several things that work here. I mean it could simply be there  They're you know trying to stare them down say go ahead playing like yeah chicken go ahead try it  Because they you know sure the French foreign minister could say we don't need you  But there are probably millions of Europeans who would not agree  What's app especially although I bet you Instagram. I don't know how popular Instagram and Facebook  It's also possible. They've looked at the bottom line said well, it's a hundred million  euros of  Month or whatever we can afford it and say we'll just write it off our stocks already in the tank  So what the heck well that may actually wouldn't that change the equation maybe that they can't afford to do that  but  By the way, ironically the stock tanking is good for Facebook in one respect because they're now under the 600 billion  Threshold which is all the regulation is going for the regular the US the Congress reg  Regulations say well it only has to be you know big tech 600 billion or more which Facebook no longer is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Imagine that isn't that funny. That's the number of the week man. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or you came up with a third kind of wild-card  Possibility that they just their business is changing and they don't they're they're willing to let go of this part of the business  As long as they but even if they do meta  They still want that data. I mean no matter what Facebook does they want that day

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they want the scale the volume the the the advertising. Yeah, I don't I don't I don't know  But I think it's a silly theory, but they're almost acting like that like okay  Well, I'm sure they want people to try it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  Nick Clegg warned and of course he's known in  the EU  Formerly the EU formerly in the area of the EU  There's no longer in the EU warned that quote a lack of safe secure and legal  International data transfers would damage the economy and hamper the growth of data driven businesses in the EU  The impact would be felt this is Facebook's playbook. Oh think of the small businesses

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think of the Australia. Yeah, right where they were they threatened to pull out news. They did pull out news in Australia  They said okay fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll take our toys and in the in the worst-case scenario  This could mean a small tech startup in Germany would no longer be able to use a US based cloud provider  Oh the horror don't I think there's probably cloud providers in Germany  I might be wrong or at least in the Schwenken countries, right a Spanish product development company could no longer be able to run an operation  Across multiple time zones. Oh, no, that's BS  I run an operation over multiple time zones. I don't even step foot outside Petaloma a  Frank Nick Clegg said a French retailer may find they can no longer maintain a call center in Morocco  Well, that may be true. I would bet the EU thinks that's a good thing, you know bring them home  Anyway, it's a battle obviously this is a  Salvo in the war  Somebody in the chat room mr. Huggy  Which obviously that means he's from Belgium says whatsapp Facebook and Instagram are very popular in Europe  Of course what's that is that's global? Yeah, I think I think he pulled a plug on whatsapp anywhere people will let you know you lose

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lose lose public support they spin off whatsapp without affecting the core business. They don't want to  Because that's where I know that but it doesn't have  The idea that it could be that more stock growth and that doesn't really feed much data into Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They could expand yeah, I mean well basically I  Mean from Facebook's perspective they want it because it gets people who aren't on Facebook, right?  It gets people on their phones. The whole point of acquiring Instagram and whatsapp

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was to expand Facebook's reach to get data from people who don't use Facebook and  Even better to incorporate data from people who do use Facebook incorporate even a richer set like who you talk to who you know  Where you are what you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is the business model for metaverse if it ever really exists  advertising and data or is it instead paywalls and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Selling fake. Hey, well, they haven't said yet  Yeah, I don't think they selling fake. Hey may actually I mean that's everybody's looking at how much money fortnight makes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Selling downloadable content. Can I buy some legs, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a I mean that was in second life there was a very  Still is I guess a very vibrant economy in in app purchases and digital goods  Maybe I would bet you that that  Given Mark's future thinking that's probably what he

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the bowl thing would do let's get out of the data business. It's all it gets us in trouble, right? Let's get out of that  Let's get out of the ad business  Apple has screwed us over. We can't really get the level of data that we depended upon for growth  So let's go Apple. I'm just this I'm not really necessarily believing what I'm saying. I'm playing. No. Yeah. This is a scenario  But but fine to be really bold and strategic  Let's find a way out of they got out of the web business and in the mobile could they get out of the data business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm projecting mr. Zuckerberg, which is not easy since he doesn't have a human brain, but I'm trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Voice you know, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would if I I would just do it like that, but  Not like him at all, but okay him at all no he's more robotic but I  Think I mean  Here's what I think a metaverse is a duplicate of the real world, right?  So every possibility of making money in the real world becomes possible  What's commerce has an as an analog in the metaverse every every one of services?  And if you make your own metaverse you take a percentage of all transactions so it isn't so much about data  It's more I mean, it's you know, it's funny because this is what Jeff Bezos is trying to do in the real world  Mark Zuckerberg says well, we'll do it in our virtual world. And if you could get a billion  Or two billion people in this virtual world  This is kind of the debate over the metaverse is do you want a metaverse?  That's run by individual companies  So like I'm in the Apple metaverse the Facebook metaverse the Google metaverse

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he argued that everything ought to be interoperable. It should be in our operable video  Yeah, it always doesn't have value but interestingly, I mean on the ad side  The two companies that were not affected by Apple's moves were Google and Amazon  Because Amazon are their own vendors advertising to sell more of the stuff that's already there and Google has its own ad infrastructure

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a little bit of a contrarian point of view on this Facebook said  we might lose as much as ten billion dollars next year because of  Apple's checkbox and I think it's BS. I don't think that in fact they're gonna I think they're trying to pretend  That this little mind all the checkbox does is say Apple says you can't have the ID for Apple advertising  market sure bought that  Yeah, because I think Google and Facebook would like to pretend that there are ways to control what they know  That's in their interest. Oh, I see  But before DHS theory, yeah, they're playing 40. Well, if anybody's gonna play 40 chess, it's  our friend Mark data Zuckerberg, I think that probably  They have found ways or will find way snap even said this they said it hasn't hurt us  We made money this quarter for the first time ever and it may take a little while  But we're gonna figure out ways to get all that data  Anyway, they said the thing that shouldn't be said aloud which is yeah big deal. We can get all that data Facebook  Absolutely Google absolutely have ways to get just as much data. They know  Presuming that what Google and Facebook both want is to know everything there is to know about their users  So that when they sell the advertisers they can say, you know, you want a 65 year old man in Petaluma  I got him. I got all of well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the other thing you're saying about the metaverse is they want is maybe they don't get the data anymore to sell to advertisers  Because that's get them in trouble  But they do get it to understand how to put the right pitch for commerce or services or other things to you  Themselves well, which is the Amazon way. It's monopsony

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again versus my lap monopoly saying that if you're here if you own the metaverse  Oh, you are the single source of everything in the metaverse. Actually, that is a monopoly. It's not a manup  It's all you're the only place people can go to buy everything you're the company store  He just what I mean, then you're right. You don't need to sell advertising if you're the company store. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you so an access  basically, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've made I mean they'd make it free because just like fortnight. It's better to be free

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then you get more people. I don't know. I think I think that that there's a  a class V mass  Kind of thing here that I can get it's velvet ropes. How do I get into studio 54?  You can do both

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have the free free both. Yeah, you have a free and then you have the champagne room. Yeah, it's like the public internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then you'll have the VIP. I only know about that from Howard Stern just to be clear

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no sex in the champagne room

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I know we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Allegedly there's lots of champagne  Yeah, but that's I mean, of course well, I don't know if they'll do that but there's nothing that says they couldn't I'm just trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To think are we missing something in this in this tale of their grand strategies? We're missing the metaverse and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Until we have that well, that's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you mean it's completely made up and doesn't exist. Oh, yeah, we're we're building theoreticals on top of hypotheticals

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but it's a legit question say well, what's like a verse? Yes, what's the plan? You know, how why would you spend?  Billions and billions of dollars to create this thing. I mean, what's the what's the upside? They own the hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're gonna build out the computing infrastructure, which means if you want to head if we build a real metaverse  You are going to need some really powerful computers to deliver that quality experience  I've long thought plus the actual like an AWS. Yeah, so I feel like there's a lot of opportunity here  Like on the infrastructure side and then on the access side  Yes, and then also we don't have a rights framework yet for the metaverse  But there's like we talked about this last week. What is it that people are buying up digital properties?  But if you think about like what property means of the metaverse  There are opportunities there, too  There's I mean  Opportunities are really endless because we don't actually know what it's gonna look like or how it's gonna or whether it ever exists  Yeah, that too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's I think it's fascinating I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Am skeptical but it's basically like all the sea stetters instead of actually building the island  They're just gonna do it in you know, so it'll be fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you want a crazy conspiracy theory even further than yours Jeff  Mark knows that we're headed for a climate crisis a total dystopia and  He wants to make a refuge

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If at least we're all gonna be in basements, but we'll be living in the past world in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which is by the way exactly what the metaverse in ready player one is and  So many stories Neuromancer snow crash it's all a  Refuge from the horrible real-world dystopia

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At the end of the day Comcast is gonna want their cut Oh Comcast gonna get it you're right you're right, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's your bandwidth bill gonna be if you're living in the meta right no, we're all gonna have mesh and everything will be fine on the blockchain

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Were you know wired only for like super big data transactions and everybody else was wireless and you had your free networks and  Like you're more capable networks. So I mean we're kind of building that out today

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny you made an excellent point though Stacey we're acting as if this is just around the corner and it's  It might even be a long shot. So it's BS upon BS. That's the ultimate answer to your question Jeff  No, this is not Mark Zuckerberg saying. Oh, we don't care about Europe. We've got the metaverse cuz that's a long way  Oh, yes, I know. That's I was playing Leo. Oh good job. You fooled me sucked me right in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, how do you think we get a three-hour show? Yeah, we managed somehow Wow Starlink

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Launched 49 brand new Starlink satellites, but they didn't pay attention to the weather report this the the  astronomical weather report  The space weather prediction center had a storm watch in place for the day of the launch  due to a giant flare a  full halo coronal mass injection or  FHCME

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Release of plasma and accompanying magnetic fields from the Sun had they paid attention they might have held off on the launch  40 of the 49 satellites are lost jeez  40 of them all 49 satellites reached their 200 kilometer 210 kilometer  perigee deployment orbit  PDO  But what happened with this the storm is actually like a headwind  Drag up to levels up to 50% higher than on previous launches  They tried to minimize the drag by putting the satellites into safe mode  Which turns them to fly edge on  But the drag was so bad. It's still buffeted the devices  they could not then leave safe mode to get into their normal orbit and  They started to spiral in and that's it. They're right enough. Is this is this guy?  No, they actually these are small enough. They burn up in reentry. I was hoping to have a twig contest if somebody brings us

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Feel like we should only be like 10 bucks for that  Goodbye flip phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm not all up on this this space stuff in space weather stuff like say mr.  Rod Powell is or what have you but are you saying that they basically could have just checked the weather report that morning before doing this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it would have been wise not to launch it then  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's an expensive who thinks about space weather, yeah, well if you're maybe the people in charge of launching

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chicks and balances in place and this sounds like it was really  They literally made a hundred to check this more a hundred of these satellites a week

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think it might well be they went just out screw it launch it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I didn't take them down now wouldn't and they waited a week. No once they're in orbit in three weeks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I think they'd be okay. They'd be buffeted. They'd be okay. It was because they were hit during their deployment

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That they okay, I think I know maybe that they don't have deployment processes because startups are really terrible in  I know that Elon Musk does not have  Bureaucracy tolerance, but this is exactly what bureaucracy and processes. Yeah do it's this sort of like here is our checklist  Yeah, and that's hard and boring and a lot of companies hate doing that so I can see how this could get missed and  When you got enough money sloshing around it's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When we had the other space weather calm page I go to every day John says he checks it every day  Could have saved those  What are you worried about I want to bring weather to bring it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I look for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't go every day when we did the ham radio show ham nation  Of course, we would had a have a weekly space weather report because it absolutely affects your propagation of your ham signal and so forth  But that's a wild story  Um significantly impacted by a geomagnetic storm on Friday Oh  Interesting two days before launch a CME hit Earth's magnetic field, but it was not a major space weather event  In fact, this is from space weather calm  In fact the weak impact did not at first spark any remarkable geomagnetic activity  But the earth then passed through the wake of the coronal magnetic eruption  Some sputtering g1 class geomagnetic storms developed it was one of these minor storms so that you know what?  This register article misstates it and once you get to the actual guys at space weather calm and gals  They're saying you know, it was unpredictable. It was okay. It was worse  No, it was one of these minor storms that caught the starling satellites  They didn't they didn't expect it the starling team commanded the satellites into a safe mode  Where they would fly edge on like a sheet of paper to minimize drag  Preliminary analysis showed the increased drag at the low altitudes prevented the satellites from leaving safe mode to begin orbit raising maneuvers and up to  40 of these satellites will reenter or already have re entered the Earth's atmosphere  Do you want to see it?  Sure, this is what it looks like when space degrees debris re enters a satellite that re-enters the Earth's atmosphere over Puerto Rico

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty excited it comes down and burns up then stays up there comes see that the bottom of the screen there that dot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's another one  Here they come like a gang

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  missile command

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're burning up in the atmosphere Wow  Have you actually ever seen  It's funny I've seen it it's wild in fact I have my my trainer said did you see last night there were UFOs that were like 60 of them in a row going across the sky said yeah that's that's a starlink  They when they launch them they're in a they're in a daisy. They're like a bracelet. Oh, I didn't know that they peel off. Yeah, it's really cool  And they're like that in all the astronomy pictures  Yes, exactly  So it's like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're like that in all the astronomy pictures, yes exactly isn't that nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right  See I wouldn't know cuz I every time I look up at night. It's such a hazy sky here in this area  Yeah, I never get to see the moon or smoke you got a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fortune all of this comes from raising  And you know enough money for a small portion of your company that the total if you were to sell it all which you will  Haven't would be more than a billion dollars  So if you raised ten million dollars for a 1% valuation, right then you're a unicorn  So that's part of it also, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There oh, yeah, I was hoping they would tell me how many unicorns they had they were like 25 or something ridiculous

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's your valuation evaluation is just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The valuation is just a hope in a prayer made up. Yeah, the term unicorn dates

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is from Bloomberg Business Week dates to a 23rd  Haven't heard that in a long  Week the term unicorn dates to a 2013 article  By Aileen Lee a venture capitalist who had just started a firm called cowboy ventures writing for tech crunch, which had just started up  2013 is that all no tech crunch

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In like  When I joined Giga Ohm in 2008 tech crunch was already our competitor. So I misread this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought it said new site. It said news site  Her article was about lessons investors could take from examining the few US based tech companies that had reached a billion dollar valuation  in looking at private in US  Public US companies found since 2003 shit and if I 39  unicorns this is in 2013  Arab D&B Dropbox Facebook Group on LinkedIn Tumblr Twitter YouTube you you uber Zynga, you know all the names  But now now there's thousands but the best part of this what are you laughing at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, that's not a bad idea go toast a waffle why I talk about hacker rank  I know a hacker rank because I I do there they have  Challenges coding challenges, which I do and I love hacker rank is a great place  To go if you want to hire coders or if you are a coder and you want to get hired  But you know one of the what is one of the big pain points for both sides with getting hired or hiring is  The interview right between deadlines and frustrating interview tools that just aren't set up for technical interviews  Conducting a tech interview might be the thing you dread the most  You have to first spend the first ten minutes of your interview  Just trying to set up an environment to share code from a dozen documents that waste your time that waste your candidates time  Well hacker rank has a solution really cool solution. It's an IDE for tech interviews  What yes, it's got a set of easy to use interview tools. There it is right there. It's an idea  I love it  you'll quickly find the best developers for your technical projects the developer interview tool includes a  Pre-made question library that saves a lot of time  2,500 questions so you can quickly find the right one for your coding needs a  Code playback feature so you can review the candidates coding approach and score their skill levels  It's even got a built-in whiteboard so the two of you can collaborate in real time to see how problems are solved  This is fun  It makes me want to hire some coders  It's time to reboot your technical interview process with hacker rag of course click interview done start using hacker rank free  free  Today and see how much better a technical interview can be and I bet your candidates will appreciate it, too  It's time to reboot your technical interviews with hacker ranks easy to use tools with a pre-made question library code playback the built-in whiteboard  You're gonna be conducting better  technical interviews help you instantly identify the right talent and it's all free at hacker rank H a C K E R  R a N K yes, there's two hours hacker rank comm slash  Twig and please go to the slash twig part  So we get some credit to start a better tech interview for free today hacker rank.com  slash twig I love hacker rank these guys are great and what a great tool hacker rank comm slash  twig I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Totally admire how excited you get about an IDE

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Development environment yeah, yeah, we live in those start talking about ID. I love IDs  IDEs and waffle toast do you listen to KUOW in beautiful Seattle? I?  Do okay be careful if you have a  If you have a 2016 Mazda I  Do do you really yes, I do well so this is an NPR listener this actually  intrigues me  Because it turns out there's a flaw in the rendering coders will know all about this they're not  Sanitizing their inputs there's a flaw in the engine they actually use JavaScript render the screen not the car engine  Engine the other code engine to render the screen they use JavaScript on the on the entertainment unit and apparently it has trouble with  Unicode characters and some punctuation, and it'll actually crash it so they're  Crash it, but brick it brick it and there are a lot of people who can only listen to KUOW in their Mazda  permanently stuck in 94.9 FM  They didn't they have a little extra stuff in the in the text

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ours technica did a better story because KUOW story starts talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I read their story. I was like well of course they didn't understand it so yeah ours technica figured out that that's what it is  It's a Unicode issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's not a 5g issue. No not at all looking at that. Yeah, but this to me okay, so I love this story  Because it shows like we're building out as we connect all this stuff  And we have companies who are not necessarily used to dealing with software over like a 10-year time frame  Maybe like a car's life  Figuring out how not to accidentally break it and then what happens when you break it who's responsible?  Because the issue here is they break these people's  Infotainment centers it's gonna cost them money to actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Physically replace it if they were but it's Mazda's fault for not properly handling  You can't assume what's gonna come in over the airwaves. It's mistake right admittedly KUW blue  But wait a minute. They're not the first to do this. There's a a podcast called 99% invisible have you heard of this podcast mm-hmm?  There's a person there. It's a great podcast, but don't listen to it in your 2016 Mazda  Because and this and this is the same thing there's a percent in the name of this show  They actually had to create a Mazda safe feed. Oh  Man, oh wow so that is Mazda's fault. It's totally Mazda's fault. Mm-hmm  So the Mazda safe feed has 99 per C ent invisible instead of a December set sign

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So because Mazda is not replacing Mazda's like no we're not gonna replace that that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's bad coding that no it's not that they  Mazda says  Mazda did Mazda said look there's a spec for it  You know it's this additional information that comes through a radio channel nowadays  That you display on the screen and it shows you the name of the artist blah blah blah that at the KUOW sent album art through  and it crashed from Mazda  Software but honestly, I mean you can debate and Mazda's gonna say well, that's an old car  We're not gonna fix it because it is at least it's a six-year-old car, but it is their mistake

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, that's not an old car. My car's six. My car's seven years old and it's a Tesla young

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not rich. I'm not rich. I just we lease our cars so they get a new one every three years and that's why  So ours technically did figure it out apparently so did 99% invisible  And honestly, it's not I'm sorry 2016 is 2016 so it's a six-year-old Mazda

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it says it affects cars from 2014 to 2017 oh interesting so that  I think there's two issues  I think there's two separate things running around here one is specific to 2016 year olds and  Apparently Mazda does say I feel like ours must have updated the story that customers can Mazda will replace it now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For good will they're not admitting. Yeah, help ability. Yeah, right. Yeah, but because of the chip shortage it might take a while, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meanwhile they gotta listen to nothing with liberal NPR. It's a it's a conspiracy. I tell you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So sanitize your inputs kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this is I mean, this is so tough  We're gonna see like I'm imagining like if I download some software to run like energy management for my home  Which I'm like super excited about they but like what if that does something to like my old Nest thermostat?  I'm like, oh crap. How do I fix that?  You know, we're getting to this era where we've got all these software interdependencies and we're not creating provisions to help consumers through them  Like resulting problems and it's gonna suck

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ron Wyden's or a diamond does it if you can find a Joe Wyden  They're even better. Yeah  They're rare, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I only Joe Wyden NFT and I'm telling you and again from Twitter. Thanks to Twitter  It was one year ago today  that lawyer cat lawyer cat visited the hearing and here's the  Thanks to judge Roy Ferguson, who's obviously very hip here is the final  Ending of the lawyer cat hearing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's no laughs I can I can see that I  Think if you click the up arrow next to the start video or stop video button at the bottom  You'll see video settings and I believe in video settings  You will see  You will see the video filters off there's the judge that you can a judge

The judge is actually explaining zoom  There you go  I'm not a  Rod ponton  Not a cat  That's a classic go and it's amazing that the actual judge is posting this  In violation of the  Owned outside it says recording of this hearing or live stream is prohibited violation may constitute content  What's your the judge? I guess if you're the judge  Who's gonna who's gonna really that matters that that makes a difference? I think to Ron ponton it does

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was very much that it's okay to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Judge says okay. Oh  My gosh, that's so wonderful and thank you for reposting that judge Ferguson. You're welcome

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure the judge will have some sort of lawsuit coming their way. That's nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, yeah, I saw that on Twitter as I was doing my work for the show. Well, thank God

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have to look at it. I just let you do it, which is great  All right. Let's do we have a change long. I'm just great. Yes, let's  Thank you, Jason Howell or did you do this and who did the change? No, sir. Mr. Howell. Thank you, Mr  Howell ladies and gentlemen, I now give you the change log orchestra  Let's do they're good. They're good. They got a cattle drum and a couple of horns, but it's still an orchestra

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's not come in from outside the smoking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want somebody to put that on a resume. I was in the Google change log orchestra  Google ads journeys to Chrome  Journeys to Chrome you could in effect resume your search  By searching your history by topic, I think rabbit holes rabbit holes actually great  I mean the history is really kind of I don't know about you, but I use history a lot trying to remember  What was that? Where did I see that? That's because we're old Leo. Yeah, maybe  Journeys a new feature in the Chrome desktop. It groups pages from your search history by topic or intent intent  Providing a more helpful user experience than just showing the chronological list  So here's an example they give on its search engine land based on activity rated related to travel  That's the topic and then a bunch of history results with the word travel in them. I think that's good  That's good. You can either type a topic into your search bar and click resume your research  That's a generous way of saying I know you forgot what you  Let's help you or go to search history and show you don't need to do that  You and I do you and I go on what was  The user will then see a list based on activity related to whatever you query is that's pulled from the search history. It's nice  They announced it as an expider we hear this we but they announced it as an experimental feature a few months ago  And now it is  Official although optional and it is limited to your device does not synchronize  I got it. I think yesterday the  February security patch has rolled out to the Google pixel  Don't know  You know if how important it is. It does say there are bug fixes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm-hmm, which included stuff like  Wi-Fi connectivity and Bluetooth good good and I got it  I think it was Monday when I got it installed and  Nope still have that random Bluetooth drop. Oh sure, but I think it's where it goes. Honestly, I think that's Bluetooth Bluetooth horrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there are quite a few CVEs  Vulnerabilities that were fixed so you probably should apply it as soon as possible  Incidentally kudos to Samsung  When they announced the s22 they did announce that they were gonna do I think four years of security updates so  Following in Google's footsteps. I think that's really important for still not enough  But hey, it's better than nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bosnia car it's six years old screw them and for the phone you're saying four is not enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do a number five five is five would be good. I six is a little too much honestly  Because I think by then there's gonna be stuff that you maybe can't fix with a software update six. Yeah phone  I don't know. Maybe that's what a six-year-old car  That's all cars a car is what we call a durable good, but a phone isn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder about phones that are, you know, five plus five plus years old and just how good are they functioning in any way?  If even if they are patched up from a security standpoint just are people still using phones that old

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's yeah, I mean some people obviously are cuz they yeah, absolutely. I mean I hear from people all the time have really old phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know iPhone 6s or you know, well, I asked that because they're giving away phones a lot of times  You know, well, that's my advice people call the radio show because you know, they're turning off 3g. In fact to 22

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's T-mobile is turning off 3g. And so a lot of phones even if they have LTE for data  But if they use 3g for signaling, there's a lot of fun surprisingly recent phones that won't work anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. So yeah, cuz for when 4g launched they didn't have voice over 4g they had to  So yeah, but those are I mean that was a long time ago, but yeah people are still using it  I mean, I just got my 3g modem replaced in my car. Yeah, that's actually where you see a lot of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so  T-mobile says it's gonna finish shutting down Sprint's CDMA Network March 31st  4g Network  First yeah, I mean  These are all yeah, cuz these are you know, it's expensive to run these extra towers  So AT&T is going off February this month to 222  And Verizon said end of the year  But that's there's a lot of phones and cars and other things with 3g that won't work a lot of old alarm systems

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wrote about it like probably a year or two ago for my podcast or for Stacey and IOT  Your alarm company should have been sending you things to like get you to upgrade like incentives to get you to upgrade  But check some people will be caught unawares

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Medical devices tablets smartwatches vehicle SOS services home security systems and other connected products could be affected  That wasn't in the changelog, but that's a big deal pay attention. Yeah  Google's latest pixel 6 update the one in the February patch breaks some things  Some owners say Wi-Fi is randomly shutting off  So  And or Bluetooth or Bluetooth side  So but you know you fix a thing you break a thing. It's the way of the world  Something's fixed something broken. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Got to like everything software

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you. You know, okay our dishwasher. We keep breaking dishwashers  We are on our third dishwasher in eight years nine years  We moved in my heart a story about this. Yeah. Oh, yeah, Lisa's probably too. So  Dishwasher she's quite colorful ten people came out. I mean literally couldn't fix it  Finally a one guy who comes out with diagnostic tools says oh, yeah, all the circuit boards are fried replaces them dishwasher works fine  Dyes later we replace it with I think it's a kitchen aid  Oh some guy comes out who is kind of not the sharpest tool  He that's not what you say he looks at it and  He touches the he says the motor feels fine and then says  It's fine. And let me know if it doesn't work and then it doesn't work and feels fine. It feels fine. He like felt it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then and then it doesn't dishwasher whisperer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then so we got the extended warranty it's only a year and some months old we got the extended warranty and  We called said yeah, no, he didn't fix it. We keep getting parts in the mail, but no, and then they said  We can't find anybody to fix it  What?  We can't we don't have anybody else. That's it. He's the guy  And so Lisa tries calling somebody else, you know, well, you know, and they said yeah, we could fix it in a year a  year  She's a year. We're both out a year. Maybe I don't know what it is. That's not no, it's not a supply chain issue  It's a service technician issue. I don't know if you've noticed this in bed

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me tell you the Maytag repair man used to be very popular and then he became quite ignored

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe they maybe they all retired do you have a hard time getting handyman plumbers  Technicians things like that. Do you have a hard time getting them?  We can't guess any yes  it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's both a retirement issue and a lack of recruitment coming in. Maybe it was a great resignation. I don't know and then  People had money from their coven  Yeah fees not fees whatever and so they invested in the people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a shame people are not going into the trades anymore. I agree. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes  Anyway, we're all like and what are we gonna do about that? We're hand washing dishes. That's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lisa's okay. She's now gone to the insurance, you know, the third party I always I never buy third-party insurance  She's going to them and she's saying okay  now what are you gonna do you gonna get some new dishwasher because we are now without a dishwasher and  We have parts parts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure there's a YouTube video on how to fix it. Oh, I already tried that do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I try is there is there a button on the dish? Well, there's this is go to terminal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again and on again, but but so with this I think was a  She says a GE I think was a GE there was there was diagnostic tools like, you know  Garage and they plug in your car. Yeah, is that true for all appliances these days or

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, most appliances even those that aren't connected will have some sort of diagnostic. They're all computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They all have boards running them, right? They all have computers. Yeah, and the problem is this guy  Doesn't have this tool so he has to put his hand on the thing  Who could say what's wrong and then we'll know which of the many parts they have sent us to install

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unfortunately, it might be a part that's in short supply like that's the issue like my dad's  Might be they fried the circuit boards in their fridge and unfortunately

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chip shortage are and you get oh interesting. Oh, wow. Okay. Wow, we've uncovered a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Another part my dad's it my dad's a doubly. So he's like, what's he doing? Maybe I could just yeah with the board  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're all gonna be in the metaverse without any refrigerators or dishwashers and we'll be happy dystopia. That's it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll have a fridge or dishwasher, but you'll have to yeah, you'll have a little tube that you suck  Well, what happens when the metaverse breaks that's what I'm thinking  Pixel 3 and 3xl. This is your final update this February security patch  That's it. It's over

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So no, that's what I gave my daughter  This February today the one you just got son of a biscuit. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get her a different phone. Uh-huh. You know, I've got this fine folding phone. She might enjoy. Oh, that's true  I'll give her my five if I get this fold. Oh, we're gonna we gotta get a FedEx this to you right away  Get this to you stat  Pronto. Well, she's good for another month at least but I'll get this to you right away. It's in perfect condition  I'll even include I'll throw it in no additional charge the handy-dandy leather case that goes on it  You want the case because otherwise you're bareback in it it's not good  I just send you money for no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I insist. I don't like I don't mind  I really don't I tried to get money for it. Samsung was gonna give me 350 bucks for it  But then you know nothing so that's what we're saying to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never mind the phone. Can you give me that cooking thing? You're like, no thermo mix

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the problem without the cases, I don't you probably can't see it, but it's kind of like a clothespin  That it doesn't bother you it bothers me, but you put a case on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Seals it all up. I have to put a case on all my phones because they just feel like but yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just slip right out of my little hands. Yeah, slippery. You're gonna actually I predict you're gonna you're gonna flip  You're gonna love this phone if I may coin a phrase I think it's good I really like it  If I didn't have all these other phones, I would be more interested in Android 12 L the hated version  Beta3  Coming now if you want if you're on the beta track for pixel 6 pixel 6 Pro and you're on a 12 L, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. It's just slightly larger in the center, sir

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Slightly larger slightly larger center  And I think there's a little gradient on the red to give it a little highlight like the lights shining on it  But boy if you didn't see him exactly next to each other like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even looking at it next to each other hardly see how many tests and focus groups and meetings did they go through to get that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you remember in the old days Marissa Meyer who was in charge of Google's front page?  There's there when their big product was search, you know, it's very adamant. You can't change it  It's got and they she would go through all those focus groups about the colors and all that stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  AB testing not focus AB testing and data real hard data now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The I wish she'd come back as a search page is junked up like nothing. Look at all this crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it is like shopping on Amazon or going to a TJ Maxx store or something. I mean, it's not that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot more I mean the carbon neutral since 2007 blah blah blah lots of links  I still pretty spare compared to most compared to Moses better. Yeah  And that is the Google change

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't want to talk about age verification and porn. Oh, we could talk about arm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, like moral panics like a porn  I can do it quickly if you're in the UK and you're underage  You'll have to go to a bar and show me your ID to get into a porn site. That's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're anybody and just wait for that data breach just wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you think ID me was bad  Oris Johnson will be in there. Yeah, and actually there's some talk about implementing that in the US. I can't imagine  Given that privacy it's porn and apple pie here in America  That they would do that. Yeah privacy big deal the age verification  This has been going back and forth in the UK for some time now tell us about planning ahead to look at porn  Exactly  Impulse, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For the moment Thursday is porn day around here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's do the Nvidia story there  they were trying to buy arm as funny as the first bid was like 20 billion and then as the value of  Nvidia stock kept going up it ended up  I think 42 billion dollars at this point a video might be going whoo. We dodged a bullet  They've decided because of regulatory headwinds. That's the new word by the way in  Finance markets regulatory headwinds. They are not going to attempt to buy arm  They will have to pay more than a billion dollars in breakup fees to Softbank the current owners  Softbank has decided to do an IPO because they they want to they want to wash their hands of this thing  Yeah, what do you think Stacy good bad? You did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's totally reasonable  I mean when your own customers are coming out against the deal and complaining to regulators that it's a bad idea  You probably shouldn't complete the deal. And so arm has to be an independent entity going forward. I mean, it's just  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Too many. Yeah, if any one company owned it, although, you know, I kind of had this  evil, you know  Genius thing about what would be so cool if arm in a video where the same can they could just do this amazing stuff?  But you're absolutely right. It's bad for everybody else in the business

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The next thing to look for like the reason why it would not be I'll just play a little devil's advocate  Reason why this is silly and the deal should have gone through is because risk five is coming out hard and fast  I hope you're right compete on the instruction set side in Intel this week just said hey, you know what?  We are gonna be all in on risk five. We're gonna do a foundry partnership with sci-fi which makes a  chip configurator kind of thing  For risk five chips, so you don't need to design your own if you don't want to  And we're even gonna manufacture some arm chips. So  You know if I were looking ahead I would say to the arm IPO sure that needs to be done but keep  Risks five in your kind of really for you because that's more open  Than what arm is doing when you think about arm being more open than the x86 license  I think that's all the chip correct me if I'm wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think if risk five is kind of like an open source chip architecture, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is an open source chip architecture. That is exactly what it is  But there are companies like sci-fi that are building ways to make it easier for like I  Couldn't design a ship even with that  But like I don't know if you if you if you try sci-fi site you can go any you're like  Oh, I would like, you know, two l2 caches. I would like these ports  I would like this kind of core that processes Linux and something else kind of like what you do if you buy an arm license  I do but you don't have to buy an arm license to do it. Yeah develop the UC Berkeley. It's not brand new

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's about ten years old  In the chip world, it's a small instruction set but risk five  the reason Intel likes this is because Intel has in effect become two companies one a  Design firm continue to make the x86 stuff. They have already been making the other a foundry  They want a foundry business kind of like TSMC  and  They want to build risk five chips risk five probably has a future though in some of the areas where you know  We've seen these chip shortages the legacy not the not the big powerful chips in PCs and Macs  but the legacy nodes and  Devices and stuff. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually think where you're gonna see risk five. So the big trend in computing is  more  Single not single purpose. It's not general-purpose computing anymore, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We need to get the most performance per watt you would see risk five stuff in IOT you think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's actually companies building risk five for IOT  You see right now the where it's most popular is like Western Digital Nvidia  Seagate they all make risk five chips for governing their own like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so people are already making risk five process. Oh, yeah. Oh, I didn't realize that  I thought we were just at the beginning of that  So they were still performant and they work and people like them. Yeah. Okay. Yeah people are now you're not seeing them today

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're the chips that control the chips on your boards, right?  but they could be used for a  huge you can design something for a huge number of things and that becomes really important because like  When you think about like a machine learning process, you're like, oh what kind of what kind of neural network?  Are you doing? Are you doing a convolutional neural network? Are you doing like a  adversarial network, you know  Let's optimize the hell out of a chip and because you don't have to pay like the mat like the larger licensing fees  And because you can build it yourself and just ship it off to be manufactured  You get a lot more flexibility there. And so you're gonna see this whole like  Opening it's gonna be really I mean  If you're like me, it's really freaking cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's I'm actually very interested I think it's great  Remember the fuss when Google announced we're gonna turn on two factor or two step as they call it verification  for a bunch of people and  Good luck. Well, Google says we turn it on for 150 million people and it has led to a 50% decrease in  Compromised accounts. It's been a success  150 million people  Suddenly have two-step authentication, maybe you're one of them  Of course, we've been saying for a long time as Google turn it on turn it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I guess the difference is at this point. So they just did that for their test group  That's just how I read this correct. This isn't something that was pushed out to everyone by default. No, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're gonna continue auto enrollments in 2022  I'm not sure what qualifies you. All right, because it is an early it's  150 million people in that and I'm like  It's a big number for a test group  The so I guess they're doing it judiciously and and this is the first  Result, which is it's worked at least in making people more secure  What I'd like to know is is good how many people got locked out of their accounts  How many people quit Google forever, you know how how bad it was for the people who just didn't like it  You know what I think Google's right to do it so and it does work  Good stuff. Yep  This pretty it's not onerous. It's the thing where you get the announcement for Google on your phone that you say  Yeah, that was me and you're logged in say it's like single sign-on. So it's not you don't have to have an authenticator  You know, it's not bad. It's actually I love it  Yeah, I've had it for a long time  It's funny because I was just trying to buy that Samsung phone in order to log into my Samsung account  They said okay, we just sent a push notification to your Samsung phone. Everybody's doing it now  Apple does it too. So I think that's a shopify  Shopify does it? Yeah, I think that's good and it's not a text message. That's the other thing. It's a yeah  It's a push notification. It's not text message  By the way, Stacy look at the beautiful wallpapers you get with this Samsung Galaxy flip 3  I  Can't wait  Meta is adding a personal boundary to your legless virtual avatar so that nobody can goose you  to to eliminate harassment I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't think that's the kind of harass. I mean that's fine, but that's not no it there were cases of people who

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  close talkers  No who got  Virtually assaulted

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Women yeah, I've heard this but  Anyway, there's a two-foot radius of virtual personal space  So there's in effect four feet between all avatars

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's that and virtual COVID doesn't get you to could get virtually groped

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that what you're saying, but you're not because it's just I mean, it's just okay  I know but it was a way to represent right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well it's like pretend I'm talking to you about chips and I'm really excited to tell you about arm and  And you're like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
