Mr. Jeff Jarvis, former TV guy credit. Hey, hey, hey.  And college DJ. Hello, Jeff. How's everything?  I'm a failed college DJ.  How's everything in your neck of the New Jersey?  We're doing all right over here. We're doing all right.  Family's good. It's going to rain for the next three days.  Family's well. Everybody's feeling good.  We're doing all right now. Good.  And we know Stacey's not here. It's Botox time in the spring.  So we brought in Mandy Patinkin, the star of Homeland.  It's actually Matthew Ingram, chief digital writer at CJR, the Columbia Journalism Review,  CJR.org. Hey, Matthew.  How you doing?  I've been really enjoying your Instagram posts. Or is it Facebook?  Thanks. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, both. Yeah. The lambs, you mean?  Now that you're on Facebook, see what benefits there are, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm leaving Facebook the minute this is over.  Well, good. We'll see you here for the next three years.  But it's kind of replacing social contact for me.  And then so there is a value to Facebook.  There's a real value to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Matthew, how do you trim the beard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good looking beard.  I don't.  You don't? Well, you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, is it?  It's just you don't trim the beard at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, now and then. I mean, a little bit, but I kind of just been letting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Looks good. It really is. It has that Mandy Patinkin look to it.  It's really, really nice. It's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm debating. I'm really debating getting the beard trimmer at the highest and just doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Man, I'm tempted to. My hair is getting so out of control today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got a real Don Johnson thing going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Normally I part it on the left, but you can't part it on the left when it's  lengthy because then it's weird.  So I part it in the middle, which gives it that Michael Douglas, Don Johnson kind of  sunny crock wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you going for the man bun? You want it to be sort of man bun length?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. It's either that or Professor Erwin Corey. I don't know.  Little stachowski.  Oris Johnson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. You could be a conductor. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm having fun with it. I've always wanted to have long hair and I never had it. And so I  thought it'd be kind of fun. I don't know. I might be man bunning, only in the privacy of my own home  because there seems to be...  I think people will throw blood on you if you go out in public with a man bun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do make certain assumptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. It's not a good look. So, but ponytail, I've really always wanted a ponytail. So maybe  I'll have a ponytail. Also a bad look, but for, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My parents in the sixties hated long hair. The worst fights we got into my entire childhood,  they send me the humiliation. I would leave getting my hair cut. They would send me back  to get more cut off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's awful. See, I didn't have that kind of... Your parents were clearly Nixon Republicans.  Yeah, exactly. Goldwater.  Goldwater, even worse or better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're a communist professor. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I went over to the base. We lived on an Air Force base and I got number two all over.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wow. When Henry and my son, who's now 25, was like two or three, I took him to a barber who  clearly had worked with recruits at the Army base. He took out the... And I wasn't paying close  attention. He took out the... It went... Henry smelled like machine oil at the end of it and had  little time. And I brought him home and Jennifer just burst into tears. It was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What have you done? I'm never letting you take him again.  It worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It worked. Yeah, it did. I wasn't... No, I wasn't aiming for that. I was trying to have a  manly experience with him as a child.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did see somebody... I didn't know that they really still sold them. I saw on Instagram this  week somebody did have a Flowbee and used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I can't imagine that that gives you too good a look.  It's terrible. No, it's garbage.  That's basically a vacuum hose attached to a clipper, right?  Yes.  Yeah, I don't want to... I don't know. I mean, I'm craving a haircut, but it might just be that  intermediate stage you sometimes get at when you... Like with a beard where it's a little itchy,  but if I could just push through... I don't know. I don't think pushing through is going to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  anything for me here. It's like... It's just getting worse and worse and worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At least we didn't dye our hair. Hey, at least we're...  We're old guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, there are a number of...  We're three old guys.  A number of women I know who are a little unhappy with events, so to speak.  So Matthew, how are things? You're in Ottawa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, actually I'm just north of Toronto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Toronto. But you do have baby lambs. I was blown away by how cute those are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They are amazing.  We have one. My youngest daughter is with us and she's a bottle feeding him,  and then he cuddles up with her and has a little snooze in her arms.  Oh, that's so cool.  It's pretty much the cutest thing you've ever seen probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you follow Matthew on Instagram or Facebook, you will see these amazing pictures of lambykins.  They're so cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Plenty of people. When I post them, people I don't even know are like,  thank you. Thank you for the lambs. This is getting me through my day of looking at your lambs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's a public service, really.  No, it is. I thought this, that seeing nature continue normally is a really nice  way to remind yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Another way to look at it is if only we weren't here, think how happy they'd all be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they wouldn't be being bottle fed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's true. But pigs wouldn't be stocking up at the,  I've got to make a political comment, I can't help myself.  So the White House is going to support the Defense Act for bacon, but not for tests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it's more important.  I mean, I get the bacon is a priority.  It is a priority.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I understand bacon is a priority, but give it a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I feel really bad for the meat workers, many of whom are immigrants who will be forced to  shoulder to shoulder in a very dangerous environment. And of course, because there's  unemployment doesn't seem to be working out too well either.  They may just have to go and say, look, I'm going to try to survive this. I'm sorry, but I need to do it for my family.  And that just breaks my heart. I could live without pork products for a while. It'll be okay.  All right. Let's talk about, you know, actually we, God, my hair is terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Men aren't vain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that looks good.  Silver Fox look.  Silver Fox. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should go with it.  Do you use anything on it, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shampoo.  I use the, I use the, no, no, no, I, I never did this, but the Harry's razor has a hair goop.  Oh yeah. That's good goop.  That's good.  Do you use that? You use that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use it now.  I feel like goop because it makes me, my hair feel like it's greasy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but it, no, it, it, it feels a little spiky for about an hour and then it stops.  Settles.  Okay.  Yeah. Yeah. This is, this is, this is our version of Vogue people.  I have beard products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I was going to grow a beard, I got everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yellow wax, got the little tiny brush, got the, got the beard oil. I got all that stuff.  Now I have it. I don't, I don't know what I'm going to do with it.  I guess I should keep it in case, you know, there's a razor shortage or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you, do you ever pull out pictures of yourself from the New Year's Eve and consider?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, never going to shave my head again. Lisa would kill me. Kill me, kill me, kill me.  All right. Let's talk about Mark Zuckerberg.  According to the wall street journal, he is asserting control of Facebook, pushing aside  to centers. He, the board of directors basically had not quite a hundred percent turnover,  but significant turnover. And he is back, baby. I didn't realize he'd settled,  settled back in his armchair, but he's sitting forward right now leaning in.  Uh, what does that mean? Is this because of the troubles Facebook had prior to COVID where they  were getting, see, I feel like this had to take time. Yeah. Cause I feel like now,  even I'm on Facebook now, nobody's, nobody's, nobody's hating on Facebook.  Cause it's the only way we know what's going on with our family.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, realistically, Mark Zuckerberg controlled Facebook before and he controls it now.  He controlled the board before he controls it. Now he controls all the voting shares that matter.  He's got proxies for, uh, board votes. I'm not sure that this is really going to make a big  difference in terms of the actual management of Facebook. I don't know whether he just wanted to  know I think it was around, but I don't think it was an irritation. Right. Matthew, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For him. Yeah. Yeah. But, but function, but your deal is still there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know. Erskine Bowles is gone. Reed Hastings is gone. These are two board members.  Susan Desmond Hellman left last October. She was the lead independent director.  She's Facebook said she was leaving for health and family reasons. This is back  last October. Then she went to Pfizer's board. So maybe her health is better. Um,  it doesn't seem like, I mean, you're right. He never gave up control, but apparently according  to the wall street journal, it's odd that they're putting this out today. I don't know  what happened, but apparently he had relied on Sheryl Sandberg, the operating officer  to handle policy and operational issues. Chris Cox, the chief product officer,  longtime friend to oversee the platform. But starting in 2018, he took on the role of a  wartime leader, announced a series of products that took Facebook in new directions, starting  with, gosh, has it been now a year since he announced the private encrypted messaging?  Has he, have they done anything in that direction at all? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they're, they're moving it like rolling it out. But it, you know, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's just for the sake of argument, just, just, just to play Leo for a second and please do.  I'm tired of being Leo. Uh, let me do my hair today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Now I look like Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the problem. Now. Now I can't, I can't look at myself in the camera and know which side I'm  pushing down. Okay. Anyway. So everybody thought, Oh, Mark Zuckerberg, he's just a, he's just a,  a nasty little crapper and all the problems are him. What if that wasn't the case? What if he  delegated just for the sake of argument, just to be contrarian, what if actually he delegated too  much and he really does have the vision for the place. And it was like Michael Dell. When Dell  went down, Dell had to come back and say, I'm in charge again. And he fixed the company.  There are presidents for this, aren't they? So what if, just to say for argument, I'm just  pulling the trigger. Just give me a chance. Give me a chance. Okay. What if, you know, I like Chris  Cox and you know, I'm sure I'm not, I'm not against people who were delegated to, but, but not only  that other people in charge of the, of the news feed have changed. Security just changed. Tons  of things just changed. What if young Zuckerberg delegated too much and what if he does have a  vision for the place? And now that it's loved for at least a few months, maybe there is a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead. I'm trying. So I would just disagree with that. Fundamentally. I don't think, I mean,  I don't know Mark Zuckerberg, but everything I've read about him and all the people I've talked to  do know something about him. He doesn't delegate in the traditional sense of the word. So he is  intimately involved in all the major decisions that either come from him or managed by him.  So I don't see him as being the kind of guy who would say, well, why don't you take over the  newsfeed or the encryption thing and just get back to me and I'll, you know, go off and do  something else. That's just not the way he operates as far as I know. So New York Times today had a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  story that they have restructured their security team. In fact, displacing more than two dozen  employees. The security team has been kind of in a furor since Alex Stamos left over the Cambridge  Analytica revelations. That was two years ago. Alex Zoom fixer Stamos. Zoom fixer Stamos.  So apparently there was a lot of infighting according to the Times. So Facebook says,  dissolved and dispersed its security group over the last two years. The latest cuts are part of  a change in philosophy on security efforts spurred by infighting and long running issues within the  department. New York Times quoting unnamed sources within Facebook. But it sounds as if  here's the company spokeswoman who gave a statement at the Times. They're going to go  automated to stay ahead of evolving security threats. We're investing more in automated  detection that never goes well and bringing in new skills as we continue to grow our security team  all over. We're growing all over. I am, but that's mostly because I am too many crumpets.  This also means we're restructuring a portion of our team and helping the people affected by this  change find other roles at Facebook. So there is a, this is, this is, I would guess, you know,  if this is happening all of a sudden, this, this is related to the Wall Street Journal's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  report that Mark is, the Zuck is back. I think it's, I think it's a fallout from what happened  with Stamos too though. I know that Facebook has disputed this characterization, but my impression  of what happened is that Alex wanted to raise the alarm about what the Russians were doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they wouldn't let him. Although, you know, on the other hand, remember Stamos's previous job was  at Yahoo where he quit because he said, they never told me about this billion record breach  and how can I work somewhere where they don't keep me in the loop? Maybe it's legit. Maybe this poor  guy just has jumped from one job ad job to another. I don't know. But it's kind of, that's twice now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  he claims. I don't know anything. I wasn't in the loop. So the Yahoo thing rings like that rings true  to me. Yeah, no, I think they did do it because Yahoo, remember Marissa Meyer didn't even tell

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Verizon during the due diligence prior to Verizon buying Yahoo. Didn't even tell them. That's classic.  Verizon was so pissed. They said, wait, give us some money back. That's not. Yeah, that's classic.  Yeah. Yeah. So I, if they didn't tell Verizon their suitor, then I could see how they might have  not told us head of security. And nobody's, nobody's denied this. And it feels like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  restructuring is to kind of de-emphasize the power of that position that Stamos used to hold.  Maybe. Because he had a whole department. Right. And he was, you know. Yeah, it was all under him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then he left two years ago and it kind of, it's so funny though that, I mean, COVID's changed  everything. Life has changed. It's a new world. We're on a different timeline. But among other  things, all the criticisms of Google, Facebook, you know, the tech lash, who's got time for tech  lash? We got, we, right. In fact, people are now embracing Google and Apple because in fact,  it's going to go on your phones tomorrow, kids. The new API. Oh, wait, first. So it's Friday. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's happening? Even Germany, even Germany switched and is now in the Google app. Yes.  France and Germany both said, look, we have a pan European program. We want to use that. France

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was complaining because Apple said, well, no, you can't use this Bluetooth interface  if you want to take data off the phone. We won't let you. Germany on Sunday said, okay.  Germany on Sunday said, okay. Okay. We're going to do it. You have a, we'll, we'll use the, and  you know what I like? And Steve Gibson's taken long looks at this. So I'm trusting Steve's reading  of the white papers ever for. Yeah. And he says they've done the right thing. This is, this is a  system that's designed to protect privacy and yet still allow contact tracing. They made adjustments

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we last spoke about this. Did Steve look into those adjustments? And yes, curious about the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  adjustment. He talked to again yesterday about it, the adjustments improve it. One thing Google  and Apple both said is all the information recorded by these phones will be dumped at the end of this  time. This is not going to be something we're going to hand over to the, your government.  That's the great fear, right? The government will use this or even, you know, private industry will  use this API to collect information. But it's, but it's designed from the ground up to really kind of  not have personally identified information in, in any of this. It just, it, it, it seems like it's  going to be something we're going to need. So Australia's designed their own terrible, terrible  countries that design their own tend to be much worse from a privacy perspective than this Apple  Google thing. So I suspect this is going to end up winning, especially since it will be on all  modern Android and iOS devices. The API gets pushed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. South Korea has an app, but I think it's South Korea, but only like 12% of people downloaded  it. And so then you don't get enough data to make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Singapore. Singapore, 12% adoption of their contact tracing app. 12% in an authoritarian  nation. Yeah. Maybe that's why. I mean, that could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, ding, ding, ding, ding. You pushed too hard. People say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little nervous. Nope. Cause I suspect in the U S I,  we've been pretty cooperative. I think this we've, I'm kind of feel like we've all done a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're, we're, we're in agreement. We're not in agreement with the White House, but we're in  agreement. The interesting thing was I've seen, I saw this this week, I put up, there was a paper  from the UK where you see the far right and the far left are both, especially in Europe,  are, are both open up again. It's kind of fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does it seem like we're moving in that direction? Part of the reason for that  is people like Elon Musk. Yeah.  What was his tweet? Freedom now.  Uh, part of the, part of the reason for that is I think after free America now, that was his tweet,  free America now, uh, is just after what he wants to get his workers back in the factory too. Right?  Yeah. You know, I mean, look, he's living in a mansion with that. He has a, no, there's something,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's some timing thing with his stock. I saw a story about that. Oh, that's terrible.  People back to work. Oh, man. Oh yeah. I should have put it in the, um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Musk's tweet fest. This is according to the esteemed Toronto star.  Is that esteemed? I'm a kind of, I was a Globe and Mail guy. Star is not, you don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think esteemed might be over selling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Musk's tweet fest came a day after his plan to reopen Tesla's lone US vehicle assembly plant  looked doubtful with San Francisco Bay area health authorities looking to extend shelter in place.  It has in fact been extended here to June 1st. Tesla has been eager to reopening after having  clashed with the county and the city over whether it was an essential business and could remain open.  This doesn't mention anything about his stock holdings.  So actually this is from Bloomberg's republished by the star. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I put up on Forbes thing under other, um, February raise expectations. Elon Musk would soon hit the  first tranche of a jaw dropping pay package worth 55 billion over a decade for any performance targets  set by Tesla's board. Oh, you couldn't qualify for a payout of $435 million as early as late April.  Although the timing is increasingly clouded by Tesla's share plunge amid coronavirus concerns.  So it's a $435 million tweet. Maybe, maybe. Don't want to be a conspiracy theorist or anything,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but he's done all right. I think he's just kind of, look, maybe the MTC should look into it.  Oh, please. We have a lot of evidence that Elon is off his rocker or not. I don't know.  Off his rockers quite right. But my point was I think there is increasing pressure. People  are just getting more and more like, I can't take it. I can't take it anymore. And so all  governments, including California, which was very aggressive, are starting to say, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But there, there are layers to this too, though. You know, I mean, I'm thinking about places where  they're saying you have to go back to work. And if you don't, you won't be eligible for anything,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  including healthcare or you have. So that's a problem in this country. Unlike yours,  Matthew, most people in the U S more than half get their health insurance from their job.  Right. And out of work means you have to, you know, you can, you'll most cases you get Cobra,  which means you basically have to cost a fortune to pay for it. I mean, you lose your coverage,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but you have to pay for it. So your state says go back to work and you have to go even at risk  to your health. Right. Because if you don't, you're, you get nothing. Right. Can you just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  take us over please? Canada. I have to say, I'm pretty impressed with Trudeau. He seems to be  doing a nice job. Is it good looking kid? Nice beard. Yeah. No, I think he's done. Yeah. I think  he's done a pretty good job. Facebook is hosting a virtual graduation. Oprah will be your commencement

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  speaker this year. I was just telling my daughter about that. She was supposed to graduate. Does  that satisfy your daughter's need to walk? I think she likes the fact that little Naz X is going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  be in it. Oh, wow. Yeah. Jennifer Garner Simone Biles and Aqua Fina joining Oprah Winfrey. I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  trying to find a Snapchat filter that would make it look like you had a gown and a cap on. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they're working on it right now. So that'll be May 15th. I will watch this 11 a.m. Eastern.  It's hashtag graduation 2020. Facebook and Instagram celebrate the class of 2020.  And little Naz X play Old Town Road because he only has the round. I have, I was just imagining that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  college students are not going to be watching this. Did you, was it, so maybe this is a another one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of those privileged things. But I never really wanted to go to my high school graduation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Did you? I went to my high school in a horrible red gown. Yeah. College I did not go to.  My mother never forgave me for it. Yeah. College is different. I would have gone to college because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's a lot of work. And if the family really loves it and stuff, I didn't graduate. So I didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  get it. I didn't go. Yeah, I didn't go. I didn't go because it was the early 70s. So actually,  it was a time of being obnoxious. My parents were out of the country. So I just took a pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So but there are certainly people for whom the high school graduation is a momentous occasion  for them and their families. College even more so. You know, I went to my daughter's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  college graduation last summer and it was great. And there were. Did you hear about the kids who  made virtual versions of their universities in Minecraft? Yeah. So they were right down to  the square footage and the layout so that they could have virtual graduation. I think that's so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  cool. Japanese students did it. Cal students are doing it right now. I think this is such a  great idea. And the thing is, this generation grew up with Minecraft.  As much as I love Donald Sutherland, I don't really want to watch him do an ad for American  Express right now. Well, I guess I don't have a choice. Group of Cal students is constructing  the entire University of California campus in Minecraft. See this, I want to see. I can jump  ahead. Blockly University. Yeah. And there's high schools in New York and other places.  Oh, it's not even that. It's a GoDaddy ad. Here we go. Minecraft graduation. Look at that.  It's pretty. They've got that's nice. Oh, they even built the cow bowl. There's this. There's  yeah, there's yeah. Blockly University of California Blockly. Because these guys,  that's what they do, man. That's I'm watching this generation. They're so good at Minecraft builds.  And why not? Why not create it? Look at that looks just like musicians are doing like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  performances in Fortnite. Yeah, yeah. Like this is basically second life. Actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this leads us to Siva Vaidyanathan's tweets, which scared the hell out of me. He's a professor.  He's at where's he Georgetown? Where's he? University of Virginia, Virginia. That's right.  UVA. Thomas Jefferson's University. He sounds like he's very worried that if there is no college in  the fall, which is still a possibility that many universities will just go out of business.  Especially colleges, colleges, state schools. Yes or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eight schools. You are we're terribly worried about our budget because, you know, our budget  comes from Cuomo. And now we all have to love him. And we do. But he's got other he tends to be very

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  tough on our budget. And yeah. Some universities are proposing in the face of this. Here's Purdue's  President Daniels saying, what if we have the students come and lock the doors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, yeah, it's very controversial letter. But he's arguing that, well, the young people  don't really have any risk. And we can worry, you know, in a small town, and so we can, you know,  build a wall around it. And we got to get back. They're not going to stay there. They're not going

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to stay there. Of course not. Well, and it's also some question whether young people are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so immune. He's the only the stories. Two things. One is the stories about blood clotting and  strokes are absolutely terrifying among younger people. Two is it has an impact on we don't even  we don't know the full impact yet on other organs. And the CDC CDC said that it's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of their theories was that young people are carriers, but don't may not contract it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but they may be asymptomatic carriers. The truth is, then they all go home to their  we just don't know. There's so much we don't know about this fire. People do get it. We just don't  they do get it, of course. But the but and maybe they don't get it as bad. But still,  it's Kim, we don't know. This is this is a novel virus. And it takes years to really understand  the mechanism of these things. And so I think we assume Oh, look, we're amazing what science can do.  It's incredible. We should know everything by now about this virus. We don't they're just mysteries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't know. So there's been a couple of really good articles. I think the Atlantic had one.  And just going through all the stuff we don't know, right? We don't know how it kills people,  really, it kills seems to kill people in multiple ways, affecting multiple organs,  clotting, sometimes lung, like we literally there, there's more we don't know. And there is that we

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  know, so it's the form of journalism, we should have all the time, Matthew, what I don't start

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with what we don't know. Yeah. Yeah, we talked about that at CGR, actually, really, how how bad  journalists are at saying, I don't know, I don't know. Humans are bad. We don't know humans. Yeah,  humans in particular are bad at it. But at a time like this, it's even more important for the media  to say, we don't know, we literally do not know the answer to this question. It's really important.  And we can tell you what people are saying about it. But we cannot give you. And I think for a long  time, the media tried to seem infallible and omniscient. And and I think that's backfiring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the other thing, Matthew, is we're terrible at working. Let's let's let's do some self hating  journalist moments is we don't we don't understand science as process. Right? We as my father say,  we take the the latest word is the last word. And scientists now that I'm reading them a hell of a  lot, because you'll see there on my lower third bitly slash COVID Twitter list. I'm reading 575  of them every day. One of the great skills of a scientist and an academic is what more research  do we need? What don't we know? And we don't say that in journals. That's that's that's below our

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ego threshold. I remember Dan Gilmore, I think it was or saying that, you know, every good  story about something complex should have a giant box, you know, that says here's what we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And but so few places do that. It's sad. And it makes sense in breaking news, we should be doing  that, right? No, we don't know the motive of the shooter. No, we don't know they're dead, but  and in science news, there was a case I wrote about this last week, I think I talked about it  briefly, but there was a New York Times story that that just quoted the author of a controversial  paper, the Santa Clara paper, and didn't quoted no one else. And we need some very simple basic  standards that when you have a preprint paper, you need to go to people other than the author,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we don't do that. Yeah, I think the preprint thing has really, you know, people see it, and  they're like, oh, it's a scientific paper. And then the guy wrote it as like a scientist and has  letters after his name. And so we should just write whatever it says in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And but but but the preprints, you know, I've written about this, the scientists I've  talked to about this are really grateful for the preprints. It's changed their world immensely,  but they know how to vet it. They know how to they know how to deal with it. But they but they also  do it. So in the case of that, that New York Times story, if the Times had merely searched Twitter,  they would have found five epidemiologists who attacked that paper. And they didn't include it,  they didn't go to the effort. The scientists are out there doing peer review at the speed of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  internet now using Twitter. It's amazing. It's phenomenal. Yeah, that is that is part of I think  what we're struggling with is that science is is happening in real time now in a way that it didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  used. So this is the president of Brown University, Christina Paxson in the New York Times today,  college campuses must reopen in the fall. And she's also proposing the same thing.  Brown has a fence all the way around it, I guess you could you could lock the fence. My mom is  nearby in Cranston, I would hate for her to have health problems because we got 5000 kids  in dorms. Exactly. Exactly. From all over the world. He tweeted too. He said nobody goes to Brown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's tiny. Most most students there in their engineering colleges, there are the  state universities, they're not living in dorms are not going to dining halls, they're not in a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  closed and controlled environment. Right. So what's wrong with zoom? What's wrong with online  education? I thought this might be the beginning of a new wave in in education. Not as good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Works. No, I think it works really well. You're doing it right. I'm taught in zoom.  You know, I'm teaching older students. I also taught I did a class at an undergrad class,  my 40 students and funny undergrads just different than twitchy twitchy because I was boring.  But I'm teaching graduate students and it works pretty damn well. And the problem is  that there are certain things you want to do in person, but there's a lot you could do. It  really should change. I've been thinking for a long time that we should be changing how we use  classroom time. We shouldn't be teaching skills in classroom. We should be teaching that outside  the classroom and doing other things while we're in. It's it's it's an opportunity to learn new  ways. But but my feel even in a place where I am where we change a lot, universities don't change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've had long conversations with my father as we were talking about before the show was a  longtime college professor now retired. And he this is well before COVID. This is 10 years ago.  He thought he talked a little bit about how the original idea of universities,  going back to Cambridge and Oxford was scholars gathering  for a colloquia. It wasn't about students sitting in a lecture as a professor taught them. It wasn't  like a high school is with a teacher and students. It was more collegial. That's where that word comes  from. It was a colloquium of scholars on a topic kind of more something more a little Talmudic,  more like you know, the kind of rabbinical studies just, you know, talking about the Talmud.  And he thought that actually that was a really that's how the in person part of a university  should be. And the rest, the lecture stuff, all of that stuff, he thought could even then could  be online, it doesn't need it doesn't need to be in person. But there is an in person component.  But it's not the teaching part. In fact, that's actually a philosophy in high schools. In fact,  education all over the world right now, they call it flipping, where instead of going to school,  get the lecture and then going home and struggling alone with your homework, you flip it,  the lectures are home at night. And where you go to school is to work to collaborate with your peers  under the auspices of a teacher to understand the material to do the homework, do the homework at

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  school and do the lectures at home. I was part of I was I was up for a  deanship somewhere some time ago, didn't didn't take it. I decided to stay where I am,  or didn't wasn't offered it either. I backed out. But as I was as I was brainstorming myself how to  think about this, it's it's a little trite what I'm about to say, but not for the first time.  But what you need is a genius bar. Right? You need you need the ability for students who are  trying to learn who get in trouble can go to somewhere, go to people and say help me with  this. And that they're self directed. And they know what the goal is, they want to get to that  goal and outcome. And they learn how best they can get there. And then you help them, you provide  services for them to do that. But that doesn't mean spending 45 hours in a classroom, all together  all at the same time at different speeds, learning the same thing. So instead of saying, as these two

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  university presidents are, oh, let's just figure out a way to keep doing what we've been doing all  along. Maybe there's financial constraints. It's certainly universities lose money, it's certainly  very expensive. Even these elite private schools lose money. But but maybe there's we can rethink  what education is at this point. My son has been online in high school. The whole high school  experience. He's a senior, he'll graduate in December, because he's so much he's accelerated  because of his online experience. And he's he loves it. He's very happy with it. In fact,  we were talking about going to the regular school for his senior year, so he could be with his  friends and socialize and stuff, because that's all senior years anyway. And he said, Yeah, but  they're gonna want me to do debate and I don't want to do any public speaking. He's happier,  frankly, in the online school. He's really found a way and I listen and he's talking,  there's other students talking. There's communication. This is a generation that's  grown up when he plays video games. His friends go home to play video games with him. They're all  online. They can't play next to each other. They have to go home to their computer. And then they're  all on discord and they're talking and that's his social life. And that's what he grew up with.  I don't want to judge it. It's not what my social life looked like. But I don't but it seems to work

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for him. So I don't know. So what what choices if he goes to college? He's going to have to go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the regular JC. I don't think there's any online. That's what I'm at. Maybe now maybe now. Now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there are going to be more options that aren't because that was that was one of the great  Instagram accounts. You're all just going online school now. Don't make fun of  what's it called? Not Pacific. Well Pacific. University of Pacific. Yeah. Yeah. University  Pacific. Right. Brown. You're online. Harvard. You're online. Just like everybody else. You're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  online. Right. It's a great equalizer. Honestly, do you even need to go to a university nowadays?  You can. We got to find a way to make it financially worthwhile. But you can take courses  from Stanford, MIT, Harvard. Harvard's incredible computer science course CS50 is free online.  And it's awesome. It's really great. In fact, I'm trying to encourage these high schoolers  to take a freshman year course from Harvard because it's the best computer science course out there.  Right. And any kid anywhere without the means, we do have to figure out how that makes that work.  But I mean, Harvard honestly loses money on every student. They survive through the endowment of  the alumni. So maybe there's some way of making that work. I don't know. It's a different model.  Harvard's very, very expensive. But most students, by the way, and I apologize, I swore at Harvard  two weeks ago. Because I didn't I followed the news instead of reading the real story. Harvard  got $8 million. And I thought it was in this from the stimulus relief package. It was actually a  package intended for higher education to go to students because most of Harvard students  are on scholarship because it's so damn expensive. And it was to support those students. And it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  completely reasonable for Harvard to do that. So students is a lot of money. So in the case of  CUNY, because CUNY is a city university, and we unlike Columbia, where Matthew is, we serve the  people. And so the money that came was tied to students with Pell grants, which does not  be us as a graduate school, no good. But you know, CCNY, you're on Pell grants to be there, then

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah, it was I think that was the same intent. So I think so the money Harvard took completely  appropriate. I apologize, Harvard. I still hate you. But only at football. For different reasons,  only in football. No, I don't hate Harvard. Our best producers are Harvard, man, as I constantly say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so I think, can we talk about Google requiring all advertisers to identify themselves? Yeah,  I think that's good. Don't you? Big deal. I think it's a wonderful thing. We were getting to the  point of the Honest Ads Act of just trying to get them to do it in political advertising.  Facebook was doing that for political advertising. Now to set the standard up to say all advertisers  ought to be transparent. I think it's wonderful. Is there any downside here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, and I'll give you the, I'll give you the, the technological reason to celebrate this.  One of the biggest security problems right now is these automated ad systems, Google, Facebook,  everybody, you don't have to show up. You just can buy an ad, provide the ad collateral,  which can contain malware. And it's happened. Many very prestigious sites have served up malware  because these ads are automated, completely automated. They're purchased automatically.  Nobody reviews them. They go up on the page and boom, you got malware. So I think it's very  valuable and very important. I don't know why they haven't done this before. You should be,  you should be able to, you know, you're buying an ad. We should know who bought the ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an expense because they're going to have to go, this is going to take years. They said to get  all around the world. It's going to start in the U S. But it, but it occurs to me that there's a  value in verification space. Right? So, so now the advantage is that advertisers, if I advertise on  Google, I've, you can find me, you know who I am. Yeah. Yeah. Those ads are better ads. Yeah.  When I did my, my, the COVID Twitter list, you know, I think I mentioned this before.  Twitter came to me and said, can you help get some of these scientists verified? And so I contacted  a lot of them, you know, who, who I thought was very good and, and, and, and did some other  programs. I wasn't paid or anything. The blue check mark. Just the blue check. Yeah. Or the  blue stethoscope. And so there's a verification, right? And the scientists were incredibly grateful  for being verified on Twitter. It meant something because they are used to credentials. Right.  And I think it's fascinating to imagine kind of a, of a, you know, we used to talk about  namespace on the internet. What about a verification space? Well, there are lots of reasons for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's also some fear about that because there is some need for anonymity for some people,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  whistleblowers, abuse. Oh yeah. No, no, no, it shouldn't be, not everybody should be verified.  Right. I think advertisers should. It's not a requirement. I think advertisers should. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for certain tasks. Yeah. Yeah. Here's the, from the Google ad blog, this is what it would look like.  You would hover over the advertisers URL and there'd be an about this advertiser and it would  show their name, their location. And by the way, there's a little switch that says, I don't want  to see any more ads from this advertiser, which is interesting. So I think this is absolutely a  great thing. I think it will, it will make it a safer space. You know, you can't buy an ad on  Twitter. We do more than verify. I mean, we, we get to know you. You can't, anybody's advertising  and, and none of our ads can possibly hurt you because they're just audio, but lots of websites  are running ads with flash in them and all sorts of stuff in them. That's potentially very dangerous.  So I think this is a great idea. I hope Google makes not only makes this, you know, a standard  for all of the Google ads, but sets the standard that other companies have to adhere to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder if this is going to lead to any, you know, a drop in just add buys. I know Google's  well, cause people might not want to do it. I guess if it's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have, but I think Matthew has got, yeah, but they're probably bad ads. They're probably ads  that also cost them effort policing stuff. Right? So, yeah, I'm just thinking I was looking at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  item about Google worried that it's, you know, ad business is going to slow down as a result of  COVID. Right. So the two of those things together might, it's a tough thing to do. Actually Google's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  results are, were good this quarter, but they did, what did they say? 30%. They're not going to be  good next quarter. Add sales loss. Yeah. Microsoft's results are coming out right now. A number of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  companies, Spotify. Go ahead. I have a friend who works in the ad industry, works for a large  um, ad network that I won't name. Um, and he said they're, they've been seeing 30 to 40%

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  drops across the board worldwide. Oh, I don't know. But I think it's,  I think the market might've worked this in Google stock to close today up eight point seven percent

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  101, how much $7? Yeah. Yeah. The stock market loves it. Although  the stock market's looking for any ray of sunlight at this point. I think they don't.  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And the stock market has a very short attention span. That's right. I wouldn't  look for quite some time. I, I got rid of almost all my stock because I just, I'm too old to be  sitting on this, on this ride for much longer. So I locked in those losses. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.  Lock them in. EFF talking about, by the way, the Apple Google API is now out in beta. And I'm,  I think in the next couple of days, you're going to get an Apple update on your iOS devices and an  Android update on your Android devices. It will go in no matter what, right? You can,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you don't have to use it, but it'll be there. It's well, it doesn't do anything until you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  somebody writes an app to use it and that you do not have to download. I got a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a question. What if you have a Huawei phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just what if asking your friend, huh, Matthew? Oh, that's interesting. You don't have the Google  stuff on there. And as I remember, I'm trying to do, I do. It's an older one. I'm sort of  grandfather. All right. If you have Google services on there, you'll get it. I think I remember that  that's how Google's pushing out. This update is through the Google services, basically the Google  Google store API. If you are on a Huawei phone that's de-Googled, I don't think you will get it.  Yeah. I wonder. You would not. I bet you wouldn't. You get a special Chinese version.  Yeah. So then the Chinese government can track you. Yeah. So I would read, if you're concerned  about the privacy, I would read the EFFs complaints. I don't think their complaints are specific. In  other words, nobody really knows how effective these apps will be. They're cautious. We, you know,  most people, is it appropriate to consider a cell phone to equal one cell phone, one person?  You know, is that appropriate? And so things like that, but I don't think they found any  really big problems here. And I think Google and Apple have been very

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  open to any criticism that have responded. I mean, in a way, I think it was Pinboard.  I'm trying, I don't want to try and pronounce his actual name, but.  Maciej Czagorowski. Yeah, that's it. That's exactly how I would have said it. He said that he didn't,  he said, you know, all this, they're doing all this already. Like you've already agreed  to all the things that they're effectively going to be doing. Yeah. They've just, they're just using

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it to. In fact, this is more private than Ad Beacons, which have been on your phone for years.  And I think it's, I think this is a sensible plan and it's, you know, this is the right way to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  forward. We need to. It does not. We've had this argument before, but just be clear. Everyone,  everybody in my feed is saying it will not replace the contract tracers. We need the contract  tracers. Humans. That work is necessary. Human contact. But it's going to be helpful. And if it  reduces the ping pong balls that are bouncing off of each other to a certain rate, it helps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You want to get the, the contagion rate, the R naught down below one,  which it is in many areas. It probably is here just because we've all been sheltering in place,  but the minute everybody goes out, it goes right back. Can you explain something to me, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. R naught, R zero. Why, what does that stand for actually? Do you have any idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm suspecting reproductive rate, but what, as you know, what it means is the number of people  who will be affected by any given person. So if it's less than one, it means that the virus isn't  spreading. If it's more than one, it means it's spreading. And the larger the number, the faster  the spread. And I think the last time I saw, I don't know, it's 2.5 for COVID-19. So every one  person will on average affect two and a half other people. That's a, that's a, that's a geometric  progression. It's a very high rate if it's not controlled somehow. Measles is worse. Measles is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like 12. Measles is very contagious. So we don't really know what the actual R naught is because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  no, we don't know anything. And you know, Lisa said, oh, good news. You just saw it on the TV news.  No, Quest Diagnostics is opening a lab down the street. We can go get antibody tests.  120 bucks. So she said, I said, good, you get it. We don't need to both get it. If you have the  antibodies, and I probably do, and if you don't, then I probably don't. So go ahead and get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then- But know that the antibody, there's not, I think there's-  Because it's meaningless. One approved test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, and it's kind of meaningless. So it's a blood draw, which is one of the better tests. You know,  there's a lot of tests which are a drop on it. But it's not clear what the antibodies even-  What does it even mean? Are you contagious? What if she says, yeah, hey, good news, you had it.  Does she then say, good, I can go walk around? No, because we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the next day. That's the thing. So you start, you know, you're going to test  teachers in school, or you're going to test, oh, I don't know, vice presidents.  Oh my God.  Two days after you get the test, there's no reason you can't have become infected and cannot become-  That's true.  A spreader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true. But no, that's why the antibody tests are useful because in theory, if it's like the  flu, for instance, where having the flu gives you some immunity for about a year, then once you have  the antibodies, you can say, okay, I'm good. But the WHO is making sure that we don't have the  evidence yet to know.  I don't want any golden tickets headed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the new, the updated R0 is 5.7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  5? Wow. See, that's bad.  Is it the numerator or the denominator? I was kind of confused, but we don't have enough tests  overall. Iceland is the only nearly universal enough test, and that's a small population in the  control room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So just like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, apparently, according to Business Insider, is back in the  saddle after years of solely focusing on high impact products like Alexa. Amazon told- actually,  this is a New York Times article. Bezos told the New York Times, Bezos has turned back, quote,  turned back to the here and now problems facing Amazon. And I just want to say I have turned back  to the here and now problems facing Twitter. I am taking the wheel back at Twitter.  Get out there and sell some damn dads, will you?  Now that's a haircut I could live with. Jeff Bezos, who's got excellent eyebrows, though.  Excellent eyebrows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You think they're dyed?  He has a whole team of people just for the eyebrows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. You know, I don't know anything about Jeff Bezos. No one does.  So he's, you know, he's over his divorce. He's settling down. He's going to pay attention.  That good or bad for Amazon? If I were an Amazon stock holder, I'd say yes, right?  Yep.  We want Mr. B in charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've just got to treat the employees better. It's going to backfire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. The optics are very bad when you're the richest man in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not even that. When your company is growing like crazy and is vital.  You know, every company says, oh, our most valuable asset is our employees. We'll mean it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Benedict Evans says, oh, calm down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's in relation to the story above.  That's his M.O., actually.  That's Karsten and me having a dialogue in the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I have to go back then to see Amazon scooped up data from its own sellers,  Wall Street Journal, to launch competing products. How dare they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Benedict points out this happens in retail and has been happening.  Amazon didn't invent it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Grocery stores see what sells and then they make their own brand of it. It's always been there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Clearly, Benedict's a Jeff Jarvis fan because his headline is moral panic.  And then the quote, well done, you've just discovered retail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a big retailer, grocery store company that sells what they call no frills,  which are no name products.  We have generics here.  They basically take whatever people like and then they just make a no name version.  Often it's the same product.  We have that too.  Pete Buttigieg did some consulting for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, really?  He was kind of the no name presidential candidate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was kind of the generic, generic, no frills presidential candidate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see.  Let's take a break and we have a change log to do.  I will allow you gentlemen to pick some stories.  I don't want to be the only arbiter of the news here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I see one that was put in here to irritate me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all about Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Carson is cackling evilly on his deck eating his Taco Bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I could see Carson doing exactly that.  He is a Harvard man.  Our show today brought to you by Eero.  I love my Eero.  Love my Eero.  We're all at home now and your home internet suddenly is looming large, isn't it, in your success?  Wi-Fi used to be great when we only had a few devices, but now that we've got dozens of  IoT devices, we've got neighbors with super powerful routers, suddenly Wi-Fi has been less  reliable.  Well, now you can set up the most reliable Wi-Fi you've ever had, the Eero mesh system.  You can start at $79.  That's a really great starting price and then build it as you need it.  Eero is a mesh system.  That means it blankets your whole home with fast, reliable Wi-Fi, eliminating poor coverage,  no dead spots, no buffering.  You have a signal everywhere.  The best way to think of it is Wi-Fi is like the light from a lamp.  You can't turn on a lamp next to your router and expect the light to shed all the way through  your house.  What you need is your Eero base station and Eero beacons to spread the light through your  home.  Eero sets up in minutes, plugs right into your modem or your modem router.  It has a great app.  You can manage your Eero.  I actually manage, I have an Eero at home and mom has an Eero.  I manage her network from here.  If there's ever a problem, I can look right and see what's going on.  The app does all sorts of wonderful things.  It lets you pause the Wi-Fi for dinner, gives you alerts if any device joins your network.  I always know when people come into my house because I see them joining the network and  it just makes a huge improvement.  I hate that noise that I hear or used to hear.  Here's the Eero app from time to time.  What my wife would say, the Wi-Fi is down again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's exactly what she sounded like.  The Wi-Fi is down again, the port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not anymore, not with Eero.  In fact, Michael's doing, Lisa's working in her office.  Michael's doing his homeschooling online with Eero.  I've got servers running in my office all on Eero.  Here's my download speeds.  So there's a look at all the activity, including security scans.  This week alone, 225,063 security scans.  We don't want malware.  When you're at home, threat blocks.  188 threats have been blocked.  Monday was a bad day for threats.  Well, we were all home, that's why.  I'm not home on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Look how much better that looks.  It must be me.  I must be doing it.  This is Eero Plus, which I really love.  Ad blocking, yes.  3,861 ads and content filters, both of them through our son.  I can look and see what he was trying to see.  He's got devices that are assigned to him, which I can pause.  In fact, I do pause at 10 o'clock at night.  No more gaming.  Eero just gives you total control.  As I mentioned, I can see other networks.  I could switch from my network at home to my mom's network.  She's in Rhode Island.  I could see what's going on with mom's network.  I could see what her...  This used to make me happy.  I would check her internet speed and it was really slow.  She's on fiber now.  616 megabits down, 421 megabits up.  I could see how many security scans, how many threats blocked,  how many ads are blocked.  I love Eero.  Eero is Wi-Fi you deserve.  It fixes all your Wi-Fi issues.  And you can get it fixed as soon as tomorrow for as little as $79.  Get started with Eero right now.  Go to Eero.com slash twit.  Use the offer code twit.  You'll get free overnight shipping at checkout.  Eero.com slash twit.  And don't forget to use that code twit at checkout to get your overnight shipping.  Stop suffering with bad Wi-Fi.  Now that we're all home, we're banging on the Wi-Fi.  We watch a ton of streaming.  We were watching Ozark on Netflix last night.  Michael was playing games in his room.  It's flawless.  Eero.com slash twit.  Offer code twit.  Thank you, Eero, for making Wi-Fi live up to its promise.  All right.  Do your stories and then we'll do the Google changelog.  I want to give Jeff time to get his finger on the drums.  Jeff, what was the story?  You, Jeff Jarvis.  What was this?  There's two Jeffs.  Now it's confusing.  Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody put one in there.  Professor Jarvis.  Suggesting from the Yale Law Journal,  one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read.  Oh, I put this in here.  Oh, I see.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought this was very provocative.  The obsolescence of advertising in the information age.  According to, well, this guy, I'm sorry,  he's an assistant professor at the University of Kentucky  College of Law.  OK.  OK.  And then there are other people involved.  You can take the student out of Yale,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but you can't take the Yale out of the student.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  This might be the Yale Law Review, but it is not.  So the idea, I love, actually, I love this.  I thought this was very provocative,  and I would love to know what you guys think of this.  Here's the abstract.  The vast amount of product information available to consumers  through online search, right?  We know everything.  Renders most obsolete advertising obsolete  as a tool for conveying product information.  Advertising remains useful to firms only  as a tool for persuading consumers to purchase products.  In fact, in the mid-20th century,  courts applying the antitrust laws held such persuasive  advertising is anti-competitive and harmful to consumers.  The FTC didn't do it, didn't do anything about it,  because back then, before the internet,  they didn't want to deprive consumers of the information  value in advertising.  But he says now that advertising doesn't have to give us  information anymore thanks to the internet,  the FTC should renew its campaign against persuasive  advertising by treating all advertising beyond the minimum  required to ensure the product information is available  to online searchers as monopolization,  a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That doesn't sound right.  The legal argument is here is stretched like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  saltwater taffy on a hot day.  Let's go through the points one by one.  First of all, isn't it the case, in fact, this was the hope,  I remember the clutrain manifesto.  Doc Searle's saying, you know, information's perfect now.  Markets are a conversation and thanks to the internet,  if you want to know more about Eero, the ad we just did,  you could find out everything.  I don't need to tell you anything about it.  You find everything you need to know.  All you need to know is it exists.  And you can find that out with a search, just search for mesh  internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is antitrust about that?  So what they later argues in the paper, is it that cuts?  Well, no, I know, we'll get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll get there.  We'll get there.  So I just want to know, do you stipulate that that's the case?  That information is now relatively perfect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The way I put it is advertising is failure.  If your product isn't evident, if your other customers haven't  recommended it to you, if you don't know about it,  then everything else you want, first off and foremost,  because it's all free, fails.  And that's why you advertise.  So advertising is a mark of failure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm not getting into antitrust yet.  We'll get there.  And I agree with you.  There's no, that's no, but anyway, is there anything wrong  with persuasive advertising?  You know, advertising for years, you know, you put the bottle  of scope on your colleague's chair because you don't want  to tell him he's got bad breath.  Advertising for years was all about four out of five doctors  recommend a hearty breakfast or smoke, smoke kents because  there's not a cough in a pack.  Advertising for years is just about not information, but  persuasion, the hidden persuaders.  Do you think that that's problematic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matthew?  No.  That's okay.  No, I mean, and I don't understand how the fact that  you run persuasive advertising can be an antitrust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I'm going to allow you, but I just want to go to the points.  No, not stretching it out.  I think those are both good points.  I think persuasive advertising is manipulative.  Agreed.  And I think I've always said, we try to do our best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Teaching.  So is religion.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, manipulative in the sense that, you know, going back  to Edgar Bernays trying to use his uncle, uncle, Sigmund's  philosophies of the unconscious mind to persuade you, you know,  that you, you need this product.  I think that's manipulative.  I think that I think information is important.  All of the ads we do in every case, the ads we do, we don't  try to manipulate you.  We try it.  We just tell you, here's a product.  Here's how it works.  Here's why we think it's a good idea.  I think that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you could argue that you saying you like it and how much  you like it is designed to be manipulative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because we trust you.  We love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  That's a point.  Now that's somewhat manipulative.  Okay.  So there's some level of persuasion maybe that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, honestly.  Actually, Jeff makes a good point.  All human behavior is manipulative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love this manipulation.  In my mind, the best advertising they've always said is  word of mouth.  In my mind, what we are doing is word of mouth advertising.  Sure.  Yes.  Right.  You're getting as close as you can.  Over the fence saying, hey, this worked great for me.  You ought to try it.  And we try to make that be honest.  So if it's persuasive, it's persuasive the same way love  is persuasive.  It's not a bad kind of persuasion.  But some persuasion, some ads are manipulative.  So maybe we shouldn't say persuasive, but manipulative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, I...  Well, if the manipulation gets to the point where it's  untruthful, then clearly that's something...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the problem there is a lie, not the manipulation.  Right.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Courts applying...  This is the line that we should probably debate.  Courts applying antitrust laws held that such persuasive  advertising is anti-competitive and harmful to consumers.  I'd love to see those cases and see what the issues really are.  So it argued that...  Yeah, it just doesn't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It basically keeps out competitors because you've already...  You've manipulated...  You've persuaded someone this is wonderful so no one else can  enter in.  That's what makes an antitrust law makes no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I do have to say that for a long time, I felt...  A lot of people felt that in the age of the internet,  advertising is less useful and necessary.  Certainly less useful.  And maybe that's why there's a backlash against advertising.  There's a lot of ad blocking going on, a lot of ad skipping going on.  I don't need to hear this.  There's a lot of terrible advertising.  Well, that's true too.  In fact, the only ads we don't skip are the most manipulative ones.  Right?  They'll get you crying a tear.  Google's really good at those manipulative ads or you're crying a tear.  That's manipulative.  I don't know.  I don't think the premise of this is completely far off.  Admittedly, it's shooting me in the foot to say that because  that's the only way I make a living is through...  But how is it...  The antitrust.  That's the part I'm not buying.  Yeah, I mean, it would come down to that whether the courts have said you can't do  persuasive ads and maybe it's not antitrust, but whatever.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So really, the title of this is the obsolescence of advertising in the information age.  Would you agree to that?  Is advertising obsolete?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think advertising as it was, attention-based advertising, yes, is obsolete, not trusted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if you have a product that is indistinguishable from another product?  For instance, Coca-Cola versus Pepsi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, no, sir.  There's a difference.  Now, I may be bi-Cola and I can drink, but I can tell you there is a difference.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me think of a commodity then.  I don't know.  Farmers' John Bacon versus Westfield Ham Bacon.  I don't know.  There are commodity products out there and the only distinguishing feature is there is none.  So my pork bellies are better than your pork bellies because...  Gasoline.  Gasoline.  Gasoline's a good one.  With Tecrolene.  It's got detergent...  Tiger in your tank.  Tiger in your tank.  That's persuasive because there is no difference.  But...  Don't those companies...  Doesn't Esso need...  Esso.  Doesn't Esso need those ads?  Well, that was the tiger in your tank.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uncle Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't Esso need to do that?  Otherwise, Shell will eat their lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The first reference this guy has to something that supports his claim about  marketing and advertising and antitrust is from a case from the 50s.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  So maybe...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was moral panic in its day that advertising...  This was the whole Vance Packard.  Vance Pickard.  Vance Pickard.  The hidden persuaders.  Yeah.  Hidden persuaders.  Yeah.  Subliminal advertising.  All of this moral panic stuff treats everybody but you as sheeple.  As a child.  Right?  Everybody is vulnerable to this horrible force, but not me.  Somehow I'm okay.  That's the same...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the fake news argument as well.  You can't distinguish a fake news story, so I have to choose for you.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, some people cannot.  Let's be real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's pretty clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had a conversation with someone nearby who believes that 5G caused COVID.  What? Really?  And the government is trying to...  Oh.  And chemtrails, like you name it.  All the hotspots, keywords.  There are some soft brains.  Some are just lost.  Let me describe just a part of this conversation.  So he mentioned to someone else, David Ick or Icky or whatever his name is,  this lunatic former footballer who has written books and been on TV  espousing conspiracy theories who literally believes that some people are lizards.  And so I mentioned that this man's clearly mentally ill.  And this guy said...  So he said, okay, so the lizard thing is a little weird, but he does make some good points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The alien reptilian legacy.  They were aliens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was on a thing today, which is very good, which is going on still today and tomorrow.  And it's called Reset Everything at reseteverything.events.  Guy put together 24 hours of programming.  I did a thing about media.  There were things from doctors, other things.  Really pretty interesting.  But there was a panel discussion and a professor I know was on it.  And I recommended that she be on it.  And there were some others.  And then a guy who's all involved in crypto tried to argue to me against expertise.  What do you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does he have against expertise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, basically it's anti-institutional.  That's where we are today.  And that's why people aren't trusting science.  They don't trust news.  They don't trust educators.  And they don't trust professors.  They don't trust the government.  And so they want to tear it down.  And that's where we are.  And that's true.  Yeah, the institutions haven't been great.  And they deserve to be slapped around.  And they need to adapt.  But without them entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, the title of your 630 a.m. talk, my time, was In the Crisis,  Journalism Must Amplify Expertise.  In the Aftermath, We Must Rebuild from the Ashes.  Good titles.  Good titles.  You're good at titles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this was a good, I think he bought it.  But this is a guy named Sebastian Couture, Canadian.  He said, is it much nicer than I do?  Put together, it's pretty nice.  It's still going on right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just hope if we hit the reset button that everything is not in Courier font in the future.  Better than Comic Sans.  Better than Comic Sans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess.  I was talking to somebody about the sort of distrust of expertise and institutions.  And I was saying in a way, I mean, journalists are trained to be skeptical of things, right?  To question what the government says or question what experts say.  And that's a good thing.  But it almost seems like people take it to extremes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we're going to question expertise, but trust expertise.  And we're not going to get rid of advertising.  Has that been settled?  But we'd like to have haircuts.  But we do desperately need haircuts.  Was there any story before we get to the changelog, Matthew, that you want us to cover?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did.  Well, I haven't actually looked into it that much, but I was looking at  Facebook's new sort of chatbot, I guess, an open source.  Chatbot, Blender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's been, remember Microsoft Tay, the racist chatbot?  Turned racist in about eight hours.  Yeah, because people will game anything they can.  So this is Blender.  It's an open domain chatbot, outperforms others in terms of engagement,  also feels more human.  I don't know if that's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of moral panic.  Yeah, Tay was pretty human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't know where we can try this.  They've released the code.  As a combination of years of research, we've announced we've built an open source Blender,  the largest open domain chatbot.  Well, let me see if I can get where it says we built.  Now, see, here's a Cornell scholarly article on recipes for building an open domain chatbot.  So I don't know if anybody's done it yet.  Here's video.  I just think they have a demo.  Hi, how are you today?  I'm good.  How are you?  Do you have a favorite food?  Mine is lobster.  Doing well.  My favorite food is cake.  I just bought one because I got promoted at work.  Congratulations on the promotion.  I don't know who the bot is, actually.  I think I'm doing the bot right.  Congratulations on the promotion.  What kind of work do you do?  I work in software.  Oh, thanks so much.  I just want to make my parents proud.  I'm an engineer.  I'm sure they will be very proud of you.  What type of engineering do you work in?  I am an environmental engineer.  What's it like to work in software?  It can be a lot of work, but it is very rewarding.  Do you enjoy your job?  I love it.  It's very important to protect the environment.  That's great.  Do you have any hobbies?  I like to play tennis in my spare time.  I have to say, Blender is on the spectrum.  I'm not very coordinated, so I don't play sports.  I do like to play the guitar, though.  That's awesome.  I've always wanted to learn how to play an instrument.  What kind of music do you play?  Mostly alternative rock.  That's cool.  I like alternative rock as well.  What are some of your favorite bands?  I like Modest Mouse and the Smashing Pumpkins.  I saw them in concert.  I love the Smashing Pumpkins.  I saw them in concert a few years ago.  What's your favorite Smashing Pumpkins song?  Mine is today.  Today is a great song.  Bye.  My favorite song of theirs is Searching Geek USA.  Working.  Working.  That's an amazing track, too.  You have great taste.  Well, I'm so glad we had this conversation.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, the human being didn't sound that human.  No, they both were awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to have this conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you see, I'm trying to remember who did it.  They got two chat bots to talk to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see that?  Yeah, they had like an Amazon Echo and a Google Voice or something.  Yeah, that's right.  Going back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And at one point, one of them said that they loved them.  The other one, it got weird quite quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It got weird.  Kind of the story of this whole show.  It got weird.  So I don't know where I can play with Blender.  I wouldn't mind.  But you know, God, is it any better than Eliza was 100 years ago?  I mean, yeah.  Do we even care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These guys.  It is.  One of the things I find interesting about it is how hard it is.  Like, it's not just...  Humans are complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard because human beings are hard.  Well, and we have a very highly developed sense of detecting off humans  so that we can either run away as fast as possible or slay them.  So I think that actually this is why it's so challenging  is more than even making something that sounds human  is fooling this biologically highly evolved sense that we have  for what is normal and what is not.  Very hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could see, you know, especially for people who find it difficult to talk to  other human beings about whatever their problems might be  if we can get them working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It did seem they obviously clearly were aiming at empathy, right?  Or reflecting, reflection and empathy.  So maybe they are trying to make a blender psychiatrist.  All right.  I think we can play the drums now.  Jeff, he is a drummer after all.  It's time for...  The Google change log.  Oh, man.  Right on the money.  Boom.  Google Meet video conferencing.  The stuff that the enterprise paid so much for now free for all.  All you need is a Gmail account or a Google account.  Obviously threatened by the incredible growth of Zoom.  Unfortunately, you do have to have a Google account to participate.  You can create free meetings of up to 100 people.  Can last any amount of time.  Although after September 30th restrictions may return.  But you can't just join the meeting by clicking a link as you can with Zoom.  You'll have to be logged into your Google account.  I think a lot of people are logged in.  And Google says we do this so that there won't be any Zoom bombing.  This is that thing where you have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw it today for the first time.  I was in the reset everything and it was just in the comments.  Yeah.  And somebody came in and they...  What motivates someone?  They put in the N-word like 200 times before somebody could just block the account.  What was the purpose?  What do you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just idiots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's always...  It's puzzle...  This endless puzzlement.  I don't know.  You're tempted to say, well, that's just a teenager.  But it's not.  Often it's a grown human with a day job and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it doesn't say anything about mankind.  And it doesn't really say anything about Zoom.  It doesn't say anything about the internet.  It says something about one idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's not even clever or interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just dumb.  You know what Alfred said?  Alfred E. Newman?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. Alfred the butler.  What did Alfred the butler say?  Batman Begins, I think.  Some people just want to watch the world burn.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Perfect line.  In fact, I think I could make a meme out of that.  Well done.  Well done.  Some people.  Google now warns you if your search terms aren't going to get you great results.  So Google will now alert you if there aren't any good results for your search terms.  I would really like to see trigger this, but I don't know how.  It will also offer...  Because my terms are always so good.  It will also offer tips on helping you reformulate your terms.  It will be rolling out in the US first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I could find this insulting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's the example Google gave.  Let's see what happens.  Minus b plus or minus square root b m.  And it did give me a result.  So maybe it hasn't rolled out yet.  That was their example.  That was the example.  Here's what it was supposed to do.  It looks like there aren't any great matches for your search.  Try using words that might appear on the page you're looking for.  For example, cake recipes.  Sure.  Somebody types minus b plus or minus square root b m.  Minus b and they want a cake recipe.  They want a cake recipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What they're looking for is a cake recipe, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know what they're looking for is the answer to their homework problems  is what they're looking for.  Yeah.  So it hasn't rolled out to me, but kids, if you're typing in homework questions,  Google might help you if you do it just right.  Google kills.  Are you ready?  I'm ready to shed a tear.  Anytime I see a sentence begin, Google kills.  What'll it kill next?  What's on the Google chopping block?  Oh no, shoelace.  Did you ever, do you even know what that was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I literally never heard of it.  No.  Literally never heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I do like business and Charlie Wood's choice of this particular picture of Sundar  Pichai meditatively squeezing his lower lip in probably some sadness over having to  pull the shoe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he's thinking to himself, what is shoelace?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never heard of that.  That is, that is, that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Try to remember back.  Was that back in 86?  Shoe leather?  What?  Shoe?  What?  What?  This is what, what could it possibly have been?  What would a shoelace indicate?  This is clearly what you would get if you bring people together,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  bring people together,  people with common interests.  Yes.  Yes.  Like two laces on a shoe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, cute.  I got it.  I got it.  You're going to use your shoelace to tie your hands down so you don't touch your face like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is the picture you get if you search on the clip art sites for the word  pensive.  You get this if you, you know, it's not April 1st, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  No.  So this was a real thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Neither of you had heard of it either.  I put that in there.  Never.  Neither of you had heard of it.  No.  And here's the quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it.  Given the current health crisis, we don't feel like now is the right time  to invest further in this project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That no one has heard of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're done.  Here's the FAQ, the shoelace deprecation FAQ.  By the way, a lot of people reading it right now.  There's a kangaroo and a wolverine and a hippo.  Yeah, I saw that.  Yeah.  Why is shoelace being shut down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because no one knew what the hell it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're proud of the work we accomplished.  Will you reboot shoelace once mandated social distancing is ended?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  May 12th, your shoelace account will be deleted.  I want to know how many user accounts there were.  Is it shoelace.google.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can, I think.  Yeah.  Oh, I feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know who I feel bad for is the poor person who really,  they probably, this was their baby.  This is their baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so here's the story.  Here's the headline, July 12, 2019.  Google takes another run at social networking with shoelace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Running away from it now.  Can I save my data?  It's a terrible metaphor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you fill out a form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The whole shoelace thing just doesn't work.  Here's the form you have to fill out, a shoelace data export request.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Jesus.  This is a joke.  This is an elaborate prank.  I can't even go to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the verge story, there's a picture of a guy with two big a smile.  Oh, here it is.  I just moved to the neighborhood with my Beagle mix.  Max, any dog owners around want to meet up today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, it was for New York.  That's why.  It was New York.  It was an invitation only for New York.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why no one's ever heard.  These guys are laughing.  Someone just described.  Google did what?  Shoelace?  What?  Google said what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shoelace is not a social network.  Nope.  It's a movement to celebrate the people and places that make New York City great.  And look how they're-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you have to start off with it's not a social network, you are on the wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All they really did was make a really great webpage.  Find and join activities near you.  If you want to join-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was like four square.  Was it sort of four square like?  I wonder.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Download the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead, Liam.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do it.  Let's do it.  Shoelace hang with others.  Rediscover.  Oh, it's on the iPhone and the iPad.  No.  You know what?  Shouldn't there be like-  I would bet there are people-  You know how people collect old bits of technology and try to get them working again?  There should be some way that you can collect old apps like this.  Because this is going to just disappear like it never existed.  Like it never existed.  All the bits will go back.  There'll be another one.  Yeah, here it is.  I'm downloading it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There'll be another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hang with others IRL.  That's the tagline.  All the kids say that.  Oh, so much for that.  This is like an event.  That's why it's not-  It's like actually get together with you.  Yeah, that's why it's dead now.  I wonder if-  No one's using it.  Yeah.  Well, no, it's not like four squares.  It's saying, oh, you like skating.  I like music.  Let's all get together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ooh.  Currently trending-  Mr. Goodbar, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sign in with Google.  Oh, what?  Some of it's-  Oh, I don't actually have to sign in, do I?  You know who I am.  Do you know who I am?  It says unable to sign in anyway.  Shulaces built by Area 120, which is their research thing.  So this is an experiment.  Yeah, but an ill-timed experiment because, of course, no one's getting together.  So bye-bye, shoelace.  Just going to untie that one.  Finally, finally, Waze is finally testing lane guidance for navigation.  So Elon Musk's Tesla has shipped out a thing that knows stop signs.  Red lights can drive you all the way.  Waze, trying to keep up, is going to show you which lane you should be in if you're going to exit here.  Which is handy.  Yeah, but don't-  Doesn't everybody else do that?  Stay in the second lane from the left.  Things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It helps that it's in Hebrew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, apparently only in Israel will you be able to use this.  I don't even know what we're looking at.  This lane guidance for Waze is starting in Israel,  but it will work much like the navigation feature in Google Maps.  A heads-up to change lane to a traveling on a multi-lane road.  Yeah, that's nice.  You want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is pretty amazing how Google has left Waze in Israel and alone to develop on their own.  Right.  Good.  Yeah, I'm happy.  That's where they're based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's where it's based.  But they share data, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Oh yeah, they absolutely do.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They didn't at first, though.  No, they didn't at first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the reason Waze didn't do it, according to a Reddit post,  by a Waze map editor, is they were worried it would be distracting.  The voice is sufficient.  They didn't want to show too much because it would distract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, here's a test.  Here's a test.  Both of you, when you use any of you,  the apps, do you do voice or visual or both?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not a hard question.  What was it like driving?  When you were a kid, did you get in the car and drive places, daddy?  I use both, but my Cars Nav will show it on the screen in front of me, as well as the voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's fine.  I hate the voice.  Don't do the voice.  Why do I follow only to the voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use both.  Yeah, I hate the voice.  Yeah, the voice, it's too late, usually, when the voice tells you.  I need to kind of get more advanced information.  Your wife won't look at the screen.  She'll only listen.  Pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matthew?  So my wife and I have a thing where she turns on Waze and the voice  and then also gives me other directions at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it's fun to boss you around.  Argue with it?  Does she disagree with Waze?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Did you see the tweet from...  I can't remember who it was, but they said,  we have a fun game my wife and I played during COVID.  It's called, why do you do it that way?  And there are no winners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How long have you been married?  37 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just glad to hear that you can be married 37 years  and still have those conversations.  That's encouraging.  Why do you do it that way?  Early on, Lisa and I would fight over which way the silverware should go  in the dishwasher with fork and times up or handle up.  Right?  Why do you do it that way?  I don't remember anymore because she won.  So whatever way she wanted to do it is the way we do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The end you use goes up, obviously.  Everybody knows that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.  I was mistakenly of the end you use goes down.  Because you want it when you empty it.  I want to take it by the handle.  I don't want to touch the tines.  Now that we're all sanitized.  I guess if the forks are up, if the tines are up, it washes better.  Yes.  That's the theory.  But honestly, it washes just fine either way.  I'll be honest.  It doesn't make any difference.  Yeah.  Then the other thing we fight on, I lost them all,  but I don't like putting pots.  The toilet paper roll?  No, no.  Nobody disagrees over that.  It's always got to go over the top.  Who thinks it goes under the bottom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No one.  So my daughter had a counter argument, which is very powerful.  If you have a pet, like say a cat, if it's over the front, the top,  then your pet can basically unroll the whole thing by swiping it.  Whereas if it's over the back, it's harder for them to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very good.  That's a good argument.  That's a good one.  Is that from experience or theory?  Yes.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Real life experience.  Oh, that's a good theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like it.  And that, my friends, is the Google changelog.  Plus a little lifelore from Matthew Ingram.  I'm glad you could be here.  Miss Stacey, she'll be back next week, but I'm glad, Matthew, you could be here.  She was a little angry with me last week.  Did you hear that?  Uh-oh.  No, she was mad because we were looking at some sourdough starter.  And I said, that is a mighty fine looking starter.  And she thought I was talking about the woman who created it, not the starter.  Oh, geez.  And she really wanted to punch me.  But fortunately, all was explained.  It was a comma blunder.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Remember that, Jeff?  Jeff, we were lucky.  It was a woman had built a Twilio.  An employee had built a lid that you put on your starter.  Oh, cool.  And it measures its humidity and expansion.  So you have always this feedback.  Wow.  Yeah.  And it used the cell network and everything.  It was really clever idea.  That would be handy.  And...  My daughter was making some.  Admittedly, she had some mighty fine looking starter.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So do you know the oldest known starter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  How old is it?  Is it the Boudin starter in San Francisco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm putting it in right now.  I'm putting it in right now.  Is it as old as the Boudin starter?  Or other.  Well, according to a local story,  it's a classic Newcastle woman maintained...  I don't know if you know it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty old, but I think the sourdough...  122 year old starter, but it's still the older one.  No, it's not the oldest.  That's typical of Newcastle, wherever that might be.  Is that in New Jersey?  I doubt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a star tribune.  Here's a Guardian story.  Rising fame.  Experts, Harold, Canadian woman's 120 year old starter.  I'm going to type in oldest sourdough...  San Francisco Boudin is 160.  That's what I thought.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's 160.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what?  There's a guy who has a sourdough starter museum.  This frustrates me.  Yeah, we have done all the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is an example of Google really making a mess of the news.  What do we find if I search oldest sourdough starter Lucille  and her 120 year old starter?  Right under it, the 160 year old starter.  But then right under that, man makes sourdough from a 4500 year old Egyptian yeast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does that count?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sour is sour.  He made it in the traditional way too.  It's Egyptian sourdough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can, if you make sourdough, roll it.  You can put it in a paste on a silicone piece of paper, roll it, flatten it.  Roll it and dry it and it'll be just yeast.  It's just like any other yeast.  So that's probably what the Egyptians did.  And he made some bread from it.  Truthfully, I don't.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I've discovered now what to do with sourdough discard.  I want to share this with everybody because it's what you do.  It was a life changing revelation.  Okay.  Thanks to my friends at King Arthur Flower.  So anybody who's made sourdough knows that you have to feed it, right?  Because it's a living organism.  So you give it fresh flour and water every single day.  And if you think about it, that means it gets bigger  and you have a lot of extra sourdough every day, like a cup or two.  And for the longest time for years, I've been throwing it out.  Like, what do you do with this?  Well, it turns out you do a lot of wonderful things,  but there is nothing better than King Arthur Flowers sourdough discard crumpets.  Oh, my God.  I am going to gain a thousand pounds because this takes no time.  You take a cup of sourdough starter, a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of sugar,  and the key ingredient, three eighths of a teaspoon of baking soda.  That's what makes the little bubbles.  I had no idea.  You mix it all together.  You heat your griddle on medium low heat.  You pour it out.  Now you're better off if you've got those rings, which I got.  I actually ordered on Amazon.  I ordered little crumpet rings and you pour them into the ring,  one inch high and four inches across.  And you cook them five minutes on one side, flip them,  cook them three minutes on the other side until they're golden brown.  It's the best crumpets you've ever had in your life.  And the problem is it makes four.  I eat them all immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, warm.  Oh, I like a good little clotted cream.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the next thing.  I got to make clotted cream.  What is clotted cream?  How do you make clotted cream?  You take cream and you just really thick cream.  Cook it in a double boiler for a long time.  It's not worth it.  It is worth it.  Actually, it is worth it.  Well, the crumpets are going to kill me.  The cream will just make it go down easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  I mean, I made these last night.  I made these this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get a cup of sourdough discard every single day.  It's crumpets forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't let it go to waste.  Sourdough pretzels.  Did I see that there?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, this is good.  That'd be good.  By the way, this is my pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to just give it to you right now.  King Arthur Flowers Sourdough Discard Recipes.  It's a whole page.  By the way, I've made the classic sourdough waffles.  Best waffles you've ever had in your entire life.  Sourdough cinnamon buns are pretty good.  Sourdough cinnamon buns, sourdough pretzels, chocolate cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, by the way, I found this out from my father  trying to order his orders on Instacart.  There appears to be a nationwide shortage of wheat thins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  You could probably make sourdough wheat thins at home.  No, he won't please.  The reason you do sourdough starter is because nobody can get yeast.  There is a shortage of yeast, but you don't need yeast.  That's right.  You got your own sourdough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't know.  So we tried to make it here and it didn't work that well.  I didn't realize that you're basically trying to encourage yeast out of the air.  Wherever you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's yeast everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so depending on where you are, but depending on where you are,  the humidity, the sort of local environment.  You can do it.  Yeah, it's perfect here because we're in wine country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's yeast floating through the air all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it depends on where you are.  It can even change the flavor.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  The terroir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The terroir of sourdough is very, very distinct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody is a sourdough ask back for an entire Instagram feed.  It's like basically baking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to get out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The COVID don't kill you.  The cholesterol will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  COVID-19, they call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the COVID-19.  I got it right here.  Do you want to share a thing or a pic, Mr. Matthew Ingram?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this was one in the rundown, I guess, which I love for sort of a weird reason.  I love the Boston Dynamics spot.  Oh, yeah.  The dog.  Yeah.  So they're trying to kind of make them useful for telemedicine, I guess.  So they...  Little less scary.  So you have this sort of frightening headless dog thing.  And then you have an iPad with your face on it.  Yeah.  And so this looks to me like something you would see in the game Half-Life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Coming for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is going into the rooms of people who have fevers and delirium.  Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a winner.  It's 100%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm your doctor.  Does it make the sound?  Let me see.  I got to hear the sound because I love the...  See, they didn't put a video in here.  TechCrunch needs a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, I think it's definitely...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello.  I'm your doctor.  Lemma, come over and visit you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And all they have to do is hook Spot Up with like a syringe, maybe injection mechanism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what it needs.  It just needs a needle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, a little sourdough tip for you, Mr. Matthew Ingram, rye flour.  Rye has some very nice yeasts.  If your sourdough is lagging or seems a little tired, a little rye flour will pick it right up.  And it doesn't change the flavor a lot.  I only make mine from hand-ground, stone-ground, spelt berries.  And it's fabulous.  Everything I do is whole wheat.  I don't use that.  I don't use that white flour.  It's all whole wheat.  That's why it's okay if I eat four crumpets a day.  Four pounds of it.  Yeah, a day, every single day for the rest of my life, which won't be very long.  Jeff Jarvis, number of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, we got a few choices here.  Let me just ask you this.  Have you seen the dog derby, the guy who the sports sports commentator who does his dogs?  I love it.  You see the rematch?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there a new one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are we allowed to play this?  We're gonna get in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I don't care what Carson says.  He's a Harvard man.  Let's listen and watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You need the sound.  So into the final minute and all of in possession.  But this is where Mabel is strong.  So I should explain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got a black lab and a golden lab sitting next to each other, looking at each other.  The black lab has an orange dog bone in its mouth.  He's in possession.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Seeing the game using that intensity, we saw it in the semifinal, staring at a slightly  torn cloth rabbit for over seven and a half minutes.  Perhaps a few signs of overconfidence from her rival, a bit of showboating.  To be careful.  There's the change from the classic hold still placed in the outside, though great technique.  And a glance at the youngster who shows little emotion, but her mind will be empty.  20 seconds to go now.  Olive closing in on victory in that coveted prize of being told she's a very good dog.  One paw to control and a switch.  Now Mabel sensing this might be a chance.  Still waiting, still believing.  And you wonder what Olive is doing here.  Only has to hold on going to the upright, though high tariff with no opposable thumbs.  High risk at this stage.  And it's gone and Mabel takes it.  No mercy from the younger dog who takes this victory just as time runs out.  A famous win built on patience.  And sheer belief.  When Olive only thoughts of what might have been, but only herself to blame.  She's given this one away and that will hurt most of all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my god, that's freaking brilliant.  Isn't that brilliant?  Isn't that just great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mr. Andrew Cotter, C-O-T-T-E-R on the Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He has a new one up.  Beautiful.  While he's waiting for a rematch, there's a new one up on his Twitter feed of them  doing synchronous swimming.  But if you want to watch that one too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is incredible.  I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're doing nothing at all and that's the beauty of it.  There we are.  No recognition, no recall whatsoever.  A stair that says I'm doing what I want and I have zero respect for you.  There might be a move by Olive.  A response to this effort by the youngster.  Yes, there it is.  Joining a rival again.  Absolutely no purpose to it.  Not fetching anything, just wandering around.  Synchronized spin.  A nice touch.  Now both of them wondering how to finish this off.  No point in shaking yet.  You're still in the water.  There's the hop.  Beautifully done.  And there we are.  Shaking all over my jeans.  Even Olive enjoyed that one.  She knows that she can still take it by shaking over the furniture back at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does this guy do?  Is he the...  He's a sportscaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He just pours the tears.  Oh, but he's so good.  Did you saw the original one?  Yes, we played it before.  The original The Reedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really...  Well, and even before that, he was doing people waiting at a bus shelter and...  Yeah, that's right.  He's really great.  Was he a golf commentator?  Is it cricket?  What is his...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was golf.  I think it was golf because he had a funny one in his feed about a Venn diagram  of people who are here for boring golf things and people here for the dogs and there's no overlap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there he is.  And it's not really what you'd expect him to look like.  Andrew Cotter.  Mr. Andrew Cotter.  Broadcasting, hosting, writing.  And Andrew, you have a standing invitation to join us on the show.  And anytime, do a play by play.  He's in the UK.  That is...  So two, two dogs.  That's the number.  That is really an example of how the world has so dramatically changed.  No sports.  So we're watching dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really great.  What are betters doing?  Oh, so when I was at the Daily News in New York, we had this horrible  racist little cartoon like Ching Chow was called.  There was a little China man.  It was awful.  Oh my God.  Is it there?  Right.  And it was in the sports section and we went on strike.  We ran out of space and we ran out of money.  So we got rid of it.  Oh my God.  There was a problem because the people who played the numbers used it.  They would count the hairs on Ching Chow's head.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Betters can bet on anything.  Exactly.  So I suspect there are betters betting even on this show.  How long it will be.  The over under is a minute at whatever.  Moral panic.  48 minutes.  Will moral panic be mentioned?  Will Gutenberg be mentioned?  Both.  This week.  Thank you, Matthew, for filling in.  Great to see you.  He is a digital writer, which means he uses his fingers as many do for the Columbia Journalism  Review CJR.org.  Joins us each week.  No, not every week, but as many weeks as we can get them.  Thank you, Matthew.  Stay well with your lambs.  They're beautiful and your fam.  Enjoy your crumpets.  Thank you.  See you later.  Thank you, Matthew.

Are you working on a book right now?  I'm trying to, but I'm Gutenberg.  Is it hard to work on a book when nothing's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really hard because I try to get from COVID brain to Gutenberg brain.  It's really impossible.  I thought, you know, Pete Dominic, have you ever run across Pete Dominic?  Wonderful guy, podcaster now, radio guy.  Comedy.  He was just saying so many people were learning how much the commute has been rotting their  body and soul when I was about to tweet to him that, yeah, I thought that giving up my  three hour plus commute a day, I have the book written by now.  Yeah, you'd think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like we'd have all this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  No.  And I'm listening to fewer books too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't even trim it.  That's just obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, a little bit when there's bits sticking out, but it just does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, eventually it's going to get longer and longer, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's going to be, well, when Matthew originally put it up,  I immediately put up a picture of David Letterman, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is not a Letterman beard.  It's a beautiful beard.  It's it's shapely.  It's got a nice tone and letterman's got a good, he's got a, he looks like a good, like crazy  old man on the porch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Virginia.  Yeah.  Sitting on the porch.  Yeah.  Beard.  Well, that's a style of beard.  You know, it's a style indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
