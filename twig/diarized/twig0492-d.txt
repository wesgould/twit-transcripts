Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the effort has took me off the list the efforts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you used to get a press pass to go to I was a member of the International Media Council nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I brought them no money well suppose they but I brought them no money, so they used my seat for somebody else yeah  That's fair  That and I apparently like  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and they don't oh really Washington Post yes, so women Davos the billionaires don't like her Davos has an appeal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I would bet 70% tax marginal tax rate would be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sticking point for some of Washington Post did it just did a story about how her name comes up often  Which is a reason to like her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Jeff Jarvis professor of journalism at the City University of New York  also here Stacey Higginbotham she  Covers IOT for Stacey on IOT comm and does a great IOT podcast with Kevin Toffle

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hi Stacey, and she's stuffy and has a scarf to keep her threat warm. I have to say you feeling okay  Are you feeling bad or is it just kind of irritating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not feeling my best

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just ask hey  What do you think of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have an opinion now the 1% don't like her, but you know you could still win with 99% of the vote  That's the key  So Google we just got an update from Stacey Higginbotham who brought us this breaking news  Google has been fine. We knew this by the French  regulator for privacy  CNIL as Jeff says Kniell  50 million dollars for violating GDPR  Stacey says Google has announced it's going to fight

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can pull up a story for you 50 million euros, which is about 57 million dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now actually if I read this properly  Kniell explained Google had filed violated two provisions of the law. This is according to ours technical first  By not making its data collection policies easily accessible enough. They didn't contend that the policies weren't  available  To end users. It's just that there were too many different places. It was too difficult to find and  Then second by not obtaining sufficient and specific  user consent for ad personalization  Kniell said it has to be every single place you're doing it. You can't just say in general  Do you do you mind if we collect data about you for personalizing ads you have to say it at YouTube you have to  Say Google Maps you have to say it in Hangouts. You have to say every single service

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Plus so that's only because Google is more split up than other things  But but but sure should the New York or should should  The the Le Monde have to ask your permission in the food section and the book section  Right and the news section and the sports section. It's basically equivalent

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it isn't though because that all comes in a package called a newspaper not anymore it doesn't what you line

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you you go to the same site and Google doesn't I mean, you know maps is owned by Google and you know  Android maybe not but all other Google properties you are aware that they're owned by Google Google changed this remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We made a big we talked a lot about it a couple of years ago when Google  Unified their privacy policy across the board for all of its services YouTube was the big one that hadn't for a long time that really  Run separately they incorporated all of it together  And obviously from you from Google's point of view it makes sense to aggregate a bunch of a lot of this happens a lot in  media where you'll aggregate a bunch of different kinds of  platforms or media or into one thing because it's easier to sell that big thing and then spread it out  Now who is Max Schrems because this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He is an Austrian who has been the thorn in the side of all the platforms, especially Facebook, but also Google where he's done  Projects stunts where he shows how much the platforms follow him or he he  Showed how his phone followed him everywhere and so he he's a provocateur and he ends up then filing suits  on behalf of all Europe  Against the various platforms. So he says in this article by ours

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Following the introduction of GDPR we have found that large corporations such as Google  Simply interprets a lot differently and have only  superficial  Superficially adopted their products. It is important. The authorities make it clear that simply claiming to be compliant is not enough  He runs an organization called  No, y be dot EU not your business or none of your business dot EU  It's also complaining against Instagram. What's app and Facebook. Those are all pending  So I think this is there is room for appeal here because they're not saying Google doesn't tell people they're just saying they don't make it easy  Which would think that there'd be a step. I don't know what what happened what can you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's two questions. Is was there a step here where can you'll said guys?  You're not doing this right and then there was a chance to remedy and then said that's what the GDPR is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They passed a law and the next step when she passed a law is to start enforcing the law  So that's the answer to your first question. So this is the act of enforcement

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then is it not the first time as somebody's been fined under GDPR or no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Under GDPR or no, I know there's been some smaller fines in different countries

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the questions we had last year when GDPR became law and one of the things a lot of people said is well  Let's wait and see how they enforce it  Yeah, we're very

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quiet they were very quiet about how they were going to enforce it and different data  protection agencies have different  They are each able to enforce it right  So  Okay, and none of them prior to actually the law being passed  None of them gave any indication of how they were going to do this. So what's happening here is it this is I mean  This is how the law works  He passed a law then you're like in Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were gonna be the target sometimes and I think GDPR had this isn't there kind of this  Process where under the law you're warned  Offered an opportunity to remediate then if you don't that's that's the safe. That's the safe harbor stuff about copyright. Yeah, I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But my real question is this  so the French can go now are finding Google can the Germans and then and the Norwegians and the  The Dutch also find Google under the same law. I thought it was he was known under one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. So every country has their own  Group that monitor regular I don't yeah. Yeah, I don't know if you can be fined multiple times  That is an excellent question that you would have to ask a lawyer  But would you like Google statement? Yes. Yes, please  Here is what a Google spokesperson spokesperson said in a statement  We've worked hard to create a GDPR consent process for personalized ads that is as  Transparent and straightforward as possible based on a regulatory guidance and user experience testing  We're also concerned about the impact of this ruling on publishers original content creators and tech companies in Europe and beyond

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dun dun dun and we should point out  That this is not the full extent of the fine  They could have it will have you to find up to 4% of the global revenue 2% of global 4%  Which would have been 4 billion dollars this 50 million dollars is frankly Google could easily pay it. I think this is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Appealing it is on principle and they should I mean, this is how we figure these things out  I mean this regulation hasn't been tested in court  I think one could argue that a 57 million dollar fine is either  You know  Tied to the I guess how badly the French regulators feel that Google has screwed up  So maybe they're like, yeah, this isn't a huge thing, but it's kind of a thing Google. So let's get this fixed  So there's a lot of different ways you could interpret this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the question and this is an illegal question, but I think  It speaks to the issue does  A why doesn't Google make it clearer?  You know, I mean why don't they just say okay fine we'll put a we'll put a pop-up everywhere  Why don't they make it clear and is do people really not know what's going on?  Do they need to make it clear are there is Google not doing a good job completely independent of the law information

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think it's really hard  So I was actually talking to a company just before I did this this show about how they could improve their security  how they could improve communications around their data collection and security practices and  You know the solution I came up with is actually doing some sort of interactive quiz and incenting people to take it to get  What is actually informed consent, right?  And I think it's just so overwhelming to contemplate these things we don't have a language for  plain language for the upper a lot of these issues, right and  Every company is worried or many companies are worried about the risk of scaring people if they actually  Explain kind of some of the risks and things because people will read the worst into it  So there's like a business fear here  It's really hard to get informed consent over something as complicated as how someone like Google might use your data from different services  And then three readers our users aren't actually going to click through it. So I think that's why  That's a real issue that we we just have to solve and no one's sure how

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's my opinion  That Google doesn't care

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  if

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have to put it up everywhere because they think most people don't you they go? Yeah. Yeah  Yeah, and go on with they're not gonna do anything about it  That there's no harm and I bet you they have data to show this and other services

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You might say is it not worth it leave Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not gonna leave right and then and Google knows they're gonna do fine. No matter what you know you could it's like it's like  Cigarettes you could put all the warnings on the cigarette pack you want you're still gonna sell them and I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, let's be honest. This is a political act  So I put up in the in the chat there were other fines there were four other  Examples and they put in the chat  No, I can't find them. I have the link here. Okay, good  Portuguese hospital was fined 400,000 euro after the staff used bogus accounts to access patient records  The German social media and chat service was  20,000 euro for storing social media passwords and plain text  Oh  Austria was fined  4,800 for having a security camera that was filming public space, which I think is all over Europe  I'd be that as it may but the problem is we didn't know any of that that didn't make any big splash  It's a political act now the whole world knows about GDPR being  Kniehl's business because they went up to Google Google or Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's a political act. Okay. It's not just a political act Google and Facebook have  the  most  Most to lose in some ways, I mean they're what people care about so in that sense, yes, but they're also  Some of the biggest vacuum cleaners out there sucking up our data and using it  And so if you can get Google and Facebook to comply with GDPR, there's gonna be a couple of effects one  People will feel more secure overall  To Google and Facebook could develop or open source technology that makes it easier for other companies to adopt  You know to be compliant with GDPR. They have all the smart people in the room some Portuguese Hospital. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is really telling if you look at what I just previous finds have been they've been for things we would all agree are  Really egregious breaches of trust, you know  Staff use bogus accounts to access patient records the social media password stored in plain text a security camera  Filming public space. These are  Okay, you're right, it's a public space but no anyway  You could say okay. That's as good. These are this is stuff  Privacy regulation should definitely address  But you you could say with the Google thing that that was that's like well Google you're just not open enough  It's not like I'll tell you you want to find here's a fine. This just came out and this is incredibly infuriating  This this morning we learned that a database  with more than 24 million financial and banking documents  from some of the biggest banks in the US  Was online in the clear with no login no password anyone could access it  it was exposed for two weeks an independent security researcher found it as soon as  Tech crunch asked banks who's who's this whose customer service?  Information was it the budget was shut down January 15th. Just a week ago  The leak was trans traced back to a company that the third party the financial industry uses  They among the services they provided this company ascension converts paper documents and handwritten notes into computer readable files  It's an OCR company. So they did OCR for these banks and some big banks by the way  including  city financial  HSBC life insurance Wells Fargo Capital One and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development  These records were online. They included not everything social security numbers  checking account numbers names address birth dates loan agreements  Look at this is a sample record that kinds of stuff  This was all in the public now that should have an egregious fine. That's a breach just like us  the four you talked about before except well, maybe not the  Security camera but well that to me is a really good look admittedly they can prosecute anything they want  But why isn't Kniell go I mean this is the kind of thing I would I think GDP not well that's in the US and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there  They will prosecute those things but they also this law has a bunch of this is not just hey  You're storing your passwords in a crappy way. This law is supposed to help  Inform and let users control their data and that's why they're going after a variety of cases

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, so Leo, do you have a tunnel bear or something on your on your machine there? Can you go act as if you're in France?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Germany or UK would be readily not easily. Okay, so that's what I want to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I want to see if I go in to one of these services, what does it was it? What does it give me?  Because you know, here's the thing the states there's this minute ago  Google has the best darn lawyers you can imagine  so you you've got to believe that they went over this with a fine-tooth comb and  Came up with their view of the of the of the best of practice most defensible  Implementation of GDPR they could imagine they were gonna screw around it wasn't it's not worth it for them to screw around with us, right?  And and I think what you said before is right there there's a there's a there's a hunger judgment for a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Judgment call this is a case. This isn't a blatantly obvious breach of public trust. This is a judgment case

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, this is this is establishing the boundaries of the law and I think I mean well, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it is I mean look come on it's it's definitely political. It's definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's political in the sense that  Creating laws is political. It's political in the sense that they they have an agenda when they created this law  They created the law and now they're going forth with that agenda

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what bothers me because if the agenda is let's take down these big United States

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The agenda isn't the agenda really isn't that the agenda really is to control is to let people have more access and control  Over their data and how it's used  unfortunately

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I sat in Kenneel's office and I heard French regulator who's French regulator  Just went after them with the head of it I've had long conversations with her and I think she's a very reasonable and smart person  But other people around the table  politicians and regulators and such there is an appetite to  Bring down the big guys. I got to agree with Leo on this one and and they're looking for that opportunity  I don't think there was anything egregious that Google could have done in this case. Oh my god  How can they not go after Google?  That was right, it's a dial. Oh, it's not it's not prominent enough. It's not frequent enough  Well define enough and I'll bet the law this is where they're gonna win in court  The law is probably not gonna be explicit enough because the their lawyers  I'm sure did a good job and said here's what the law says about enough and here's what we're doing  Maybe a little more but that's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think Stacy that Google flouted the law or is it flaunted flouted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Google flout law a flaunted flouting the law

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  After they threw down the gauntlet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, there was a great discussion about the difference in flout and flaunt on reddit  they were talking about concealed carry and  The whole thing started by somebody said  What did they do in the Wild West?  about people carrying their guns is just everybody have a gun on their hip and they and  Ultimately came down to the I thought the perfect sentence which was they  flouted the ordinance by flaunting their ordinance  Think about it  They flouted the ordinance by flaunting their ordinance yes  Ordinance is another word for ammunition and they thought it was ammunition. Is it is it  Any weaponry I think it's any weaponry it's mounted guns artillery  So they flouted in other words  Blew off the ordinance the law by flaunting because they were saying in  That was why the shootout at okay  Corral happened is because the whatever boys wouldn't wouldn't put their guns up as they went into town  So why I had to shoot him. Okay, it's ordinance is  These the law they flaunted the ordinance by flaunting their ordinance

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that's what was confusing me at first because you had the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now if they'd been ordained we would have had a conversation  Anyway did Google flout  GDP are  Like did they say oh screw that we're never gonna get no they did the best they thought they could do without

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they did the minimum they thought they could so that's the question what I would expect  So that's the question is the minimum they thought they could do so I don't think frankly agreement about the requirement  What's the minimum? Yeah? Yeah, and that's that's how that's how laws. Yeah. That's what we do  That's why you go to court is how that discussion is when you go to court. Yeah, and then then the court will decide  Or they'll settle I mean they'll sit down in the room and France will be like we're really pissed off about this and Google  Be like I don't care and France is like I'm gonna find you. They're like fine. We'll talk

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I may be my guess a Google is  Willing to put up whatever notice at least for the first part put up whatever notices  They're required to put up but they understand that it's annoying like this cookie law that that we have to put up with it's annoying  To users to see these so they said well, what would be the?  What would be the minimum compliance with the law that would not annoy our users and this is what they decided and then and then  Keneal decide said no, that's not enough. We want more or max shrems  We want more and I don't so what I'm saying is I don't think Google's acting in bad faith here  Because honestly I think if if if if Keneal came back said we want something like the cookie  Google so say you guys are idiots, but they would do it because you know what it would make any difference to their business in  the long run

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I signed on to tunnel bear  As if I'm in the UK  But it's not it's not working for waiting for proxy tunnel. Never mind. You need Express VPN. I find I do  I was no I in fact do need that and I was thinking about doing that after the last

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sponsorship it yeah, the less you pay for VPN the slower it is  Anyway, I think this is it's certainly not the last time we'll have this conversation  you know the reason I asked the questions that I asked is is Google evil here or  Is it just a question of interpretation?  And I don't think Google's being evil I think that they're you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just where Stacy and we are discreet only on degrees to is that she's saying that there's a there's a  they want a test case and this is a test case and that's what they want they got to do and  We're arguing that it's a little more politically motivated than Stacy would agree. Would that be true Stacy?  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, yes, no, yes, yes, okay, I'm gonna stop we should talk about something else. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think we've really flattened this one  There's every ever we've squeezed the life out of it much like this ball python has squeezed the light out of my keyboard. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it happy? How do we know if it's happy? Well, it's yawning a lot now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's some debate among ball python fans if the yawning is because it's sleepy or because it's measuring my head to see if it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Swallow me. Oh my gosh, that would make such great television think about your ratings

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where Leo go right there he's in the middle. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mean, it's not gonna kill you but in the meantime the clip is gonna go viral. What doesn't kill you makes you slightly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You go viral. Yeah, that's good. You know what? That's the new YouTube generation  Screw Nietzsche. We got YouTube. What doesn't kill you makes you go viral. What doesn't kill you makes you go viral

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Python by the way, I started watching that fire festival documentary on Netflix

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, oh is it people have been raving about it's really good. Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just shows you where we've gotten to with this whole Instagram social media marketer  hype machine that  It's I don't know. I don't I haven't finished it  So I don't know if it's a conge it was a con job or just something that got out of control  But it were gone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I was gonna say the whole thing reminds me of my mom, you know  She would always tell me some people Stacey. They just have more money than sense  Yeah, and and that's what I'm like. Oh  Yeah, I mean, I feel bad just taking that a lot of people got caught

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, this was the festival just to refresh your memory from April of last year  That was so ill-planned that when people got there instead of the luxury  combinations and gourmet meals they they got a hurricane survivor tent and a piece of bread with butter on it and  Then there was no concert at all and there are lawsuits and all sorts of things flying back and forth  But really it's a good documentary to watch because it's a testament to our times. I mean they marketed  They did the viral marketing brilliantly. They're really good at the viral marketing  Really bad at producing a product to match the viral marketing and you can you can make people want something  The question is can you deliver easy peasy and there's this whole the thing is there's this network of influencers  One of the things the fire festival guys did is they promised?  500 Instagram influencers free tickets and accommodations at the festival if they would  at a specific date and time all push an Instagram picture of just a  orange  Screen and everybody did it at once with the hashtag fire festival. I can't wait or something like that  I mean they were really good at viral marketing the problem was then they get to the festival and they don't know what to do with  These 500 influencers because they're expecting tickets to a show and luxury accommodations and all they got is nothing  It was really interesting. What was also interesting is there were a number of people who saw the fraud happening?  Who tried to put they put up a website  They tried to created a Twitter account saying don't go or if you go we know what's going on fire festival people you got to tell  People are gonna go in two weeks of this festival that there's nothing there for them  They can't they'll be stranded all this stuff and it was ignored so that the the the people who were doing the you know  The bell ringing the alarm didn't really know how to use  The  Influencers in the same effective way  Wasn't there wasn't a governor on it, right? Yeah, it was really interesting and they got they brought out  12 female supermodels to dance around on the beach and bikinis and they that was like a year before the event and they used  The video from that right up to the day before the event as if this is what's gonna happen  It was it's it's a good documentary. It's on Netflix. It's very it was also a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was a ton of con the VidCon alternative Oh  Two years ago, I believe didn't hear about that, which was a very small scale same thing  Yeah  Tana  Was irritated for some reason with VidCon and decided to have her own VidCon across the street  and got a room in like a Marriott and  To many people showed up they didn't really have anything there were safety issues  All kinds of like because because I can go online and I can market this I can go to Kickstarter and I can go to patreon  And I can go to YouTube and I can excite people about something  Oops

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What you wish for we've gotten this marketing with his viral marketing. It's so good. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of you think about it's just like vaporware taken to yeah that next I mean, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean it's really caused causing her, you know havoc  Yeah, and of course it's gonna attract conmen now. I mean be  buyer beware because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know if the internet will get blamed for the bad actions of human beings, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but again as we've talked about many times the internet has weaponized the bad action of human beings, right?  They're able to do stuff  so much more effectively than ever before we get our

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Systems in place and institutions and so I just got a new book here from

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you ever read these you just show them?  You must read all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a thin but look how thin it is. Oh, okay. I'm still reading the book. I started last month  Man, well, yeah, I I do audio books by doom on you know, two two of a commute. That's the difference  Commute makes a huge difference. Yeah, if I've got a user for research, I read it  So yeah when I can I just for I just listened to Kamala Harris's book already you've done with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw you bought the hat read the book bought the hat bought the hat bought the hat. Yep  I bought the Kamala, but I think you're jumping a little too soon here. I mean, there's I might be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have did I have requested the deletion of my Facebook feed later today. I will literally delete my Twitter feed  No more deactivation. I'm taking this taking this serious

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, are you listening to Farhad in the New York Times about never tweeting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have not but Farhad is now no longer a tech columnist. He's an opinion on the editorial board  He's opinion maker. Yes, that's interesting now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is Viacom up to they bought VidCon right right now? They just bought Pluto TV  for a whopping  340 million what is  Tell us that please Pluto TV is one of the fastest growing free ad supported TV streaming surfaces  So if you go to Pluto TV, it's interesting. I kind of I thought maybe they were a little sketch because  By the way snakes love Pluto TV because they're broadcasting. I don't understand how they get away with you know  Broadcasting some of the things they broadcast on here  So they got meet the press on right now. Yeah, do they have a license for that?  They must or Viacom Viacom which owns who does which one does Viacom own?  They own CBS would certainly not most litigious of all yeah, they wouldn't buy something like  They wouldn't buy something like this if they weren't I would mute this but I can't cuz the snakes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sitting on my mute key. Wait, let me you can just push them aside snakes are very nice. Really? He's not gonna bite me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that a snake on your monitor or yeah? Yeah, so there's cheddar. There's Fox Sports  Impact wrestling this is all free you just go there and you just watch this for free cuz right it's ad supported  There's look at all this college sports. I've I've seen this. I mean I thought what were we on Pluto TV briefly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We were we were I know we were in negotiations to be on Pluto TV. I'm not sure if we ever actually got

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they wanted us to do stuff. We want us to they cut out our ads and stuff, right? Yeah, that was the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was too much work for us to know so CNET's on here Nerdist is on here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CBS  Their founder we did talk to them relation. Oh, okay interesting. So so what is his what is his strategy?  What is his ball his strategy is he just got 340 million dollars work?  Well, that was a good strategy. What would I what was I thinking?  Look at all the stuff on here. They've got music channel. She's this is crazy  And I guess it's all legit because it wouldn't exist if it weren't legit  Right like  They're just they put all these agreements together so the really what Viacom is buying is is these agreements

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I wow an audience how big is I mean does it? Oh, it's not a big it's a it's a micro streamer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's tiny. It's super tiny. It's a micro streamer. So  Yeah, it's not that's what's interesting about this  Let me see if it says here  Tom Ryan who I guess was a guy we had on triangulation  Was gonna it will continue to serve as a CEO. It'll be independent  upon closing of transaction  Should close in the first quarter subject to regulatory  Approval, but frankly as axio says it's unlikely a deal this size would get much scrutiny  It's just fascinating to me 340 million sounds like a lot to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's cuz you're a small fry I guess I am if you're thinking big, you know, you got to think unicorn

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But also this is an interesting strategy on Viacom's part. I think that's it goes along with acquiring  Vidcon for instance, so Pluto TV had 12 million monthly active users. Oh, it's nothing we have seven. That is nothing we have seven

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you want to be bought by Viacom is that what fraction of 12 million is seven

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like six percent. I'll take  60% I'll take 60% of 340 million. I'll take it. Yeah tomorrow  I have a wonderful audience. They tweet beautifully  that you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually Leo they wanted you until you killed all your social media and then probably that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was probably suicide to kill those accounts, but yeah was  Seven point five million of Pluto's viewers are on connected TVs. So Viacom likes that  They also young  Pro yeah, they're probably young right there cheap. That's what I would worry about. I mean right  Eating they also buy come also bought noggin and  comedy central now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was it that's a channel right noggin yeah noggin is like a Nickelodeon sponsor I thought it was a Nickelodeon can they also bought

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Awesome for toddlers. They bought awesomeness TV, which is I think a digital media  No, I'm sorry, it's where all your favorite creators come together and daily shows made for you. Oh  Well, that sounds like it's just for us. It's it's not even it doesn't stand alone. It's on YouTube. It's a YouTube publisher  Wow, I  Don't know how much they paid for it  But so Viacom's up to something probably trying to stay relevant in the 21st century. I think so my thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well Viacom hold on Viacom does not have CBS. They're both some redstone. Yeah, I think oh is he still

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I was okay. So this is a true story. I was once at a baby shower  Yes, and I  This was when the iPhone had just come out. So it was like  2007 and this poor girl sitting next to me at a baby shower  So she was normal and she had likes like I think it's so cool how you know the iPhone works  But I don't understand why I can't hit it with my nails and have it work and I was like  Do you do you really want to know?  Yeah, I do I was like two hours later  Do you really want to know so that I'm sitting there for like only like a few minutes explaining capacitive touch  But she did not talk to me for the rest of the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I've learned you got to jazz it up. So what I always do is say go get me a mozzarella stick  and a pretzel  And you can demonstrate it with a mozzarella stick and a pretzel

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. It was a baby shower. Not a football game mozzarella  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm so rella what's that? I'm sorry. You can use it. You can use a mozzarella stick as a  As a stylus, but you can't use a conductor. Yeah, cuz it conducts right, but you can't use a prep your pretzel  It's too dry  Right, Snaky, right  Right, Snaky. So Amazon. Oh  Hi, Snaky Amazon always thinking ahead has  Created a vest to keep robots from pummeling humans. Oh  Interesting well, this is a rather link-baity, but I had to give a credit headline from a gadget  So the issue is of course, you know Amazon warehouse  Workers are working right alongside robots all the time automated systems and so forth  And so the what these what this vest so-called vest is is really a pair of suspenders  Who connected to a belt that signals to robots that a human is entering the space so the robot will stand down. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it using 60 gigahertz radios

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's a good question and gadgets says sensors that can communicate with robotic systems, but I bet you anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a radio sure so ti just introduced probably two months ago a 60 gigahertz  Sensing system that was in part designed to work with robotics by saying that's a big yeah  Because it's a little bit more accurate and that it's higher resolution data about how close a person is and that sort of thing  But maybe it's using something totally different like computer vision can do this too, but not as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you know how this why Amazon's doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they are gonna have workers work with their robots in the warehouse. No the bear repellent incident

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of Amazon's robots managed to  Puncture a  Bottle of bear repellent 24 workers were hospitalized

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's actually I think I read somewhere that that was like the second bear repellent issue that Amazon had had I'm not kidding  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You shouldn't laugh cuz what was one of the third it was the third  So really what they need to do is create sensors for bear repellent  It's it's a pepper spray for aggressive or charging bears  Well, what is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That if you're standing nearby the robot could still do it and you happen to be nearby does it just not know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think this doesn't really solve the bear repellent problem. No, oh  Maybe look at me only stock bear repellent when there are no people around snake changed the page to being homeless is better than working for Amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Snakes are capacitive. Look at that snake is capacitive. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Take that to your baby shower  Yeah, I'm talking to you talking about you snakey I  That's really interesting. Are you trying to make a political statement snake about homelessness in Amazon?  Wow, that's not the article I was talking about  so I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazon  Wanted to hiss at you when you change the page. I think they were worried. I think they were worried

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That the robot might think of a of a human as a can of bear repellent  so proactively  What are you up to snake proactively so we have proven the snakes are capacitive that doesn't make sense I would think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You would only load bear repellent when people aren't around or something like that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It punctured a nine ounce can of the stuff and it feels gotta be other harmful lots of other harmful things at the warehouse

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But are they stuck under high pressure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But wouldn't you want to design a robot that wouldn't that wouldn't in fact puncture anything I  Mean, honestly, that seems like a failing in the robot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe it did. Yes, but you could drop the the can and run over it. You know, that's what's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  initially, they said it dropped the can a  preliminary investigation  Determined the bear repellent fell off a shelf  But a spokesperson for the town clarified that an automated machine punctured the nine ounce can releasing its toxic fumes  Take that human  Maybe this is how it happens. This is how it begins

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With bear repellent. This is the way the world ends. This is not with a bang but with bear with a bear with a whiff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook is building a meme hub called LOL to attract teens. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're beautiful slithers. Not the right word. No, it's not. I  Don't know what the right one you late. I'm too late  very undulating  So did you see the we were talking about this unknown on?  Windows weekly earlier Microsoft was kind of a leak  It wasn't an announcement Microsoft, but they said that they are going to have a fake news checker built into their browser

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft edge that's neat. I think we're gonna talk about Cortana

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's a really so that's why I bring it up because I know Jeff, you know how hard it is  but  Microsoft's mobile version of edge is going to start issuing fake news warnings. Oh, it's based on news guard

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is news guard not good? No, no, I don't want to be any judgments news guard is a  Little simplistic because it has a one-size-fits-all for everybody red yellow or green rating of a news site  It's hard to do right. I mean bingo and and  Yeah, so it's not gonna it's not gonna get you done individual claims it's going to be you know  Sites that you think are not believable will get a different rating from what they do because it's one size fits all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This also seems a little judgy. I'm looking at the exact  I know it has to be judgy  But look, so they're talking about what daily wire calm this website generally maintains basic standards of accuracy and accountability  It does not repeat repeatedly publish false content gathers and presents information  Responsibly, but it does I don't know why they get an X for this  Oh, I guess because it does not regularly correct or clarify errors. It doesn't handle the difference between news and opinion responsibly and  It does not disclose its ownership and financing  It's a little judgy, you know, so that's the whole point of it. Yeah. Yeah, I guess you have to be judgy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right if you're judging, but yeah, and I just it's done by Stephen Brill and Gordon Krovitz. Stephen Brill started court TV  He  The two of them started the paywall infrastructure for media and they never liked me for not loving paywalls  And so now they've started this effort and they're hiring  Human journalists to sit down and judge sites against their criteria all of which I think that I think is a good idea  It's more data. It's and  full disclosure I  Raised money from Facebook. I'm independent of Facebook. I received no money personally from Facebook or any platform  But one of the projects I'm working on is to aggregate the signals of quality and news. So I'm in this space  So this is an effort to bring this to the consumer  The question is how much it will resonate  At an individual level individual site level, you know, do you agree with their view of Fox News?  Do you agree with their view of Daily Caller? Do you agree with their view of RT?  It'll proof-and-putting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you are using edge on  Mobile  There is a news rating  Feature in the settings you can turn it on. I don't know if it's on by default  It describes news guard is you know, and what it does  I think this is kind of does Facebook use news card. What is Facebook? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook has all kinds of signals some of which my project will provide to all of the platforms  And advertisers and dead networks for free  But they've got a ton of signals on their own plus they got fact-checking they've they've worked with fact-checking networks  to give them signals about  individual pieces of content, but then that ranks up to the domain level  So according to the Guardian

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  News guard is saying that mail online which I guess is the Daily Mail is unreliable and that's probably true  Unreliable and that's probably true

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So my daughter came to me the other day and said I saw this in the mail and then I was like  So I had to sit down and explain  Journalistic standards and then the other day she was like, did you see in the post and I was like which which post?  She's like the New York Post and I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but that's a good education. You're giving it is a good and it is nuanced because they're both mainstream outlets  Yes, it's not not the National Enquirer  But there may be a little sensationalistic. Is that what you told her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What did you I talked about how different organizations are like people and you know, you how you have some friends who are like  Yeah gossipy. Yeah. Yes. I was like so your friends and I mentioned some friends  So I don't want to do that here on the air  But and then you have others and so when one friend comes with this kind of information, how do you treat it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She explains how she treats it. Oh, this is such a good mom. That is a great teaching

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Opportunity what that's really cool and then I put her in a room and I didn't feed her any dinner

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think that's really good  I think what you did there is a model for everybody listening who has younger children because they're faced with this they're growing up  I mean we didn't have to face this where they're growing up in a world where these I mean I remember the nuance  between Newsweek and time  Right, but I don't remember that's very nuanced much more than this  But but I do remember that I don't remember how I learned that probably my dad or my mom said  You have some friends that  Like to write first-person articles as if they were there and then other friends who do third-person reporting  Who do you listen to?  So the daily wire was given an all-clear while Breitbart was not so that that's a problem maybe in  I don't know  I you know, I don't I think this is better than nothing  It's interesting that I was getting in this business

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're all desperate for something. Yeah. Yeah. I mean why else are you gonna use edge browser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean the other thing edge has good at blocking and there's some edge on mobile is actually pretty good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you you raise the exact problem Microsoft has although news card I looked they offer a Chrome extension  Firefox extension and  Other extensions Safari I was like and edge

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very interesting Google has I don't know. This is probably no this wouldn't be a change law Google has bought  the technology for fossil smartwatches for 40 million dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was in my newsletter last week. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So do you think it's an indicator that Google might be doing a pixel watch or be planning a pixel watch? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would just like something they have to do something to compete with the Apple watch right if they  Yes, they do because the Apple watch has become so compelling in Google and Apple has brought in so many  health and medical things that are I  Mean again really compelling and they're bringing doctors and medical records companies on board  So if you think about a divide  You know between people who have access to this data and people who don't  people are going to  Want this and Google has to have something to answer with and Android where right now is the yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not very good. I haven't used fossils version of it, but apparently it's there's something there that Google wants

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so fossil actually was really good at doing smartwatches that didn't feel like smartwatches and  Designing things that  That were compelling to use for people who didn't want a computer on their wrist so fossil is not Android where

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't I don't think so. It's like pebble or Fitbit. It's its own thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who did they was faucet they may have done an Android wear watch actually feel like they did I believe they did yes  I believe they did I mean I think they had other they didn't just do that, but I believe they know they have an Android  Okay, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they did have something though that was two hundred fifty five dollars of Bloomingdale's that was kind of price range

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's thing. Yeah, they were less expensive, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're pretty I mean if you look at them on the website, they're nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe this the designers that says Google's buying fossil smartware tech  But maybe it's they're buying the IP is what they're buying IP. So maybe it is the design and some people I thought no  Yeah, although fossil was quick to point out we're not stopping and we still have 200 people working on R&D  So they didn't they didn't get them all  And then yeah, it sounds like fossils gonna keep doing smartwatches. Hey, I wanted to give a  Tip a hat tip to Google  they have announced that they are going to give an additional 3.1 million dollars to wiki media the  parent cooperation of  Wikipedia as you might imagine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now my ten dollar donation doesn't look like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, if everybody gave ten dollars to be worth more than Google's seven and a half million, that's what they've given over the last  Ten years they announced this at the World Economic Forum in Davos to it. We don't have a reporter there  Third of the funds will go to sustaining current efforts at the Wikimedia Foundation  It's a nonprofit by the way, the remaining two million will focus on long-term viability through the organization's endowment  That's good. You know what given how much value Google gets out of Wikipedia. Oh, yeah, I'm glad to see the

Transcript:  Google will also be allowing Wikipedia editors to use several of its machine learning tools for free and  They're going to broaden something they call projects tiger, which is a joint initiative. They lost launched a couple of years ago to  Get more Wikipedia articles written in underrepresented languages in India  And to include oh, yeah  there are a lot of different languages in India and  To include ten new languages in a handful of countries and regions  It will be called now instead of project tiger  glow the gorgeous ladies of wrestling no growing  growing local language content on Wikipedia, so it's really more like  cool call cool cow  I  Think that's great. I mean does  Siri yeah, siri uses Wikipedia to I hope Apple's doing this  Apple Facebook and Amazon as well as Google also use Wikipedia content in their own products so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was there was a Twitter discussion about a year ago Jimmy Wales  founder of Wikipedia  And people were some people were saying well Google exploits Wikipedia use Wikipedia  I was thinking well though it links to them like crazy and and and  Jimmy said they do get people who come from Google and that's good  Oh, there's there's benefit  I think I would like to see so Google is working with publishers as is Facebook on  On paywalls, but I've been pushing both companies to say also work with companies that need contribution  Like the Guardian and like Wikipedia, and I think on every Wikipedia box if you imagine there was a box there to contribute  That would be a huge give back to them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait contribute like I mean because I have never contributed to we could be oh money nevermind  I don't need my  editorial expertise  Yeah, but they do I donate to Wikipedia whenever they do their annual job, but why do you not edit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wikipedia did you just never got around to that or I wonder if one of us should really intimidating it is a little intimidating  And there's a culture there. It's the same reason I lurk on reddit, but I never post there because I'm afraid  Yeah, the way you feel about Twitter is probably how I feel about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I but I only read reddit even but I lurk there. I read a lot of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I just I don't I'm afraid to say anything  They're so they're way too hip for me. Did you know that Google has a big presence in Yum Yum, Tennessee and  Hollywood, Alabama  Yep  In fact the new data center Google is building in Yum Yum  Tennessee is gonna have solar lots of it  Where they hope to have it be match match notice with a hundred percent renewable energy from day one  They struck a multi-year deal with the Tennessee Valley Authority to purchase output from several new solar farms  413 megawatts of power for 1.6 million solar  panels  May I give you a related story? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  May I give you a related story? Yes, so on the rundown I think under it's Bill Gross's energy vault

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I know you're a friend of Bill's yeah, Fred of Bill Gross Bill Gross idea lab

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We started more than 150 companies. His latest is amazing  And he has a great presentation. He just gave at the DLD conference in Munich  Where Bill explains?  How we've gotten?  Renewable energy  Cheaper than a remade coal plant right so we're there  but what we're not of course is storage because the wind and the Sun doesn't come when you need it and  He said everywhere on earth where you can pump water up and have it get hydro coming down is pretty much already done and  The storage plus the generation is still more than dirty energy  So what you need to get the storage down to is three cents per megawatt whatever  And he's at three and a half cents with this new company. He started and spun off which is nothing but  cement blocks  And it and the cement raises the cement block up when it has energy and what it needs to bring the energy back out  It just reduces the that's a bad lock back down. It's a battery. Yeah, and and he's got  cement that can be made out of  Recycled cement so it reduces waste and and it's it costs  I think what he say seven million dollars to build one of these things and it's it's amazing  This is just Bill's genius at at startups and at engineering and it's really exciting because you get to the point  You're part of the problem now with coal is  It's not worth it  Yes, we can produce  renewable energy for cheaper than coal  But we have a huge investment in the infrastructure around coal and the storage costs are higher  If you go both below both those lines, then you start taking away all the motivation to use coal and even gas  For renewable energy and this and imagine to these these batteries out in the middle of nowhere not in the middle of a desert  Wait, I have a physics question. Yes, ma'am

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm using the renewable to raise the cement block and then the storage is it's up high and as we drop it the kinetic  Energy is released. So it's some sort of physio  Sorry, I just I'm like what is that? I didn't explain it. Well, yes, you're absolutely right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's a lot of ways to do this. You can raise water level and let it go down

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's all sorts of ways to do this. It's really clever. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, keep going. I was just related to so so when you when you have  Google's and Facebook's and data centers  Using renewable energy they still have this problem storage, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The last mile and all of that. I mean energies here. They're there. There's all sorts of issues  Yeah, that's why Elon's building the power walls, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you have batteries batteries are still so I?  Get the video. They're not good. Yeah, the battery cost is still much higher and you've got chemicals that are on this the image  Got children barefoot children mining lithium and right. Yeah, but plain old cement blocks on a crane, you know, that clever

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Legos  There's so many stories here. This I don't know where to go next  Well, we can confirm by the way, or at least the Chinese government is confirmed  We were talking about dr. Huh who gene edited uses CRISPR  He claimed to gene edit two babies Chinese government has confirmed that a hood young quay did in fact  Did in fact gene edit those babies illegally he forged a bunch of documents  He did a lot of things to get it through but there are at least two babies

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That have CRISPR edited genes. I couldn't find it. That's what was there. Was there anything about what he did to the genes? Yeah  So he changed it. That's right. He gave them resistance to HIV

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Smallpox and what was the other one?  I can't remember third disease by removing a gene I believe  The problem with CRISPR and gene editing is  We just don't know enough about what we're doing and it's very likely or very possible that there's beside effects that you just don't know  You're you know, you're modifying  CRISPR is kind of like cut and paste for genes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, does it talk about what happens to the kids? Does the government know who they are? Yeah, I assume they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't think they've identified them and so the hope was I hope they never do I mean that's exactly what they said  The the twins were nicknamed Lulu and Nana  Another woman still carrying a gene edited penis  He forged ethical review papers recruited eight couples to participate resulting in two pregnancies  The Guangdong government will keep the twins under medical observation  but  They are not going to say who they are the kids  That would be an amazing  Thriller is the u.s

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Government sends agents in to steal those babies so we can monitor their progress and gain all the scientific knowledge for ourselves  That would be an awesome awesome awesome book. I'm done  Someone take that idea and go with it in an interview with Beijing youth daily

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In an interview with Beijing youth daily  xiao feng who is from the chinese academy of sciences deputy director of the national institute of  Biological sciences said the whole incident would need to be investigated thoroughly  If I were to handle the matter  I would never tell the twins they've been gene edited and allow them to live their lives like normal people  I think that's for the best  He but he did say he's worried about the potential health risks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you've got to test if it works, right?  Like are you going to expose them to hiv or just hope it happens and see if it works? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, we need a double blind anybody you want to do it i'm just I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think someone should do this. But at the same time. Yeah. Well, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so anathema to the the scientific community all over the world even in china  And that was one of the thoughts was with maybe the chinese government is kind of losing its control  Is with maybe the chinese government is kind of looking sideways when this guy's doing it because they really are curious  But it sounds like they actually condemned the guy they he's disappeared by the way. They're trying to find them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He hasn't seen it. Wait, did they condemn him because the rest of the world was like, yeah, well, that's a good question. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um an expert in the field xiao is worried about potential health risks  The children will face as well as get this the incidence effect on the human race  Once the gate of gene editing is wide open the human race will be finished  He said the technology is strong, but the terrifying fact is anyone slightly trained in a lab  can perform it  some well and there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's tons of science fiction books out there talking about like, oh, yeah, you know go fast forward  200 years and you've got people who retain and want to be like the human race  And then all the people are like screw this I could be better and you know adapt

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, of course the issue of the have and have nots this is going to be very expensive will only wealthy people will only  1 percenters be able to have smarter babies and if that's the case will they gradually become a different species?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but I mean I think it'll only be super expensive given the rate of technological change and things like illumina in it  So you could probably go five years. So if you just had a baby that sucks, right? But  Yeah, I don't I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've all know harari writes about this in his 21 lessons for the 21st century makes a really interesting point up until now  People could claim they were better. They were noble. They were rich whatever they could claim they were better  But they were exactly the same  All humans were the same  This is the first time ever potentially that somebody with more resources with more money than other people could make them and their children  Something different  And could legitimately say  Now we are yeah genetically all the same but they could legitimately then say yeah, these kids are faster smarter more attractive  for reals  You know not just because of the accident of birth  Uh, that's an interesting that is an interesting new world  That we are I don't know if it would be all that new

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean if you think about things like access to resources and privilege  You were definitely born up you and jeff both were born with a leg up for example. Yeah, then so  For me and look what it from a raw material  I feel like a lot of people would like to be where you are  I don't think it's you're not you're not resting on your 240 odd million from viacom, but you know  You're not doing too tab terribly 340. I'll take the 240 though. I'm just no that's that's what i'm saying  Oh, you're saying that's what I would get that was your 60 percent. All right. Thank you for doing the math

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I know what to ask for when viacom comes there you go. Sumner redstone walks in the door

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sumner it's closer to two  210 sorry  sorry, I just  30 30 million off the top right there god already i'm losing money

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, let's see. Oh and here's a story  from the daily mail

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh to be trusted

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so. I don't think you should do this leo china launches an app that tells you if you're within 500 feet of someone  in debt  And encourages you to report them if they seem like they're doing okay, like maybe they just got some gene editing done  Officials in the chinese province of hebei created the app it appears to show the locations of people who are considered to be in debt  Here's your debt radar

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is like everything just too I mean this is the chinese are like  How can we make everyone's dystopian nightmares come true? But is it really I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is a nordic society people shouldn't be allowed to you know, run around  You know driving mercedes-benz if they owe somebody 50 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They should pay up and and and I think I've changed the law since but it was very recently in scandinavia. You can look up anybody's income  Online and your traffic fines were percentage of that. Wow  what

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, well i'm not moving to scandinavia  Now that's the daily mail. So again, although they are reporting something that appeared in the china daily  Right next to it a story i'm not going to link on jeff bezos mistress lauren sanchez don sheer top is she and the newly buffed billionaire  Helicopter to malibu to enjoy spa treatments and then retire to her love nest  So that's what you were talking about with the daily mail

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So raima isla a finished businessman was fined 54 000 euros  For traveling a modest if illegal 64 miles per hour in a 50 mile zone. No, that's not right  Because it's a percentage of his income

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not d, I don't want to live there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although it's a happy place now google maps it does make the sense though

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you think about it a lot of people speed if you're wealthy you can speed and you're like I can afford the ticket in the situation  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  However, if you get in the head-on collision, it'll still kill you however rich right but this this at least makes the penalties

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Equal to everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is a case to be made for that you socialist

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just i'm throwing out the like this is anathema in our society

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I can see how it makes sense for scandinavians. He should have had the new google maps which displays speed limits  And it's ios and android he would have known and didn't we say earlier that in some of these jurisdictions?  Google is testing  locations of speed cameras as well

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought that was is this just the speed limit size. This is just the speed limits  I don't really want ways knowing that i'm going over the speed limit in a particular area. Oh it knows they could actually  The police officers, oh it knows what's happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You wonder is that's that's a privacy issue is ways storing that data. Oh boy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh boy, hey tom wheelers back former  Uh  Dingo from the fcc. Where did she fall under her desk?  Nope, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to fix something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where the snake goes snake oh my god, where the snake careful of your monitor careful of your monitor don't move it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a little tail right here. Oh shit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder I bet it's really warm back there. Is it warm? Does it? Yeah, it's it's probably oh you can see it look  You can see it right there. Oh it is it's on your little face. It's on my computer. It's resting. It's resting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little snaky chin  I wonder if it'll emerge on the other side at some point  Is the head coming out oh how funny  If 5g is so important writes tom wheeler  former dingo and uh chairman of the fcc  why  We like him now though. It sure we do sure. Uh, what's his name?  We didn't know how good we had it. We didn't know how good we had it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not only that but we all thought he was gonna be a dingo, but he actually turned out to be  A nice dingo a puppy. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is what led leo to think that uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Might be okay. I was hoping no, I had hopes. I want to you know  I'm the kind of guy who gives everybody  A fair shake and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when I was covering the fcc it was well known that pie leaked all kinds of anti-net neutrality stories to certain publications that covered it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Oh, you didn't tell us that oh you didn't tell us that  That's not good. Now, you know  So wheeler, uh says if 5g is so important, why isn't it secure?  And of course, he's he's talking about uh, wa way among other things  um, but he  He says here's the thing the trump administration  Has made I didn't know this but you knew it i'm sure stacy 5g  Kind of a cornerstone  Of the future for the united states, which is i'm all about it. It's basically our space race  Uh, he says the 5g race is more complex and dangerous than industry and the administration portray  When 5g enables autonomous vehicles do we want those cars and trucks crashing into each other because the russians hacked the network  If 5g is going to be the backbone of breakthroughs like remote surgery should that network be vulnerable to the north koreans breaking into a surgical  procedure investors innovators and users  confidence in the network cyber security if its much heralded promise  Is to be realized he apparently does not think that we are doing enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So remember back when the trump administration said that we should  There was probably a year ago  There was a report that went around that people in the administration had made a pitch to say the u.s  Should develop 5g all on its own  And I think the pentagon should be in charge or something ridiculous and we all laughed and ha ha ha  There's a couple things about that one  5g is not going to be used for robotic surgery  You know the use cases for god using a landline  Please

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wired, um, but it will be absolutely used for intercar communication. It it will and there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And i'm trying okay, here's here's his point i'll tell you what he's saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you. He's he's saying in november the president's national security telecommunications advisory committee told him the cyber security threat now poses  An existential threat to the future of the nation  He's been warned again and again, but then and and by the way  Tom wheeler won't say won't  He who shall not be named adjit pi the chairman of the trump fcc quickly echoed the industry line that the market  Not government is best positioned to drive innovation and leadership  Worse than ignoring these warnings the administration has repealed existing protections  Shortly after taking office the trump fcc removed a requirement  Removed a requirement imposed by the obama fcc in other words me  Tom wheeler that the 5g technical standard must be designed from the outset to withstand cyber attacks  This was the first time wheeler says cyber security was required as a forethought in the design of a new network standard  In fact, I I vividly remember interviewing vince serf and said if you could redo the internet  He was of course one of the fathers of the internet. What would you do differently? He said encryption  Security basically right i'd build an encryption  The trump fcc also cancelled a formal inquiry seeking input from the country's best technical minds about 5g security  Retracted an obama era white paper about reducing cyber threats and questioned whether the agency had any responsibility  For the cyber security of the networks they're entrusted with overseeing so I thought this was a  Really good opinion piece in the new york times by tom wheeler and worth just bringing up  It's important, you know, it's funny because we're in a trade war with china so all of a sudden huawei is the evil empire  And that's more I think about trade than security, but this stuff that really does matter  Eh, the market will take care of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I just put up surgery without a landline

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great so so the way you would see it in the chat on the side

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll see. No, I i've seen studies about latency and 5g does have great latency profiles

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Better you think than than like ethernet?  Here is dr. Leonid the rogoza. Oh, this is the anarktic  sir, he's actually  Performing surgery on himself, which is a little weird the surgeon who removed his own appendix the point being  Maybe maybe in the someday  Antarctic doctors won't have to remove their own appendixes  appendices

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't there a house episode about that? Probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That feels very here's a question  I know if it's an appendix to a book that it's plural appendices, but if you had two  Human anatomy appendixes would that be an appendices or appendixes? It would just be a problem  So there's a crebs on security writes about a weakness at go daddy that is being abused  It's actually a terrible weakness at go daddy  Being abused by spammers. Do you ever get the sextortion spam? I did where they say hey in the subject matter  Your e your password is  And it was a password I had used long ago and then the  sextortion email goes on to say  I logged in, you know  I logged into your system got into your system put some recording software on there and watched as you went to a porn site  And i'm gonna send a video of you in the video you were watching to all your friends if you don't give me bitcoin  Maybe you didn't get that one stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't it wouldn't okay  I am not I can't believe i'm admitting this i've never been to a porn site

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's actually not the right answer to that particular spam

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I I wouldn't worry i'd be like ha they must be fishing me  but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel really embarrassed to to admit that no no i'm not surprised at all because you respect women

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, there's porn for women

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's always got women in it doesn't it?  No, I don't I don't know. I just know that i've never been to a porn site. I wouldn't know myself. Yeah  according to uh  uh crebs on security  There there was I hope it's been fixed a flaw  In the way, uh dns was handled at go daddy that may it meant that anybody  Who was on the same dns server as a major site a well-known site could commandeer that  And use it to send spam see problem was you know, it's hard to send spam because most sites like google's gmail will block  Email that comes from an address that is not a known good address. You know, I mean it's gotten that bad  So they would use trusted domain names  On go daddy to send out this spam  It's not exactly hijacking the domain. It's just using the domains dns server to send out the spam  So nasty, uh, I hope go daddy's fixed it  It's all I can say  Here's all right you you I don't give enough props to the trump administration. So i'm going to do it right now  The open government data act has been signed into law by the presidency  it uh  it  Is requires federal agencies to default when possible  To making data and metadata public to publish that public data in a machine readable format and catalog it online  It mandates the chief data officers  Be appointed at those agencies to handle the process. It was bipartisan  It flew according to tech crunch through the house and senate mostly uncompromised  The treasury is yes. In fact one of the agencies that will have to do this  These agencies are also now officially required to find and present any evidence for any this is actually  The real reason this flew through and this is the reason the president signed it because he really wanted this one  Agencies have been in the past making regulations. This is something that really bothered republicans  And now they won't be able to just kind of make their own regulations  They'll have to find and present evidence for any new policies or changes. I can't say that's such a bad thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Personally so there you go. Um, well they'll use that to I understand they'll use that to turn turn back  No, not just turn back but when and so forth. Yeah  Yeah, they'll just make it impossible to actually enact regulations because they'll design the studies that drive the data that's used they see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, no we it's you know  It's like marco rubio  Uh saying that the state shouldn't be allowed to do privacy laws because we'll do it  It sounds like on the surface of it. Yeah, great if you do it  But but the fact of the matter is marco is well known  There's no way we're gonna do a privacy law in congress  Um  You don't think so, I think we'll get one I think there'll be start to be pressure  Yeah, but I think the well here's the other story that is why I don't think so  google  Remember, I just said google has given what was it seven million dollars to wikimedia over the last 10 years  Uh, would you care to hazard a guess as to how much google spends on lobbying congress?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little bit more than they used to a little bit more a little bit 21.2 million dollars last year

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The most they've ever spent  And facebook and apple and everybody else  So that's one reason I wouldn't  Count on a privacy law in the united states  The reason we'll get one is the same reason marco rubio is sponsoring that bill because they don't want california to make a stringent law as we have already  What they so the the rubio bill says no any existing state laws are void non-void. It should be a federal law  That makes sense, right? We one law not 50  but uh  It's pretty clear than any federal law will end up. Well, I forgot this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I forgot I got a little bit of news here. Oh good. What's your news french? Well, not huge  It's actually a little bit stale and old  Oh, well, thank you for doing it. Yeah, I know I appreciate that you appreciate that  um  so uh, um  What's his name? Oh, vick gondotra  Oh, no, it's not that no no no no sam nunas sam nunas sam nunas put in a I think it was he who put in a um  A deep malicious deep fake prohibition act  ooh  Uh, I think it was nunas. Let me see who put it in  uh  and  So it you know prohibits you anybody from making  deep fakes  Well ben sass ben sass ben sass ben sass sam nunas is gone, right ben sass so we did it. Well, okay  But the problem here is um who determines what's fake?  What's satire? What's art? What's anything else? Don't you mean what's malicious?  Yeah, well even then how do you determine that?  So you're allowed to make a malicious deep fake trump. You're gonna call it malicious, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a that would be a violation of the first amendment. So that's one thing the courts will have to decide  Well, amen. Is this is this a is this an act of congress?  To prevent free speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's exactly what the first amendment so it's jumping on the sorry. I haven't said it yet today, but moral  Panic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every time he says moral panic, I would say gutenberg I say more panic you say gutenberg

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So any audio visual record created or altered in a manner that the record would falsely appear to be a reasonable observer to  Be the authentic record or the actual speech or conduct of an individual

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting satire  Falsely I think that's key key falsely appear to a reasonable observer to be authentic record  so in other words  Alec baldwin's impression of the president on saturday at live as much as the president hates it on that failing network  Fakes me out  You you believe it? I believe it  Okay, the steve bannon I thought it was maybe steve bannon for a while  But yeah, yeah, no  So I think that you could say a reasonable observer would know that that's satire  I think you know, I mean this clearly is going to be an issue right is it's possible to make videos now  Uh that look as real as can be of somebody saying and doing something he never did or she never so this this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This researcher called me about this and so he told me about the bill. I didn't know he's in french. It's french  He knows more than I do it hurts  um  and uh  But I looked up and photoshop came out in 1990. Yeah  We figured we never had a law. No, we still get faked out. Yeah people can do malicious things  But we pretty much you know, they can make their fingers longer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can make their tummy slimmer. I didn't say it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You said it. I didn't say it. You can't send those tweets to leo though because he's not on twitter the chicken

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would say we're still having a problem with photoshop though. I mean we're having a research

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Conversation, but do we need a law to tell you you can't do things?  If you use it if you use it to fraudulently do something that is wrong if you use it to  To sell somebody a florida condo that doesn't really look like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then there's a lot of things you're protected by laws against that. Yes, exactly. Yeah, so this is a kind of digital fraud

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is oh, I know. I this is this is a violation of the first amendment. I have to say though
