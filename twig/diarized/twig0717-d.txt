Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google Wow.  Wow, what a great show we have for you.  And it's not here, so we've got Mike Elgin dialing in from Italy,  Jeff Jarvis all the way from New Jersey,  and our special guest sitting in for Stacey Higginbotham,  Chris Messina, the inventor of the hashtag  and discoverer of so many amazing technologies.  We will talk about AI, of course, the Build conference  and what Microsoft announced, but AI in general,  including Bard and a whole lot more.  And while we're doing the show, we're going to listen in  on Ron DeSantis' Twitter space where he announces his candidacy.  The result may surprise you.  It's all coming up next on Twig.

And we have a couple of substitutions to announce at the beginning  because we have brought in the understudies.  Mike Elgin is here filling in for Ant Pruitt, taking a couple of much-needed days off.  Hello, Mike.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Hello, Leo.  Thank you for having me.  This is really exciting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  From Italy today.  It's always where in the world.  Victoria Veneto, Italy.  Mike and Amira in the Veneto.  Are you getting ready for your Prosecco gastronome?

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Yeah, that starts Tuesday.  The Venice Prosecco experience starts Tuesday.  And that's going to be in this general area, the Prosecco Hills and Venice, stuff like that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was telling you my whole life when people asked, I said, oh, yeah, I'm from Genovese  because I thought my grandmother was from Genoa.  So, you know, my Italian roots.  I'm in Genovese.  And then my sister the other day, I said we were in Genoa.  And I remember that's where the family villa was.  She said, you're not Genovese.  She said, my grandmother's stepfather was Genovese, Jacoby.  But she said grandma was born, actually not even, no, no, we called her,  was born in Skiyo in the Veneto, very near where you are.  Yes.  I'm all this time, I'm Venetian.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  And I didn't know.  That's right. You're Venetian.  You're a child of the Venetian Empire, which is not bad.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Your grandmother has curtains just like those behind Mike.  I love those.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  That might be your grandma's curtains.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It could be my grandma's curtains.  It could be.  That's Jeff Jarvis, the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig...  Go ahead. Go ahead.  Go ahead, singers. Jump your queue.  Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Hi, Jeff.  Hi, the real one arrived.  Yeah, Lisa said, oh, his book is here.  It's the hardcover. That's not the galleys.  That's the real deal.  No, that's the real thing.  Gutenbergparenthesis.com.  No? Is that right?  Yes, I think so.  You still pre-ordering though, because it's not officially out till June.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Pre-ordered out till June 29 in the US.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The ink is still wet on that one.  Stacy Higginbotham also has a day off, so I thought this would be a great opportunity to get an internet legend and man about town on the show.  Chris Messina is here. Hi, Chris.  Hey, good to see you.  We've known Chris forever.  Chris, one of his many claims to fame.  He's a big... You were a big Twitter user.  You actually left Twitter in the flame of blaze of glory a couple of... about a month ago.  That's right.  But for that best known because you introduced the hashtag, which has really gotten a life of its own, but it was...  You started using it or you suggested using it, I guess, on Twitter as kind of a canned search.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, back in 2007, you know, Twitter was a simpler place.  But yeah, we needed a place to share about what was going on and most importantly, a way to filter things out that weren't relevant.  And so the hashtag actually was meant to have both purposes.  One was for adding labels, essentially metadata to posts so people could follow and track those topics.  And then also my proposal, which was just a blog post.  The idea was that you could mute things that you were not interested in.  Because the problem actually that we were solving for that I was trying to solve for was in March of that year,  a bunch of us had gone down to South by Southwest and those who were not at South by Southwest were really annoyed by all the tweets that were coming out about South by Southwest with our drunken antics and the rest.  And so it was a way to basically sleut up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was so annoying.  I do remember that.  And the hashtag was if we kind of encouraged if you're going to tweet about South by just hashtag S-X-S-S-W.  So then we could ignore it.  We could ignore it.  This was there was no functionality built into this.  It's a Twitter to do this, of course.  But Twitter at the time had something called track.  So you could track a hashtag.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  That's right.  So in fact, that was that was one of the core drivers of the format.  You know, because back then, you know, if you wanted to see what was going on with different topics then and when you followed someone, that also meant that everything that they tweeted would get sent to your phone as a text message.  You know, this is before there was push notifications before the iPhone, really.  And so with hashtags, you could string together a series of words and then track that series of words because it was, you know, to Twitter, it just looked like a big blob of characters.  And so that was actually one of the first use cases in October of that year.  My friend, Nate Ritter, was down in San Diego and was tweeting about the wildfires that were going on.  And, you know, I was using San space, Diego space fire colon as a prefix to all of his tweets.  But you couldn't track that.  You know, you couldn't get updates on that specific topic.  And I was like, hey, Nate, this would be a great use case for using hashtags.  And so he used hashtag San Diego fire and people could subscribe to that.  And then they saw him doing it.  And then they started to do it, even though I didn't know why he was doing it.  And that's basically one of the first kind of examples of citizen journalism using using hashtags.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yay. Here a huge argument for preserving old tweets, because this is the tweet in August of 2007.  How do you feel about using pound for groups as in hashtag bar camp message?  Oh, those are the days.  What's interesting is that a lot of the functionality of Twitter was, in fact, you know, created like this by its users.  So, you know, we need an ad reply. We need a hashtag.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Who gets credit for the ad reply?

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Does anybody think that was R.S.G.?  If I recall correctly, I mean, even the retweet was a user convention.  I mean, it used to be, if you recall, like it was R.T. and then at username and then the content.  And it was just a copy paste job.  You know, I mean, it was so simple. Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, that was one of the secrets is just for somebody who wants to build the next Twitter.  One of the secrets of Twitter was it was kind of formless, which allowed its users to be urgent to it was have emergent properties.  And that was what made it so incredible.  Sad to say, if you follow the Christmas scene, tweets, his last one is goodbye.  Yeah. So you left.  In fact, you wrote an article about it. You find you finally, by the way, you must tweet from March of this year.  I hate hashtags. Of course you do, Elon. Of course you do.  Of course, it's all good things. Of course.  Hashtag goodbye says Christmasina.  That's so why. What was the last the final straw? I don't need to ask why.  What was the final straw?

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  You know, it's such a strange thing.  And I feel like I'm living in this like or I had been living in this weird world of gaslighting on Twitter, essentially,  where it was hard to know what was intentionally being done to degrade the service versus what was accidental versus what was just sort of circumstance.  And, you know, my my intention all along had been to give, you know, Elon his six months, you know, just to sort of see where he was going to take the platform.  You know, I am a Tesla owner, and so, you know, I have appreciation for his products and for the things he's done in this case.  You know, I've been the funny thing is I was on Twitter since 2006.  That means that the longest relationship in my life beyond my marriage should be on my current romantic partnership or anything like that was with Twitter.  OK, like which is, I know, very terrible and sad thing to say.  But even still, to have come up on the platform as the one thousand one hundred eighty six user and to see it grow as it did meant that I wanted to see, you know,  maybe there's some things that can be done here that only an Elon Musk character could pull off.  And, you know, after four or five months, especially with so much focus and emphasis on blue checks and verification and eroding a lot of the trust on the platform,  it just seemed to me that the time had come for me to really look at and consider this relationship.  And so what had happened was there was a person who is a sort of Twitter slash Elon Stan who retweeted this 14 year old app researcher Nima's tweet didn't provide what I considered to be adequate.  Credit essentially this person sort of takes other people's content, just like Elon does with memes and then sort of gets the credit and all the likes and all the adoration.  And I was just like, you know, to do this to a 14 year old kid, you know, who is so positive in the world, he lives in Iran, like of all places to take his work and then to share it as though it's your own and to sort of leave it ambiguous in terms of where it came from was sort of a strike too far for me.  So I called this behavior out, of course, on Twitter and I was like, what the hell?  This is ridiculous. This is stupid.  And then got into this back and forth with that person in DMs and, you know, I was like, whatever, like, I don't care.  I'm leaving my tweet up, you know, and within an hour or two, Nima actually sent me a message and he's like, where did your blue check go?  And I was like, what are you talking about?  Oh, my God.  I went to my account and it was gone.  I was like, you got to be kidding me.  This was like days before like blue check again, like when they were all going to go away for everybody.  And I was just, you know, assuming and accepting like I'm not going to pay for Twitter blue.  I'm going to lose my check.  It's fine.  But to then lose my check like days beforehand, it just like smacked of such.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was retribution.  It was.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  So I'm like, you know what?  Like I don't need to stay here.  I don't need to be providing my content and the things that I do out in the world.  Like, you know, we've had a relationship for a long time and now it's become abusive and I just need to leave.  And so that's, that's what happened.  That's why.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And how does it, how does it feel after you've set Shiva for a while?

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  You know, it's, it's hard.  Like Twitter is in our culture.  Like Twitter is, you know, a circulation system or circulatory system, I suppose, for the, you know, the tech world.  And so many conversations go on there that normally I would participate in.  So I'm still, I don't, I wouldn't say that I'm like going through like any kind of withdrawal or anything like that.  You know, I have other platforms that I have other places where I can share, but it does feel like leaving, you know,  the town or city where you've spent, again, I did literally spend years kind of growing up.  But I, you know, it's like, it's becoming something new and different and I don't need to stick around for that transition process.  Do you read it at all still?  I do.  I mean, again, I get lots of threads sent to me, you know, I'm, I'm deep in kind of like the AI world right now.  And so there's like the AI community really is there.  They haven't really found another place.  And so I find myself going through, but I have decided that I will just not post publicly.  I still use DMs, you know, a lot of people use that as a primary way to get in touch with me.  And so that's what you do in AI Chris.  You know, mostly right now learning, I would say I've done a few angel investments here and there.  But, you know, I think it's like, like I've been on product time for a long time, also since around 2014.  And last December, I happened to catch ChatGPT as it was being announced and I posted it to Product Hunt.  And you are the zealot of everything.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Zealot! He is!  Product Hunt, we should mention if you don't know about it, it's worth checking out, is a place where founders go to announce their new products.  And then people like Chris amplify that.  And it's a really great place to see what's hot because of people like you.  Totally.  You like to contribute your content to people, other people.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I like being useful. I like being helpful.  And so, you know, for a long time, you know, like so in my career, my career is very strange because I've done many things.  I'm sort of a generalist, a maximalist.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How did you, what did you start? You started as a designer, right?

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  That's right. I did.  Yeah.  So I came to Silicon Valley in 2004 and I worked on the launch of Firefox.  And that was my first kind of foray into the tech world was through open source.  You know, and as a designer in the open source world back in 2004, there was like two or three of us.  You know, and so I just kind of like got going there and, you know, worked on browsers, browser technology.  I mean, even the hashtag was sort of intended to be kind of an open format or standard that anybody could use to build social platforms and social software.  And so along the way, there was some predecessors to Product Hunt that would allow you to post the products that you used.  One of them was called I use this and then I use this eventually went away and Product Hunt came out and it was a way for me to help founders, makers, builders, you know, get the word out, you know.  And so because I had worked with engineers and open source people and they're not always the best at selling themselves or marketing themselves, I could help to translate the things that they were doing to a broader audience.  And so Product Hunt was one of the channels that I found was really useful to have interesting conversations about what people were building.  I should mention.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  It's astonishing to see the degree to which generative AI tools have taken over Product Hunt.  It's unbelievable. What would you say?  70% now.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  That is the number that I use 70 to 80% every day.  There's like some and I think this is one of the things that's for people who are not too close to it or just reading the headlines.  I think what they're missing is the degree to which developers and founders have to embrace this new platform and this shift and to the degree that they are.  You know, they are building things and they are sort of taking a crack at how to use this stuff.  And I think for me, as someone who's always worked in tech and thinks about communication and language and interfaces and product and design and platforms.  This new shift is, you know, as big as probably like, you know, the web and Web 2.0 was, if not bigger, simply because it changes the nature of how people interact with computers and what they expect computers should be able to do for them.  So we are just at the very early innings and the very start and watching it on Product Hunt unfold.  You know, since I launched Chat GPT in December and it became the number one product of the year.  I mean, I've just never seen a product like that I've launched have that kind of response.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. And Chat GPT is obviously very interesting.  It's obviously making a huge impact, but it's the tools built using APIs to services like Chat GPT is the real thing.  People say, oh, Chat GPT makes errors, it hallucinates all this kind of stuff.  That's not the point at all.  It's like the data set can be your data set.  It can be any data set.  You know, this is the thing that people don't understand.  It's not a search engine.  That's right. It's an approach to information.  As Jerome Lanier said, it's a way for humans to collaborate on a massive scale.  And so it's really the data set, the errors, all that stuff is really beside the point.  It's all these little tools of the kind you find on Product Hunt that is so fascinating and so surprising.  Every day it's like, wow, I didn't think of that, that you could do something like that.  You know, it's pretty amazing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's the proportion, both of your views, of real things versus bandwagon hopping?  It's hard to tell, I know, but I'm just curious.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  It is because you'd have to first define what it means to be a real thing.  And we are in the stage right now of experimentation.  Obviously, Chat GPT is a real thing.  I would say given what Microsoft talked about, you know, their build conference this week,  co-pilots is a new category, just like social media became a category.  And so you can launch all sorts of co-pilots that are differentiated based on the data set that they work on,  based on kind of user empathy and understanding what people's needs are and how sophisticated those users might be.  You know, for example, I use a number of text editing tools and they have all added some sort of AI generation.  But then even within those components, you could have a co-pilot or AI generation within like their code generation tools.  In other words, like if you can paste, let's say, you know, markdown over some code, let's say that you put into a document  because you're writing developer docs.  Well, within the code editor itself, you could have an AI tool that helps to debug or improve the clarity of your code.  So at all these different levels, you just imagine that there's, you know, a thousand tiny interns kind of running around in all these different text boxes.  And I mean, that's that's kind of like where we're at.  So to say like what's real and what's not, I think it's still a little bit early for that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  One of the things that was kind of interesting, we covered the build keynotes earlier this morning and yesterday morning.  And the most interesting part of the keynotes was actually at the very end of today's keynote when Stevie Batiste came on.  He's a technical fellow at Microsoft.  He used to do hardware, now does software.  And he, more than anybody at Microsoft, positioned AI's role in software going forward.  He said there's three stages we're going to see.  There's where is AI?  It's beside what you're doing.  It's inside what you're doing.  And then it's outside what you're doing.  Let me explain what each of those means.  Beside is kind of where we are now as AI as a helper, AI as a sidebar, you know, Bing chat, minimally disruptive.  Most of the stuff you do continues as it used to, but you can use AI as a little assistant.  He says the next stage, and I think this is going to be interesting and this is clearly what Microsoft wants to be,  maybe they're better positioned to do this than anybody else, especially in what they did not mention,  but inferred would be Windows 12 where AI is everywhere.  It's the main scaffolding.  He showed the very famous, or somebody showed the very, maybe it was Rajesh Jha, very famous,  Doug Engelbart, mother of all demos with the mouse and the first mouse and the pointer.  And he said we are now moving to the next stage where it's not mouse and pointer and the input loop isn't waiting for a keystroke or a mouse stroke.  It's AI, which means that the UI is going to change, but AI is going to be everywhere.  And then the final stage.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on there for one second.  I still draw that picture a little more for me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, Matt, you know, one of the things we do right now with any computer, your silly Chromebook,  Hey, hey, hey, my Linux OS in front of me, Mac OS in front of, actually you have iPad probably Mike Elgin.  I won't infer.  I'm rocking a Mac.  Yeah, rocking a Mac.  Is you have applications which you launch to create a document.  And for years we've had this applications kind of centric view of computing.  Long time though people have been talking about, Chris, remember this of course, document centric computing.  We've tried to do this many times.  But the idea is that's more how you work as a human.  You know, humans don't say do I need Word or Excel or maybe we do now, but in the old days you wouldn't.  You would say, what do I want to build?  Do I need a hammer screwdriver?  You say, what do I need to build?  And you'd focus on what you're building and then use various tools as appropriate.  AI will facilitate this because it is the master tool.  You'll talk to AI, not to the computer.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It'll figure out what tool to use.  Yeah, and it'll end.  That's what Grammarly showed a few weeks ago.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  An interface for this would be like Fortnite, you know, where essentially you can build kind of whatever you want.  Right.  And that's actually the problem is that you'll have infinite choice.  And the question then is how does the AI coach you into like working from what is an enormous space of possibility down to a set of clear either buttons or interactions or almost like madlib style.  Okay, like who is this for?  What are you trying to achieve?  I feel like I think Google was the one that really writes good complaint letters, I guess, for getting refunds and things like that.  Yeah, right.  I mean, they've seen enough email.  You know what I mean?  It was good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, they demoed that at Google AI and they said if you really want to write an angry one here.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Where do I send a complaint letter to Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  There's no one there to be.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the problem.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sorry, AI is going to run through number three.  Well, Fortnite is a good example, Chris, or the Master Hand in Zelda, the Tears of the Kingdom.  One of the reasons Zelda is so hot right now is because you have arbitrary build capabilities and that's transformed the game.  It's fascinating to watch people.  So this is so I think Microsoft's what Microsoft saying is we're they almost said this explicitly.  We're a platform company.  They actually put Bill Gates famous quote up on the screen saying, you know, you know, something's a platform when the people who use it make more money than the platform maker that the platform facilitates people to create new things and they're going to even benefit more.  And I think that's what Microsoft sees itself as is the AI platform builder.  And for all of the attention that open AI gets, let's not forget Microsoft owns nearly half of them.  And all of it is running on Azure.  So in effect, Microsoft is financing the AI revolution.  So that's in that's the second stage beside then inside.  But the one I think is really most interesting is outside.  And Microsoft talked a lot about disparate data sources, orchestration across multiple apps, pulling in acting as an agent.  And Chris also will remember this.  Mike will as well.  This, you know, the very famous John Scully video with the knowledge navigator and the little AI with a bow tie.  The whole idea of it acting as your agent and pulling things in your Jarvis, if you will, Jeff, pulling in things and from everywhere, from the from the from all of the world and becoming your kind of intermediary to the real world.  And this is what I see.  This is Microsoft saying this is what we think the future is going to be.  And this is where we want to be now, whether it will be or not is another matter.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  But another yeah, another perspective on the on the external use of AI occurred to me.  And it's I'm sure it's not original thought at all.  But it sort of kind of blew me away when I was really thinking about it, which is that no matter where augmented reality goes.  I'm certain that augmented reality is going to be much bigger than virtual reality.  Even if it isn't, it's going to be huge augmented reality is we're all going to be talking about it after the Apple WWDC next week.  And some of us have been talking about it for a decade, but there's no augmented reality.  The future of augmented reality is going to be heavily dependent on AI to the point where the AI part is the indispensable part.  The visuals, the holograms, all that stuff is theoretically dispensable.  What I mean by that is AI is going to see and interpret the world for us.  It's going to take in all that data, figure out what's going on and then use that information to then give us advice, nudge us here and there,  answer our questions to all that kind of stuff with an awareness about what's going on in the world.  So the AI to interpret the world and then AI to figure out how to help us with our surroundings is going to be the most important part of augmented reality.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You almost have to have it in order to interact with the world.  There'll be so much input, you'll need something to filter it.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  The smoke and mirrors part, the visuals, the holograms, the 3D, the magic leap stuff, that stuff is going to take forever.  And the applications for that kind of thing are going to take forever.  I'm ready and I think everybody's ready for an AI augmented reality right now, which is just a voice.  Right?  And so I think we're like on the brink of, I think this year we're going to see a lot of things like that where we're talking to a voice,  the voice is talking to us and AI is interpreting the world and figuring things out for us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right. Since I have at least two, if not three bullish AI bullish people on, I want to tell you my dirty little secret.  I don't buy any of this.  I am not. I am not.  I am bearish on AI.  And here's why.  You know, I think about self-driving cars, I think about speech to text interfaces, handwriting recognition.  It seems to have been always the case that the first 90% can be done and be very impressive.  But the last 10% is such a failure that cars run into kids and Siri has no idea what you just asked it and your handwriting turns into farm.  And I think we've seen this over and over again and I worry that we are once again falling for what is a hype cycle because the first 90% is so damn impressive.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  It's not just the last 10%.  The last the last 10% of the last 10% is almost impossible.  Yes, it's Zeno's paradox.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're never going to get there.  Right. Right.  So Chris, I'll let you defend this because Chris, obviously you are a believer.  I mean, history might be on my side.  Why is this going to be different?

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  You know, like the way I'm looking at this is really about resetting assumptions about what computing is.  So, you know, I often try to think about generationally, you know, kids coming up now who are in school, who are learning to work with chat GPT will have a completely different set of assumptions about what the interaction paradigm should be when they pick up a device.  Right.  You know, already there's some kind of skepticism.  You know, we grew up obviously and these things are still magical.  You know, those of us who choose to stay on Twitter still think that Twitter is amazing.  Whereas the younger generation is like, this is like it's just text.  Like this is so boring.  Where's the video?  Where's the interaction?  Where's the game like stuff?  So I do think that, you know, for a certain generation, certain cohort, certain set of people, you know, the AI is not going to be that relevant to that.  I mean, you know, there's a story I think today about how car manufacturers are trying to like take out AM radio, you know, from the cars.  And there's some contingent of folks who are like, no, like, you know, over my dead body or whatever.  In a similar way, I think there will be so many folks who resist what AI can do for you.  And yet another cohort of people for whom these types of conversational interactions will become the de facto way that they actually compute.  So that to me is the shift and that's the difference.  And so we have now 30 years, you know, if not longer, maybe 40 or 50 years since the mother all demos that define the computing paradigm based on changing human expression to meet what a computer could understand.  Yes.  So moving our finger around to point to things through a metaphor, which was the mouse or having, you know, a set of keys, rows of keys that you have to like put your fingers on in a certain order to generate commands.  So the computer knows what to do.  Now we are finally in, you know, I built a conversational AI company in 2016.  That was just too early with the assumption that we have built the APIs.  We have built the platforms.  What was missing was the interface that would allow kind of just in time coupling of those services through a conversational or language based runtime.  And that's to me the shift that is happening and it will change everything because again, people will start building from those new set of assumptions.  They won't be building with an assumption that, you know, you have to go through an app store to deliver a little chicklet on people's phones and all the mechanics around like ads and all that other stuff.  Now it's going to be intent based, which, you know, Android has been working on for some time, but you still have to have the metaphor of the app.  And I think it just dissolves a lot of those boundaries and the way that we've organized so much of the digital world that that I think is what's going to fundamentally change.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  And Chris, that's the 10,000 foot view.  And to me, the 100,000 foot view is that we've been using computers since we've been using electrical powered computers since the first half of the 20th century.  And in the entire evolution of computing, the way that it changes and evolves is that the computers become more powerful and they work much, much harder to speak the language of humans.  And the language of humans ultimately is just storytelling of verbal conversations that we have with other people.  So it was inevitable since the 1930s that someday we would have computers that we just talked to and they would talk back to us and they would make sense and they would understand things and help us do things and do things for us and that sort of thing.  It's always been the direction of computers.  They've always evolved.  So the voice interface is that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, right now we're typing that language.  It's not.  It's a command language.  It's language.  So it's all the things that humans do.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  We're visual animals.  We have language.  This is what we are.  We're bending it to become something that's part of us.  Ultimately, what we're sort of talking about and pointing to is it's sense making and it's communication.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  And you're absolutely right.  Like all the ways in which humans understand the world through our sensory input, right?  First has to be felt and experienced.  And then the second part is then how do you translate those experiences verbally into phonemes that I can then shoot at your ears and that you can also see my movements and things like that to try to understand the medic things that are swirling around in my brain.  And so that is how we create a kind of union while we are still boundaries.  So I'm still me and you are still you.  And yet, as I describe these things with words, as I shape that reality in your mind, we then come to an understanding.  And up until now, we've had to use a lossy type of communication style with computers to approximate what we mean because of the huge number amount of sort of sequential compute that's needed to get to something similar to what humans are talking about.  Like you can give a computer an image or a photograph and it's a bunch of text.  If you ever try to open up a JPEG in a text editor, like it's gibberish.  It's nonsense.  It's not concepts.  But now thanks to machine learning, largely, we've trained the system to have a better sense for patterns and phenomena and to label those phenomenon with human concepts and ideas that now allow the computer to respond to us in a way that is much closer to the way that we understand and interpret and experience the world.  And that changes how often and how frequently people want to use computers because it becomes a lot more accessible and a lot more delightful than the current method, which all of us.  And it changes quite good at exactly.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  It changes who can use it also changes who can use language.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This has been my argument about about this is that it broadens literacy both in text and in visuals, images and in programming.  People who can now communicate.  Chris, let me ask you, since since you went 10,000 feet and Mike went 100,000 feet, I'll go down to hell.  Great.  I'm trying.  I keep on trying to look for anyone who has a credible scenario in which they argue that this could destroy mankind.  I don't believe it.  But have you seen what's I've never seen the script for that except, oh, my God, we're all powerful.  We have big shlongs and we can do what we want with the world.  I've never seen something that takes me through the steps by which that happens.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  You know, I'm obviously there's there's plenty of sci fi and movies that attempt to tell the story of these things.  But I feel like it's a little bit lazy to just make this assumption that, you know, once you add plugins into chat,  you suddenly both the system is somehow sentient and also sees humans as a blocker to enablement.  Like one, I think, although these systems can become extremely powerful, I mean, you know,  and you can have all sorts of different conditions that emerge from that.  It feels like the real risk is almost like if not a cultural decline that is caused by a set of questions about what is it that humans should be doing with themselves?  How should we be doing work if suddenly, you know, we have a lot of, you know,  we already have enough income inequality in the country that suddenly now you have a bunch of sort of executive folks who are hiring AIs to do a bunch of roles throughout an organization.  And that leaves a lot of people without a lot to do and without sort of like like capitalism starts to break down quite a bit when so much of the work that currently is done by people to give them purpose and meaning  and a way to contribute to their community suddenly goes away and can be automated and made to be extremely cheap.  You know, like we've in this country, we struggled with slavery and this is a new form of slavery that is not morally reprehensible in the same way.  It's different. And so that is something that what's the machine is a slave.  Yes, like essentially if you're using chat, GPT, let's say that you're in college, like there's no reason necessarily for you to write an essay.  If your goal is to get a credential and then to go into the world and to show someone this credential to get a job that has now been automated through like automation technology.  So instead, like the shift and this is not exactly answering your question,  but I'm suggesting that the thing that I'm most concerned about is that we're not doing a good enough job teaching the skills that will be necessary in this future world where there is an assumption that again,  people are using these tools day in and day out and it's in their pocket, right?  The tools of empathy, of curiosity, of, you know, listening, proactive listening, nonviolent communication, like all those things are actually quite necessary in this in this new world.  But they're not the things that are taught in school for the last hundred years or so.  We've been teaching people how to, you know, rote memorization, facts, all that stuff.  And to Mike's point, we've been building computers that do all that stuff for us so that we don't have to.  We need to inspire people with humanities involved now.  Yes. Yes. So we're sort of coming back full circle into the humanities and philosophy.  Just as they die.  Right. Exactly. So I think that's like, if anything, maybe it is that we, you know, bore ourselves  without changing what education is about to encourage, you know, deep curiosity and then the ability to ask better questions.  These reasoning tools that we're building now will, I think, make a lot of people very like lazy and they'll miss the point of what education could and should be about in terms of personal development, personal growth, personal inquiry, etc.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  In my journalism school, I started a program with my colleague, Kerry Brown, in engagement journalism.  And the argument is that it doesn't start with our stories.  It doesn't start with the journalist perspective.  It starts by listening.  And we're oddly bad at that in our field and other fields like education and retail and government.  And listening is a skill that we haven't had.  And part of the problem, part of my argument about the Internet and why there's moral panics around it is because people who have always been there and have always been speaking, who were never heard in mass media, now have the opportunity to be heard and resent not being heard.  And those who held the stage before resent their voices.  And so speaking and listening take on a whole different definition.  I like that.  I like what you're headed with that.  The where chat becomes a what is it?  Is it a curator, a middleman, a gatekeeper, a facilitator or what in between?

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe a facilitator, maybe a context, you know, like to be, you know, either an interpreter or just again to sort of ask the questions like.  Because so many people have such a diverse set of experiences and we're living in a world, you know, and we're seeing this with social media now, right?  Like Twitter obviously was one melting pot of a lot of different ideas and cultures and so on.  Now we're, you know, disaggregating again to different edge networks and platforms.  Now it's very hard, you know, having left Twitter for me to have a sense of the zeitgeist of what's going on.  So there are little pockets of reality and truth or truthiness that are popping up and I'm encountering them and they're very confusing.  Like it's very bewildering maybe.  And so anyways, like a type of AI or a conversational agent that can be there to help me understand what's gone on before.  What is the context of this place that I find myself in?  What are some of the appropriate norms and ways to speak, you know, could really smooth over our movement through these digital environments?  That's an interesting question.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Blue sky.  Yeah, well, blue skies get human.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're getting ready for they're getting ready for agents.  An interesting argument is, you know, are they going to bring in those agents next?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think, you know, that's interesting that Twitter, a read-only Twitter that is created by AI.  But I have to say, I'm still skeptical because the content AI produces is so anodyne, so phony at this point.  And I don't think it's going to get any better.  I don't. I think there's a little bit of a science fiction leap that you're making that it will somehow, you know, achieve this fluency that I don't necessarily think about.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  If you think about it more from a collaboration like those who use it for collaboration, I think will actually sprint much further than those who don't.  I don't think that poets and novelists who are doing just that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are they making better poetry and better fiction because of it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes, they're being inspired.  Really? I think we look at Leo.  I doubt you want to know what how to look at tree is much more inspiring than any AI would ever be.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  And if you hooked up a tree to AI, that would be a book I would want to read.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The one right behind Christophe.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  If you want to, to me what's interesting is if you have this thing that has three trillion connections in language, it's telling you everything that all the cliches we've had.  It challenges you then to go beyond them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You still have to think beyond the cliche and all you're getting is the cliche.  The machine won't.  So you got a great cliche generator.  What's the value of a cliche generator?  That's not useful.  Have you read any high schoolers essays?  Yes, exactly.  Exactly.  They're horrible.  Yes.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Machines really should be doing those.  But I think the analogy that I like so far and we'll see if any new emerging facts jars this away from me.  But basically, I think it's very similar to photography and what it did to painting.  Before photography painting was something we used to record visual scenery or visual things.  People sat for portraits and it was a kind of propaganda.  It was a lot like stable diffusion is now where it's kind of an idealized version of the aristocrat standing there like in a kind of a phony environment.  We used it for capturing faraway scenes and landscapes of places where we're far away from any place you'd ever go and you would look at it and go like, wow, that's what it's like there.  That's amazing.  And so we used the painting as a way to capture what was really there.  As soon as we had photography that could really capture what was really there.  Well, suddenly painting just exploded into a thousand styles of surrealism and all these different things that we really love.  It really freed humans to be super creative and to do things that humans can do that cameras can't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So we no longer need to write the cliches.  The AI will do it and we can do something more original.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Well, I think so.  For example, we on the rundown is a is a missive by Sundar Pichai.  You know my feelings about Sundar Pichai who's writing in the Financial Times and and his entire thing feels like it was written by AI.  I don't think it was but I but it's like you say it's anodyne.  He's a boring writer.  He doesn't make any he doesn't make any mistakes.  He doesn't he's careful about everything.  He's everything's couched in these sort of platitudes and so on.  That's how AI writes by default.  Then you can tell it to be sassy or whatever and it's not very good at those sort of things.  It's not very good at summary for the most part.  But again, this stuff has been with us since January.  I mean, you know, give it give it two years three years.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah, I really think that like the scene the younger generation come up with this as a core, you know tool and I think the photography example is is pretty good because by and large especially given all the all the cameras in people's pockets now  and the sheer volume of terrible terrible photos that have been produced as a result of putting cameras in everybody's pockets doesn't mean that those who have real talent or vision can't then use that tool for something more transcendent.  And I've seen, you know, so far, for example, musicians who maybe normally don't write vocals or lyrics to their songs be able to use something like chat GPT to just get something to get a riff to get a line to get like something that sort of inspired.  Or gets them going.  And ultimately, if this is the best solution to the blank slate problem or the blank page problem, then that means that I mean, you know, I I spent a walkabout year kind of traveling the world thinking that I was going to like write a book about my experiences and I got nowhere because of this blank page problem.  So if I have chat GPT or something like it, that not only harasses me into like sitting down and like spending, you know, an hour writing and then also is like, OK, tell me about this or tell me about that.  I feel like as a creative tool to extract things out of a person, then that's a way to again to understand these tools and to put them into the current context.  I mean, it's you think about it from a different perspective.  This is something that we actually try to work on on Google Plus, which, you know, Mike, I know you were there for that.  You know, is the question like, what is the prompt?  And currently, whether it's Twitter or whether it's Blue Sky or any of the other platforms, they ask you something, you know, the prompt like what's going on, what's on your mind, like what's happening?  There's been loads of tests, but all within a very sort of fine mix.  You can imagine that a chat GPT or some other GPT tool could actually propose topics that you might be interested in based on what's both your interests personally and then what's been going on in your network.  Right. So for lots of people who currently find it hard to participate in social media or are mostly lurkers, this could be a facilitation to get their voice, their perspective into the mix.  And then they can be coached on how to express themselves in a way that gives them greater confidence, just like having spell check or grammar check.  This is almost like concept check.  And that could actually be a great enabler for hearing from more people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I need to take a little break.  If you want to rush over to Twitter and the Twitter space where Rhonda Sanders is about to announce his presidency for presidency.  It said it was in two hours.  Yeah, no, it's at three o'clock.  It's right now, three o'clock Pacific.  27,000 people are in there right now.  I don't see Mr. DeSantis in there yet, nor do I see Elon Musk, nor the man I thought was going to be the host, David Sacks.  So I don't know what's happening, but you know, it's it's now.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  But Florida man is missing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Florida man is gone.  I do want to talk a little bit about our sponsor AG1 from Athletic Greens.  You got it right. These are the travel packs, which I really, really like.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It says I can't fetch it.  Can't fetch it.  Yeah, I noticed it.  We're able to fetch space.  The number of listeners is going down.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So maybe there's something going on.  Maybe maybe Twitter can't handle it.  Crashed.  Handle it.  Yeah.  I noticed one of your jobs.  I know you consult Chris Messina.  I noticed one of your clients is Neva.  Yes.  So sad about Neva.  I've been flogging Neva for, you know, months.  He has been.  Oh, he has been.  I love it.  I love the AI generated synopsis.  It was the future.  I was paying five bucks a month because I didn't want to ads.  It was now they're they're selling out and they're and they're closing down and they're refunding my money.  Do you have any insight into what happened?

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  You know, it's it's I started out kind of, you know, advising Sridhar.  Certainly there was there was a lot of alignment in terms of what Neva was working on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He was a Google head of advertising at Google.  So yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  So we have we have that that background together.  But you know, I think there were a number of things that happened.  You know, they did a bunch of different and interesting experiments.  There was a whole effort that they had focused on around Web 3 and NFTs and kind of, you know, just trying lots of stuff to see, you know, what the next wave of the web might be like.  And, you know, I don't I don't have any specifically insider information about this particular thing.  But I think the thing that he said, which is the thing that I would I mean, we saw this with Google Plus as well as hard.  It's like changing behavior.  Yeah.  You know, even if you have a better product, just the muscle memory and the distribution that Google has is really, really difficult to break through.  And so, you know, like it's interesting.  You know, one of the reasons why I reached out before was, of course, talking about, you know, Twitter and activity pub and those things.  And we face a similar question, you know, as to whether or if some of these other networks that are coming up now, where it's like Google doesn't even have I mean, Google has some network effects.  But for the search experience, it's largely a private personal experience.  And yet the muscle memory is so ingrained, you know, you almost have to like, you know, do some psychedelics or something to just like, you know, break free from like the way you think about it.  But I think that was that was the thing that Neva really, you know, struggled to overcome.  It's the attorney of the default default.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I kind of was souring on Google just because that the above the fold stuff was less and less.  Oh, yeah.  I just kind of said I need something that's going to give me search results.  Neva gave me very, I think, pretty good search results.  And then when they turned on the AI, I was I kept showing all these these poor guys are so bored with it.  I kept showing it to them.  June 2nd.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Chris, do you ever use a search engine called Find PHIND?  Find PHIND.  I have not actually.  PHIND.com.  Check it out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm looking for Neva replacement.  I'll have to check out AI search engine for developers.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Ah, for developers.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  I don't know why it's for developers.  It works for all purpose searches.  It gives you a Google like result and also an AI, chat GPT like result side by side.  And it's it's it's pretty good.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah, nice.  I think perplexity is sort of in a similar realm.  I think it's perplexity.ai.  It's interesting how like there's a new it feels like a standard in interface design that was largely inspired by chat GPT where it's sort of like chatbox.  But then they give you sort of like starter conversations to get going.  Yeah, but yeah, I don't know.  The Neva thing is super interesting.  Obviously, you know, they'd raised a bunch of money to go after this problem.  But I think the the LLM stuff changed everything and it woke up the sleeping giants.  And now it's like game on.  And so it's Microsoft versus Google.  And as an um start, you know, had had like chat GPT and open AI really not come on the scene as they did.  I think Neva, you know, could have had their runway and continued, you know, chasing that dragon.  But now that the big guys are awake and actually like launching their stuff like Google had all this stuff, you know, behind closed doors.  That makes it much harder, you know, with that billions of dollars of investment, you know, to do the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  Yeah, it's pretty good actually.  Just trying to get it to write some code for me.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Let's see if it can do it.  See if you can spin up a Twitter spaces.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I need the dial tone of the Internet.  Can you can you get to work on that?  Okay, sort of good.  And what was the other one perspective?  Huh?  Perplexity.  I'm sorry perplexity.  Yeah, but a lot of these unfortunately so hard to make a search engines index.  A lot of them are just using bings or Google's index and this looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll have to do.  Well, that's another question.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Do not just indexes but trading sets become a commodity?

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I mean, obviously like what one of the ways that I think about AI is a lot of people have talked about data as kind of a new oil and I just want I think that that metaphor is a little bit, you know, gross and tired.  I tend to think about it more like varietals and you know, grass them in California.  So I would think that but like, you know, I think I think that with data, it's a little bit like terroir.  It's you know, it's the specific kind of region where different aspects of the data has different levels of complexity different levels of expressivity different metadata that's attached to it, you know, and so you know, those varietals are kind of you know, the weather the atmosphere the ground.  You know, the grape growing area as well as the people were then cultivating those things and they have a certain taste or preference.  And so when it comes to building, whether it's a search engine or a reasoning tool built around a large language model, it isn't so much that I think the training data becomes a commodity, but there are different expressions of it in different use cases.  You might have a general purpose like large government body data set and it might have a bunch of extraneous stuff that just isn't really that relevant or that useful.  And so tweaking those models deciding what goes in what stays in what goes out how to cross reference like identity, ironically, which is something I spent a lot of my career working on becomes an even bigger problem because now you want to be able to know from one data set to another.  What are the same like, you know, reflectivity like is this object in this data set the same thing as in that data set and what are the other relationships between those things?  So that's also the way in which these things are not necessarily commodity per se, but they can be blended, if you will, to create new types of data sets, whether they're synthetic or or not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Do you what do you think of the argument in the stochastic parents paper that ever larger learning sets are are are meaningless and counterproductive and hard to manage and really not the point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hold on a second. Let me just interrupt. I was in the wrong group.  Elon has launched his group for the presidential campaign, his presidential campaign.  I can't get it to run, but he's got three hundred seventy five thousand in there.  So I think I was I was in a side and this is one of the problems.  Of course, I was in a side group.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  You're in one from a verified user, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, this is where you even find it.  Yeah, it's just it's in the trends.  Yeah. Elon Musk is the host.  I'm a listener, apparently.  So is Yashir Ali, Alexis Ohanian, Michael Beschloss, Alex Wagner, Laura Ingraham, Caitlyn Jenner.  It's a who's who of Tommy Lauren, Matt Gaetz, Rudy Giuliani.  And there's Randi Sanders. He's just listening for right now.  But we can't figure out how to get.  How do I talk on here?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I guess, Elon, what Rudy Giuliani ran for president, honest to God, his Twitter account was private.  Can I let me just turn on the turn on the sound here?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can you hear? I'm just curious.  I think it's Elon talking at this point.  Can I broadcast this? I don't know.  You know what? I wonder if I should report this space as being offensive to my liberal ears.  Yeah, that's right. I imagine they'll have that turned off anyway.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Well, I guess we can't hear it. So well, there's no staff there to shut it down anyway.  So that's true. That's true.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And he's still not paying the rent, which may be kind of an amazing.  Well, that was the accurate history.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This building is not earthquake safe.  So maybe he'll use that as. Oh, there you go.  It's a dumb question. Yeah.  How do you get to spaces?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There is this thing called Twitter.  You'll find it at Twitter.com.  Yeah, I'm there. Yeah.  And then over on the on the right hand side.  Well, I mean, let me refresh because probably doesn't.  I see tech crunch. Oh, it's not there anymore.  It's not there. They've been moving stuff.  Mobile. Check it out on mobile.  It was there. It was right here in the trending.  Maybe if I explore.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Well, my spaces bar just went away.  Yeah, Twitter crashing hard. It's crashing hard.  That's what's happening. Yeah.  Now, there we go. Listen live in spaces.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It should be up here.  Preparing to launch is the name of that one.  Now, four hundred seventy three thousand people in there,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  including all these famous and semi famous.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  That would be so good if like, you know, the one moment  where where Elon tries to like showcase his new purchase  is the moment when Twitter actually finally crashes,  like all the predictions about it.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's like somewhere presidential campaign here.  You say and I knew this had happened.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Oh, I heard I heard Elon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right. Well, it's certainly an incredible honor  to have Governor DeSantis make this stark announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What the hell? What the hell is that?  Please wait.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  It's like space music.  I guess we're going to Mars, guys.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's it. We're on his his roadster off somewhere in the.  That's right.  She's Louise. All right.  I don't know what that is, but I'm closing it.  You mentioned AM radio.  Ford has reversed its course and says, we are.  OK, well, all right.  We'll leave the AM radio on in your car.  It costs nothing. In fact, it's a software update.  If you. Yes.  Kind of amazing for any owners of 40 V's without AM broadcast capability  will offer a software update to restore it, said CEO Jim Farley.  So apparently they're building them with AM radio.  They just disable them in software.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I want is that. Huh.  Sorry, like mine is my mind is going to like several places  because there's a lot of things that have been changing in the audio world.  Obviously, we saw it with Twitter spaces, but like when it comes to  when it comes to audio and cars, obviously that's a really relevant ad channel.  And so whether you're streaming Spotify or other platforms like that,  that's all coming over, I presume, you know, digital frequencies, perhaps.  So if it's a software update, does that mean that the hardware is just being turned on  and turn off for AM or is AM content being streamed over like I don't think so.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't think so, because one of the reasons I think they're bringing AM back  is because there's been movement in Congress.  AM is a critical emergency channel for that's what I would expect.  Yes. And so that's why it's a software update.  Yeah. Yeah. You need a hardware radio because there are plenty of places in the US  you can't get your cell signal.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  And so if it is like Starlink and other types of satellite coverage,  maybe I'm not disagreeing.  I have the same question.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Elon does not, as you know in your Tesla, Elon does not put AM radio in your Tesla.  It does not.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  If everyone needs to go to Mars, I will not be notified.  You know, if the message goes out over AM, it'll be on Twitter spaces.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Boop, boop, boop, boop.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Yeah. So I'm looking at the debacle that is this announcement  and Twitter keeps crashing,  DeSantis keeps being demoted to a listener rather than a speaker.  Oh my God.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  It's symbolic. It's symbolic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There are half a million people.  The number continues to rise of people trying to listen.  They should have used Clubhouse.  Here's Brian Stelter's tweet is,  This space is not available.  Yeah, I think it's in fact, I can't get it to do anything.  It's kind of just kind of dark now.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Another embarrassing blunder for Elon Musk.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me join in for prime time.  Laura Ingraham and see what's going on.  One more time. We'll give it a shot here.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I bet he's throwing all of his ad inventory at everyone who's trying to get on the space right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Last chance.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Huh.  Well, there you go.  So I'm sure we'll find out more about this on the evening news.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  If you go to the explore tab, at least for me, again, I don't know what's personalized and what's not,  but Musk is a trending topic with 986,000 tweets and DeSantis has 170,000 tweets.  So talk about being a ratio.  Yeah, he's not even.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's why I'll Elon likes it.  And that's how we're going to keep it.  Yeah.  Is Joe Biden tweeting?  Oh, well, let's see what the president has to say.  Jack Dorsey.  He just came back.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Who?  Then silence again.  Are you listening?  We're ready to go here.  No silence again.  Oh, Lord.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jack Dorsey apparently is now endorsing.  Let's see.  Let me find that story.  Norse and who?  RFK Jr.  At least he's retweeting.  Yeah.  Posted two videos in the past week featuring RFK Jr.  Oh, man.  Of course, a big COVID and anti-vax conspiracy nut.  And more.  Yeah.  So what is it about people?  They get red-pilled.  Oh, I hear Elon.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That was B.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did he say there's too many people?  So many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, this is not good.  No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Chris, do you mourn this a little bit?  I think it's sad.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I went through definitely a period of grief.  Because again, this place and space, it is like a neighborhood that goes downhill.  And it was a place that you could go to.  And you have a down moment.  There was always something interesting in there.  I mean, there's still interesting things going on.  But it's sort of like they've taken out the plumbing and just like porta-potties around.  And you're kind of like, is anyone going to clean this up?  Yeah, in that sense, it's sad.  And I don't think there's much conversation about grieving of the loss of Twitter.  And yet, in terms of the purpose that it served, it doesn't serve that function anymore.  There's going to be a generation that grows up without Twitter as we knew it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There is that discussion around black Twitter.  There's a story in the rundown today that climate scientists are leaving en masse as a group.  I think that we see it around communities rather than Twitter as a whole.  Journalists still don't know what to do.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I mean, so this is again the thing that I was interested in the conversation you guys had previously about Activity Pub and about these migrations.  I do think that the dissolution of a social platform like this, I think it's interesting having been on the inside of Google Plus as it was being built and having designed parts of it.  Bless you, sir.  Bless you.  And also struggling mightily in a lot of the kind of idea.  Some of the ideas were good.  Some of the ideas were completely orthogonal to what or how humans tend to want to interact with each other.  And so, you know, if you come at it from a more, I don't know, observational perspective, then maybe you can build better software.  Anyways, this question of like where these communities go and how they move and whether or not we should build into the fabric of the social web that ability to leave if a place becomes toxic or no longer serves its function.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Is anyone afraid that a year from now that Twitter will be the right wing Twitter and Blue Sky will be the left wing Twitter?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And is that a good thing?  That's not a good thing.  That might take about a week from now, Mike.  Yeah, I mean, here is the Biden tweet.  Throw a little subtweet, I think.  This link works.  Now it's on.  Yeah, now it's on.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah, but to give money.  Okay.  Yeah, to give money.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Interesting.  Yeah, he's not having a spaces chat.  Neither is Elon right now.  Apparently.  Are you monitoring it?  I was trying to, but now it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now there's nothing, huh?  Interesting.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Most of what I'm seeing are people saying that it's not working.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy, says social media may harm children and adolescents.  A profound risk of harm to adolescent mental health urges families to set limits and governments  to set limits.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  It looks like, sorry, David Sacks, if you go to David Sacks' tweets, he just posted  a space with Ron DeSantis.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They created a new one?

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe because Elon has too many followers, so Elon can't set the space.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that might be.  That could be.  That might be.  So let's see here.  Tulsi Gabbard in there.  David Sacks is hosting this one.  And there's Ron and a bunch of other people.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's that noise again.  Who shows this music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Guess.  Take a wild, wild guess.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Is this what DeSantis plays at his gatherings?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Unbelievable.  So the Biden administration's surge in general, let's point that out, called on tech companies  to enforce minimum age limits and to create default settings for children with high safety  and privacy standards.  And he urged the government to create age-appropriate health and safety standards for technology  platforms.  You know, fine.  What are you going to say?  The Leo below, I have a thread on 79 where I went back.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So happens I was researching this, this is the part of the book I'm writing now where  I went back to 51 years ago and the surge in general report on television violence,  five volume monstrous thing 40 years ago on video games.  This is every non-technology ones.  They're all the same.  They all end up the same.  And then the interesting thing was, um, uh, professor corn Revere, who's a really good  first amendment scholar, had a really good post about the, um, uh, a video game one.  It went to the Supreme court and, and you see the first amendment lesson and happened  again and again and again and again.  And it has to be retaught.  And so in the Supreme court ruling on, uh, Brown, California versus, uh, whatever entertainment  company was, uh, there's a quote that gets reused now constantly about the first amendment  that, but in one of the footnotes, um, uh, Scalia was arguing with, with, I think, uh,  Alito somebody, and he described a ridiculous law that should never happen.  And what he described was Utah's law that just, just went into effect.  And so we go around on this moral panic Mandela over and over and over again.  And that's not to say that there isn't plenty of worth studying and there isn't plenty to  be concerned about, and there isn't plenty to support parents with.  And that's all true.  But the search generals report says nothing about guns in the schools, about about, uh,  climate change, about the economy, about all of these things.  Oh, no, no, no.  It's all phones.  Yeah.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Um, well, the weird thing, and I think this was acknowledged that there's a, there's  a certain degree of, um, I guess it's refreshing honesty or surprise.  It's more honest.  The, the search and generals, uh, statements than, than I would have expected, but he  basically points out that the problem is that we haven't studied it enough.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh my God.  We studied it.  Oh my God.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Yeah, there have been studies and they point out that there's a, you know, there's probably  more harm than benefits, but the benefits are there.  Actually, the existence of social media and the lives of young people is actually a huge  benefit in a number of ways that include, you know, a sense of a place to express creativity,  a place to, to find connection with people, to, to, for, for people to help, you know,  find people to help them through their adolescent problems and so on.  On the downside, there's, there's bullying problems.  There's like self esteem issues as in lunch rooms.  Exactly.  So, but Mike, very important.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You bring up a really important point.  Claire Kane Miller, the times through great credit and the times for the great credit  had a story today talking about how important the social media is to LGBTQ teens, especially  now when they're being assaulted in some States all around, they're not being allowed to live  as themselves.  And so the existence and which, which Murphy, Murphy, Murphy, Marty, um, acknowledged in  his report, he had a thick paragraph, but the benefits, just as you just did, Mike,  a knowledge, the importance of LGBTQ young people, without that, they'd be even more  lost.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I mean, like, doesn't it seem like the other piece of this is to suggest that social media  either also harms adults and parents or that they are actually one of the number like leading  causes of some of this harm and abuse because, you know, adults and parents tend to set the  norms and the behaviors for their kids and to assume that kids should somehow develop,  you know, some sort of moral clarity or alacrity in the absence of those examples seems to  ignore like some of the fundamental distortions from social.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  In fact, I think they do do exactly that.  You see, you see a fluidity of movement of younger people from one social network to  another for, for the various reasons.  I mean, you saw people rushing to Snapchat because, you know, years ago, because, because  they could have a group of, you know, interact with like 12 people instead of a thousand  people.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Now, now, Discord is that for a lot of teens.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Exactly.  Exactly.  So it seems like on the whole, one of the interesting things about younger people as  a demographic is that they're quicker and sort of better at finding spaces on social

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  media in some ways is more to them.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  And again, it's sort of reflecting back on how we grew up with this.  And so, you know, like my accounts on social media are so valuable to me.  They're so personal.  And I want to hold on to them like forever.  I think what I see in, you know, this is true in a lot of other communities is kind  of a willingness to abandon or let go of, or just kind of use disposable identities,  you know, constantly, and especially earlier on.  Like, I think one of the things that's interesting about this report, and this is a constant  conversation that I just do not know how to square with, you know, American conventions,  values and laws, which is causing social media platforms to be better at identifying young  people underage and then restricting their access and use without some sort of identity  regime that requires everyone, you know, every kid basically to have an ID that is attached  to them somehow in a way that is completely against so many of the principles of privacy  and security.  So we want, you know, the cake to eat, you know, and to eat it too.  But it's not really realistic, I think, to put the onus of parenting and controlling  access to these platforms exclusively on the platforms themselves.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Chris, there's a great quote.  I just read this paper today by Kirsten Drotner from Pedagogica Historica.  I read all the fun things.  Welcome to Wednesdays at Johnson's House.  Is that a real library behind you?  One line quote, on a social level, media panics basically attempt to reestablish a generational  status quo that the youthful pioneers seem to undermine.  You're right on target that it is about age.  It is about generations.  It's about parents either saying they're protecting their young people or as so much  in moral panics, it's about hooliganism and vandalism and delinquency.  And so it's either condemning our young people or protecting them because you don't trust  them in that way either.  And the young people know what the hell they're doing and they're figuring it out.  And you're right.  There are us elders or not.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I mean, I feel like the ways to well, I don't know, like, you know,  I do have a role as a parent now.  And, you know, I do think a lot about how to equip kids to be in these media environments  and to understand what is, if not real, just what is important about what people say and  don't say.  And, you know, we've got a 13 year old here at home who runs a Discord server and I've  had to teach them about being responsible as a server admin because they determine who  is in the server and who is not.  Oh, I would love to hear those moderation lessons.  Well, it's I'm learning as I go.  But, you know, thankfully I've run my own Discord server so I can have that conversation.  Think about all the parents out there who have not run their own Discord servers, let  alone even know what a Discord server is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Right.  So and yet those folks, you know, those are the folks who are trying to tell their kids  how to behave and how to do that.  And there's a whole like subgenre or subterranean world of social interactions that are happening  in these spaces that are affecting kids and their mental health and their sense of security  and safety in their communities and their environments that are completely opaque to  parents.  And so parents are like, oh, let's get the search in general to like say this is a problem  and to crack down and to restrict access.  But that doesn't solve for the underlying interactions and behaviors that are going  to happen anyway.  As you said, like in the lunchroom, you know, that is a visible space.  And yet school interactions happen outside of school now, you know, whether it's on text  messaging or whether it's in these chats.  And so the vernacular in the language that needs, I mean, we talked about this earlier  with like, you know, chat GPT being sort of a context provider for parents, you know,  where it's like, what is it that your child understands about social media and technology?  And then what do you understand about social media and technology and where are the gaps?  And can you facilitate a conversation so that both can at least come into those conversations  with a broader lens for what belonging like in this moment means to that generation?  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Would that be useful?  That sounds like what you were answering Jeff's question about what are the hazards of AI?  AI is prescribing parental...

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  It depends on, you know, the relationship that you want to have with your kids.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The machine said I should be talking about sex.  So sit down and shut up.  It seems that you don't want the government enforcing it.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I agree. You don't want the government involved.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  By the time you get around to doing something about it, they're all gone and off somewhere else.  Right.  I just don't, you know, there's so much dynamism in trends in social interaction among teenagers  that it's like you don't have a prayer of like it's a game of whack-a-mole.  You don't have a prayer of climbing down on TikTok because by the time you do,  they'll be off TikTok and on the newest thing that doesn't even exist yet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, as we predicted, five creators in Montana have sued now over the state law and TikTok has now entered the fray.  TikTok itself, right?  It is also suing.  Yeah. I thought it might not just let the creators do the heavy lifting, but they file a federal lawsuit against Montana.  It's clearly a First Amendment.  It's a First Amendment.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Who knows what this would work, but it is.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  It's wild that that's happening in Montana of all places.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  It's also lazy.  Right.  First of all, Montana is doing something.  They're basically doing, you know, international relations as a state.  But the other thing is that they're just basically, they're saying, OK, Apple and Google, you guys, we're going to crack down on you if you don't enforce this stuff.  And it's pretty ridiculous.  You know, it's like if you were on one side of a state line, you can download an app.  If you're on the other side of the state line, five feet away, you can't.  This is not going to work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Apple has said prior to the law being introduced, or actually when it was introduced, but not passed, that they did not have a technical means to prevent people in Montana from downloading TikTok.  I find that hard to believe.  I think you could you could create the Great Firewall of Montana if you really wanted to.  I don't think that's how the Internet works.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  But I'm glad that you've hallucinated that idea.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can't you just say, well, let me look at that IP address.  Oh, yeah, you're in Montana.  No, you couldn't.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I mean, they did this for Pornhub, too.  You know, and they do it now for Utah.  If you're motivated.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  If Pornhub can block itself, the VPN business is great.  Yeah.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's great news for VPN providers.  Exactly.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah.  Mozilla might still have a business.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are you excited about Instagram's new text based app for conversation?  This is from Gia Haberman.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  It at least seems to have Federation built in and it wants to interoperate.  They say soon our app will be...  Activity Pub?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Soon our app will be compatible with certain other apps like Mastodon.  I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds like there'll be Activity Pub.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, let's have a race, Blue Sky and Instagram.  Who's going to get there first?  Yeah.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I've been having a lot of conversations with people who are actually building bridges between...  Oh, good.  Yes.  I think that's Blue Sky or at protocol.  And I think that that's like...  It's so funny because I started working on this stuff in 2006, 2007.  And finally, some of these ideas are coming to fruition.  And so it's interesting to see that Blue Sky picked up a bunch of these ideas and yet kind of reinvented the wheel once again.  So now it's like, oh, great.  Now we have like five standards.  Now I have to choose among them.  But actually they're close enough that maybe we can get to some alignment and maybe this Instagram thing could actually push it forward.  I mean, we'll see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't have a favorite between AT Proto and Activity Pub.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I think they're actually complimentary.  As I've dug in a little bit more, I understand that what Blue Sky is trying to solve for is actually different than Activity Pub.  And so, you know, considering like I helped to create the Activity Streams format that then turned into Activity Pub, the original goal was about syndicating a greater richness of activities beyond just what RSS encoded, which was blog posts.  And so now that Activity Pub is quite mature and now there's software behind it.  The alignment between what Blue Sky is trying to do from an identity portability perspective is compatible with the way of expressing the activities that Activity Pub uses.  So essentially you get some aspects of identity and the tree structure and I don't know, there's a bunch of like weird mutation stuff that I don't quite understand in the protocol, but it's not completely incompatible.  In fact, the protocol uses things like an actor and a verb to encode its content.  So it's already there.  And the work is being done currently to see if those things can actually align.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  And Flipboard is really interesting because basically from within Flipboard, you can reply to, you can like, you can repost content from either Pixel Fed or Blue Sky.  And it's like, wow, if you can do that on a site like Flipboard, then wow.  Wow, it's very optimistic.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  If a lot of publishers, you know, Jeff, your earlier point about media folks leaving and trying to find someplace other than Twitter.  In fact, if there is federation and an underlying protocol that can link all these things together, it almost doesn't matter in the short term where they end up as long as they kind of move together.  That's the dream.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, this is all, so Dave Weiner, Leo, if you saw Dave Weiner set up an RSS feed for your Blue Sky, fortunately you have nothing to feed into it.  He set up an RSS feed for my Blue Sky?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, yes. Yours and mine and a few others.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I better post something.  Because Dave is always up to come back to RSS.  Yes, everything is RSS feed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Does Blue Sky support RSS natively? I know Mastodon does.  Do you have to?  I doubt it.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah.  Mostly because I don't think it's super relevant to their audience.  Right.  You know, I mean, I don't think it'd be that hard to build.  And now that the clients are open source.  No, Dave did it.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But he's scraping it probably.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  It's sort of ironic to like take something that's like rich, like an activity object and then reduce it down to like RSS.  It's like a one way, read only protocol.  It's sort of like you have like a PNG or really great graphics and you're like, let's smash this into a JPEG.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm sure that Dave has answers.  I know, I know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The last time I talked to Dave I said, why don't you make me sign up with Twitter on all of your web stuff?  And he got mad at me and I haven't spoken to him since.  So I'm glad he's included in my Blue Sky.  I know, my Blue Sky feed.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  By the way, did you guys see that?  It looks like Snowflake has actually gone through with the Neva acquisition.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ah, good.  I mean, I guess good.  Good for Neva.  Yeah.  Snowflake is an AI company.  They were interested not in Neva's search capabilities, but in their AI.  Yes.  Was Neva using, do you know, chat GPT or were they doing something separate?  I think they came out for chat GPT.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I mean, they might have been using GPT though.  They might have been using the OpenAI APIs for what they were doing.  But yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I thought that was actually a good use for search, but even at Microsoft's event, which there's going on right now, Bill, talking about search every time on the very tiny print at the bottom, it says results AI generated, not factual accuracy, not guaranteed.  And I think that that's a problem in the long run or maybe just the short run.  Search may be the wrong place for it.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, it's weird that we've lived so long without disclaimers at the bottom of search results to say these results might be sponsors.  Good point.  Good point.  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're right.  Yeah.  But at least the link is to something that exists.  We know that chat GPT can...  Which could also be completely fabricated, right?  No, that's true.  At least that's the...

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I mean, it's sort of like when you click into something on LinkedIn, it's like, oh, you're leaving the LinkedIn walled garden now.  And you're like, okay, does that mean that there are snakes?  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do we want to start a pool on how many people get fired at Twitter after these spaces debacle?  Is there anybody left to fire?  Exactly.  Where's Linda? Is Linda weighing in?  Linda was in the space.  So poor Linda.  She was.  Yeah. So I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He has more black owned businesses than any state in the nation.  That's what he just said.  Who does?  Ron DeSantis.  Ron DeSantis.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's talking now.  I have more black owned.  That's scary.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  That's like saying your binder is full of women.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Because it's merit, not identity politics.  But you can just pop in any second.  There's always something interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I know the way that they got this going was by basically booting everybody out.  They're down to about 140,000.  Restarting the server.  Yeah.  They restarted the server.  time.  Which is wrong, of course.  And then it crashed.  Be careful what you wish for.  That's all I can say.  Google, right?  Google, right?  Google, right?  Google, right?  Google, right?  Google, right?  Google, right?  Google, right?  Google, right?  Google, right?  Google, right?  Google, right?  Google, right?  Google, right?  Google has reached a $39.9 million privacy settlement with Washington State.  This is not the only state suing Google over the fact that their switch that turns off  location, didn't turn off location, and they were still collecting location information.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Google has promised to stop.  I think this sort of is such a strange, like it juxtaposes so well with what we were just  talking about with age gating and TikTok downloads in Montana.  It's sort of like lots of people would prefer that these companies not collect this data,  but then to do the thing that they actually need to do in terms of provisioning access,  you can't have the information that's necessary to actually enforce certain rules or laws.  So it just feels like in the Google case, granted it's been many years since I've worked  there, but you just sort of end up collecting this information by virtue of having an IP  address to deliver a web page to someone who has come to your server and it has to go back  there.  And the nexus point has to be someplace on the physical earth.  Like, how do you get around that?  I just.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, this is the other thing about the Facebook fine, this huge fine.  $1.3 billion.  Where the issue wasn't Facebook and privacy at all.  The issue is America.  It's Europe not trusting data in America.  Same with America and TikTok and data.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The EU told metadata to stop.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  An American company and American employees control data that's housed in a European server.  How is that different?  Right.  They don't trust Americans.  Well, this is the same TikTok issue.  What difference does it make where this data is?  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  TikTok says, well Oracle is going to store the data, but that wasn't sufficient because  Montana and whoever else said, but yeah, but the Chinese government can still access it.  Right?  So this is what the EU, it's actually Ireland's data protection commission is complaining about  being transferred, data collected by Facebook being transferred off of European servers  into the US about obviously about European citizens.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  It's like, I don't understand how that works when it comes to like edge caching and like  network optimization.  I mean, if I'm a European citizen accessing, you know, my Gmail account from Oregon, does  that mean that I'm, I only can access my Gmail if it's stored in somewhere in the EU, in  which case I'm dealing with like the latency of constantly going back to that.  Like it just seems like it runs against the way in which the internet was designed and  the way performance works.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Right.  If I email somebody in the EU, isn't the entire conversation stored in both places?  Right.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah.  places.  Emails still never meet in the middle.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess the problem is we have a global internet and it doesn't respect national boundaries,  but nations want it.  Imagine that.  And I don't know who wins on that one.  Do you have a, you are on T2, which is, was created by former Twitter folks, T2.social.  It's very much like Twitter.  You're on blue sky, Chris.  You're on mastodon.  Do you have a dog in this, Hunter?  Or are you just, you're just watching?

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I mean, in the sense that the dream of the original distributed social web, you know,  is still alive.  And I now is more than we've had an opportunity, I think in most of internet history to perhaps,  you know, right the wrong of the centralized social platforms.  Yes.  And so, you know, as far as it goes, one, I want to be seeing how these platforms are  showing up and competing and how they're innovating and changing things.  But then also, if I'm going to be providing guidance or input to any of the folks who  are working on the underlying protocols for interoperability, we do have to sort of think  about what different verbs do in different contexts and what certain behaviors are allowed  in some context or another.  And what happens when it comes to interoperability between them?  So we do have an advantage.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Twitter has kind of led the way.  I mean, we have, we know what a working social network looks like.  And so all of these look somewhat like Twitter.  We know what it looks like from a centralized.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  From centralized, yes.  They look like it.  And you're like, you know, and Google Plus was very similar.  You have a text box and you type something or you add some attachments and then it goes  into a feed.  And that's kind of the whole model.  But in this new world, you know, you should be able to follow people that are on different  networks and different platforms that are run by different people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are you sad that Plus didn't take off?  No.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I think it's useful just to stay for the record that Google Plus was successful for Google.  It was not successful for users of the network per se.  But you know, having, you know, being the person that designed the Google profile, you  know, there were 43 different representations across Google when I got there where you could  have a different profile photo and a different name.  And you know, there are some benefits to sharding your identity in that way.  But when it comes to interacting with one company, you know, it's not like you want  to have like 15 different Apple accounts or, you know, 15 different YouTube.  I mean, maybe you do for business purposes, but like as far as it goes, when you change  your name because you got married, you want it to be propagated across all the places  that's necessary with one company.  And so what Google Plus did was it provided identity as a backbone for all subsequent  Google services to be built around those assumptions, which then gave you different  capabilities and things like Google Docs and Drive so you could share something to  someone and know that the right person had it.  And from a business use case, you could then have people who work for a company and  therefore have access to different services or data or information.  And if they leave that company, that information can be revoked without them having to  give up their full Google account.  So anyways, in that sense, plus was a success for Google's business goals.  It just wasn't a consumer hit.  Now, Google Photos, I will say, is largely a success.  It drives a lot of the machine learning that Google does.  And in fact, the product manager who's still working on that is the same product manager  that was working on that with Google Plus.  So it's kind of amazing to see that some folks have really stayed with these products  all the way through, you know, even like 10 years later.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  I also think that Google Plus improved social networking generally because so many  companies, especially Facebook, tried to copy some of the best features.  And so even even I think this week, you know, Twitter said, oh, we're going to have  you can have videos on Twitter that are what, two hours long?  Two hours.  Well, that I mean, we're that Google Plus had that in 2000.  Plus, they'd have a lot of like really good ideas like.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  I think the timing was a little awkward and the emphasis on desktop browsers was probably  its Achilles heel.  You know, during I remember during that year, that was when Zuckerberg had his famous kind  of like hoodie lockdown and everyone basically had to like stop using Facebook on their  desktop laptops and switch over to mobile.  And they realized how bad the experience was, which then allowed Facebook to build what  essentially became their mobile advertising juggernaut, which then, of course, Apple then  cut off their legs with the app tracking transparency stuff.  But nonetheless, you know, I think if Google had really ironically leaned into Android,  they might have actually done much better by building into the US.  Actually, this is something that I think you guys have talked about.  But and I'm curious to see what happens when the DC happens this year.  But Apple has been slowly building a social network into the operating system for the  last two or three years.  And there is no antitrust concerns because it's so there's no app.  There's no kind of concept of, you know, this is the thing that you could pull out from  the platform. And yet that is how Apple is slowly eroding Facebook's position in the  market. You know, for example, if you go to Safari, there is a for you section or shared  with you that comes from all the different people that have shared links to you via iMessage.  In iMessage, there's a shared with you thing that shows you all the photos from different  people in the photos app.  There's stuff from your contacts.  So very, very slowly, you know, boil the frog type method.  Apple is introducing social sharing functions as part of the operating system that is  completely, it seems to me, being missed by the mainstream press and by analysts because  there is no kind of app that you can point to and say, aha, that's the Apple social

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  network. You're exactly right.  And if you look at notes and if you look at free form, you basically share documents that  you interact with with people and then those those connections are persistent.  So you go back to like I do it all the time with family members and colleagues and stuff  like that, where you just go back to the space within those apps where you were interacting  and interact again for a different purpose.  And it's just sort of you're sort of just sort of connected with all these products.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  It's very strange.  Like the contacts in the address book app in Mac OS and on the iPhone are the ways in  which you manage those connections.  But there's not like an explicit like add this person as a friend.  You add them to your address book and that is the action that you take to then connect

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  with them. And that was the vision of Google before and after Google Plus.  And and but to circle back to your point about mobile and missing mobile, I mean, one of  the ways in which Google Plus was light years ahead of everybody else was live streaming.  Right. They call it live streaming back then.  But basically, you do you could do a hangout and just basically be live streaming and it  would automatically be live on YouTube and then be stored on YouTube permanently.  But it was desktop. And so if you look at how how live streaming turned out to be a huge  phenomenon, it was all on mobile.  That's mostly a mobile phenomenon.  So if they had just been aggressive, like you said, about getting that live streaming  capability and the group chat live streaming capability and rushed that to mobile, they  would just own the future. That that became the big the big deal.  And they just missed it because they were only on the desktop.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it was such a blind spot.  You know, and looking back, you can clearly see it, especially, you know, everything that's  happened with with Instagram and Facebook and WhatsApp.  You know, all the parts were there.  Google had all of it, but they were just so wedded to again.  And, you know, I mean, if your business is this huge money volcano, you know, thanks to  search, you're just you don't have the right incentives really to cut from the past.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I argued years ago AOL was Facebook before Facebook.  Sure.  Right.  AOL was Twitter before Twitter.  It could have been all those things, but I couldn't see it.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Where do you stand on the quote tweet?  Blot of controversy.  Any thoughts?  Do we need a quote tweet on Mastodon?  Yes.  OK, there you go.  We do.  That was simple.  That was easy.  That was fast.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  And they're headed that way.  Chime in and say that we don't need it, but it would be nice.  I like it.  You can.  It's easy to sort of construct your own.  And as the creator, the hashtag, you know that these like sort of like these sort of  workarounds can be very powerful.  Like you just paste in the link to the original thing if you want to.  Yeah.  But I like quote tweets.  It's easy.  It's fun.  I, you know, it's like the people who follow me follow me for my theoretically for my  opinions, my take on things.  It's easy to take a tweet and then share my take on it.  It feels good.  It's also a, it's also an ingrained behavior that a lot of people have.  So I think it would be nice.  I don't think it'll ever happen.  I think the mass, the, the, the reverse community is

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think has been, has been open to it when he attended the black Twitter summit.  You know, he's been talking about that and say, and he also, and our, and the  black Twitter summit we held, he saw the value of search, open search to a  community to be able to find each other.  So he's very open to those, to those things.  And I think we, there's some really interesting proposals on the mastodon get  in terms of, of putting some limitations on it as a voluntary that you're  retweeted, those kinds of questions are interesting to reconsider.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah, we need.  Yeah.  I think, I think like there's a question of enforcement and behavior and how to,  you know, conduct a space where you're emphasizing pro social engagement.  And there's of course negative things that are going to happen.  I just don't think that like the medium, I mean, yes, there are aspects of the  medium itself that can be used to inhibit bad behavior, but if you're cutting out a  huge set of content that people are, you know, familiar with and comfortable, you  know, using, and they can use that to actually build up other people's voices  and provide distribution and attention.  And you're like, well, let's just get rid of all of it because 20% of it is, you  know, nefarious seems to ignore, like again, where the control should, should be  put, you know, if someone is, is, is going to be negative or mean and these things  absolutely happen.  That to me seems like that should be at the level of the individual and the person  should be blocked or they should, should be sent to something else.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Exactly.  And this is another area where I wish people would copy Google Plus again, because  so Google Plus had an awesome phase.  It was like three years where it was amazing.  And then it sort of turned to crap.  Like around for the last few years.  But, but in the end, there was one awesome thing that turned to crap in the last few  years, which was that a single click would block report and remove a comment.  Yes.  That was just so powerful.  Just boom.  And you just nuke somebody and their comment has gone forever.  They're reported and they're, and they're blocked.  If every social network had that, there would be no trolling.  There would be no hate speech.  I mean, it would be amazing.  Oh, you're advocating for it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yes, actually.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  So on this, on this point, like, um, I don't know if you guys have seen or tried out  like what blue sky now offers with, uh, their moderation lists, and I don't know  exactly how they're going to work.  You know, it's very interesting that everything on blue sky is public, including  who you block and those interactions.  But as a decentralized platform, uh, you know, for better or worse, you do need to  embrace some aspects of transparency in order for the system to function, um, in  a decentralized way.  And so now you have the ability to subscribe to block lists.  And, you know, I think the easiest way to understand these block lists on  blue sky is just to think about an ad blocker.  If you have an ad blocker that allows you to subscribe to block lists, then you  can have multiple different sources and different perspectives on the things  that you want to remove or get rid of on the internet, whether those are cookie  banners or ads themselves, or, you know, there's, there's even some ad block  lists that allow you to allow some ads in that you might consider to be positive  or that you want to support, you know, the, the producers of different  websites or whatever in a similar way.  This is going to bring that type of capability to the internet and then to  crowdsource collaboration on, um, those types of lists.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is interesting.  So have people created mute?  This is blue sky.  I have people create a mute list that I would have to know what it was, I guess.  And then I could join.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find my  And your subscription to it is public.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  But yeah.  Um, I haven't muted any accounts, uh, nor have I blocked any accounts.  Oh, wait a minute.  I did block one account.  I don't know why, but, uh, but I haven't had much occasion to block, uh, you  know, blue sky, it, my only complaint about blue skies is kind of a silly  right now because I think it will giddy having left Twitter.  They're just giddy and they're so happy that pictures of Alf that they just go  crazy, but, uh, yeah, it's settling down a little bit, settling down.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I just saw a discussion on, on blue sky of race and health threads.  I don't understand the health thread thing.  It's actually in the right.  Yeah.  Let me take, let me take a little break.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I want to talk more about this, but I need to take a break.  Uh, Christmas scene is here and what a great opportunity.  To have one of the legendary creators of all that is good and wonderful in the  universe with us, including the hashtag and a lot of, so I didn't realize  you'd worked on activity stream.  I guess I knew that way back when, back in the day.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  It was way back then.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I kind of took a hiatus.

Speaker: Leo Laporte

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did they have flooding problems last week or no?

Speaker: Mike Elgan

They, they, they've, they've had problems in the past, but, uh, but in modern times  they've really controlled the water flow here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And of course, Jeff Jarvis, who is in New Jersey.  That's all I'm going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

And then he wants to talk about education and he bring it.  They're bringing in Chris Ruffo, major known intellectual to talk about that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I turned back to already the tech crunch reporting, technical issues, play  grand, the census presidential announcement on Twitter.  You heard it happen here.  Uh, live the product, the product, which allows live streamed group voice chats  cut quickly, cut out quickly after going live at 3 p.m.  The audio glitched in and out of times only played reverb noises, along  with some distorted speech as of 3 15.  There were 580,000 listeners on the Twitter space update by three 30, an  alternative space with the live Ron DeSantis was up and running, although it  only attracted a fraction of the initial user base.  How many do you have in there right now?  Jeff, it was down.  It's about 147 last time.  I have 47,000 last time I checked.  Uh, he announced, of course, as he intended to that he's running for president.  Uh, I also saw a Rupert Murdoch's, uh, response to this in the daily mirror.  Oh, Ron disaster.  They called it.  I was quick.  Didn't Rupert's not a fan.  I think, uh, I don't know who he's a fan of, but not of, not of, uh, Ron, I guess.  Um, and, and somebody on blue sky skeeted, right?  Is it a skeet?  It's a skeet.  Yes.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yes.  I think the CEO called it a post, but sure.  Yeah.  I wanted to call it a bleep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I wanted to call it a bleep.  That would have been so much better.  They got a lamb.  Anyway, uh, somebody bleated.  This has to get Tucker Carlson really scared because Tucker routinely  has many on the platform, multi-millions watching his show.  They, if they can't handle half a million people, that's problematic.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Well, here's the, here's some context.  So before Elon Musk fired everybody in November of 2022, Elon Musk himself did  a, a space with 2.7 million people.  Uh, in December, he did another one with 2.2 million in May of, in May of this  month, uh, actually the, uh, uh, former prime minister of Pakistan did a space  with, uh, I guess only 65 K, but there have been bigger spaces than that.  Back in the day when people still worked there.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yes.  Employees are good.  He said six months to really, you know, firm up that infrastructure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a bad, that's the wrong direction.  That's wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Uh, what were you, how many, how many young people can true social support?  Like 20?  That's a good question.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's running a, it's running on a forked mastodon.  It's probably pretty good.  It is.  Let's see.  It might be more stable depending on how well they forked the code.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Probably don't have the money though to pay for it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The Washington post to Santa's presidential campaign kickoff on  Twitter, plagued by technical issues.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is not, not a good look for either DeSantis or, uh, lead story.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  New York times to Santa's announcement derailed by Twitter malfunction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, not a good look.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is the post to the Twitter space where you set to announce came to a  halt after roughly 20 glitch plagued minutes filled with long stretches of  silence and messages like details not available.  The funniest thing was, and we heard a little bit of it,  Elon muttering to himself.  It's not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't, I got Elon.  I would not want to be around.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Schadenfreude, thy name is sweet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I know.  I'm sorry.  We shouldn't, we shouldn't.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Daily mail, the daily mail in the UK said it's the biggest fail in campaign history.  Holy.  Uh, on DeSantis' mock for Shambolic Twitter room presidential announcement  with the Elon Musk that crashes five times and leaves users bamboozled.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It does seem like a strange decision to do it on, on Twitter, to be honest.  Uh, yep.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  That's yeah, but I mean, like he's filling the vacuum that Trump had previously,  right?  So had it gone well, it actually, like I thought it was, it had the potential to  be very smart because if Trump isn't there, but then DeSantis can kind of just,  you know, rile those folks up and they're looking for the game that Twitter was  while Trump was on the platform.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's where the base is or was.  Yeah.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah.  But if, if, you know, if neither, um, DeSantis nor Elon are very good at Twitter,  uh, then maybe that's not such good campaign strategy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I prepared a special story just for you, Jeff Jarvis today, the 140th, 40th  birthday of the Brooklyn Bridge.  Uh, probably you don't know this Chris, but, uh, for some reason,  Jeff doesn't like bridges.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm bridge phobic.  I started trying to walk across.  I lived in Brooklyn Heights.  You'd think that I would have come out there and written my novels there or  something.  I tried to start walking across it and I said, I can see down.  Nope, nope, nope.  You can.  You can see.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Did you fly?  Do you use airplanes?  Well, yeah, that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They fly.  They can fly.  Yeah.  Um, you would not like this video.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I can't.  You would not like this video on the New York Times, uh, website, an Unum  interview with Ken Burns, which immediately shows the cracks in the bridge  and the water.  But, um, I love the Brooklyn Bridge.  It's one of the great landmarks of America.  And I just want to celebrate it's 140th birthday.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's amazing.  It's a wonderful, amazing thing.  I've driven over it unhappily, but

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  New York was inching towards its new role as a world class city and the  bridge helped put it there.  You know what?  I just started.  I'm really excited.  Robert Caro's biography of, um, uh, Robert Moses.  Yeah.  People love it.  Which is, uh, yeah.  I mean, look, I don't, I barely know who Robert Moses is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Uh, he, he had just a huge impact on, on New York.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  As a, as a, on all kinds of communities that he split up as a former New Yorker  and so forth, very interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  But, uh, and Caro, I've read his LBJ biography.  I know is one of the great biographers and everybody agrees.  This is the biography to beat all biographies.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I can't wait to read it.  Journalists love it.  I've never actually read or listened to it.  Are you listening to it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm listening to it.  So far it's a lot of anecdotes, which I like, you know, it brings it to life, right?  Stories about what, what happened.  Uh, FCC commissioner, uh, nominee.  We've got a new one.  The white house has nominated veteran government attorney, Anna Gomez.  Remember, of course, uh, for a long time.  The FCC is still under manned because for a long time, Gigi Sohn, who was  a Biden's first FCC nominee was blocked.  Uh, since late 2021, uh, Sohn finally, uh, pulled herself from consideration.  Uh, last month, uh, she was a big supporter of net neutrality.  One of the people we really, uh, wanted to get in there, but telecom  lobbyists did not want her in there.  So, uh, Biden has nominated Anna Gomez.  Don't know what her opinion is of net neutrality.  I hope she's a supporter thereof.  At least she didn't come from the private sector.  She was a previously a deputy administrator for the national telecommunications and  information administration has worked for the FCC for 12 years.  Uh, he also nominated, uh, I'm surprised he nominated Brendan Carr.  I am too.  Geez.  Carr is really one of the most reactionary FCC commissioners.  Yes.  And Democrat Jeffrey Starks.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let's not forget now everybody on both sides of the platform hate  the internet, so that's fun.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think probably Carr is a gift to the Republicans hoping that they will  finally let him, uh, fill this, fill the democratic seat, but I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Um, what else?  Oh, they're laughing about the status on, uh, on MSNBC right now.  Yeah.  Much hilarity.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, it is Sean Freud.  And I think that's probably, I apologize.  I apologize.  Oh, we had a Kathy Gallus on a Sunday on Twitter because of course she wrote two  amicus briefs that were critical, uh, in the Supreme court's decisions from last  week, she won one and lost one.  She lost the fair use case, the anti Warhol foundation being sued by a  photographer for a print that Andy Warhol made of a picture the photographer made.  Uh, Kathy's point, which so far no one else has picked up on, but I thought  it was very interesting was this wasn't.  This was kind of suing an intermediary.  Uh, the analogy I made, uh, is, you know, uh, Michael Jackson did a song called bad.  Weird Al made a song called fat.  If I were to play fat, it would be as if I played fat on Twitter and the Michael  Jackson estate sued me for playing the parody and that's in effect what happened  here, she says the Supreme court got it completely wrong and undermined fair use.  Which is too bad.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Which is an issue for AI too.  A big issue for generative AI.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Because before the copyright stuff was going against copyright when it came to AI  and this reverses it in a way that I think can be very damaging.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Uh, but it also has to be said that, that, that weird Al always got permission from  the, he did.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's why it's not a perfect, it's not a perfect analogy.  Right.  Better to get something where somebody did a fair use, a legal parody of something.  And then I played the parody, but got sued by the originals.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  The other weird thing about this is that the magazine had previously gotten  permission to use the photograph.  That's right.  400 boxes.  But then this was a different use and, and this is the whole, this is the whole issue.  So, and, and it's the problem with this sort of thing also is that clearly Andy  Warhol was using that specific photograph clearly, but there's a, there's a line  there that where, you know, an artist can use a photograph to the point where it's  unrecognizable, uh, and then how do you, you know, so our judge is going to be  deciding where that line is with AI, for example, uh, where, where they're, they're  going to look at something and say, oh yeah, I can tell that that's using this  artist's style.  So, uh, we're going to rule because, because I, the judge have decided that it  reminds me of the style.  Like it just seems un, unadjudicatable, I guess is the,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  well, and to your, is the thing that to your point, Jeff, uh, I had thought the  courts would uphold the right of AI to create new creations from stuff that they  had learned from existing artists.  I thought that was a clear use of transformative use of the work, uh, and  would easily be supported by the courts.  Now I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, but you know, this was, of course, was not a case about AI.  This was a case about something different and, and, and things aren't recorded,  right?  They're learned from, um, and the actual work is, is discarded in a sense out of  memory.  Uh, so that may make a difference.  I don't know.  Uh, Chris, I'm curious to hear your perspective on this.  I see you nodding.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah, I was, you know, as, um, as you were thinking about this or describing it,  you know, it, it occurred to me that as we try to figure out what to do with,  like static media and media that of course exists, you know, let's say you  frame it, you put it up on a wall or you print a bunch of magazine covers of  something that is static, um, fair use in that context.  And I believe in this case was about whether or not the original work has been  essentially usurped or replaced with something that is more or less equivalent  by a different artist who then makes money or commercializes that, that reuse.  So in other words, the original photograph could have been used for the, I believe  this was a, uh, like a 20 year anniversary.  Yeah.  Something, whether it was about prints or whether it was about the photography.  I don't know.  It was about prints.  Yeah.  The photo was of prints.  I don't know if it was anyways, whatever the case was, it was an article about  prints.  Yeah.  I believe that the, the Supreme court was saying, well, essentially the, the  fair use doctrine really applies to things that are in sort of a different  commercial context.  You can take things and editorialize them.  You can take things and talk about them.  You can take things and create a derivative work that is substantially transformed.  And of course the substantially part is of question, but in the commercial  context, I think Leo, what you were saying where you would be sued by the  original copyright owner is because you are essentially choosing to use the  derivative work instead of the original.  Although the thing that you paid for is essentially like a copy or a  replacement of, of the, the, the original.  So you're paying for a facsimile as opposed to the original.  And therefore the person who created the original should get, um, you know,  compensation for that in the case of AI artwork and going forward, and work in  general, it begs the question if you can simply conjure up a new image, every  time someone looks at something, what is the nature of copyright?  Are images, do they need to be copyrighted?  Essentially like you can, you know, you can buy stills from a film, for example,  right, put on your wall, you know, it's the celluloid or whatever in the future.  If most graphics or images are to be generated on the fly by AI and produced  based on a training model, what is it that you're actually copywriting and what  actually is being sold in the marketplace?  So this is a somewhat very backwards kind of perspective.  Now granted, a lot of this static content is going to continue to be produced and  we will produce static images that we like, and then we want to pay for it.  And we want to buy, but in the case of artificial intelligence, if someone says,  oh, that's a copyright infringement on my work, well, you could literally like  roll the dice and just sort of generate a new image from the same training data  that it is substantially transformed or different such that copyright maybe  doesn't apply in the same way.  And I don't know how it applies to motion images, but that's a question.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is so from SCOTUS blog, all agree that Warhol's artistic contribution is  substantial, reflects an aesthetic intention not shared by the photographer  Goldsmith, but for Sotomayor, who wrote the majority decision, the only relevant  feature of Warhol's use is that it is a commercial licensing of an image created  by Warhol based on Goldsmith's work for a fee.  It was the commercial aspect of it.  So if for instance, let's say I buy an AI generated work of art that looks very  much like Thomas Kincade's paintings, Master of Light, and then Thomas Kincade,  for only example, and then Thomas Kincade sues me saying, and this is the  Supreme Court's issue, instead of buying an original from Thomas Kincade, I bought  an AI version of it.  And that is as to the use of the magazine in the magazine issue here, though  Sotomayor is clear, Goldsmith's works, a celebrity photograph commonly used to  accompany stories about the celebrity, often in magazines.  Her point of view is that instead of paying the photographer for the original  image, they use the derivative image.  But they didn't love the original.  It took money away from the photographer.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  It's like a knockoff bag.  It's like a knockoff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And so in the AI example, if I use an AI that was derivative of Kincade, Kincade,  according to this judgment, could legitimately go after me for commercial  use of a painting created by an AI, but derivative of his.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I don't know that you could, I mean, you could show similarity, but I don't know  if you'd actually show.  It'd have to look an awful lot like his, right?  Well, but again, that's human perception as opposed to the actual thing and the  way in which these data sets are trained, you know, it actually is an amalgamation  of, let's say thousands of different, you know, types of art.  And so then how do you like, then is it fractional infringement?  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I have to pay $10 to Kincade at $5.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what, that's what news publishers are begging for is pay us for ready use.  Right.  Leo, you raise a really interesting issue with where the, where the EU is going on  regulating AI, where the intermediary liability takes a whole new quantum leap,  whoever created the original structure becomes liable for anything ever done by  anybody with that structure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So if I drive my Tesla or my Tesla drives into a house and kills somebody,  Elon's responsible or Elon's programmers are responsible.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes, yes, yes.  And that also negates any open sourcing.  Of it.  Right.  Yeah.  You can't open source.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Which is, which is, yeah.  How does that work for guns?  Oh, interesting.  Oh no, we're not going to go there.  Video games kill people, guns don't.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's right.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Get it straight here.  I know.  My apologies.  The other Supreme Court case, and actually it was both cases, was  Gonzalez versus Google and Twitter versus Tamna.  The court rolled them up into one and said, because we have decided Tamna, we  don't have to decide Gonzalez.  We don't have to decide Google because, you know, it's the same case, which it  kind of was, remember though, the oral arguments for Gonzalez versus Google.  The Gonzalez attorney was saying Google was, YouTube was actually responsible  because they, their algorithm published, you know, this ISIS video and, and  created thumbnails and that made them a publisher of the content.  The good news is while nobody mentioned section 230, it didn't even get to that  point, most of the decision was on a detailed ruling on Tamna was written by  Clarence Thomas, who actually, first of all, the justices voted nine, nothing.  Uh, to in favor of Twitter.  Uh, so that's, I mean, it's unanimous.  Uh, but, uh, and Clarence Thomas actually kind of surprised everybody.  It surprised me for sure by writing a very well thought out, uh, piece, but  it doesn't mention 230, what it really came down to is what is aiding and  abetting and can Twitter be considered aiding in it because they were going  after them on the terrorists aiding and abetting of terrorists.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Well, I believe that the, the, the thing was that they were essentially  asserting that Twitter was aiding and abetting all terrorists or jihadist  activity as a result of publishing or allowing this content to be published.  Exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Thomas, uh, was very clear that historically aiding and abetting, uh,  did not, uh, you know, go that far.  He says, for example, assume, assume that any assistance of any kind were  sufficient to create liability.  If that were the case, anyone who passively watched a robbery could be said  to commit aiding and abetting by failing to call the police yet our legal system  generally does not impose liability for mere emissions, inactions, or nonfeasance.  Uh, he, he said for these reasons, of course, have long recognized the need  to cabin aiding and abetting liability to cases of truly culpable conduct.  And as a result, uh, Twitter, not truly culpable.  It did not aid in a bit and nine, nothing that Twitter is not responsible.  This completely safe for now.  Well, it's safe only in the sense that they didn't say anything about 230.  Although Mike Masnick makes a very good point in tech dirt saying  Thomas actually gave is in this whole discussion of aiding and abetting, a  very good reason for why 230 exists in the first place.  So, uh, Kathy's opinion was the only benefit to 230 in this.  It really does not impact 230, but the only benefit might be that now here's a  precedent that could be used to support 230, uh, down the road.  You see, we need this because we need to protect people in a case like this.  You don't hold a platform liable for the speech of its users.  Um, so it was not a victory for 230, but it wasn't bad.  It didn't hurt.  It was a reprieve.  And, and Kathy said, and of course she's been on the show many times.  She's very smart.  She wrote the, uh, you know, uh, amicus brief, uh, for this case.  She said, uh, it is possible that what Thomas said that that could be used in  further cases to protect 230, so there may be some value to that.  I just wanted to give you a follow up on that.  Do watch, if you get a chance to watch the twit episode from last Sunday, it  was a, a really good discussion.  Um, and we had a Harry McCracken and Kathy Gellis in studio, Amanda  Silberling from a tech crunch.  And, but I really grilled Kathy on, on both, all three of these cases, really.  And then she could answer.  She's great.  She's, she's really great.  So one, one win, one loss for her.  She's a one and two in the Supreme court.  Um, the, should I give, should I go here?  The AI writing novel writing tool that everyone hates is better than I expected.  Writes Addie Robertson in the verge.  This is actually what you were talking about, Chris Messina, because Addie says  it, it would, it would help.  Wasn't the Addie had writer's block?  I don't know.  Is Addie a guy or a woman?  I don't know.  Uh, they, uh, have written 150,000 words of unpublished fiction last year alone.  So writer's block wasn't the issue, but it was very helpful in generating a novella.  The electric sea.  Um, Addie says the electric sea was produced with heavy human guidance, but  every final line was created by hitting a generate button.  The story is published on a Tumblr.  I couldn't bring myself to read it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But even Marché also wrote one called the death of an author, which the Times  wrote about this process.  Yeah.  Really interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the generative, uh, fiction tool is called pseudo right.  It's well named.  I like the name S U D O pseudo right.  Um, it's a called story engine and, uh, it can write a full novel in a few  days with a little help from a human.  Have you played with this anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you written your,

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  I haven't played with it, but I, but I, but I, but I think that as is always  the case with AI places where AI generated content is applicable, press  releases, SEO, uh, page mediocre writing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In other words, exactly.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Exactly.  I mean, there's a lot, there's a most, most super popular fiction is garbage.  And, and it's just, it's, it's fantasy world stuff.  Right.  Uh, I read recently about this Mormon author who's nobody heard of.  Nobody's heard of who made $55 million last year.  He's got this, uh, disorder where he just must write all the time.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're talking about Brandon Sanderson, Stephen King, no, Brandon Sanderson.  No, but Brandon is amazing.  And that article was such a hit piece on him.  Uh, it was really kind of unfair.  Nevertheless, he says he can't not write.  He just spews it out.  He really rarely edits what he writes.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  I want that disease, but anyway,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I, by the way, I tried to read some of his stuff because I thought, wow, people  have, it's terrible.  You can't write.  People, people laud him as a world builder.  And I'm very interested in world building fiction, but the writing is so God awful.  I couldn't get past the first paragraph.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  But so much romance fiction on, you can buy an Amazon so much like of this just  sort of like fantasy world stuff is just bad writing and really AI should be

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  writing at it's just doesn't require the entire functioning.  I think this is actually kind of impressive.  Here's the prompt.  Eddie gave, uh, uh, this program introduced Jack hacking at his computer,  focus on vivid descriptions of Jack's squalid apartment and his moral conflict  and cynicism, Jack pulls off a corporate espionage job by navigating a virtual  world.  He sends the information to his client.  There's more, there's more, uh, Jack's moral conflict as he began hacking to  expose secrets in a corporate controlled society, but is ending up selling them to  the highest bidder in order to finance his continued life as a hacker, use made  up brand names, fictional corporate names, use detailed literary descriptions of  futuristic hacking, focus on emotion and character traits.  That's a nice prompt.  This is, this is, this is the first paragraph generated for that.  Jack sat hunched over his computer, fingers flying across the grimy keys like  deranged spiders.  I like that.  I like that.  Yeah, that's good.  Uh, the glow of the screen cast a sickly pallor cliche on his gaunt face, double  cliche highlighting the shadows between his eyes.  You've got a hat trick.  His apartment was a squalid den of decay, a mausoleum to forgotten dreams and lost  hopes, tangled wires and discarded cliche.  He's tangled wires and discarded tech littered the floor while mold crept up  the wall like black veins.  That's not bad.  I don't, I, that's, but yeah, quite a few little cliche phrases in there.  Yeah.  Come on.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  And I wish you would use chat to you to write his books is, uh, his most recent  book in 2018 called Bob honey, who just does stuff was called by the guardian  repellent and stupid.  And the New York times said that it called it a book shaped object.  He should be using

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nicholas cage.  Sean Penn.  Oh, Sean Penn.  I knew it was a bad.  Awful.  Okay.  Sean Penn writing novels.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  It's a book shaped, terrible book shaped object.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Beautiful.  That's beautiful.  Oh God.  I wish I wish I'd thought of that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Repellent and stupid on so many levels says the guardian

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  his face.  The where the Brits

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  now I want to read it.  I mean, you, there is such a thing is so bad that it's fun.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Who does the audio book?  He reads it.  That's a winner.  Uh huh.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Should I play a little bit from audible of this?  Oh, please do.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe we'll, maybe we'll, we'll stumble upon a good  paragraph.  It'll be as good as an Elon Musk Twitter space.  Okay.  Bob honey.  Shouldn't be too hard to find a book named Bob honey who doesn't do.  Oh, just do stuff.  It's not on audible, but maybe the sequel, Bob honey sings, Jimmy  crack corn is what, uh, this was a earlier, uh, attempt by Sean Penn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's, let's listen to the search of the retirement home on the night of  spurly Colty A's demise and found Bob's bed magnificently made with tucks and  folds that had bring a Marine Corps drill instructor to drool and delight  atop its trampoline type duvet, an envelope fat with cash addressed to the  local ASPCA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I think an AI could have written that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Fat with cash.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Chris, let me try some idea out on you.  The, the, if I had a machine, I've said this in the show before, but if I had a  machine that had, had, had tracked all of the relationships of these, of these  unbelievable number of words, come up with trillion, three trillion tokens, I'd  want to query that database to see about, about our biases and connections and the  predictions it's not about creating more of the same.  It's about what have we already produced and what, what does it tell us?  Is there anything going on in that vein?

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Well, you know, like one of the things that I like to think about, um, is just  negative space as a, as a sort of concept to allow you to sort of understand that  what lives in the, in the positive space.  And this is something that Alan Watts has talked about with a grid of words.  You imagine sort of, um, graph paper with lots of dots and it goes on for miles and  miles and each of those dots is a word.  It's a, it's a concept.  It's something that humans know, but all the negative space, all the non dot area  also are filled with concepts.  They just don't have labels that humans have, you know, engineer developed.  Right.  So to, to, to what you're talking about, there probably is a lot of great wisdom  found in these hallucinations that people are so shut up afraid of because they're  creating adjacencies that are unexpected, that are oblique and I feel like you  should write precisely, right?  Cause everything else has sort of been done right.  And it's following like these cliches that you mentioned at one time were not  cliches, you know, like trending topics and hashtags on Twitter at one point did  not exist.  There weren't these words smushed together into a new concept that is identifying  something in human experience.  And so that aspect of generativity, I think absolutely could be something that  could be developed.  I haven't seen anything specifically along those lines.  However, I am starting to see people kind of mashed together either different  prompts or to, you know, like, like even Adobe with what they're doing with  Firefly, I started to put out products that will allow you to do different types  of in-painting or scene changing.  Or, you know, for example, there's like, you know, this object, I want to replace  it with some other object in the space.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Adobe just released a Photoshop brush to do exactly that.  Exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Have you seen Drag Your Gan?

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Firefly.  Oh, it's so good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's Drag Your Gan?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Go to line 61, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But before we do that, how about a little palette cleanser, some Sean Penn  reading from Bob Honey, who just do stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The America Bob drove from Woodview, New Orleans was not that one of lore, not  the one he'd known in his earliest cross continental automotive excursions, not  the one of pay later gas stations, vintage diners and Tulane roads.  Only trains remained a spirit refuge to modernity's craven Trumpery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whoa.  Oh my.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Whoa.  Whoa.  Low ball.  I think that's a sentence no one's ever written before.  I mean, I don't think it's a cliché.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We could say that much.  No, it's not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What line 79 you said?  Let's go to line 61.  Pretty amazing.  Oh, Farhad, you ain't seen nothing yet.  OK, this is a drag your gan.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Farhad was worried about photoshopping.  Now it's going to be so easy.  Everybody's going to fake everything.  We want to know what's real.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Interactive point based manipulation on the generative image manifold.  This is from the Max Planck Institute.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Comes up with like the subjects for these things.  They're completely inscrutable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is a presentation at SIGGRAPH this year.  So what am I?  You go down, there's videos.  Oh, there's video.  Should I watch this one?  The video.  Main demo.  It's wild.  Accelerated.  I don't know if there's audio, but I'll play it.  OK, let's see.  Here we go.  OK, they're taking a dog and they're stretching it.  The mouth is amazing.  They could just change things and make things smile.  Well, and it presumes that the dog sit down.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  It knows where the teeth are.  Right.  Yeah.  So it basically takes a two dimensional image and then you find  a point in that image of some significant, you know, sort of like  keep what is it key points or in video where you keep a key frame.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  So you're doing more or less the same thing, but with a three, two  dimensional image and you're what you would use to do is sort of like,  like stretch.  You remember I'm going to date myself like Kai's power goo or whatever.  Kai's power goo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Except that didn't, that just smeared stuff.  It was like finger painting.  That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  So imagine, you know, 20, 30 years forward now, instead of just  smearing it, you know, and dragging the pixels.  Now you actually change the content of the image based on its understanding  of the subject of the.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  In that example, just now there was a picture of a woman with her mouth  closed and it like made her a smile and it produced teeth for her.  It's probably not her teeth, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It doesn't know what her teeth look like.  It's some a GAN teeth.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Now the question is, could this be copyrightable and what are you even  copywriting?  Right.  Exactly.  Right.  Like, like this is where that Supreme court case is sort of like, like  you did this in Warhol and sort of go between 15 different iterations.  And none of it's even worth copywriting because it's sort of already in the model.  Imagine Warhol with this tool.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you could do it in Jackie Onassis.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  The Warhol version of the Prince photo was many versions.  That's true.  Yes, that's true.  That's right.  Mm hmm.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  Uh, okay.  So is drag again?  Uh, I mean, obviously it's a, it's in the lab.  Uh, will they release this at any point?  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Or if the paper's out there, these techniques become, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, two main components featuring, uh, one, a feature based motion  supervision that drives the handle point to move towards the target position.  And two, a new point tracking approach that leverages.  And this is the key, the discriminative GAN features, generative  adversarial network to keep.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And that sounds like something that might kill you.  They keep localizing the position.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  That's the technology behind deep fakes.  Yeah.  Sean Penn's next novel.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.  So again, is not the same as a large language model.  These are two different ways to take data and create something, uh, some AI.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, capability, but you could imagine, stay with us for a minute, Leo.  You can imagine, um, a language model writing something and then it provides sliders.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  Just 10% more than 5% less than that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Microsoft talked about that, uh, actually, uh, at, uh, build this week.  They already have something sort of like that.  So does Google Bard.  Remember the bar demonstration at Google IO where you decided to take the  complaint letter and make it nasty.  Microsoft sort of has that now in Bing chat, you can have choose different  styles, but they really, uh, at the keynote described the fact that it could be a  slider, that you could have an infinite scale and you could turn it up and down  until you got something you liked.  Um, that's probably the thing that's really interesting about this conversation

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  too, right.  Is the thing about it from the flip side of the reverse, right?  Like we're sort of talking about this from the authorship perspective,  someone who's writing something, but actually, especially with, you know,  Facebook has, uh, or Meta released something this week, um, with their,  their translation services, thousands languages.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Many languages that actually don't have a lot of recorded examples, uh, you  know, to, to, um, to train on now, imagine this from the receivers end.  I think this is one of the things that's again, hard, like we, we kind of exist.  Again, those of us on this, on this podcast kind of are in the positive space.  You know, we, we see kind of, you know, interactions that we use computers in  certain ways, but there's a lot of people who don't have access to computers who  don't speak the language that computers are written, you know, in, or the  interface is written in.  What some of this allows software to do is to adapt to the user and to the  user's needs or preferences in a way that previously used to be very, very difficult.  Now, one of the things that you guys had talked about earlier was about how,  you know, Microsoft and maybe windows, windows 12 or something is going to have  kind of AI built in and it's going to be part of the experience.  But one of the things that I think is actually going to hold back windows in  particular, um, compared to the Mac and especially I believe on Linux, although  I don't know this, I'm completely ignorant about this on Linux is the degree to  which Apple has invested in assistive technologies over the years.  In other words, you can turn on, uh, voice controls where the, you know, Siri  essentially will tell you how you're interacting with a computer.  Um, there are ways where you can use assistive touch and things like that,  both on your iPhone or your Mac, all of those things that allows computers to  become more accessible to more people are the very same tools and scaffolding  and structures that AI will be able to use to then manipulate your environment.  So for example, there's a product called rewind.ai and what they do is they  record everything that goes on your screen.  And the idea is to augment your memory by seeing everything that you have seen  with your eyes and capturing video recordings of those things.  Now, if they're also able to inventory and index all of the interfaces and  buttons that appear on the screen, then they can see the actions that you could  have or would have taken, and then the AI can learn to take the actions that you  might have taken.  So there's a lot of this that exists in browser automation and tools like that.  But if you're able to just use common language to tell the computer what you  wanted to do, and it observes you doing it for one or two times, and then can  emulate what you've done.  Now you're opening up again, accessibility to a whole new range of, of,  of applications and use cases.  So I don't know again, how much Microsoft has invested in accessibility of its  platform.  I don't know how much Linux has either, but I know this is something that Apple  has taken pride in and has done a lot of the instrumentation for years.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Microsoft is arguably a head of Apple in accessibility.  They've really put a lot of energy and effort into it.  I don't know if it will benefit them in the same way, because I don't know if it's  with the same kind of point of view, but they have, you know, I've met their  accessibility ombudsman and many of their ads feature accessibility.  They made a place, a controller for their Xbox for people with mobility issues,  things like that.  They're very good at that.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  That's amazing.  Yeah.  So as long as that exists, I think, you know,  yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Um, Meta did something interesting to make this, uh, I thought, uh, it turns  out that there are many recordings of the Bible.  Uh, so they trained on two new data sets, one that contains audio recordings of  the new Testament, and then the corresponding text in 1,107 languages.  Hmm.  Another contained unlabeled new Testament audio recordings of 3,809 languages.  They then matched it up because that's one of the ways you train is match  the text to the speech, uh, and they were able to create a model that can not  only speak, uh, a thousand languages, but recognize more than 4,000.  There are only, I should point out only 7,000 languages it's estimated in the  world, so that's a pretty good subset of, uh, of the world's languages.  Pretty, uh, impressive.  Remarkable.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let me check.  Let me check and see if Ron's still talking.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  No, you want to hear some crazy Leo?  Yeah.  So there, there are approximately a thousand languages.  Um, probably around 100 of them are in Oaxaca alone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I do know that you mentioned that when we were there.  Yeah.  Uh, there are a lot of native languages and the native languages, uh, you  know, varied, uh, over time, quite a bit.  I guess because they lived in S and S and separated enclaves.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  There, there's 65 or so, uh, recognized Zapotec languages just among  the Zapotec ethnic group.  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Are those like dialects or those actual languages?

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Actual languages.  So, so Zapotec is a language family.  And so there are, there are many types of Zapotec that are totally  unintelligible to other Zapotec speakers.  Wow.  Wow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, as, as, uh, Umberto Eco once said, a dialect is a language without  a normie and Navy.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's good.  I like that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, you mentioned the Adobe, we were talking about their generator, their AI  image generator firefly.  It is now, or is going to be in Photoshop in the second half of 2023.  And it will do some pretty amazing things.  Here's some of the examples that Adobe offers, uh, for what it can do.  I mean, this isn't a GAN stretching, but it's, you know, it's getting there.  Adding a car, a car shaped cloud and a reflective, uh, bottle of water.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I literally use this, uh, I believe yesterday.  Uh, so some of the work that I do currently is, is helping  makers launch on product hunt.  And that occasionally involves getting into keynote or some other, you know,  slide tool to basically produce their gallery.  Um, and one of the, the, the makers that I was working with needed an image, um,  depicting essentially a phone being dropped or lost.  And so I went into, I first went to unsplash where, fortunately, the  images are public domain.  I grabbed that.  I uploaded it to firefly and I was able to replace a beer can, which was for some  reason, dropping in water with an iPhone by selecting the beer can and saying,  and it worked and it like literally took like 30 seconds.  So stuff is real and it's super helpful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Incredible.  When I read this, this morning, I went to see if my, uh, Adobe photography  subscription, which I thought included for $10 a month, Lightroom and Photoshop  still included Photoshop.  It didn't.  He took Photoshop out.  So I canceled it.  Um, yeah, this is pretty impressive.  Firefly.  I can't remember where fireflies, uh, models come from is I don't know who is it.  I don't know who it is.  That's a great question.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  When it's, yeah, I would think that Adobe would want to run and produce their own.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think they acquired something.  No, no, I don't know.  I don't know.  Um, we should talk about the tw- the Pentagon explosion.  Uh, speaking of Photoshop and Twitter, right?  And yeah, it's true.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  And blue, blue checks.  Yeah, this is all of it.  We're bringing it all home.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's all coming home.  The final story, we'll all bring it all home.  Um, so the issue was this is a fake photo.  It's not clear whether it was generated by AI or just Photoshop.  It doesn't really matter.  Although most of the news stories I saw blamed AI for this.  Uh, and really it's the narrative.  Folk devil of now.  The tech folk devil.  Um, stock market, when this was tweeted by a phony blue checked account called  Bloomberg feed, not Bloomberg, uh, the stock market tumbled, it recovered  pretty quickly, I might add, um, in every case where it was tweeted or retweeted,  it would credited Twitter sources.  Which should just be like some poop emoji.  It's gotta be true.  Within an hour of it being circulated, government officials stepped in to  clarify the tweets were not true.  The Arlington fire and EMS tweeted, there is no explosion or incident taking  place at or near the Pentagon.  So don't believe it.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Blue check accounts that said that because I mean, can you really trust them?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If not, dozens of verified accounts on Twitter with large  followings spread this photograph.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But so who's to blame here?  It was, but it was in what I first saw about it.  The story I saw was fake photo about it up.  Right.  It was known that it was fake.  True.  Yeah.  But it's like you got to be a Bellingcat Bellingcat.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Thank God for Bellingcat.  Uh, Nick Waters tweeted.  There are a few signs of making an AI image.  The, including that the fence melds into the crown crowd barriers.  Yeah.  There's this, this is kind of AI looking here.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And must hate spelling cat.  And so we'll never learn that on Twitter.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah.  Um, so maybe it is, maybe it is, I mean, what does it matter if it's a Photoshop  or AI generated, you certainly could do it with Photoshop.  It doesn't matter.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It would be crushing hearings if it's AI generated.  Yeah.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  That that's a difference.  So there was another story that the, uh, you know, that the, the U hall that  crashed into a gate near the white house, uh, there were a bunch of, uh, uh, blue  checked, uh, you know, Twitter blue accounts that said that it was a FBI  Psyop spreading that sort of, so the Twitter, so, so quote unquote verified  accounts on Twitter are becoming a major source of, uh, disinformation.  And so we have this reflex to sort of give credence to anything with a blue  check, even though we know that now nowadays you just, you just pay for it.  So this, this is one of the.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, but look at the headline in the New York times.  Now this, this is the headline, but Andrew, and so I'm not going to blame it's  the story author, Andrew Ross Sorkin, but an AI generated spoof rattles the markets.  That's not the lead that it's AI generated.  That's not the story.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  It's really the story is Twitter.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  An archive photo.  They could have taken a nine 11 photo and put it up there.  People would have been fooled for, for 10 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It may have been the first time an AI generated image moved the  market, according to Bloomberg.  It's not about the AI.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  It's about Twitter.  We just didn't know that the other ones were AI.  Yeah, right.  For, um, Jeff, what do you think about like the, the way in which the, the  coverage, not in this New York times article, apparently, but when people are  talking about verified accounts on Twitter, it feels like that language  now is misleading, right?  Always sort of like subscribers to Twitter blue subscribers.  Like, and the language of verification gives them too much credence.  And the fact that the media is seems to have not cut up to the fact that there  is no real verification, except that someone has a credit card number.  Like subscribers.  Right.  Exactly.  Okay.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've been trying to get the, since I'm at the master before the master of the  hashtag, um, you know, one of the great frustrations life is you try to get one  to take on and of course it doesn't cause you can't do it.  Um, so the one I wanted was eight bucks.  Schmuck.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  You can keep vlogging it and maybe, maybe it'll, it'll  actually be hashtag.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hashtag eight bucks.  Schmuck.  Now you got something.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, here's, here's a quick story.  So, so when the debt ceiling fights of years ago, I, uh, said, uh, and it was, I  got angry, I had too much wine and I got angry at Washington general.  And I just said, Oh, F you Washington, but spelling it out.  Um, uh, you know, you can track together and just get this over with.  I'm sick of it.  Of course I was wrong to blame all the Washington.  It was one party, but we'll stipulate a sentiment.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I didn't, you were expressing, you were speaking for the people.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I said it, and then somebody said, you idiot.  That's a hashtag.  I said, of course it is.  Of course it is.  So F you Washington spelled out became a hashtag.  I ended up on CBS news with it.  It became, became huge.  It was also the first Reuters did research.  It was the first reference with occupy wall street and F you Washington.  It was the first use of occupy wall street in a tweet.  Wow.  My little bit of, of infamy there, uh, since I met before the God of the hashtag.  Here we go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  You know, reactions now coming in, uh, to, to the failed, uh, spaces, uh, launch of  a, uh, uh, Ron, uh, DeSantis is, um, uh, presidential campaign, Daniel  Jalcutt, our good friend, uh, on Mastodon.  The last two things, Elon Musk tried to launch blew up in about 30 seconds.  A lot of jokes, a lot of those.  Thank you very much.  Twitter spaces, total landscaping from Andrew Fowler on blue sky.  That's good.  And also on blue sky in space.  No one can hear you launch a presidential campaign.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He droned on for an hour.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  An hour.  Yeah.  I don't think he's got his finger on the pulse of America.  God, I hope he doesn't.  Anyway, let's take a little break.  We've got more, uh, we'll wrap it up pretty quick.  Actually, we've got your picks of the week.  We don't want to keep Chris here too long because we want him to come back.  Don't want them to hate it.  Our show today brought to you by my email client.  Now for a long time, I've said, if you really care about email, why are you using  a free service for your email?  Free service means you are the product, not the customer.  Uh, and so many businesses and I, you know, I used on the radio show, got calls  from people all the time saying, you know, my, my, in fact, my, my son, just  the other day said, I can't get any email and I can't get written anybody to get  more space on my Gmail.  I said, son, you haven't been listening to your father, listen to your father.  If you care about email, you need to pay for a service.  And frankly, you need to pay for the best service.  Fast mail.  I've been using fast mail for more than a decade.  This is email from people who care about your privacy.  Who people who care about email to the point where many, they're a leader in  email, they, they launched many, uh, initiatives and internet standards, uh,  with, with fast mail, I get DKIM and, uh, and all of the authentication protocols  on any domain I choose, I could bring my domains to fast mail.  I have so many email addresses now.  Uh, email from fast mail is great.  You have a web mail interface if you wish, but it's real IMAP.  So you can use any client with it.  You also can use their, uh, in fact, I've given up on iOS and Android clients.  I just use the fast mail mobile client, which is fantastic.  Quick settings from the quick settings menu.  You can choose a new theme.  You can switch between light and dark or as Jeff likes to do it,  you could switch to light.  You could change your text size without leaving the fast mail screen.  So if you're like me old and have a hard time reading tiny print, you  can make it bigger quickly.  Quick settings is great.  You also can do something I think really important with Bitwarden or one password.  You can generate a new masked email address, which is fantastic.  So that it's not only are you creating a password unique to every site or  application, you can create an email address unique to every site or application.  It integrates with Bitwarden and one password.  So that's a kind of double security.  You can, uh, with the fast mail app, send snooze.  You've got folders and labels.  So if you like Gmail's label style, you can do that.  If you like folders, you can do that.  You can do both really fast search for 20 years.  Fast mail has been a leader in email privacy.  I've been using them for more than 10 years.  Replace Gmail with fast mail.  Great spam filtering.  You have complete control over it too.  You can write, I have a very elaborate spam sieve, um, script that really is  effective, but they also have default settings that works so well at fast mail.  Your data stays with you for better productivity features and as little as  $3 a month, you pay for free email with your privacy, isn't it worth $3 a month  to protect yourself?  No ads, no, no spam.  It's just the right way to go.  You can download your old data, import it into your new fast mail inbox, or  continue to get mail from your old address so you don't miss a message.  Fast mail is moving email forward with new internet standards and open source  innovations that power many email services.  Not just their own.  Don't get left behind by substandard email providers and don't, don't run your  business on a free email provider.  It's worth the money for fast mail.  I have my custom domains.  They're all hosted by fast mail and all my email goes there.  Reclaim your privacy, boost productivity with fast mail.  You try it free right now for 30 days.  Fastmail.com slash twit.  Fast mail is the best.  You ask the experts, they'll all tell you that.  Fastmail.com slash twit.  They use it in case you're interested in the open source Cyrus server.  They've contributed back to that project many, many times.  It's a very good IMAP server.  It really does the job.  Fastmail.com slash twit.  Thank you fast mail for being my email service, for doing such a great job for  me for all these years.  I'm glad we could finally get them as an advertiser.  We appreciate your support for twig.  You support twig too when you use that address.  You let them know you saw it here, right?  Fastmail.com slash twit.  T W I T enough.  And put taking the day off.  He'll be back next week.  I'm hoping Stacey will be back next week.  I think she had to do something right.  But we're so glad we could get Mike Elgin joining us gastronomad.net.  That's a that's where he hangs his hat these days.  And of course, Elgin.com is sub stack and he's on the mastodon at Mac Elgin.  And he is in Italy for gastronomad experience.  The Prosecco experience.  Oh, is this, is this the Veneto right there?  That's it.  Beautiful.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  That's it.  I'm probably a, probably a quarter of a mile from that very spot.  What did you have for dinner tonight?  Mike?  Prosecco.  Uh, pizza, pizza, pizza and salad.  Yes.  Yeah.  There's a lot of good, really amazing food.  The Phoenician food is really something.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, they go to Morocco next El Salvador.  Oh, that'll be fun.  That's right.  You're as

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  El Salvador is a brand new one.  We just, that's right.  Amira was born in El Salvador and she knows a lot of people.  We've been there probably 30, 40 times in the last few years.  And it's a really cool country.  That's a lot safer now than it used to be.  And so now, um, we're planning this experience and it is going to be amazing.  And that's in January.  So if you, if you live in Maine or new England or something like that, and don't  want to freeze your honey off, it'll be, it'll be in the mid high seventies in  January and El Salvador.  Oh, nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nice.  Yeah.  Gastronomad.net.  I just, we went on the Oaxaca experience for the day of the dead last year and it  was incredible.  Just, just so much fun.  Mind boggling.  Actually not last year.  It's 2022, 2021.  That's right.  Right.  That's right.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Holy cow.  A couple year, year and a half ago.  Yeah.  Like that.  That was a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Time flies.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, also with us, uh, the wonderful Chris Messina, the creator of the most important  feature on Twitter, the hashtag, which is now migrated everywhere.  I do blame you though, for every time I travel now, people are all those Instagram  influencers are out there, hashtagging their food, their pictures, their hashtag  lavender fields.  Sigh.  When you see, when you see young people say hashtag amazing, do you, what do you  like, oh yeah, I thought of that.  I thought that up.  That was me.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Sometimes, you know, it's, it's so, it's such a weird thing to, you know, have  contributed something that becomes part of the culture such that people don't  even have the concept that there was a time where the thing didn't exist.  You know, it's sort of like inventing like the, the, the dollar sign or something.  You know, what was your reaction watching Black Lives Matter happen?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oof.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Um,  Oh yeah.  Hashtag BLM.  That's right.  Yeah.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I mean that me too, you know, Arabs too, you know, hashtag me too.  Holy cow.  There's, there's a, there's an element of like just like humbleness to it.  Right.  And the reason why I got into working on the social web was because I wanted more  people to be able to contribute their voices and to join the conversation.  And the hashtag was a method by which, you know, people could do that, uh, with,  you know, like what was becoming a new network.  So I think there's, there's some amount of pride, there's some amount of  trepidation, there's some amount of kind of just awe that it's possible, you know,  especially depending on when you join these platforms and when you get involved  with them to really shape the outcomes and shape how they, they turn out.  So I think, you know, for, for it, it's taken kind of a long time, I think, for  me to get into the right, maybe like mental space about what it means to have  contributed something like the hashtag to the internet and to culture, but to me,  it also presents an opportunity to tell young people about what it means to  contribute and build these places into the spaces that they actually want to be  in and they want other people to have a good time.  Um, and it's, it doesn't just happen to you, you know, moderation on these  platforms doesn't just kind of, you know, it shouldn't be assumed that the way in  which these things are has to be the way in which they persist.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And the responsibility we all have.  Yes.  But you know, when we encourage a fight, we're making, we're making the internet.  Yeah.  And we're recommending good stuff.  We're making the internet.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah.  Where, where we put our attention is, you know, where that oftentimes gets fed back  to us and it's more and more important, especially now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I can't thank you enough for what you've done.  We were really glad to have you on.  Uh, this is, uh, at the end of the show, we like to give people a chance to, you  know, mention picks or things they want.  You spend many hours a day picking things on product on, is there anything you  would like to pick here on the show?

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Wow.  Um, let's see, you know, I mean, like I do.  End up hunting a lot of things.  Um, actually, you know, here, I'll give you this one.  Um, I don't know when this is, this is going to come out, but, um, I can't, I  can't say specifically what it is, but, uh, there is a web browser that I now use.  It is called arc.  I use arc.  It's made by the browser, the browser company of New York, and they have a  big launch coming up tomorrow.  Um, you should watch my product on account.  Um, you will discover the thing that they're launching.  Um, it's very cool.  And as far as, um, let's just say the, the read, write web, uh, that, you know,  w it was something that Richard McManus of course was writing about for many  years, that idea, I think is coming to roost in a very real and important way.  And so, um, just, you know, it starts a new conversation about what the web is  and what level of control people can have over their internet experience.  So watch for that tomorrow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I will as an arc user.  We got an inside.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Browse.  It's from the browser co.  So go to a browser.  Well, I guess you can go to arc.net is probably the easiest.  You can go to arc.net.  Yeah.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Now I believe it's still invite only, but nonetheless, get yourself on the list.  Um, they're probably, you know, they want to open it up soon.  They've been working on the windows version, which is pretty interesting.  I mean, just everything that they're doing is super, um, you know, creative  and seeing a web browser come out of the East coast, you know, as much as, you  know, you think it's a global internet in New York has different ideas about  media and about content.  It is also interesting that, um, my friend, Mike Krieger, who was one of the  co-founders of Instagram, um, and is now of course working on, um, artifact,  which is sort of a tick tock for news, if you will, is on the board of arc.  And so he's bringing a lot of his ideas into, um, arc.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I like, I use artifact as well.  We've talked about it.  Very interesting.  Um, all right.  I don't know if I have any invites.  I don't think I do.  So I just will, and I'm sure you don't.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  So there is, I will say, you know, since we're talking about arc, there is a  Reddit, a sub sub Reddit that I, um, an admin of it's at our slash arc browser.  And every month there is a mega invite thread.  And so for folks who want to get an invite, that might be a place where  you could solicit some right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mac only, but, uh, windows coming as you said soon and watch for an announcement  on privacy tomorrow.  Oh yeah.  I was tomorrow.  That's right.  Uh, I just wanted to mention, we didn't put it in the, uh, we didn't do the  Google change log, but, uh, I did want to point out that Bard is now putting  images in the search.  So I asked Bard, what are some must see sites in the Veneto region of Italy?  Mike, see how accurate this is obviously Venice.  And there's like a map from Wikipedia of Venice, Verona known for the Roman  theater, the arena of Verona and Romeo and Juliet was set in Verona.  That's right.  The homes of Shakespeare's Juliet Capulet Lake is Lago di Garda close.  I didn't realize I've been to Garda.  I love Garda.  Uh, we have friends who have a house there, the Dolomites.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  And there are many Dolomites is unbelievable.  Okay.  So far, Bard's got it right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Palladian villas, villas designed by Andrea Palladio.  Uh, those are just a few of the many, many must see sites, but notice the  images now in a Bard, that's pretty cool.  That's right.  Yep.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  The, the, the thing we do, of course, I mean, we, the, the architecture  and the nature is amazing, but as you know, Leo, we love the food culture,  the wine culture, and this is one of the greatest wine regions in the world.  It's known for Prosecco of course.  And, you know, uh, Americans know one or two types of Prosecco.  There are, there are many dozens of types of Prosecco.  It's an incredibly rich, diverse, uh, wine variety.  And then there's a hundred other varieties.  There's a famous guy who, who, uh, who hybridized a great varieties, uh, uh,  decades ago, uh, Moscone and, and basically there's all these wine varieties  and nobody's ever heard of, uh, that are amazing, but w but we have these  really great friends here who are wine makers, food producers, cheese makers,  all this kind of stuff.  We're just geniuses and they quietly apply their craft and we, and they  teach us all about it.  So it's just, it's just an amazing food and wine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I followed up.  I said, how about the wines?  And it knew I was still talking about Veneto.  It said Valpolicella.  Okay.  We know that one.  Classico, Suave, Prosecco.  Well, we know about that, but it doesn't find any of the lesser known ones.  So I think you're just going to have to go there with Mike and  Amira and find out for yourself.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  The world here's a little bit of trivia.  The world's first wine critic was Pliny the Elder.  Uh, and, uh, you know, 2000 years ago.  And one of his favorite wines was what we now call Prosecco.  It wasn't sparkling back then.  It was a still white wine and many styles of Prosecco are still actually, but it's  with the great variety that then was called Prosecco that's now called Glera.  And he was a huge fan.  So they, it was even during the Roman empire, they were drinking Prosecco.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mike, you have some tools to fix news as your pick.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  I do in fact, and these, I don't necessarily recommend these, like  as to go and use these tools as your source of news, but I think it's  interesting to see what, uh, what people are coming up with to fix what they  think is broken about news.  For example, uh, news is too stressful.  News is too sensational.  News is too time consuming.  So there's a, uh, a, uh, an app called OneSub.  So you can find it at onesub.io, which is an app that basically, I'm sorry,  this might, this is a website.  This is a website that gives you the news that's actionable.  That's it's on the positive side.  It's, it's kind of like, it's designed to let you be informed without being  freaked out about the state of the world, which I think is nice.  Uh, there's another site called boringreport.org.  This is hilarious.  This is an app.  The, the, the icon for this app, the, the logo for this app is somebody yawning.  Or boring news.  Just what I need.  Rip out, they use AI to, yeah, they strip out the sensational  journalism using AI.  Oh, that's clever.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, cause I hate the linkbait crap, man.  I just get mad.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  And you can see their example there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's pretty, pretty, alien invasion, imminent earth, doomed to  destruction, turns it into experts discuss possibility of extraterrestrial  life and potential impact on earth.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Boring.  And then there's another one that hyper summarizes the news, uh, called web.  Well, it's it, you can find it at web.concise.app.  And what this does is it strips down the news to its bare essence and it gives you  this bullet point of the different, uh, aspects of the, of a news story.  So it'll take a tech crunch article, for example, and it'll give you three bullet  points, uh, that give you the main points of that article.  And so anyway, I, again, I don't, I don't recommend necessarily that the, uh,  brilliant, uh, news consumer who, who, who listens and watches this, this podcast,  uh, you know, rely on any of these, but they should check them out to see what  people are thinking about in terms of news.  I personally am a big fan of a site called allsides.com.  And I don't know if you've ever talked about it on this show, but allsides.com  is a fantastic resource that takes every news source.  I think they, they, in their database, they have a thousand and something new  sources and they have a crowd sourced a rating about whether they're extreme  left, moderately left in the center, moderately right or extreme right.  And then they, they, they, they fold this against how the degree to which they  fact check the content that they produce.  And so you can really explore your news sources.  And I think this is the biggest problem with news.  People just, uh, people just take whatever news that comes to them over  the social networks, which is a terrible way to consume news.  You should be aware of the credibility and the lean, the bias or leaning of,  of every news, uh, source that you consume.  And, uh, allsides.com is a, is a great place to start thinking about that.  And you can also contribute, uh, your input about whether, you know, is  CNN extreme laughter, is it like slightly left of center or whatever?  You can, you can, uh, you can put in your two cents about that.  But anyway, these three, these three, all sides has been around forever.  These three, uh, uh, sites that I'm talking about, I think have emerged  in the last week, so they're, they're all very new.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  You know, one thing, um, it's funny, uh, for one sub, I actually worked with, uh,  Jim on his launch on product hunt.  So fantastic.  Seeing that around.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have subscribed to one sub now, and now I get to choose, uh, some of the  people I want to follow, I guess.  People most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not Elon Musk, please.  No, Nikki Haley, but maybe Jimmy Al Sharpton, maybe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And all sides, I think it's great.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  The, uh, the summarization feature in artifact.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, no, I didn't know it had a summarization feature.  It's, it's quite good.  Oh, um, you need to tell them to make that more obvious.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  It's so they're doing a lot of changes and updates.  Um, they've been adding a lot more.  You can now follow authors, which is kind of interesting.  Um, you can also leave comments and the comments actually are so far positive,  but there's a little sparkly icon, I believe, when you go to a specific story.  Oh yeah, I see it.  You press that.  It'll say, oh, that's new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Oh, it's really good.  And especially, you know, they don't, from what I can tell, they don't seem to strip  out the ads because they want to be very publisher friendly.  And these are the founders of Instagram, of course.  And so they want to support that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, it's a, on the phone down here.  Um, just telling our TD pick up my over the shoulder.  There it is.  There it is.  So I did the summary of this verge article and there is the summary up at the top.  That's so pops up at the top and it's great because you can avoid all of the ads

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  and all the other kind of like, and now actually in the latest version, they have  the ability to report clickbait articles.  They literally call it that.  Oh, good.  Cause it's a really bad.  So great about that.  That's I love seeing that.  Yes.  So if they sort of, you know, realign incentives so that the click bait, like one  reporting click bait is useful and good because there's so much stuff out there  that's just like, Oh, this thing was set on Twitter and the whole thing is a tweet  and it's just like content around it.  Second, you know, you can add the reader mode.  So that cuts out a lot of the other garbage and stuff that pops up all the time.  And you can use summarization and so you can quickly get the gist of an article  and decide if you really want to dive in.  So it's, it's becoming a pretty regular staple for me in terms of my news  consumption.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Awkward silence.  Ron DeSantis bold Twitter gambit that flopped.  The Florida governor wanted to show off his tech savvy by announcing his  presidential campaign on Twitter.  It quickly devolved into the conference call from hell.  Yeah.  That was the time summary.  Actually, that was good.  Conference call from hell.  And this is a concise, which is doing somewhat the same thing.  Just paring down the articles using AI.  We're going to see more and more of this.  And I love the idea of an AI agent that knows what I'm interested in, kind of  like a Google alerts or the old tracking on Twitter that can generate for me  something of value.  Ultimately, I'd love AI to do our whole show run down.  So I just show up and I say, Hey, here's what AI chose for us today.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, so I guess the democracy and the rest of us don't.  I get it.  Jeff Jarvis.  What's your pick of the week this week?  Well, so God bless the internet archive.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Scanned in USC's optical sound effects library.  So this little thing for audio here, if you go down on the left, about 10 down,  you'll see a crowd applause.  Oh, that's what this is.  We want to be able to have power to use this after I give us a little.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was thinking we could instead, we could use liquid and mud.  Oh, that's.  That was a.  That's an explosion.  So these are real to real tapes.  Oh, how about a how about a fight?  This this might be good for moral panic.  Yeah.  Oh, these are pretty these are pretty old.  Yeah, they are.  These are not well recorded.  You can hear all the noise and hiss.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  You do like a 70s like movie, though.  It would be so fun.  Totally.  Intern, you know, you know.  Yeah, totally.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How about bells, horns and whistles?  So this is a whole box and these are the different tapes in the box.  This is hysterical.  Let's see.  Department store chimes.  Oh, yeah, there you go.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah, when department stores existed.  Exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And when they had chimes.  Only Leo and I are old enough to remember that.  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hosiery on floor five.  All right.  This is fun.  Look at this.  And they are like the picture.  Yeah, Jammer B.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think we all should have our soundboards out of this.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's some animal sounds.  This is thanks to the Internet Archive for.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Pig snorting.  We got to have some pig story.  All right.  Let's get some Apple users.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That had a slate on it.  Some farmer.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Is that from the Twitter space?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow.  The SSE USC optical sound effects library from the Sunset editorial collection.  Oh, it's from the USC cinema department.  So you're right.  These were old movies.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The company was active from 64 to 87.  They did episodic TV shows like Bewitched and I Dream of Gene.  Oh my gosh.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  569 credits and IMDB.  That's a great find.  Thank you.  Anything else you want to plug?  No, that's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's enough.  Then let's go home.  Plug, plug.  Of course.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The book is called the Gutenberg parenthesis and the website is a Gutenberg  parenthesis.com that's where you can go and order at least it was ordering and  she wanted to know where to order it from.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's up to you?  Uh, the Boomsbury has 10% off.  Blackwell is like white, like out of London, but they, they shipped to  America with, um, even more higher percentage on one of them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis more money than others.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, it's, I don't make any stuff, but it's fine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's what I told her.  I said order from Blackwell's cause it's an independent bookstore in the UK.  And we want to, and look, you save $3.  So free shipping and free shipping.  That's nice.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Free shipping from the UK.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's actually the, what, what's it's great thing, Chris, cause there are books  that are only in the UK and I can only get there.  That's how I discovered them.  So they will ship from there, but they also sell American books.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Got it.  Got it.  Nice.  Uh, or you can spend 27 bucks and get it on Amazon for crying.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you get the price guarantee that whenever they decide what it is,

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  is there anything about the hashtag in this book?  Do I need to get this book and assigned?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Did Gutenberg have hashtags?  Absolutely.  There is.  Wait a minute.  What?  I don't know if the index has  index.  You need an AI generated index.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If it's not in there.  No, it's not in there.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Chris, you'll, you'll appreciate this.  Speaking of hashtags all throughout Europe, people who speak languages other  than English is their main language.  Is it a pound tag?  Um, for example, if you go to the airport in France, if, uh, an airport in  France and you park and they say, okay, to get out of the parking garage, you  have to do this four code and then do a pound sign, but they call it a hashtag.  They say press three, four, two, seven hashtag to get out.  Cause nobody knows.  Universal in Europe.  Wasn't it?  Nobody's ever heard of the pound.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wasn't that another?

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah.  The octethorpe.  Yeah.  That didn't press.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You are on page 192.  Oh my God.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Um, look at that.  Look at that.  Amazing.  Oh, it's an amazing.  Well, read it to us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What does it say?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let me know.  It was proposed in 2007 by Chris Bacina as a way to bring together groups on  Twitter, it was adopted to mark movements to create call the response conversations,  to protest, to joke, to organize, otherwise diffuse information and discussion.  Did an AI write that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hey, hey, well, when, when, when, when one thing we're sure of,  Sean Penn did not write that.  No, that's great.  I can't wait.  So, so it's not just Gutenberg.  This book is about.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's about our, the lessons we have to learn from our entry into the  age of print as we leave it.  So the first half of the book is a loving history of, of print and it's  spread and impact all the way up to computers.  And then the second half of the book is basically four essays about  lessons like creativity versus control, uh, conversation versus content.  Uh, uh, mass versus community and institutions and whether they should be updated.  Wow.  I'm looking forward to reading.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That sounds good.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Christmas.  You know, like my first jobs, by the way, was in, uh, when I was in college, I  studied in Switzerland for a semester and I actually worked at a print shop as a janitor.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Was cold type by that?  I presume.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I mean, while it was cold, it was, you know, uh, yeah, Switzerland, Switzerland.  Yeah.  But lead.  Yeah.  There was some lead type.  Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you have to sweep up little slugs and put them on July eight.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm going to appear at the museum of printing and Haverhill mass with our  friend, Glenn Fleischman.  Oh, he's done stuff there before.  I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Doug Wilson, who did the Lenin type, uh, book and Marcent Vickery, uh, who did.  Oh, nice.  I back to the books.  Yeah.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Oh, I'm looking forward to getting that.  That's going to be amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  July 8th shift happens meets Etowah and chirdlew.  That's a real word.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  That is a word shaped blob.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, you don't know.  Okay.  Well nerd time, the keyboard on the line of type was different.  And so when they wanted to just clear a line, they would go down the keys and  it would pop out of line and the keys spelled Etowah and chirdlew.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  I've always known Etowah and chirdlew as in order the most common letters in the  English language.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that was the theory that that's why they got picked in that order, but  that's not necessarily true.  The case.  Oh, that's, that's going to hurt my wordle score.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Cause that's what I'm using to figure out what I should pick in word.  You're kidding me.  ETA, OI, NSH, RDL, you are not the most frequent letters in order.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They kind of are, but there's some variation on them.  You should ask chat.  GPT.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Should I ask Bart or chat GPT?  Both.  Okay.  Let's ask chat GPT.  What are, how, what's the question?  What are in order of frequency or frequency of use of use the alphabet?  Okay.  26 letters in the English.  I got to say English, right?  Because it's going to be different.  Yes, it's true.  True.  Uh, in the English, what?  More Z and English, uh, herbs is English misspelled.  Why does it, Oh, cause it's not capitalized.  That's okay.  It'll figure it out in the English alphabet.  It'll vocabulary.  That's better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't, I'm trying to think of a word.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Actually you want to, you want to know what it is in chat GPT and your entire.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it only has its corpus to look at.  What else would it look at?  Well, here we go.  Ladies and gentlemen, according to chat GPT E T A O I N S H R D L U.  Whoa.  Should I ask Bard the same thing?  Cause I think it just confirmed what I have thought all along.  Irrespective.  You're going to have to use this at your, uh, at your talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want to point out here.  It's some good trivia.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's see what Bard says.  Bard comes up with something different.  We're in trouble.  Exactly.  E A R T I N O S H D L U.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I think, I think that the other one just, um, went with common knowledge.  Just made stuff up.  Oh, common.  No, just common knowledge.  It didn't count.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Whereas Google, Google said this list is based on analysis of letters occurring in  the words listed in the main entries of the concise Oxford dictionary.  Well, it tells you where it found it too.  That's yeah.  Let me see when, let me look at, let me look at what, uh, open AI said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it, uh, no citation.  Huh?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, now we've got a conflict and AI battle.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  I mean, AI cage matches are something I'm here for, for sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you know, Bard just pulled this from an article.  That's, that's why.  That's why.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, and which one do I trust?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The article, right?  XS PDF.com resolute.  Yeah.  That's a, it's an article, huh?  Cause it gives us, it cites it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Whereas, uh, chat, you used Eva one last time, Leo, just for the first  full time, it's gonna be so sad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's gonna be so sad.  Trackers be gone.  Uh, it says th h e I N E N T R E E R.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Well, I didn't say single letters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't, I didn't, I didn't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's just, it's dip thongs or something.  I don't know.  I don't know what it is.  Thank you, Chris, for being here.  Really appreciate it.  I hope you'll come back.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Craig, Craig wasn't pleased last time when you, when you made,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I know he sent me a nasty note about pigeons.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Yeah.  Don't get, yeah.  I think he's, doesn't he, isn't he doing pigeons on Macedon or blue sky?  Or he's doing pigeons everywhere.  He has a pigeon rescue foundation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I know.  Um, but I said foolishly, apparently that maybe it'd be nice if Craig put some more  money into what was it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was preserving, uh, cultural archives or something.  Yeah.  Instead of saving the pigeon.  Cause those things were going to get dying off on YouTube.  And he just upset you.  Craig listens.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He knows.  I'm sorry, Craig.  You know, I love you and I, I love your pigeons.  Let's see.  What did he write?  He wrote, he just sent a picture, a picture of an angry pigeon.  No, you didn't.  He said, well, and then, and then he sent a picture of Alfred Hitchcock.  No, I sent that.  Oh, okay.  Good.  I was like, wow, that's, that's threatening.  Yeah.  So this is what Craig said.  Just a pigeon.  Give me the evil eye.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The, uh, the header.  I can't remember what the, what the topic line was.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It just said, uh, watch out Leo.  Oh no.  You said that.  Yeah.  He said it.  GFK would like a word.  What is GFK?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's the nickname of the bird.  I can't remember what it stands for.  Oh, okay.  I should know that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ghost face killer would like a word.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's it.  Ghost face killer.  That's right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's more of a threat than you, your thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, I did.  Mr.  Algon, thank you so much for staying up late with us in the Veneto.  I appreciate it.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  It's my pleasure.  Leo, can I, can I do a 30 second pitch?  Plug.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Kevin's thing, man.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  Cause we talked about these things.  Hello chatterbox.com is the thing.  It's called the chatterbox.  It's an educational product where kids build a smart speaker, kind of like an  Amazon Echo or something like that.  And then they teach it how to talk and interact.  It's the only educational product that I know of that uses both chat, GBT,  and also stable diffusion.  It's, uh, that's cool.  Kids are protect.  Yes, it is.  Kids are protected from, you know, objectionable content and so on like  that through the chatterbox system.  Uh, but the most important thing is that teaches kids how AI works.  It demystifies AI and it gets them to use it as a tool.  And what they end up with is actually a computer that they can use that has no  screen, uh, that, uh, can do anything they want it to do.  It can turn on lights.  It can do a million things.  They can customize it.  And this is great for schools and educational, uh, environments, whether  it's homeschooling or whatever, and also individuals can buy it and build it  themselves.  I think this is a really great product for kids to learn about AI, especially  now that everybody's talking about AI kids are, you know, having AI write their  essays and stuff like that.  And nobody really understands it.  So this takes kids at the age of around eight years old and up and really  teaches them what AI is, how it works and how it can be used for education  purposes instead of, you know, the opposite.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Really cool.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  Do you, are you connected to the, the, the founders of the makers?  I mean, this is the kind of thing I'd love to get on product.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  It is my son, my son, Kevin, inventors.

Speaker: Chris Messina
Transcript:  There we go.  Wow.  Have them reach out and I'll get on product on for you.  Wonderful.  Yes.

Speaker: Mike Elgan
Transcript:  That would be great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Making connections.  Look at that.  Good.  Who needs AI?
