Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got buzzed by a prop plane earlier. That was very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was weird. Kevin has worked everywhere including the Google, Apple, British Telecom, the Beeb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never asked you Kevin. As employers go, which was your favorite?  Oh, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is an interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me set the...I don't mean in terms of...just kind of a gestalt and nice place to be and you'd recommend it to others kind of thing, not the specifics of your job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The big company things. I mean, that's interesting. I think Salesforce and Google were both very good employers from that respect.  Apple was fairly good but a bit weird because of the internal chaos stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were in Apple before Steve left during Steve's exile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just when Steve came back. I joined April 98 and a week later they launched the iMac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there was considerable chaos at that time. He was really revamping the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was a bit of chaos there but also Apple's org structure was very much a court org structure.  There were different groups that were playing to Steve effectively and competing over stuff.  That part of it was very chaotic.  There was a problem with companies to some respect but it was very much...my example was we set up a wiki inside QuickTime to discuss our project plans  and was told by management to take it down because the apps team could see what we were thinking and that would be bad.  So that was my example for slightly oddness of Apple. But Apple had a lot of great things too.  There's some good stuff there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of a unique way of doing business, isn't it? But every company has its own style and Apple's style was we don't want interdepartmental communications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It comes from being the hardware company and being correctly paranoid about accidentally leaking products ahead of time.  Because if you're a hardware company that's the worst thing you can do because it destroys the demand for the current product at the point where it's at its most profitable.  Which is once you've got the manufacturing running smoothly and your costs are going down then you bring the new products out and at the beginning of that ramp you're losing money on it as you're ramping stuff up.  But then you get to a point where it's profitable and ramps down and you bring the next one in.  So if you leak the new product before that crossover happens you basically destroy the company.  And this isn't theoretical. Osborne did this, Palm did this themselves.  So that's sort of where Apple's mindset is because that's the kind of products they're selling.  Whereas Google doesn't have that problem because they're not...well they may be starting to get a bit of that because they're starting to sell hardware.  But basically that's not their primary source of revenue.  So they can afford to be laxer about the terms of internal communication stuff.  And so they started from the idea that everyone in the company should know what's going on most of the time.  And to the time that did change was when they started working on Android and then because they were in that same hardware space that team was locked off in a separate building and didn't communicate much.  So there is a dynamic there that fits the kind of product you're making because you can destroy your business in that way.  And similarly, whereas Salesforce was very much about future product roadmaps and what's coming out and what we're going to do next year.  And they're comfortable doing that because they've basically got a...although they've got competitors, their core customers are expecting to know what's coming next year and look forward to that.  And that was something Microsoft historically did.  Microsoft's way of crushing a competitor was not to surprise them with a new product.  But when they're convinced they've announced something, they would say, oh, yeah, that'll be the next version of Windows.  You don't have to worry about that.  And that was their way of distracting from the competition.  Microsoft had other structural issues, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They had divisions fighting amongst themselves for priority.  And so sometimes the office division was powerful.  They could keep the hardware division from putting it on the hardware.  There's all sorts of, you know, internecine warfare going on.  I wonder, though, Apple really kind of showed the value of secrecy.  And I think a lot of companies have learned from Apple.  But I wonder if secrecy is the best way to run a company.  Especially not for your customers.  It depends on the kind of company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I think that's the other...  Somebody wrote a critique of Apple recently saying that one of the reasons people are getting disappointed with Apple now is that they don't have competing divisions.  They focus everything, which means that they're focusing on the competition.  It means that they're focusing on everything on iPhone and they're neglecting the Mac.  You know, there hasn't been a Mac Pro update for three years.  The new Macbooks that came out weren't as focused on the sort of high end users, the video makers and people like that, as previous ones were.  And that's sort of...that constituency is getting grumpy.  But they were always a small part of the business.  And because the Mac division isn't sort of separately competing, it's just sort of a part of the whole company.  And the company moves resources around.  It's harder for them to say, yes, we need to make the best Mac we possibly can.  Because the company would be like, no, you get...the engineers are focusing on the next release of iOS at the moment because that's much more important.  Right.  And then there's Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What the hell?  I mean, it's different.  Its structure is very different from when you were there, I'm sure.  Because of Alphabet and now...  Google, you know, it's clear that Google's management is always trying to find a way to stay nimble and innovative as you grow into a bigger, a bigger hidebound, often, company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, something that Google did, and I think still does, was the idea that just because we're big, we shouldn't try and introduce layers.  We should keep the thing uniform.  So the idea of TGIF, where they have a company-wide meeting now on Thursday for time zone reasons, but historically on Friday, where the founders get up on stage and anyone in the company who wants to come along can listen and those who aren't present can watch it over a stream and can ask questions of the founders.  That's something the startups do.  Scaling it up to a company the size of Google, where you've got tens of thousands of employees around the world, is kind of a crazy thing to do, but they did it.  And they try to keep that focus so that anyone could walk up to the mic and ask Sergey Olario a question.  And I think as far as I know, they still do that.  They're fairly good at not leaking these things.  But as far as I know, that does still go on.  But it was something that was a challenge as the company grew, because it's always hard for if one person can walk up to the mic and complain about something and derail the whole company for 10 minutes.  That's the sort of downside of that model.  But it works to some extent.  I mean, the other thing that Google does a lot of is not try and avoid the strategy tactics you're talking about from Microsoft.  So not let one team constrain another.  And that can be a good thing.  But it means we end up with five separate chat clients on our Androids, because Google's got four different teams building different versions of them, which is kind of odd.  I mean, what Apple will do is they'll make a new one every two years and throw out the old one.  So there's sort of several generations of dead iChat and FaceTime.  And now it's iMessage.  And they throw away the whole product line.  Google will just have three or four competing ones.  So if I want to receive an SMS on my Android, there are three or four apps that could potentially do it, depending on which one I last spoke to that person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, what's pleasing to me, and we have a number of stories about this, is how well Google has handled its new phone.  This was a big departure for Google.  The Google phones, the Google Android phones were really developer platforms with the Nexus line.  And they decided to kind of abandon the Nexus line and create these phones that were priced just like Apple's iPhones.  And even though they were only in Verizon, also attempting to kind of compete as flagship phones against the other flagship phones, and apparently have done quite well.  We're going to take some stories here.  Morgan Stanley is predicting the Pixel smartphone will generate Google almost four billion dollars in revenue next year.  Now that's still dwarfed, of course, by Apple, but that's a good business.  What is the comparison?  Apple sold two hundred twelve million iPhones in 2016 for one hundred thirty seven billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Four billion sounded big to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But well, four billion is big if you have a lot of businesses.  You know, Microsoft always says, you know, we're looking for billion dollar businesses.  Well, this is a billion dollar business.  There's no question about it.  Even if Morgan Stanley is low on its estimate, they think they're going to sell about five or six million pixels.  And indeed, according to Don Risinger writing in Fortune, the Google Pixel trounced the iPhone on Black Friday.  Pixel activations more than doubled on the Black Friday weekend compared to the number of activations in the four preceding weekends.  iPhone seven activations only up 13 percent.  Samsung. This is from mobile apps and like a company, LocalLytics, Samsung's Galaxy S7 saw 30 percent, 36 percent growth in activations.  That's Black Friday, November 24th through Cyber Monday, November 28th, just a four day period.  So a lot of people bought Pixel phones. I don't know if they bought them at Verizon, if they bought them online.  Are you happy with your Pixel now, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am. I am. Absolutely.  Once I once I've got the ways problem fixed.  Yeah, I like it. It is a nice phone. The battery. The battery is very good.  It's kind of a deceptive. It's deceptive because it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels very nor average. Nothing looks special about it.  Yeah. But you but it grows on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it does. No, it feels it's good.  And can be feels good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's got a 4K screen, has it?  Am I remembering that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the Pixel XL does the Pixel.  The XL.  The small Pixel has a 1080p screen and yet both are used for Daydream Google's VR headset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's got better GPU so that you can do higher frame rates for that stuff, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, it's a pretty fast little snappy little.  I like the little one. I got the I had the XL and and I now have the regular small one.  And I like the small one. It's fun. It's kind of funny.  I mean they have a phone that's compact is a new idea for me.  But I like it. It doesn't it doesn't get in the way.  You have the XL, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't. I have I'm still wearing the original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're out of 5X or 6P? You're 6. You're Shamu.  The killer phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yeah, again, it's the 4K screen that makes it really nice.  That's something that we like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So success for the first phone that Google really did all by itself.  Didn't go out to a partner to make.  I mean they did have a partner make it, but they designed it themselves and engineered it themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if you don't count Motorola when they own Motorola.  Yeah, yeah, because because those are still that's just still a nice phone range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is even in fact you we were talking offline on Twitter because I guess your son needed a new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, his phone broke. He dropped it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And your other son had a Motorola. What was it?  Zed pure said play said play.  Yeah, that play and liked it. And I suggested maybe that would be a good phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you know he did? He does like it. Yeah, he's a big fan.  He I mean he'd had the the Nexus five before.  Well, this is definitely a step up on that.  So it's different from that. But also, yeah, he really liked the fast charge.  That was that was a killer feature for him because he's always dashing around from place to place.  So that's that. I suppose all the new phones have that.  But that was that was his. Wow, this is much better than my previous phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. What we don't have information on is Google's other new products.  They just started shipping the Google Wi-Fi. We're going to get ours.  The new three units are going to get ours next week.  What about you? Did you order it? Jeff, what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I can't because I missed it. You know, I was like 10 minutes too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like everything else that sold out.  How about the Google Home that was on sale for under well under $100?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I paid 30 and I paid 30 bucks more than I should have for that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have it?  The Home? Yeah, I have it open.  I'm trying to decide. If you if you already have an Echo, you don't need the Home.  Here's a funny video made by a guy who has both.  And he got them to interact, interact with one another.  What's his name? Let me get his name here. Adam Jackowenko.  He posted this on YouTube. He says, I decided to have some fun with my Echo and Google Home. Listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alexa, what's on my calendar tonight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tonight there is one event at 6 p.m.  At 6 p.m. there's Hey Google, what's on my calendar tonight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have a calendar entry today at 6 p.m.  The title is Alexa, what's on my calendar tonight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hear how much better the Echo's I mean the Google speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is one event at 6 p.m.  There's Hey Google, what's on my calendar tonight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have a calendar entry today at 6 p.m.  I'm just mad I didn't think of this. Alexa, what's on my calendar tonight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have an Echo and a Google Home sitting next to each other.  I just freaking love this.  I assume this could go on forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey Google, what's on my calendar tonight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have a calendar entry today at 6 p.m.  The title is Alexa, what's on my calendar tonight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It could go on obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is interesting to see that they seem to have incorporated some of that better voice tech we were talking about last time I was on a month ago or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The sound of it. Yeah, it's quite good.  I think both of them sound fairly natural.  I bet you if we see the numbers for the Amazon Echo, particularly for the they were selling at the dot for $40 over Black Friday, I suspect we'll see massive sales for that.  That's going to be a huge I think we saw what did they say?  Two and a half million Amazon Echo's were sold and the bulk of them this year.  It's taken off this year.  Let me see if I can get it.  No, but Amazon doesn't say what their sales are.  Let me see if I can find this.  Somebody mentioned what they thought that they had sold.  I don't see it.  But three million units.  This is from Geekwire.  No, that's April though.  There's more.  There's got to be something more recent than this.  Anyway, it's been a very successful two years in.  And with these great drops in prices, I have a feeling.  According to Business Insider, Echo and Alexa could add $11 billion revenue by 2020.  I don't know about that, but these these projections for six years out seem.  Wait a minute.  Twenty twenty is only three years out.  Never mind.  It's moving along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just bought I just bought the three packets back on sale.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we'll have a review for you.  I use an Eero and I'm very happy with it.  This seems to be very much in that mold, kind of a mesh Wi-Fi network.  One thing that Eero does really well is they are very aggressive on updating the firmware regularly and tweaking it regularly to make it work better with the devices in your home and so forth.  And I'd be curious to see how Google does.  You have a large home, right?  Yeah, it's more than 4000 square feet, 45 square feet.  So it's quite and it's all on one floor.  So it's quite spread out.  Oh, OK. That's a good test.  So it really is.  Yeah, there are there are on the periphery.  It's really hard.  Certainly a single router does not make it.  And I've tried all sorts of ways of extending it.  But the best has been Eero so far.  But I have what's nice is I have two networks have a Comcast business class network and a Comcast consumer network.  So the Eero right now is on the Comcast consumer network when the Google comes up on the business class network and we can have very well have a good testing test bed for that.  You saw, of course, and I put poot a little bit.  But Google did release test results that said their Wi-Fi solution was the fastest of all the new mesh solutions.  But that was a test paid for by Google.  It didn't impress me particularly with its rigorousness.  I'd like to see for myself.  So we'll have a review probably by next week for you.  Here's an interesting numbers.  As long as we're talking big numbers, according to Android police, Google Allo was downloaded five million times in the first five days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't. It's hard to believe that people knew it existed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I downloaded. I downloaded. We talked.  Have you used it since?  No.  Yeah, that's probably pretty much the problem.  It's once at the top of the Play Store's app rankings is now below position 200.  The download count stalled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How does it compare to Signal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's not.  OK, so Signal is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, I mean, it turns and downloads because I'm seeing everyone I know signing up for Signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Signal now.  Signal is getting the Trump bump.  Look at this.  Get your encryption while you can.  Signal is, of course, the one everybody recommends.  Moxie, Myerl and Spike has done a very good job with it.  It uses OTR, uses all the proper buzzwords and it's open, open source, so it can be validated.  In fact, others are using the Signal code platform, including Facebook's Messenger, I think, and WhatsApp.  However, I don't know what the downloads are because most people, I mean, do really most people think, oh, I have I've now got to run out and get encryption?  Well, apparently so.  This article, I'm not sure if it's fake news or not.  The encrypted chat app that's booming in the post Trump world.  People are going to run out and buy it.  Get this just because of the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, just empirically, you know, I'm seeing lots of people sign up for it because the slightly weird thing about it from encrypted chat app is it tells you when your friends sign up if you have their phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And that's frankly a flaw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's using the same weird model that WhatsApp uses and Allo uses, which is your phone number is your identity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So on the on the on the app store right now, Signal Private Messenger has a mere million downloads, so it did not.  It does not have the downloads of Allo.  Allo bested it by 500 percent.  Allo has encryption, but it's not you have to turn it on.  It's not on by default.  Signal, of course, is encrypted all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's for all our roots, everything through Google so they can use the system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.  Which doesn't bother me.  Even in the Trump era, I don't know.  It's so funny.  I mean, I think that's kind of a knee jerk reaction.  I don't know if.  I mean, I guess how would it's principle, but how will we know if it's time to say, oh, I better encrypt everything.  I'll tell you the snoop.  You know what? The bigger one than than than Trump's election is the snoopers charter in Great Britain, which is established a precedent in the Western nations for unprecedented snooping.  And deprecation of encryption as well.  And so that would be if you lived in the UK. Right, Kevin?  Would you would you say let's go out and get signal now before it's too late?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, in fact, my friends, the Open Rights Group are saying exactly that.  Yeah, they've been pushing against this for a long time because they've been trying to bring this into law for ages because it's not I mean, it's not unprecedented.  If you remember, the Snowden revelations basically said that this was going on and this was the retrospective legalization in the same way that US retrospect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what the apologists say is no, this is good.  Now we know what they're doing and this is all regulated now because in the past it's all just been everybody's doing it without any regulation.  That's in fact, if you look at the petition, because I guess in the UK now they have that petition thing that started in the Obama administration here in the United States where you can go on to a government site and sign a petition.  The petition exceeded the number of signatures very rapidly.  It needed 100,000 signatures for Parliament to consider it for debate.  It has 147,000 as we record today.  However, no no move from Parliament to debate it.  And the government response is the Investigatory Powers Act.  That's the Snuper's Charter dramatically increases transparency around the use of investigatory powers.  It protects both privacy and security and underwent unprecedented scrutiny before becoming law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's still the open rights group says they've taken it to the European Court of Justice and they're awaiting a ruling on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not going to be overturned, you think?  In fact, it's a roadmap for the United States and other Western nations to do exactly the same thing.  I have to think Congress, our Congress is eyeing this saying, hey, they got it through in the UK.  Does it does it out?  You know, I should read this bill more carefully.  I know the main thing is it requires ISPs to hold everything you do, including what sites you visited for more than a year.  It gives all sorts of British authorities, including like the food safety authorities, the right to ask an ISP for what you've been doing on your phone or your computer, even without proving that you're up to no good.  But I do wonder what it's standing is on encryption.  Does it block encryption?  I seem to remember having read that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it requires you to hand over encryption.  Well, they've already had the thing to hand over encryption keys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so back doors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, not back doors.  They basically if they got something that if yours that is encrypted, they can demand an encryption key from you.  Ah, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's been ruled by courts in the United States to be a violation of the right.  Right. You can use your finger, but not your your key.  Right. It's a it's unlawful search and seizure.  Fifth, fourth.  Fourth, fourth.  All right.  What's the fifth?  Probably something I take the fifth.  Plead the fifth.  Self-incrimination.  Fourth is an unreasonable search and seizure.  Which of course, you know, the UK doesn't have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you don't have any of it.  No, we have a bill of rights, but it doesn't include these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does introduce a FISA like court, the panel of judges who can oversee, which wasn't there before.  So I think that's one of the arguments that this is better than the kind of ad hoc system.  OK, here's the encryptions encryption.  Let's see here. This is the Computer World UK.  Still has encryption problems.  Parliament continues to grapple with end to end encryption in the investigatory powers bill.  This is oh, but this is a pre passage, so I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm looking for the open rights group now.  So the completed one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In any event, this does seem so you're you're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is scary. It's a scary precedent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's something that the worries, the fear would be that they would outlaw strong encryption like signal.  There's no way signal, which is made in the US, would kowtow to British laws putting a back door in it.  In fact, Max Marlowe, Spike would offshore it before he'd do that even in the US.  So it will never let's presume it would never have a back door.  Would it then be outlawed in countries that Russia says we're not going to allow strong encryption without a back door?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's that's where the sort of Internet filtering stuff.  They may be demand that the app stores are filtered as well.  So there's that there's that aspect of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't find it, but there'll be a I think there'd be a brisk black market in stolen APKs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's but this is part of the point.  I mean, so Matt Chachkovsky was talking about this last week, basically saying, OK, we've got until inauguration to purge the databases before the government decides to start seizing them.  And that is he's basically saying if you work for a large company and you've been keeping user records, your best bet is to delete them so that you can say, I don't have those user records.  Because at the point that the government passes a law saying we can access your data and you can't tell him we've access your data, it's too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, all companies should at this point establish a policy of deleting logs on a regular basis, preferably as quickly as possible.  Yes.  That that's that should be the next step.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's basically asking for a cultural change, which is, you know, historically, engineers like to log things and logs were cheap.  So you keep logs and everything to start work.  So you can always go back and see what happened.  And there's been a push for this from the FF and the Open Rice Group, people like that for a while saying don't keep logs for a long time.  Delete them as soon as you can so that they can't be taken.  And so, you know, the UK government is requiring ISPs to keep logs on people for 18 months now.  I don't know exactly what the time period was in the IP building, something like that.  There's that that but they're required to do that by law in the UK.  The ISPs are.  But the thing is that the large companies have been keeping more than that and for longer because that's what they use to do targeted advertising and behavioral targeting and all that stuff.  So they keep it around on the off chance.  They'll come up with a way to come up with something clever for it.  And that is the stuff that, you know, Corey Docter has called it toxic waste for a while.  Machi did another great one of his talks about this as well, basically saying you are creating liabilities for people by storing this data on your servers.  And you flip the default.  Do not store behavioral data about people.  And if you can avoid store identifiable data, you should avoid that too.  And that's that that is the challenge moving forward as you as you start to assume that, you know, the challenge is you can't really compete with a nation state.  If you've got a nation state that wants something and they have the resources of the US government, they can probably get that from you.  So the answer is not to have it in the first.  Not to have it in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, not to fight the subpoena, but not to have anything they could subpoena.  Right.  To that end, Brewster Cale says he's going to move the Internet Archive to Canada.  Yes, or copy it.  He's making a copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unfortunately, that's why I used to poo poo those ideas.  Not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a mirror in Canada.  He says to defend himself against a Trump administration.  I don't understand that at all.  That seems like another knee jerk reaction.  Do you think the Trump administration would demand that the archive be deleted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have one of Trump's advisors on this stuff says that on national security says that use of encryption alone is suspicious.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's always been the NSA even said that.  You know, James Admiral Clapper said that, you know, if you if you using a VPN or PGP that you're we Snowden told us that now you're in the database automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is not new, which was part of the push for encryption by default in WhatsApp and it's why we yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's why I encourage everybody to use PGP or GPG because if we all use it, then we all are all Spartacus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, PGP is annoying enough that it's very hard to keep using it.  But yes, I turn it.  It's not that annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you have a good email client that supports it, that's the trick is to get an email compliance.  It's a client that supports it.  I have it turned on.  I send my email signature has my PGP key.  And as soon as somebody sends me something encrypted, I by default will automatically from then on encrypt back to them.  It doesn't take any extra effort on my part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the sort of the counter push to that is that if you're signing everything, then you are verifying that you sent it.  And that that means that you're creating at that station.  So that's the if you're signing it and not encrypting it, you may be causing yourself more trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I sign all my email.  But that that's historically because I don't want to be spoofed.  I don't want people impersonating.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's all about that model.  And you're the feel of that model that makes sense.  Yeah, I mean, that's it.  That's the other discussion.  The other discussion about activism and and stop using Twitter and start using like that.  There's been interesting discussion of that from Zeynep Tufek and Quinn North and people like that who are saying actually a lot of what activists need is the ability to actually do that.  It's the ability to access these public spaces and be able to speak in public.  But they also need to have private communications amongst themselves that aren't public.  So this is both.  Yeah, you need both.  And at the moment, we entangle them together.  So we'll use Twitter or Facebook place to publish stuff and also as our channel for publications.  And we're relying on that that stuff not to get intermingled.  And that's so part of I think part of the reason people are picking up signal is thinking about can I decouple these things?  Can I move to different ways of doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we know we know that Twitter has authentication.  So if you're tweeting with a blue check, we know it's you.  Well, it's you.  Facebook does, too.  What do you think?  What do you think?  Just kind of offhand.  What do you think is going to happen on January 20th when President Trump now has at POTUS as well as at the real Donald Trump?  Is he going to be kind of interesting as if he like preserved one at POTUS for official announcements and then he could ones iPhone ones Android.  I really I have to say and I've said this before.  I remember how much I hated Twitter.  Now that Trump is tweeting so much, I think it's a it's a huge important channel to his inner workings, his inner thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he's also know what he's this is a game of he's using it to manipulate as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think he's just manipulate like crazy.  It distracts people from real news with fake news.  Exactly.  That's fine. That's still a value to us to see it and see what he's like.  My colleagues in media.  I blame more.  Oh, I don't blame anybody for fake news except that people want to believe it.  And we were talking before the show.  I think I think it's not fake news.  That's the problem, because there's some stuff that's just bogus.  It's conspiracy theories, which are hard to disprove and spread like wildfire.  And the Internet has proven to be an amazing, fertile greenhouse, hot house for conspiracy theory.  And and and President Trump is a huge conspiracy theorist.  He loves that stuff.  He eats it up.  And that's a more of a problem to me because you can't disprove conspiracies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but also Trump is not concerned about whether you believe him or not.  But he's speaking to an audience.  Yeah, yeah.  He's been to his audience.  But also he's primarily speaking to establish dominance and control.  So him saying this thing is this is this is the thing and I'm not supporting it.  That's actually a power play.  That's him saying I can get this across even without supporting evidence because I have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could just say that there were millions of illegal votes and it becomes so.  And then and then of course, the chain and he then challenged a reporter to prove it not.  So instead of saying instead of you know, the question is, what's your evidence?  President like Trump instead, his response is, what's your evidence?  It's not true. It must be true.  Yes, it's a conspiracy theory.  It's a conspiracy theory.  So the question really ramous writing and slate is would Facebook or Twitter ever ban President Trump?  Trump and Twitter has said, yeah, if he violates our rules, we'll ban him.  What? But Facebook says no due to the newsworthiness of whatever he tweets.  But somebody in the chat room just pointed out that it's a little known fact.  But in fact, the president of the United States has an unblockable channel to all smartphones in the country.  You cannot turn off the alerts from the president of the United States.  Those are that is an unblockable channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, God, he starts using that for his three tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I you know, I'm sorry.  And I know everybody's really it's all horrific and people are so scared.  There's a certain committedly, it's an amusement to this, too.  I mean, it won't be amusing if he launches a nuclear strike against Azerbaijan.  But but but no, I love my anger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The better of me and my language the other night, I saw that you were really peeved.  I was extremely peeved.  And in the light of morning, I regretted only one word because I do believe we call liars liars.  And please, people don't we know we disagree.  But but the the two million votes stolen from me thing is it is it is an entree to voter suppression?  Yes.  And and the conspiracy theory here is there's tons of voter fraud.  We have to change all kinds of laws and we have the power to do so to keep more people from voting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And that's already been just a voter ID laws have is a movement that's been going on throughout the country.  And in many cases, blocked by court successfully, successfully.  And yet courts have overturned these in several at least several cases, several states,  because it is a fundamental violation of the Constitution, in my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But there was there's a problem with the Voting Rights Act and the Supreme Court not holding it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No longer being enforced is what it is.  Yeah.  Well, that's interesting.  See, but that's but see, that's why I like the idea.  I like these tweets because I think they stimulate a conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but the problem is that they're not they're not meant to be factual.  They're meant to be directional.  Yeah, I understand.  So it's like the rallies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like a rally.  He's he treats he loves those rallies.  It's like treating Twitter like a 24-7 rally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's the only American president who's going to end up having he has a big rally tomorrow.  And he's going to he's going to keep doing that because he loves the adoration.  Isn't that funny?  He doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels like he's still running.  Oh, yeah.  It's very strange.  Well, I will watch with interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But to some extent, he is until the 19th.  Remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's not that.  There's no way you're going to get.  There's no way it's going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's he you know, in a sense, for him, he is still running.  And he is doing that to to keep them on side as well.  Right.  But also in the in the in the other sense, his modus operandi is to to establish dominance.  He will say anything and do anything to show that he's in charge.  Right.  And he doesn't really care if he's consistent or not, because he's focused on the moment.  And that's how he's operated for 70 years.  He's not going to change now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I feel like that the we've got very strong norms in place to to protect us against an authoritarian president.  If it happens, I mean, well, then we'll have to run to this barricades.  But well, that is too late.  No, it's not too late.  You run to the barricades before it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no. The point is that you keep your you keep your antennae up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You keep your download signal and install it.  And you. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you watched?  Have you watched Keith Olbermann?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, Keith's a nut job, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but it's a file under under amusing.  And it's the perfect time for him.  It is for his anger.  Yeah. So he has a resistance series on YouTube.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My fear is that it's almost like crying wolf.  We can all too much of this will will inure us to it.  And when the time really does come to to stand up and be counted,  people say, oh, yeah, that again, keeps back at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's the other point of this.  It's not it's not fake news.  It's propaganda. It's part of the point is to is to dispel the idea that there is  that there is news and there is truth at all.  And if you can say that, I really was saying that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that I really resent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's that's actually the goal of a lot of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's psychologically erodes our minds fundamentally.  I think it's very, very big problem.  And again, the Internet really lends itself to the to this kind of erosion  because we're already bombarded.  You know, we have talked in the past about how the Internet made facts commoditized.  It used to be a fact had real value.  That's what the job of reportage was to gather facts.  Where when? Why?  And if I was talking with my 13 year old, actually now 14 year old,  and we were talking about facts and we had just asked the Google Home something  and it told us something.  And I said, what do you think it was like in my when I was your age  if I wanted to know how much a blue whale weighed?  What do I do? And and his friends said you'd go to the encyclopedia.  I said, yep, that's right.  That's why I have an encyclopedia on my bookshelf.  That's completely obsolete now.  And if it wasn't in the encyclopedia, how would I find out?  And they were baffled. I said, well, you have to go to the library and look it up.  So facts had real value.  They were worth a lot. Now that facts are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's interesting. So facts are devalued.  They're completely devalued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we thought that was a good idea because that meant you could get all the information you need.  And now you can use your critical thinking, the real the real skill to assess and and do synthesis and come up with new ideas.  I remember my my late father-in-law, who was a science teacher in high school,  when we first gave him an iPad, said, God, if Copernicus could have had this,  Copernicus spent most of his life gathering the data, you know, grinding telescopes to gather the data.  Had he had the data, he could have spent most of his life synthesizing it, coming up with theories.  And and so he said, we live in an age now where you can do that.  But what I didn't anticipate, and this is a long list of things we didn't anticipate what the Internet would do to us,  is that by by making facts completely valueless, that we've let the word fact is now meaningless.  And that is that is that's the erosion of our of something fundamental, that there is a fact that is true or not.  Relativism. It's it's relative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As I was talking to somebody who was in the business who was shocked when an editor said to him, well, I have my truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, but it's kind of true.  I mean, you know, I kind of see the other side that that a lot of what we consider to be truth is shaded by our ideology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the challenge is, you know, you get into epistemology.  It's like, how do we know something is true? What basis do we have for supporting that?  And the best thing we have is scientific empiricism.  But even that is is is difficult in that it's not as the idea that you can create an experiment that's reproducible.  That has that has become under challenge in recent years.  People have started to try actually reproducing them and found that in large fields, people have been basically P value shopping and trying out different variations of the data.  Do they get something that shows a plausible correlation?  Then they publish that one.  And then when you go and try and reproduce the experiments, you can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're seeing that a lot. That's turned out to be that was a common M.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And it's partly this was, you know, psychology experiments and things like that where you naturally have to work with small groups and you add the statistics as something that isn't core to the system.  I'm not saying we're going to overturn quantum mechanics or something where there is significant stuff like that.  But there is Nathan Jorgensen wrote a post about factiness, about the idea, which is like the the counterpart to truth.  Truthiness is like this thing sounds like it should be true.  Therefore, I will say it. And that's the, you know, the Colbert thing.  Factiness is this is this thing looks like a fact and therefore I would defend it.  And I I'm proud that I have a fact in my piece, even if it doesn't necessarily correspond with reality.  So it's when people spend a lot of time saying, but GDP per capita has gone up under Obama and not looking at what the actual distribution of GDP per capita has done.  That that's that's an example of factiness. You've picked a measure that suits your argument.  It doesn't actually ring true to a large number of people in the country because actually they've been doing pretty badly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So are we better off? I mean, or worse off.  So in the old days, we said, oh, the Encyclopedia, the New York Times, if it's in a book, it must be true.  Though those were trusted sources.  And we've learned that, you know, thanks to many things that they maybe weren't quite as trusted as we thought.  But but was it better that at least to have something that was kind of trusted?  Or does it mean we're actually really close to the truth of the matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The institutional argument, which I hear all the time.  It's an elite. It's a fundamentally elitist.  It's an elitist argument. No, I think I think that on the net, we're better off.  Most people want to be correct. Most people, I really honestly believe, don't want to be wrong.  If given the opportunity, I would disagree with you.  I think most people want to be what it's they do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're saying it's post hoc or proctor hoc. I'm saying it's post hoc.  People form their ideas and then look for proof that it's correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sometimes, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.  Somebody's coming after Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually a leaf blower, I think, which is no, I think it's a chainsaw.  The two gardens away. Oh, Lord.  But I think this is very interesting.  And I wish I'd studied more philosophy and epistemology and an ontology and all of this stuff, because this is an age old debate, an age old discussion.  But it's really been brought to the forefront by the kind of proliferation of facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really interesting.  I'm glad you talked about this, because I hadn't thought of it that way.  And I get that. But I still have to believe that a world with more facts is better off than a world with fewer facts.  A world with more data to use is better off than a world without.  Then we got to get good at measuring the facts.  Yeah, that's our fault as humans misusing it.  But clearly, if you gave Copernicus more data and more facts, he'd be better off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe he was better off grinding his own lenses and observing for himself.  I don't know.  Have either of you been warned by Google that your account is under attack by a foreign government?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was warned, but not the foreign government piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel bad. I didn't get that.  I think I'm not important enough to get that warning.  Paul Krugman, Michael McFall, Keith Olbermann, Julia Yaffe all received warnings from Google.  Let me see if I can find it.  Here's Julia's post.  Government backed attackers may be trying to steal your password.  This comes direct from Google.  There's a chance this is a false alarm, but we believe we detected a government backed attacker trying to steal your password.  This happens to less than 0.1%, one in a thousand of all Gmail users.  Aren't you lucky.  We can't reveal what tipped us off because the attackers will take note and change their tactics.  And in fact, Google delayed, apparently Google delayed these, even these notifications a few weeks  because they were afraid that it would give information to the attackers.  To further improve your security based on your current settings,  we recommend setting up a security key or install password alert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's security? Security key is just two factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, they don't say to the word two factor.  I'm not sure why the password alert I think is that new thing that Google does where if you have a Google, an Android phone,  actually it even works with an iPhone.  When you log into your account, it then sends an alert to your phone that you say says you're trying to log in.  Right. And you say yes or no, which is kind of basically is two factor.  I don't know why they've decided to use that for two factor instead of the Google authenticator.  I guess authenticator must be what they mean by security key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  SMS as well. It has other SMS. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  NIST has said stop using SMS.  It's deprecated because it's way too easy for a hacker to social engineer your phone number out of the phone company  so that they can intercept your SMS messages.  I don't know if this alert thing is impervious to that.  I guess it would be because you'd have to log into your Google account on that phone.  And that means so it's yeah, I guess it would be better than just a text message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. So it seems if they've already got you logged in somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, it's kind of yeah, it's kind of a chain of trust from from what your current device to the next device.  Apple does basically the same thing.  You have to approve an Apple login from another Apple device.  But so everybody should turn that on.  Here's a fun story.  One million Google accounts compromised by Gooligan.  Aptly named our Android malware.  86 apps and third party marketplaces can root 74 percent of all Android phones.  But that's because most Android phones are not on a modern version of Android.  This affects ice cream sandwich, jelly bean, Kit Kat and lollipop.  If you are on if you are on Mars upon or Nuget, what is am I forget?  Marshmallow or Nuget, you're OK.  But most users on Android are not.  And unfortunately, a lot of the people who are vulnerable to this are people who have less expensive phones in other nations.  You know, who are have carriers and companies, manufacturers that don't care about updating.  And so, you know, the most vulnerable people in some ways.  Gooligan begins when a user downloads and installs an infected app on a vulnerable device.  And as I said, there are a lot of apps, although note those apps are on third party app stores.  So step one, do not download apps from other sources.  Get them from the Google Play Store.  But if you've got that third, you know, go to your settings and turn off the apps.  And turn off install applications from third parties that should not be on in your Google phone because you might even get a link in a malware or a phishing message that downloads and installs an APK.  That'll be blocked if you don't have that setting turned on.  It's not on by default.  After an infected app is installed, it sends data about the device to the command and control server.  Gooligan then says, ah, yes, I'll be with you in a moment.  Then downloads a root kit from the server, which takes advantages of multiple exploits on Android 4 and 5.  If rooting is successful, the attacker, of course, has full control of the device and can do whatever the hell he wants remotely.  After root access, Gooligan downloads a new malicious module from the server and installs it on the infected device.  This module injects code into running Google Play or Google Mobile Services to mimic music behavior so Gooligan can avoid detection.  Geez, Louise, at this point, you can Google again will give you the option to steal a user's Google email account and authentication token information.  So if they can get into your system and you're using Google Authenticator, it gets the secret from Google Authenticator.  Now your two factors useless. That's why Google's probably recommending this new system.  Install apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait.  Two factors useless because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The way the Authenticator works is it creates a six digit code that is from the current time and a secret number.  Yes.  So if they can get your secret number from Authenticator, they can authenticate from any device.  Your secret number should be protected. It's as important as your password.  So if they've rooted the phone, I mean, I'm projecting this. It doesn't say this specifically, though it implies it.  They say you can get they can steal authentication token information.  I don't know if that means inbound codes or actually just get the secret. If they get the secret, it's all bets are off.  They can generate codes all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is the secret in it forever? Once I set up?  Yes, secret is forever. You can reset it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can reset it.  You know, you can get a new secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So my temptation is to say that those secrets should be reset on some timetable.  However, when that secret is communicated, that's a weak, vulnerable point.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why they do it with QR code.  So when you first set up Google, two factor, right?  You get a QR code on the screen. That's the secret numbers in that QR code.  And you scan it with your phone because you wouldn't want to enter in a 20 digit number.  And now it's in your phone.  And, you know, you preserve that QR code at your peril.  You're not supposed to. You're supposed to say, OK, bye bye.  And that's done. And that now the only thing that has that secret number is your authenticator.  But you can manually reset it.  I think this new system is better, is more secure.  I'm not a security expert on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Except when you're someplace where your phone is not going to work for three days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. It's a little bit of a pain in the butt.  But so all security is, is it not?  When I travel internationally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sure it's that base token they're taking, but the basic,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if they're getting the intercepting the SMS, then yeah, I would assume that authenticator puts that token somewhere safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's more that if you're using Google services for the web browser, then you're basically sending an authentication token from the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not so bad because you only have 30 seconds to use it.  The token's only good for 30 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yeah, if you can get the one that lets you reset it and create new ones, then that's much more problematic.  That's a real problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not clear.  This stuff is hard.  Director of Android Security Adrian Ludwig said he and other Google officials have worked closely with Checkpoint, the company that discovered this,  to investigate Google again and to protect users against the threat it poses.  There's no evidence data was accessed from compromised accounts or that individual users were targeted.  Note that one of the main things that they do is not to steal your information to attack you,  but to put adware on your phone to generate revenue or to install apps from Google Play and rate them to raise their reputation.  It's a kind of God's variety of scams.  Google's been using a service called Verify Apps to scan individual handsets for signs of guligan and other ghost push apps.  And when detected device owners receive a warning, installations are halted.  So that's that.  That's that.  I think that new thing when you download this is a great feature.  And I didn't realize they could backport it to earlier versions of Android.  When you download a new app, it scans it before it installs it.  We've taken many actions to protect our users and improve the security of the Android ecosystem overall,  including revoking affected users Google account tokens, providing them with clear instructions to sign back in securely,  removing apps related to the issue from affected devices, deploying enduring Verify Apps improvements.  So they're doing the best they can.  But the problem is fundamental is that old versions of Android do not get fixed.  Let's take a break.  Kevin, you got to go in 10 minutes.  Yes, thereabouts.  I'm not going to remind you the time and hope that you forget.  Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.  If you're a freelancer, a small business, you know the thing you hate doing the most is, well, sending out invoices.  It's also the thing you must do the most because that's how you get paid.  FreshBooks makes it easy.  You can create invoices in less than 30 seconds that look professional.  They've got your logo on it, the color scheme, any images you want that reflect your brand.  I mean, they're personal invoices.  You can chat with your client regarding an invoice once they receive it.  That's built in.  You'll be able to see which invoices you've sent, which have been viewed.  There's never a question whether your client saw it or got it.  It pings you when they do.  And which have been paid as well as overdue and outstanding invoice totals.  So you've got on the dashboard, this is that brand new FreshBooks dashboard, all new.  You've got all the information you need about how your business is doing.  So many small business owners, if you ask them, have you made a profit this year?  Can't even answer that question, let alone how much.  But all you have to do now is launch FreshBooks and you'll say, yes, I have.  And here's how much.  You'll have quick access to outstanding balances, spending, total profit.  And you can generate those fancy accounting reports if your bookkeeper needs them,  like sales tax summaries and profit and loss statements.  Track expenses by vendor and category too so you know how much you've spent to make your money.  If you do time and hour billing, there's a tracker in the app and on the web.  Makes it easy to track your time to the minute.  And when it comes time to create the invoice, it just goes right in there so you'll know exactly what you did and when you did it.  I can go on and on, but here's what I want you to do.  Try it free.  This new dashboard is awesome.  And if you're a current FreshBooks user, if you haven't already received that notification,  you can upgrade to the new dashboard, but you can also stay with the old one if you're comfortable with it.  But new users will get the new dashboard and you will love it.  It's a 30-day unrestricted free trial waiting for you at freshbooks.com slash twig.  Freshbooks.com slash twig.  And if you do me a favor, just say, this week in Google when they ask, how did you hear about it?  That way we get credit for it.  This week in Google.  Yeah, this Google again is a nasty one.  Here's a bad hack.  Here's a bad hack.  This weekend, all the gates were open at the San Francisco Muni.  Oh, yes.  You just walked on the train because apparently somebody got ransomware on at least some of the Muni systems.  They're asking for $73,000 in ransom.  Now, the whole system wasn't hacked because obviously the system that ran the trains wasn't because they kept the trains going.  But I think the money stuff was because anybody could just walk through those turnstiles.  The hackers claim they control 2,000 computers of their 8,000 computer of SF Municipal Transit's 8,000 network system.  If you saw the kiosks, I didn't see this.  Maybe you did, Kevin.  If you saw the kiosks downtown on Saturday, it said you hacked all data encrypted.  Contact for key.  They gave out a Yandex.com address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if this was, of course, a plot at The Good Wife where they had data and they didn't have it backed up and so they had to pay,  as long as they have a backup of the data, how does this scam work against Muni?  It doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But of course, you don't pay the $73,000 if you have anything else you could do.  I presume Muni is well enough run so that they can just clean the systems and put the data on.  It just means, and by the way, everything's back to normal now.  You revert to the prior version.  Yeah.  That's probably what could have happened was that they were down for a few days as they fixed it and now they're back up,  presumably without paying the 100 Bitcoin that the hacker wanted.  Which is what, $70,000?  Probably what happened was, well, okay, so this is from Hoodline.com.  Mike Grover, a Bay Area security researcher who aided Hoodline in investigating the story,  said there are a few ways the hackers could have taken over Muni's system.  My gut says they found a way to get inside before spreading the ransomware through their domain controller  or an administrator's machine and then leverage that to use the administrator's access to infect the rest of the network.  Easiest way to do this, and it happens all the time, it's what happens with Sony, is you send a phishing email to a bunch of employees.  One of them believes it.  By the way, it also impacted the paychecks.  Muni workers are not sure if they're going to get paid this week, which is not good.  And without collecting fares, it costs them more than half a million dollars a day to run Muni.  Fair machines were back up, though, after the weekend.  So that's the good news.  The scary thought, though, is that they were hacked at all.  And, you know, if they'd hacked...  Oh, we lost Kevin. Bye, Kevin.  If they had hacked the controllers, the computers that control the trains, they could have caused a wreck.  Yeah.  Not good.  The signal system.  Yeah.  You could have like what happened in New Jersey.  That was operator error, though, right?  That was, yes.  What happened to that?  Are they trying the kind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He suffers from sleep apnea.  Oh, he fell asleep.  Well, they don't know that, but they revealed that he suffers from...he was undiagnosed to have any sleep apnea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Sleep apnea means you don't breathe properly when you're sleeping at night, which means you can be very tired during the day thinking you had a good night's sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you ever had a sleep test?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have not, and I don't want to know.  I know I'm tired all the time, but I attribute it to my advanced age.  Yeah.  That's normal, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, you got to love it. Casey Neistat got a big payday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I watched his blog saying this is the last blog I'm giving this up, and then turns out it's for a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Estimated $25 million. Casey, a YouTube star. He's got millions of subscribers, right? I haven't checked his subscribers yet, but I've watched his videos.  Very talented, really clever guy. He does have 11 employees, so I always thought, oh, he's just a great editor.  He works really fast, but no, he's got 11 people working for him.  And he created an app called Beam, which we actually had as an app cap on iOS today. It was kind of cool.  You'd put it on your phone, and you had to tap your chest, and then it would start taping.  It was kind of weird, but the idea was very direct, personal broadcasting.  Another case where a lot of people downloaded it, and then nobody used it after that, including me.  Casey is 35. He's got a great story. He's a very talented video editor.  Very talented. Does a lot of kind of cool stuff in New York City.  And he is now a CNN employee.  In fact, the whole company, all of Beam's employees will join CNN. Beam was downloaded a million times.  The great hunt for youth in video.  Right. I think that's a smart move. It's a weird move, though, because normally what a company like CNN would do, or my company, is we'd approach them and say, we'd like to hire you.  But nowadays, it's like we'd like to acquire your company.  Presumably, it goes with the job, though, right? He gets 25 million and then a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he's content visionary or some such thing.  There may be an earn out or something. Well, I guess they're shutting down Beam, so it's not an earn out situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, there's no more Beam app, but their employees will stick around in the Tribeca office. They're not going to move to the Time Warner Center.  Good. That's smart.  Neistat will still manage his personal YouTube channel, which has 5.8 million subscribers, but it's not related to his new media venture.  And as for whether Neistat will appear on CNN's TV lineup, the network said we're exploring every possible way for Casey and our media venture to connect with new audiences.  Stay tuned.  The new wolf.  I asked Karsten to try to book my old colleague Alex Wellen, who runs digital at CNN.  He was one of our anchors on tech TV many moons ago. Great guy.  I love Alex. And he's at CNN. I'm willing to bet was the guy who helmed this acquisition.  Have you emailed him? Yeah, we're waiting here.  I think Alex still likes me.  You'll find out soon enough.  Find out soon enough, if I'm still in his good graces.  We lost Kevin before we got to do his...  Oh, he's back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it looks like my DNS went down on my main connection, so I'm now going in through my phone. Android hotspot.  You've been hacked.  I'm not sure if I've been hacked, but it says DNS failed on my...  That's not supposed to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Comcast has probably eaten something.  Yeah.  But fortunately I can fall back on my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But can you stick around or are you about to leave? I don't understand.  I do need to leave soon anyway.  You came back just to say goodbye?  Just to say goodbye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was on a conference call today and somebody had problems with their connection.  And she would just come into the conversation constantly saying, oh, it's me. I left. I came back.  And then clunk.  And then clunk went off again. It was like a comedy routine. It was all the person said was, I'm on. I'm back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You hit your data cap. That's what happened.  Have you received an email from Comcast saying you're approaching your data cap? I got one this month for the first time ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't had one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's scary. You have a terabyte. I went up. I went 125% over the terabyte. They said, that's okay. We'll spot you this time.  But if it happens twice more, we're going to have to charge you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Were you broadcasting from home or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I was just watching TV. But I realized we watch everything now we stream.  Even if HBO is on the cable, it wouldn't cost us. We end up watching it on HBO Go instead.  I stream everything and I have 4K now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm streaming in 4K. That's what you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Comcast, they know. Everybody said, oh, a terabyte. You'll never hit a terabyte.  Well, you have 4K. Then you see how much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to do 4K and 360.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It depends how much they compress the 4K. At the moment, they're not compressing it much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it looks great. I'm amazed because there is very little 4K content. There's only like 100 DVDs.  Although you see here, YouTube is now supporting 4K live streaming.  Live streaming, wow.  And also in 360 degrees. I don't know anybody who has a 360 degree 4K camera.  That might be the Ozo. I don't even think the Ozo is 4K.  All of us now have 4K cameras that can stream 4K, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a 4K camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All phones. Many phones can do that. So that's cool. They look good.  I mean, 4K. I've been watching 4K with HDR on Netflix and on Amazon, and it looks good.  You end up watching, I remember in the early days of HD, you'd watch the stupidest stuff because it was in high def.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But don't you have to be like four inches from the screen to tell?  Oh, no. Come over to my house. Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm not that, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not huge. I'm not way distant, but I have a, so I have a 65 inch screen.  So it's pretty big.  Not one of those curved things or no?  No, I had curved last year. I had curved this year straight.  And it's, I'm about eight feet.  Okay.  And you feel like you're looking through a window. It's like, wow.  So I'm watching a very stupid show about Japan, but it's in 4K.  And you really feel, remember that's what Mark Cuban made, made money on, right? Streaming HD bikini videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, God. BBC Earth in 4K. That'll be worth seeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I pre-ordered it. They're reshooting it, but it won't be out. Well, are they? No, it is out. Right?  It's airing, isn't it? Oh, he just, we lost him again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Earth 2 and they've shot it all in 4K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're airing it on, but are they airing it on BBC America or where are they airing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not sure. BBC UK at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But I ordered, because I pre-ordered the DVD because that's how, that's the way we watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It'll be PBS here. You mean Blu-ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Blu-ray. No, no, no. Blu-ray UHD. I have a high def Blu-ray player. I mean a UHD 4K Blu-ray player.  Yeah, but that's the way to watch it. Yeah. Oh, I bought the HD when it came out and I had a new HD TV.  It's beautiful. Love BBC Earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember being, nobody's going to need HD. That's silly.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  HD is an immeasurable difference. 4K is tougher. I mean, a 4K screen is great if you're actually using it for text and work and you want, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin, come to my house and watch this movie, this Japanese movie with me. You will be blown away. I promise you've never seen anything look better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, okay. I mean, for me it's like the TV in our house isn't that big and the room's fairly big. So 720p is fine for what we're watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah, you need to have the viewing environment.  I set it up to be, you know, close because I want to, you know, and I'm, it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because you want it to be immersive. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is immersive. It's cinematic. It's better than going to the movies.  Yeah.  Hey, I forgot to mention we were talking about Echo. Amazon is going to apparently, according to Mark Gurman, good source, Bloomberg Technology, do a premium Alexa speaker with a screen on it.  They say it's for your kitchen.  First, as soon as first quarter 2017. I've been waiting for this. I've been waiting for Amazon to start capitalizing on the, on the Alexa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, this is the thing we talked about for a while is, is, and it's part of the thing that Google makes sense because you can have the Chromecast and the TV and you can have the Google gadget you talk to.  And it can send stuff to the Chromecast, which is what you want. So Alexa doing that makes sense.  But having a screen in it makes less sense to me than, you know, sending it to the Amazon Fire or whatever their equivalent is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and then we're going to do Sonos. Well, I think that's what the screen will be, right, is a Fire tablet. What do you, what do you bet?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or, but a Fire dongle thing you stick in your actual TV.  Because you've got the TV in your kitchen.  Oh, that would be cool.  No, that's the thing. That's the promise of the Google one is that you can say, OK, Google, play me BBC Earth.  And it goes, it's in, it's in Google movies. Do you want to spend 10 bucks on it? You say, sure.  And then it appears on your TV.  I haven't tried that yet. Does that work now?  I don't know. I haven't got the, you know, I haven't got the gadget.  But that's the thing. The thing that the Chromecast makes possible is that you can you can send stuff to any of the screens in your house.  The thing that potentially the speaker that knows where your things in your house are means you can say play me the movie and it'll play it to the right screen in the right room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've named all my Chromecasts. So I should theoretically be able to say play me the movie in the living room.  I have a Chromecast named the 4K Chromecast is named Man Cave.  I can't wait. I can't wait to say play bikini videos in my man cave.  That's going to be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is this is where it misses you and since it's somewhere else in the house instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, GoPro in trouble.  We've known that GoPro was struggling.  I'm not sure if it's that there's too many competitors or that people are getting weaned off of the action camera category.  It reminds me of the great flip cam.  But that just died suddenly, didn't it? Remember that?  Boy, that was the thing for for vloggers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was I loved it. I discovered it.  I introduced media companies to it. I said it's going to change the world.  But you know what killed that was the smartphone, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The ability to do the same thing on the same phone you already have.  And I would guess that's kind of what's killing GoPro is that we've got great cameras on our phones.  I don't know.  Fifteen percent of its workforce will be laid off.  They're going to shut down the entertainment division.  Well, they seem to be in charge of the world.  Wow. They're restructuring to reduce operating expenses by six hundred fifty million dollars next year.  They estimate they'll incur as much as thirty three million dollars in restructuring costs.  Products, including the Karma drone and the new Hero 5, have not sold well.  The company blamed the disappointing results on production problems.  They had to recall twenty five hundred drones.  It also faces a class action lawsuit.  The claims the company made false and misleading statements about the drone, which is a violation of federal securities law.  Wow. Competition.  But I mean, but I think also a weakening market.  And here's the best news of all.  Netflix now lets you download their content to watch offline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm this was this was this made the rundown worth it for me this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm very happy.  Now, it's not everything. It's mostly original stuff.  But that's great. That's the stuff I want.  That's the best stuff on Netflix. Watch on the plane.  I just I haven't finished The Crown yet.  That'd be perfect. I like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All kinds of stuff. I didn't watch it all because because if I can't watch it on the plane or in the subway.  Yeah. So here's here's a question for you.  Are either of you Walking Dead fans? No.  I had to stop watching it. It's a dystopia.  Everybody stopped watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, the ratings for The Walking Dead have plummeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it just got so disgusting.  I couldn't I couldn't do it.  Yeah. Well, it proves you can go too far.  Sadistic. Yeah.  And and and really just does is I watch TV to escape from dystopia and we're in dystopia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. You know, so well, that's what some have said is that get ready because you're going to see a stream of feel good movies.  Just this is happening in the Great Depression.  Right. We're going to have a Busby Berkeley tap dancing, singing, happy go lucky escapist movies.  I do note when I go to the theater, a ton of sci fi movies all of a sudden.  Mm hmm. Last year was the comic book character, the Marvel's the Marvel Universe year.  This year is going to be the spaceship saga.  The space opera year. Tons of stuff.  What, by the way, what do you think of The Crown?  Have you watched that, Kevin Marks?  You're a British citizen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Watch that one yet. I watched a bit of Victoria, but I haven't watched.  I didn't finish that one.  I want to know. It's the same guy did The Queen, which I thought was wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I haven't watched it. So I can have an opinion on that. Yeah.  I've been what I've been binge watching Vikings.  That that I was. Is that good?  Well, it's very good. Oh, I'll have to watch that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's I think in 4K UHD so I could enjoy that.  There you go. I'm looking at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was impressed with it. It's it has that Game of Thrones thing, but actually there's a bunch of historical stuff in it that's accurate.  OK, so when they do people speaking of any languages, they're actually speaking old Danish and old English.  Oh, nice. And you know, some mythical stuff and bits and pieces.  I knew that old Danish degree would come in handy someday.  I was I was laughing. I was because I went to Cambridge and I had friends who did Anglo Saxon, Norse and Celtic.  It's hot now.  Finally, you got a job in media.  Good job.  To write the dialogue for actors to learn languages they can't speak.  Their Spiegel loses again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They their sixth court case against ad blocker ad block plus.  I.O. the company that makes them.  In fact, I know these guys.  In fact, we had the tilfide on triangulation talking about ad block plus.  He mentioned at the time that they were being sued again by their Spiegel.  Their Spiegel says, you know, you're undermining our ability to monetize by blocking ads.  Their lawyers were contacted by phone.  The judge says your case has been dismissed, but we haven't seen a written decision, so we don't know why.  They're basically their Spiegel, which is a newspaper, right?  Magazine magazine magazine magazine.  OK, is trying to, you know, says, you know, ad blockers should be illegal.  OK, I really do need to go now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So I was saying, OK, I'm going to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, I really do need to go now.  So I'll say thank you, Kevin Marks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will give a big plug to pub pub pub sub hubbub and to and to the website club tonight.  Indie Web dot org and the website club tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  San Francisco 530 riding out.  He's fading.  And the pubs have helped me.  Am I am I dying on the way out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're dying on the way out.  You're going on the way out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also, I think there's another noisy machine going on here as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is.  Hey, it's great to have you.  Thank you for filling in the last minute.  Well, pubs of hubbub is now Web sub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  So what this does is it lets you when you post to your blog, it notifies people who are subscribed to it instantly.  So you don't have to to pull a feed or check for updates.  And this is a protocol that's been around since 2010, but it's now a W3C working draft.  We've done it as part of the social web working group.  Nice.  And it's still still used in quite widespread ways.  And it's being adopted by the new thing.  So mastodon dot social, which I don't know if you've seen yet, which is yet another Twitter alternative, uses pubs of hubbub as part of its protocol.  And we're using it in the Indie Web to make sure that when you post something, other people can see it quickly.  So you can do the kind of real time back and forth that you get with Twitter or Facebook without actually being tied into one one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is the new Twitter?  It's not going to social with something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's mastodon dot social, which is it is going to social compatible, but it's a new implementation that someone's just built.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mastodon as in the woolly mammoth.  Yes.  Mastodon Mastodon.  A free open source social network server, decentralized.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's that's that's just popped up over the sort of ramped up.  I think he started it a couple of months ago and it's picked up some traction in the last few weeks.  But he's using pubs of hubbub and some of these these specs as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice. Thank you, Kevin Marks.  You know, we got Kevin on at the last minute because Stacey fell ill.  So not a seriously ill, but she just couldn't make it.  So thank you for coming in at the last minute.  And I'm sorry we have to lose you so fast, but it's been great having you.  Bye. I'll see you again soon.  See you soon.  I am joining Mastodon right now.  Aha. Aha.  Let's see real quickly before we before we get our picks of the week.  Anything else to talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a lot of stuff here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey sent along this article, which I also noted Google AMP is a gilded cage.  It's kind of what I've been saying, right?  I know you'd like that one.  Where do you stand on this now?  Now that we've seen what AMP is and all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think we've seen the full impact yet until Google basically links everything it links to as AMP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the idea was we're going to speed up the web.  We're going to get rid of the worst ad tech.  We're going to let publishers publish articles that load almost instantly on your mobile browser.  And we're going to make it kind of an open project that anybody can run an AMP server,  although I don't see anybody doing that.  And this article from Terrence Eden is not so much a criticism of AMP.  It's just saying if you made the mistake of trying out AMP on your website, it's pretty hard to get out of it.  Yeah, that's really good.  WordPress makes it easy. There's a WordPress plugin.  He uninstalled the WordPress plugin and Google continues to show AMP links,  which of course, because he's not running the plugin anymore,  gives him a 500 error.  And even if they try to click through, they get a 404 error.  So this is probably something Google would fix, I would imagine.  Yeah, don't fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a weakness in the AMP architecture that you have a different URL as opposed to a new standard.  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, it hasn't turned out to be a horrible thing either.  And I have to say anything that makes pages load faster is a good thing.  It's a good thing, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm amused by the fact that Facebook erased Zuck's post about fake news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was an accident too, I presume.  Yeah, sure, sure.  Why did they erase it? Because their fake news censor said, oh, it's fake news?  Yeah, you can't avoid the straight line.  I sense fake news.  What was he saying? We're going to get rid of fake news, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you're not.  Yeah, it was the one where he said 99% of the stuff on Facebook is authentic.  No, wrong.  Right.  So I was amused by that. I thought that was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are wrong, Mark Znooker-Harg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You are blocked.  How much are you using Assistant on the Pixel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very, very little. But you know, it's a problem I have with all of these things.  But I use it when I want to find a factual thing. I will use it.  I have a Google Home too, and I don't talk to it that much.  I talk to... I learn to talk to the Echo because it does a few things that I really like,  like reads to me, plays music, that kind of thing.  And I think that's the problem with all speech interfaces.  You know, I have Cortana on this Windows machine.  And I know it's... you have to kind of be trained to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that's why it's interesting that Amazon is adding the screen back to speech  because you want to be able to see the page.  I think it's good for... I don't know if it's going to work, but I think it's good for media brands potentially.  Yeah, that's true. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We a few weeks ago added Twitbits to the morning briefing that the Echo does.  And we got pretty good take-up.  I think the last time I saw was 5,000 people were listening to bits from our shows,  mostly it was the news from TNT Monday through Friday, and then bits from the screensavers and Twit on their Echo  as part of their morning briefing, which is thank you everybody.  And if you'd like to do that, you just open that app.  I don't want to use the name, but the A app, the Amazon Echo app, and search for Twit in the morning briefing contents.  They've really expanded the kinds of things you can get in the morning briefing, which has made it a lot better.  A lot better.  And yeah, we've tried to keep those down in a couple of minutes so you get a quick hit of tech stuff.  Snapchat spectacles, are they going to be a big deal?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm sure you wish you had a pair.  No, not at all.  Just for the fun of it? No, not at all.  It's a gimmick.  Very much so. Plus I'd be blind, because it's not prescription.  Well, you had Google Glass.  Don't you have to remind me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just the same thing, right? You could take videos and share them to Snapchat.  It's $126.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And less dorky looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really.  You put this link to an op-ed piece in the New York Times by Christopher Daggett, an auction that could transform local media.  What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we have the Spectrum auction coming.  Another one?  It's a double blind Dutch with a double twist and a sow cow.  It's very complex, extremely complex.  But the New Jersey public media licenses that we believe are up for sale could be worth as much as $2 billion.  So Chris Daggett, who's a friend of mine, he has the foundation I'm on the board of, the Jolien Ardadj Foundation, wrote an op-ed with free press.  Also weighing in, arguing that if let's say it's $2 billion, why not a 10% fund to help develop the future of media and an informed society in New Jersey?  $200 million could go a long way to building new media efforts.  So otherwise the money's just going to go right in to solve Governor traffic jams.  Does it go to the state? No, it doesn't even go to the state. It just goes to the federal budget.  No, no, no, no, no. That's the point. The state owned the licenses.  The state's selling them. I get it.  In most of these cases, these licenses are commercial and it will go to ABC, NBC, whoever.  But in this case, there are three licenses that were owned by the state of New Jersey.  Public TV licenses.  Exactly. And so there's a few cases like this around the country.  And so they're selling them and they can be worth quite a bit.  And we're just saying don't that's a one time asset sale and don't have that money.  And it's our money. It's not. And it's our money. Yep.  It's a little irritating to me that this this sale is going on and most of this money, the billions of dollars is going to go to TV stations and they don't even use it.  It's our airwaves and they should be given back to us the people.  But that's not what's happening.  So anyway, I thank you for the plug to that. I wanted to mention that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a certain irony to the fact that people didn't vote in the election because they felt that government wasn't responsive and was corrupted.  Politicians were horrible and evil. And as a result, you ain't seen nothing yet.  Yeah.  It's a little higher. It's self-fulfilling prophecy.  I'm trying to restrain myself. I know you're being very good.  And now I'm the one who's falling into the pitfall.  Because you have to talk about it. It's just unbelievable.  It's hard not to. Yeah. I mean, I'm still of the opinion that I'm taking a little bit of a wait and see, although we're starting to see.  I'm just curious. I still believe that the institutions of our republic will moderate any extremism on the part of anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's upsetting me most right now is health insurance, pre-existing conditions, Medicare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's already said I'm not going to get rid of that. He said he hasn't, but I'm nervous.  He's got a new HHS secretary who has been a virulent foe of Obamacare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that worries me at an individual level. Yeah, it should. Because you have a pre-existing condition.  The photos of Romney dining with Trump, the captioning that's been going on is just hilarious.  My favorite is, oh, good, a new season of Twin Peaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that we're going to see an amazing, I think sometimes if everything's going your way, it kind of kills creativity.  I think sometimes adversity is a very useful thing for the left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm getting a lot of flashbacks to the 60s. This is the weirdest picture ever.  It is. It's so hilarious. Sorry, I should have warned you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, people are captioning this like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I didn't know that Jean Georges is a wonderful, amazing restaurant.  Three-star Michelin. Jean Georges Vector. I didn't know it was in a Trump building.  So except for the 21 Club, all he evidently likes, Trump, is cheeseburgers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder what he's eating there. I mean, it looks like Mitt's got something of interest, but Trump's got a looks like a taco bowl.  I don't know what he's eating there. We know he likes those.  Some very funny tweets.  It does look like a Twilight Zone episode where a guy just made a foolish deal with the devil.  That's Adam Murray's tweet.  Okay.  Although I think we can all be happy that President-elect Trump has convinced Carrier, the air conditioning company, to keep a thousand jobs it was about to send to Mexico.  So I just tweeted a good fortune piece that explained the deal.  Yeah.  And says basically they lost, kept a thousand jobs, lost 1,100 jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a 7,000 jobs that were lost.  Lost 1,000 jobs, lost 1,100 jobs.  There's a $700,000 a year state of Indiana tax break to them and a couple other things.  Trump argued that you're gonna make more money from all my tax breaks I'm going to give companies.  You should stay.  And then one analysis says the Carrier's real fear was losing federal contracts.  Right.  Well, hey.  So a lot of jobs are still going to Mexico, but some jobs are staying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take a break and we'll get our picks in just a moment.  Jeff Jarvis here.  City University of New York.  His blog is BudgeMachine.com.  And I think you probably can't go to Michelin three-star restaurants every night.  Sometimes you have to cook.  Sometimes cooking isn't the most fun thing to do after a nine to five hard work day.  You don't want to go to the store, plan a menu, shop for ingredients, come home and cook them.  That's when you're going to be thrilled you've got Blue Apron on the menu.  I love coming home on Blue Apron Day.  All the ingredients to cook an amazing meal.  And see the recipe card is awesome because it's got every picture, step-by-step instructions.

Blue Apron's mission is to make incredible home cooking accessible to everybody.  While supporting a more sustainable food system.  Setting the highest standards for ingredients.  And building a community of home chefs.  I gotta go to the menu.  I love every week looking at what's on the menu.  Sauteed beef and potato latkes with roasted beans and carrots.  They have family plans as well as plans for couples.  So that's nice because that means you can cook for your family too.  Harissa, let me look at the family recipes.  They're more kid-friendly ingredients like, oh look at that.  Spiced catfish tacos with roasted sweet potato and coleslaw.  I hate doing this ad at lunchtime.  You're keeping me for dinner.  I know.  I know.  Broccoli and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pork rib burgers on pretzel buns.  I do want that.  Pretzel buns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about...  Now this is a vegetarian.  They do have vegetarian entrees too.  Broccoli and white bean burgers with cheesy roasted potato.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yum.  Veggie burgers made from bites of broccoli and creamy white beans.  And then they even recommend a wine to go with it.  The wine's on you though.  Blueapron.com slash twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stay on the food for one second.  Yes.  So I'm enjoying a meme that's growing as we speak.  Kellogg's pulled advertising from Breitbart because of what Breitbart is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't even believe they were advertising on Breitbart in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't either.  It may have been through exchanges.  Right.  So Breitbart is now running a big boycott campaign against Kellogg's.  You can't stop eating cornflakes.  I say liberals, California, the Upper West Side of Manhattan and Brooklyn,  let's empty the shelves of Kellogg's, us coastal liberals.  So now everybody's debating, well, what can I safely eat?  What's OK?  Somebody said, well, Kellogg's is in a horrible position because no liberal is going to admit eating fruit loops.  So I had a tweet that lists all of Kellogg's brands and how people are trying to figure out what they can eat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Special K, All Brand.  There's some good stuff in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dan Gilmore was looking for something healthy and I said, he's not allowed to tell me that Cheez-Its aren't healthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Egg-O waffles.  Yeah.  Pringles potato chips.  So Black Bart has declared that Kellogg's hates its 45 million readers.  It can't be that many.  No.  That's got 45 million monthly conservative readers.  So dump Kellogg's.  Sign the petition to dump Kellogg's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What good does the petition do?  You don't buy it if you don't want it, but buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nutri-Grain Pop Tarts, Rice Krispies, Cheez-Its, Kashi.  I like Kashi.  Apple Jacks.  Frosted Mini Wheats, Morning Star Farms, Famous Amos Cookies, Mother's Cookies, Keebler, the Keebler Elves work for Kellogg's.  Who knew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're liberals.  I knew they were liberal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Low Fat Granola, of course.  Apple Jacks, Muselix, Smart Starts, S'mores.  I don't eat any of this stuff.  All this stuff will kill you.  I've been boycotting them for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  James O'Malley of Gizmodo said, finally the American left has its own Chick-fil-A campaign.  So it's fun to watch a meme from the birth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's amazing.  We're so good at spreading this stuff.  I feel like Neil Postman was right.  We are amusing ourselves to death.  And this is the final stages of the death throes.  Jay Rosen's mentor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, yeah.  Indie Web Camp is tonight.  This is what I'll do Kevin Mark's picks.  If you are interested, IndieWeb.org.  I am all for this.  Promoting an independent web instead of a monoculture.  The website meetings are on a regular basis.  Tonight in Ski Pole in Amsterdam, in Baltimore, Maryland, Brighton, England, in Gothenburg, Sweden, and San Francisco.  And then December 7th in Nuremberg.  I would go to Nuremberg just for that meeting and some sausages.  And maybe a beer, a nice beer.  Yeah.  A little beer and brats.  Your number of the week.  So, alright, so one fun, one just serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The serious one first.  So there's a lot of talk obviously about fake news.  I have a couple issues with this.  I just want to put on the record.  One is that a lot of things are getting thrown into the fake news bucket that I don't think are fake news.  We talked about this last week.  There was a blacklist that included the Onion and Private Eye.  You see, that's not fake news.  It's comedy.  No, and I like my Democrats, even though they're not journalistic and they've done some things that are wrong, they're not fake news.  They're partisan and partisanship is not fake.  Partisanship is being a citizen, is having an opinion.  So I need to be very careful of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing that's why I've been against from the very beginning, this idea of let's clobber fake news because it worries me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's let's get more truth, more facts.  Though you convinced me today more facts may be bad, but I generally believe more facts are good.  So but what also struck me too is the courts did an analysis of traffic to these allegedly fake news and hyperpartisan news sites web traffic.  Well, the thing about occupied Democrats lesson I learned when I interviewed them is that the web track, they make money on the web traffic, but it's otherwise meaningless.  There's a lesson here for big media and the lesson for big media is use the same devices.  Yes. Do the same things.  Make memes, make them truth bullets, add journalism and get in the middle of people's conversation.  So I just wanted to make that point on a number of things.  And now to a more fun number.  Ariana Huffington, who left the Huffington Post a couple months ago, launched her new company, Thrive, pretty much today, Thrive Global.  And she has, she's selling things.  She's including a $100 bed for your phone.  Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Ariana.  What the what?  That's dopey.  Two colors.  Is do you have to assemble it like your Ikea furniture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. I was thinking a hundred bucks.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is we have I'm telling you it's end times.  It's the end times.  Sleep well after using that.  Yeah.  Nero is fiddling while your phone is sleeping on its little bed.  Geez.  Sometimes I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She has a muse brain sensing headband.  She also has Jeff Bezos writing for her.  What?  Why getting eight hours of sleep is good for Amazon shareholders.  Oh, Lord.  Is this Thrive.com?  It's an interview, a Q&A.  Thrive Global.  Thrive Global.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well-being, wisdom, wonder.  Why do you think she left the HuffPo?  I don't know.  I suspect a lot of it was just the politics of, you know, A-Wall Verizon.  Yeah.  But, you know, I wrote a piece last year, a year ago now, saying come back, Ariana, come back.  We need you in American politics.  We've lost your voice.  Stop trying to be Oprah.  And no, no, I can be both.  I can be both.  But she left politics almost entirely aside.  And I don't know if that was, I've never known.  My guess is it was corporate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's, by the way, another piece about sleep.  Apparently Thrive is going to be about sleeping well.  This was by Sheryl Sandberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lean into your bed.  Lean into your phone bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's definitely pulling all of her, pulling all of her contacts.  Here's a Marie Kondo article.  By the way, Thrive is publishing its articles on Medium.  Why wouldn't you?  Ev's going to do well with Medium, I think.  Marie Kondo is the tidy expert.  Some would say tidy nut.  Yeah, and the stuff they're selling is just ridiculous.  So it's a sleep blog.  All right, my tip for you is congratulate Mike Elgin because he is a grandpa.  Monday, his son Kevin Elgin and wife Nadia had a baby girl unnamed, at least as of that post.  Now, one reason I saw that post is because of my tip.  If you're on the, it's harder to do this on mobile, but if you're on the Facebook website,  click that little drop down arrow next to newsfeed and you can choose top stories or chronological stories.  Here's another, here's a meme.  I have to say chronological, well, it looks like there's only one post in my chronological feed, so that's a lousy tip.  But viewing them chronologically brings back all those posts that were algorithmically being dumped from your Facebook feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it still complete or is it a chronological view of the one selected?  Well, that's a good question.  It's always been my understanding that it's...  It used to be on the right.  You had, wait, what happened to the right column?  It used to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Facebook's having some issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe there used to be a column on the right.  It's way on the right here.  It's the full feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Yeah, you have to go to newsfeed and chronological view most recent.  And that way though, it seems to me that way you get all the stuff because the minute you go to the top news, you lose half the stuff that you're seeing in the chronological.  So just seems to me that's the way to do it.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a brief but I think quite enlightening this week in Google.  You see, it's Stacey's.  The blabbermouth slows us down.  No, just kidding.  Stacey, we hope you feel better.  Yeah, poor Stacey.  She got a last minute migraine.  But she'll be better.  I'm sure by next week we'll get her back in the fold.  You can find Stacey at staceyoniot.com.  Stacey Higginbotham.  And of course, Jeff, you'll find it buzzmachine.com.  That's where he blogs and on Medium.  Are you writing much these days?  It feels like you kind of back.  Not as much.  You kind of maybe just sitting back and watching and ruminating.  Or are you just busy teaching?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that and medians and travel.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I like your blog post.  So don't stop.  Don't stop posting.  Yes, sir.  I like it when you're angry.  Others don't.  Others don't.  Of course they don't.  But that's look at Twitter is full of people who don't like anything.  It's an outrage machine.  So you shouldn't post on Twitter and then pay attention to what people say about your posts on Twitter.  That's crazy.  And the thing I like about you, Jeff, is you do post a lot on Twitter.  So if you follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also have a post I want to write.  I'm thinking about writing is that is that you know, we've talked about a lot because I on this in this election, I chose to go full bore in.  Yes.  Was that a conscious?  It was a conscious choice.  Very much.  Very much.  And I've had opinions for years.  I've been a columnist and a blogger.  So the opinions been out there for years.  I've been hoping about that.  But I went further in.  And it meant that it meant something different to me.  And I'm reclaiming my citizenship.  And with it, I'm feeling emotions and anger, which I guess makes me more empathetic to the anger of other Americans.  And it's hard to tamp it down sometimes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in my opinion, we need both.  We need reportage, fact based reportage, and we need people's opinions.  And as long as they're both labeled clearly, I don't have too much trouble with either.  In fact, even one person can do both.  I just don't like it when it's mixed.  My reportage is mixed with opinion.  Yes.  Hard for me.  What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Distinguish.  Did you have Mike Elgin news?  Did I have it?  Yes.  I just see it on my Facebook feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's what I was just saying.  That was my that he had a grandchild.  Yeah, the picture.  Yes.  Yes.  You must have passed out during that moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You sent me to change the feed.  I was changing the feed.  Oh, you're busy changing the feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the first thing you saw is Mike Elgin had a grandchild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I remember the side of my eye.  Princess Squishy Face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't have a name for her.  Mike's going to be a good grandfather.  I am thrilled for him.  Except the sad thing is he was staying in the United States until the baby was born.  Now I'm afraid we'll have lost him to his digital nomad lifestyle.  I think that baby can hold on to him.  Yeah, you know what?  Maybe you might be right.  Jeff, always a pleasure.  Have a wonderful evening.  We'll be back next Wednesday.  Wednesday, 1 30 Pacific, 4 30 Eastern, 21 30 UTC.  That's when we do this show.
