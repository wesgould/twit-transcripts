You know we use the word Google very loosely in this title.  Anything we want to talk about right? Right. Right. Hey look who's here Jeff Jarvis. He's not pink.  My cameras usually make me very pink. I see him a lot. Jeff is in town and it's nice to have him.  Jeff Jarvis Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York. The author of Public Parts and What Would Gutenberg Do.  No no that's another book you haven't written yet. It's good to have you. It's nice to be here. It's wonderful to be here. I love being here with my guy.  And you have brought your boss. Sarah Bartlett is also here. Currently the Dean of the School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  But I was just first of all somebody in the chat room said oh Sarah's book is great. You've got to read The Money Machine.  That's nice. So you have fans. I have at least one fan out there.  This is the story of the guys who invented the leverage buyout practically. Colbert, Kravis and Roberts.  And really the beginning of the end of the financial markets. But it also says here that you were a reporter at Fortune, Business Week in the New York Times.  Assistant managing editor at Business Week for six years and editor in chief of Oxygen Media.  That's all true. They didn't lie. No it's actually accurate. When did you go into academia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I started at Baruch College which is part of the City University Network in 2002.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You decided that journalism was over or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No I needed an income that was steady and stable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You needed a job. You chose academia.  Well anyway that's great. Was it your inspiration to bring Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can't take no credit for it. He was the first professor hired at the school and I was the second.  I could thank him maybe for not shutting the door on me. Now the tables have turned and I can inflict whatever pain I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's nice to have you both in the studio. We're going to ask what you're doing out here besides fleeing the snow.  Poor Gina.  Gina has not fled. She's bundled up in mom's basement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hi Gina.  I'm doing a podcast from my mother's basement. I'm owning it. You see my mom's tchotchkes up here.  The jet's low. It's all the way across the room.  I'm surrounded here by all my mom's old pictures. My mom loves me and I'm here in her house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The irony of all this is mom is in Florida.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She's like are you watering the plants honey? Good.  There's extra snow boots in the closet.  Make sure you lock the door at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when we left you last week you were running off to buy your house in Park Slope. Is that done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes I was. It is done. The closing is done. I am officially very much in debt.  Happily in debt and responsible for shoveling the snow tomorrow which will be fun.  I'm a brand new homeowner. Really excited. We're not quite moved in yet because our stuff is still in a truck  or getting loaded into a truck on its way from San Diego but will be moved in soon.  There's a lot of home improvements in my future so I'm very excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well here we are gathered together. I think we're going to spend a little more time than we usually do talking about journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Watch out. Get the coffee now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love this stuff and as I watch NBC botch the Olympics yet one more time  spending more time on Bob Costas' pink eye than on some of the stories in the Olympics.  That's what that is? Come on.  It's so disgusting. It really is.  This morning on the Today Show they actually interviewed him about his pink eye and I thought this is not news.  No.  Anyway I guess when it's the Olympics it's not news either really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They did the opening ceremony again in two ways. I don't know if the AP called me.  They took out the human rights statement from the opening.  Interesting.  Which is a problem. They did the same thing in the London Olympics where they bollocked it up.  Why did they do that? Oh because it's too boring for Americans.  That's what I thought. I guess.  They also took out the police choir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this made me mad because Lisa said hey did you see the Russian police choir singing Daft Punk?  I said I saw them singing the Russian national anthem. What do you mean Daft Punk?  She said no they did. I said no that's a mashup. She said no they did.  I mean it's online you can see it but it was not on TV.  Okay so I wasn't crazy.  You weren't crazy. I thought what the hell happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Associated Press called me to talk about this and said  Why did they cut that out?  I think it was just a dumb mistake because they said it got millions of views on YouTube.  Yeah.  And so they said  They don't understand their audience.  No they don't. They don't. How could you miss that?  Plus the great thing about all these things is it's these  and I say this with no disparagement but it's these gay moments in the Olympics  that you want to celebrate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just thought it was really funny because this is the Russian police choir.  I presume these are all policemen.  They certainly have the greatest hats in the world.  The big big big Russian police hats.  Is Chad looking for it now?  They're wonderful.  And then what you see is you see the younger guys are really getting into Daft Punk.  Right.  I don't know if they understand the lyrics.  I'm here to get lucky. I'm going to stay all night to get lucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's hard to understand about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it didn't translate.  I mean this is a song about getting laid.  Anyway they're singing that and then the older guys who are clearly  Gorbachev here or maybe even Khrushchev here  God knows what they've done.  are kind of like standing there like puzzled and maybe a little put out.  It's fascinating.  It's fun to watch and why NBC cut that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well they have this chance to edit the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wasn't there also a technical glitch where one of the rings  that the lit rings didn't open and didn't they edit in the version from the crowd?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Putin asked NBC to photoshop the ring and NBC at least in this respect said no.  Yes.  At least show some integrity and said no.  However the official Russian version included the rings opening up  from the rehearsal instead of the failed ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right where it worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we saw the open.  And immediately you saw the t-shirts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the jokes about the fifth ring came out.  There we have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  This is the Russian police choir.  Turn it up a little bit because I think we should all enjoy it.  Daft Punk is performed by 100 straight Russian policemen.  Except for that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the only clip that I have.  Everything else has been taken down.  Oh really?  By Daft Punk?  Yeah.  So like this version.  That's why NBC didn't show it.  This looks like the full version.  It was a rights issue.  It was a rights issue.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a rights issue.  All the money.  All the money.  Of course.  So my, okay this isn't really this week in Google at this point  but what the hell.  Am I wrong in seeing a little bit of bias on the part of American media?  Anti-Russian bias.  I'm thinking of before the Olympics began the Sochi problems Twitter feed and all of these.  The Canadian did that.  Let's be clear.  But many of these pictures turned out to be spurious.  Yes they did.  Many of these stories turned out to be spurious.  And then it seems like even as we've gone through the Olympics there's kind of this,  maybe it's hereditary because they were our enemies for so long during the Cold War.  Maybe it has, I think nominally it has to do with the anti-gay propaganda.  I don't think Putin is beloved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Pussy Riot did brilliant PR timing to be in the US and on Colbert.  Did you see Pussy Riot on Colbert?  Amazing.  I didn't.  Amazing.  Did they sing?  What did they do?  How you can be funny in simultaneous translation.  That's awesome.  And both sides of it did it.  It's amazing.  It's just amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I gotta look that up.  Isn't that a real surprise that we would have somewhat of a negative slant on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I gotta admit, emotionally, I'm rooting against Putin.  You know?  And that's the same story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you hear all the stories about it's so warm there, everything's terrible, the hotel  handles fell.  By the way, we didn't hear anything more after the Olympics started about hotel door handles  falling off.  It just stopped.  Maybe they're out working.  Maybe they fixed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I don't...  Well the greatest story is that it was the luge guy who had to break through the door.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Punched the door.  Yeah, punched the door right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it does.  No, I think you're right.  The door won't open, pow!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, there's not a whole lot of stories there.  Except there is one text story there which was that Richard Engel, who normally I think  is a very good correspondent at NBC, did a story which seemed to me to fail one of the  critical tenets of good journalism.  You tell me, Sarah Bartlett, you're a Dean of journalism, that it sounded like he went  into the story knowing what it was going to be about, knowing what story he wanted to  tell in the face of all facts he told it, and they did it with editing.  So this is the story he did about hacking hackers in Russia.  And the premise of the story going in was if you bring a computer, don't bring any electronics  to Russia because it will be hacked immediately.  Now he did mention that we're not in Sochi.  We're in Moscow, a thousand plus miles away.  They brought in a guy from an antivirus company, which right there is probably a mistake, but  he's a technical expert.  He set up a Windows machine and a Mac machine, no updates.  They also got an Android phone.  And what happened, although you didn't see it on camera, was he had Richard Engel go  to malicious sites on the Windows and the Mac machine, download and run software.  What they showed on screen was he didn't do anything.  It just turned on the computer and now it's hacked.  Now maybe our Android fans will understand even better on this.  He had him in the Android phone go to the setting, you know that setting, Gina, where  you check the box that says allow third party downloads.  He unchecked that box, not checked by default, he checked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it said, are you sure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it gets a big warning, this could be dangerous.  And then he went and downloaded a known malicious app.  Okay.  And then all of this is edited out.  Then he shows that he's been hacked.  So in other words, he did, he did stupid things on all three systems, known stupid things  and edited out the doing of them.  And by the way, you could do this sitting right here, every one of those.  It has nothing to do with Russia or Russian hackers.  Yeah.  So it felt like, it felt like a hit piece.  I think Engel is a better journalist than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Total lack of transparency to what he was doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, one of the reasons we know what he did is because the trend micro guy expert, I think  felt guilty about it and blogged at all.  Oh, is that working?  Oh, by the way, here's what really happened.  That's a bad precedent to set where I'm going to prove a story true and I'm going to edit  my piece to make it safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then I'm going to hide my tracks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To this day, as far as I know, not in any way apologize, despite a lot of criticism,  not only from us, but from security experts, the trend micro expert and others.  So, although a lot of people felt like the worst part was, go ahead and show this Chad,  him ripping the box open.  Richard Engel apparently doesn't understand.  He opened a MacBook Air box.  He tore into it like it was a FedEx package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's just wrong.  That's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's wrong.  Aesthetically violating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's where the big cringe factor was.  I don't know.  I guess we can't.  That's fine.  We can't find that.  I just I feel like to me, this is part of a larger pattern of let's figure out how to  make Russia look as bad as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But is it also a way to make technology look bad too?  Is it?  It could be that.  It's a chance to scare people about how dangerous technology is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think it's sort of broader than that.  I think there's sort of failures of journalism that we see every day and we just happen to  notice them more because everybody's focusing on the Olympics.  But these are these are problems that we see across the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is this is bad journalism.  Standard operating procedure for networks.  Oh, it's not hurt.  He just tore it open the box.  Oh, no, no, no.  These are carefully made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's 20 designers who designed that back box flap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right.  I mean, I don't know.  There's not much more to say about that.  It's not really TV news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty bad.  That's pretty much what it is.  It also is kind of a truism that if you are an expert in a field and you watch television's  version of it, it will always be wrong and confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's also the news magazine problem.  I think whenever I bought a Time magazine, you know, I'll be interested in that cover  story is what I know.  Of course, was always just the stones getting water.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, as a good example, Time just published an article about quantum computing in which  they kind of say, this is going to change the world as soon as they can make it work.  It's just like cold fusion.  Yeah.  As soon as somebody invents it, will you let me know?  And then we'll talk about what it can do.  All right.  Let's continue on.  It's interesting.  Actually, Google had a little bit of a response to the anti-gay propaganda law in Russia.  They changed their homepage.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They rarely do to advocate and they did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think that's what it was?  It was it was it was about that was presumed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, you know what?  I looked at it again and it's not is it really the rainbow colors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is the rainbow.  I actually figured out red, orange, yellow, blue, green, indigo, violet.  But it's a little subtle.  It's a little subtle.  I thought that might be the Google colors.  Is that the Google colors?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder whether it was the colors of sport tabs or something.  But no, that would be the case.  So yeah, it's the rainbow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In what country was it war rainbow uniforms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Germany, although they said that was we just like the rainbow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a statement.  It just feels that it's yeah, we had to compete with Ralph Thornlund's ugly sweater.  So we had to do something ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There it is.  They are really ugly.  There's there's a great Twitter handle nine.  And he went crazy on this.  What has happened to Germany?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought the German skaters had lovely little shifts.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's my thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, good news.  Here it is.  A Nexus seven.  Jeff Jarvis can finally use his on the Verizon network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we'll see because they're now going to sell.  I'm not saying no.  They're going to they're going to they've announced finally that they're going to sell  them or I think it's been leaked that they're going to sell.  Right.  What I don't know is when I walk in with my Nexus seven that I didn't buy there.  Oh, they won't.  I don't know.  That's my last test.  What are they going to do?  Six months, six friggin months.  It took these bozos to say that this works on the network when it takes two seconds to  put a friggin sim in and it works fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You my request, Jeff, is that you wear Google Glass.  This interaction.  Hey, this is what you're talking about in your in your medium series.  I want you to stream this interaction with the Verizon salesperson live on Google Plus.  OK, please.  And let us know beforehand what time it's going to be so we can all see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you I mean, you you approach the FC approach you wrote to the FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a complaint on file with the FCC, which I still think is valid because Verizon did  not.  It took six months to maybe follow the dictates of the auction for LTE Spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was part of their agreement that if they were to buy the 700 megahertz spectrum, the  C band, that they would be an open network on that band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  And Google, don't forget, forced that right when Google entered into the auction for that  spectrum.  Google put in the requirements for for openness and then pulled out.  That's why Verizon got it right.  So they didn't follow the dictates.  And I think they should still be punished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the FCC's response to you was?  We'll look into it.  Silence.  Nothing.  Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, they get so many letters from Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's probably put it in the jar of his basket.  You know what that is, right?  Yeah.  The round file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's not in priority inbox.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not going to say where it was in our trip here.  I've heard of a startup in a technology company in this area that tries to ban garbage cans.  OK, why?  I guess because there's too much garbage, too much garbage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, but that doesn't eliminate the garbage, just the place to put it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the person who told me said it was kind of motivates you.  You get that that that Mac.  Maybe you think about tearing the box off before you take it in the office.  You don't throw it away because you can't throw it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you throw it away at home.  I know it doesn't or if the garbage is no, it doesn't.  Or you throw it on the floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, garbage.  Maybe it's that a horrible addition on every email.  Think before you print.  Then. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, I hate that.  I hate that.  Yeah. First of all, who the hell prints email?  Somebody apparently that's a signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The person who's sending you the email is not very savvy.  Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  William Randolph Hearst, the third, used to you'd send him an email.  His secretary would print it, bring it to him.  He's very technically, too.  But this was just like service.  I know people like that. Yeah.  And then he read it and he'd write a response and then she'd go type it.  I think he's gone behind beyond that, by the way.  Now, I think he actually uses email.  Well, it's a good friend.  So I'll report back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I will. I will go into a Verizon store and I will report back.  Now, the Google Glass, someone should tape it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gina Google Glass.  I think I mentioned last week that I talked to somebody from the team  after my rant about that, and I'm seeing the team in Mountain View on Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'll see what that that could be a little uncomfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're more responsive than the FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's darn true.  I got priced my lenses for the Google Glass.  Four hundred thirty five dollars. Yikes.  So it's two fifty for the frame, two and a quarter for the frame,  fifteen hundred for the glass and four thirty five.  You add it up. I don't know how to seven or eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a lot. It's like twenty three hundred bucks.  Something like that. Yeah.  For a pair of glasses. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Last night we had Jacob Applebaum on All About Android  and he just got his custom frames and he got his lens fitted  and he has his V2 glass and he loves it.  He does. So, yeah.  So I actually I refer our viewers to back to the last week show  to hear your rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Jacob, Jacob, somebody I got to listen to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. To your credit, Gina said, hey, well, Jeff hates him.  You should watch Twig and see.  But Jeff said all the things that you did.  I mean, Jacob said all the things that you like. Jason.  Jason Applebaum. Jason.  Like he said, they shouldn't bend because one side wouldn't bend  and the other side would. And that would be crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did he like the gigantic five gallon case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We didn't talk about the case.  You know, he's he's a pretty he's been in touch with the developers  and he's he's he's an engineer really himself.  So I think that he has and he has empathy for the developers  and how difficult a problem it is to install a hinge, for example,  in the electronics, which is obviously not something  that a user or consumer should worry about.  And he did say that, you know, when it's at the point  that it's a consumer product, it absolutely the arm should bend.  There has to be a better solution than what they have right now.  But he was sort of marveling at the fact that they were able to get it  as far as they have right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is just it's one hell of a Newton.  Yeah, I still I still hold that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What happens when when Jeff wears glass into the office?  Do you throw him out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not at all. But people want to borrow them all the time. Really? Yeah.  My students are in fact, my son told me don't come home if I don't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's all the swag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I keep telling him, I don't think that's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm of the opinion Google will never make a consumer product.  So I think this is more like Google for one one where they're collecting data.  But it's a it's such a prototype.  I think there's so many problems associated with it.  I can't imagine Google trying to sell this as a consumer product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Social experiment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not even that. I mean, you know, Google wants data.  And I think they get from this.  Well, they're going to how people use wearables,  what the reaction is to various form factors.  You saw now Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They would only do that if they wanted to sell something  into the consumer market that was a wearable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, remember that data to Google is valuable in many ways,  besides an actual if somebody else makes the wearable, are they happy with that?  Do they push? Yeah.  But and Google, we just learned this week, does have a patent on a watch.  And and apparently it's fairly close to market, according to some rumors.  So I don't think Google necessarily.  What's going to be special about the Google?  I think here's what I think.  I think Google believes wearables will happen.  Google, the special will be apparently the Google Now cards on the watch.  So Google now on a watch would be actually much more valuable  than anything Apple could do, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Absolutely. Google now and rich notifications,  the way that they appear in your pull down shade on your phone.  I bet that those are going to be integrated into the watch seamlessly  that developers wouldn't have to make a change the way their apps work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gina's so excited she's ordering right now. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't think Google necessarily wants to make a commitment in the wearable space.  They just acknowledge that there is going to be a wearable space  and they want to know how do we this is the smart thing to do.  Remember, a lot of companies got bit by mobile.  They understood how to do a search on the desktop.  They understood Facebook, understood how to do Facebook on this.  And then mobile happened.  And much faster than anybody predicted, all of the traffic went mobile.  And these companies were caught with their pants down.  Oh, my God, how do we make it work on mobile?  So it's assuming that wearable might be the next thing.  Yeah. What we what we need to do at Google, we need to know everything  we can know about how people use it, about what people want, about what works for people  and push the market and push the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is the argument being made about Motorola now.  They used it for the time necessary.  Yes. To push Samsung company.  They did. And it worked. And it worked.  They got what they wanted. Yeah.  They always do.  I, for one, welcome my new masters in Mountain View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Nest acquisition has gone through now.  They're officially the makers of the Nest thermostat and the Nest smoke detectors.  So they are in the hardware business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that's a consumer product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But I mean, this is kind of new to Google.  I mean, I guess Nexus was a consumer product.  These are consumer products.  These tablet Nexus tablets, the Nexus phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think Matt Cutts was saying last week that he would hope that Nexus doesn't go away?  Right. What do you think?  What's your prediction about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I guess this is the same conversation, which is does Google want to be  a product manufacturer, which has its downsize?  Yeah.  Or does Google just want to understand these products to better do what they do best?  Which is more important? This is my question for Matt.  And my question, and I've said this before, which is more important to Google, Android or Nexus?  And they're not going to.  And Matt said, well, they need Nexus because that's how they try stuff out.  That's how they show other handset manufacturers the best, what the best in class can be.  And that may be a good argument for doing it, but I don't think it's a business for them.  Even as it is, it's not a business for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. It's a reference device.  It's not a business.  And it has a strong following of power users and developers, you know, the advocates.  We, you know, we all love the Nexus line.  Regular consumers aren't going to the Play Store and buying Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But, you know, I think that's the point is that we're in a we're in a bubble.  Oh, yeah. And so we think the glass and Nexus is the thing.  Right. But real people, they want to say, oh, look at that guy with a glass.  Can I try it? But they're not they're not going to spend a fifteen hundred bucks on it.  Your students wouldn't spend money on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, they just want to borrow it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, Samsung, how well is the Samsung watch sold?  Is it the same thing? We don't know, but I doubt very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Terribly, terribly. Right.  I mean, you know, the water. It's early days, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, this is this is a market that's going to grow.  So I don't think we can write it off yet. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it was so limited. You had to it had to work with a Samsung device.  Look, if Google if Google comes out with a watch that works with every single app,  you can get in the Play Store as it is with any device running Android.  I mean, just just the compatibility wise.  You know, it's the market is so much so much broader there.  And they can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that's interesting, because that's the argument we were having yesterday  or day before Mac break week, you know, yesterday was if Apple does a watch,  Apple's not going to make an open device.  You will have to have an iPhone.  You will have to live in the Apple ecosystem.  That's how Apple works.  That is not a very compelling device to people like us who want something open.  Pebble I can use with my Apple, but I can also use by the Android. Right. Right.  It's got to be open, I think.  And you have to have partnerships with everybody possible, all the,  you know, run keepers of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you've got to be forward compatible with all kinds of new phones  and new Android operating systems and all kinds of other pains in the butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so do we think Google considers these business or more  a way of learning about its customers, learning what services to provide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're right. It's a way of learning.  The question is, do they want to keep learning for a while?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they may. I'm not saying I probably should amend my thought.  I did think they'd stop making nexus and just use Google Play editions.  But you know what?  They probably will start continue to do nexus because Matt Cutts is no fool.  But it won't be a business.  It'll just be experiments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Does it need to be either or?  I mean, can't they be doing both?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, of course, they could be doing both.  I guess what I'm saying is they can't.  They aren't making money, enough money to make it an interesting business for them.  It's not a billion dollar business.  Microsoft needs billion dollar businesses.  What does Google need?  You know, there was Microsoft doesn't enter a business  unless they think it's a billion dollar business.  Does Google have a metric like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, Google says we want to fail early and try stuff.  Right. And so the question is, it's not when they go into the business,  they'll go into robotics and cars.  The question is, do they stay in the business?  Do they make it a business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it for cars is a good example, because when Google started doing cars,  it was like, woo, yeah, it's turkeys.  Woo. And in fact, now they own that space.  And anybody, Ford or General Motors, anybody wants to do autonomous vehicles,  first place they're going to go is to Mountain View and say, hey, explain.  How does this work? Right.  So maybe that was a smart move from a product point of view.  Yeah. Put some of the lead strategically.  How about this? Google has released a Chrome.  Teleconferencing system.  Watch out, Cisco.  I don't know. Again, this is like, well, what is Google's intent here?  So the idea is the Chrome box for meetings.  It comes with a Logitech HD webcam, not made by Google,  a Jabra speaker phone, not made by Google, a remote control with a keyboard  in the back and uses Google Plus Hangouts for video chat.  And it's all on a Chrome box.  A thousand bucks. A thousand bucks total.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The works with I think a first year free, but then a service fee,  like a two hundred dollar a year service fee to two hundred fifty dollar a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Cloud Services.  Yeah. Which I don't think you'd have to have.  But I guess having that central.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So people saw this last week and said, oh, Leo, why aren't you using that for  it? But then again, what do you get out of that?  That you don't get out of. Right.  My wonderful pixel with its wonderful camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting question. If we spent a thousand bucks, Chad,  we what we do now right now is we Skype, Skype, Omatic, we call it,  which is four stock PCs each running in Windows seven with Skype on them.  And when you call in and when Gina's using it right now,  she calls one of those four boxes.  Each of them has their own input on a board and we can bring it up.  Why couldn't those be instead this thousand?  Well, the camera we don't care about.  We have to have video in, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the problem is that we use our own special camera.  What's interesting is in the article, they show two different manufacturers.  They show HP and then there's an ASUS.  So and these little boxes look a lot like the Intel.  The NUC NUCs.  Yeah, the next unit of computing or whatever.  So it may be that there is one of these, you know, NUC style things  that would fit our needs.  But this two hundred and fifty dollar a year thing,  it doesn't seem like this is a separate like basically what we would want  at Twitter is a separate layer of Internet, you know, or we want a server.  Service. Yeah. Google server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. In our basement.  In fact, we're looking at doing it with a Microsoft technology called Link.  Right. That has a server in our basement.  Sorry, dude.  I don't think it'll work on your pixel. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it looks I mean, from the article, and I could easily be wrong.  It doesn't seem like the they bill it as the two hundred  and fifty dollar Google cloud service to make up to make pay  set up as painless as possible.  That doesn't seem like we actually get an actual server  that we could go in there and change config files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And what's the difference between just going out and buying a Chromebox? Right.  That's what I'm thinking, which is one hundred ninety nine dollars.  I don't understand what makes this different.  It may be that the server control is the camera move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, what I bet is, is you can you can give your client a link  and then they will call the setup that that like, well, that's what the services  are. That's what the service is, is that two hundred fifty bucks is called.  Call Google. They'll set it up for you.  This is something that Amazon does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But look at Uber Conference, which is just software.  It's a website that provides a centralized Web RTC hub.  Now, that's only for audio. That's not for video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So right. But I've seen this before.  Who is it? I believe that it's Adobe does a connect.  Adobe Connect. And they you can call them on the phone  and get technical help if you're not if you're not connecting.  And that's what I think that the two hundred and fifty dollar service is,  is if your CEO needs to call a technical line,  they they have some place to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To be honest, that's what the thousand bucks is also because it's just a kit.  Companies feel better. Like, oh, we bought the kit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. And it looks like there's some enterprisey features here.  The service syncs with Google Calendar and in the future,  Microsoft Exchange to display the schedule of upcoming meetings.  That's nice. You can start a new meeting by typing a meeting name to the terminal.  And it tells you when the next meeting is scheduled to begin.  So it warns you if someone's muted and they start speaking, they get a warning.  So it sounds like it's got a couple of like little bells and whistles  that you'd want in a corporate teleconferencing environment  that that vanilla Hangouts doesn't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again, I think that this is for Google, not a product per se,  in the sense that they think this is a line of business  as much as an experiment. Right.  And which we learn stuff. Their business is data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they want people using Hangouts. Right.  And if it means getting getting into conference rooms for super cheap.  I mean, this is cheap compared to very cheap.  So what does Cisco say to this? You're sitting there and this goes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  by the way, like twenty thousand dollars. Yeah.  So what's the difference between this and what Cisco offers you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Cisco probably has a lock on enterprise because they're Cisco  and because you, you know, you have the Cisco guy comes and sets it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some geek in the company at some point says, well, it's too geeky.  Oh, it's a geeky, geeky solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't want to you don't want to you don't want geeks to run your business  because then they they, you know, they're they're they'll save you too much money.  They save you money. Strange. Yeah.  They don't they don't dress properly.  Wear brown shoes. So your sponsor, Citrix, probably says, ha,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  this makes us look nice and cheap and it's actually tough for Citrix.  Of course. Well, I would think it's competitively good for them  in the sense that they say if you're already using introduces the idea,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you're already using Citrix, then why would Citrix does it all software? Right.  Right. All software solution.  And it is much less expensive than Cisco. Right.  So and it but GoToMeeting, which is their conferencing product, is  is considerably cheaper than Cisco.  So that's always been their problem.  And it's one of their I think it's their best selling product.  I think that.  I don't know. I don't think businesses are as price sensitive as you might think.  Yeah, I don't think that they go, well, there's a thousand dollar box  that's built on a three different manufacturers boxes.  They don't want that.  They say I want to call Cisco and say, put it in.  Or, you know, it's just easier for them.  Now, let me ask you this, how important is market capitalization  as a way to judge a company?  It seems like a number that.  Press might like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's very important. Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is to me. OK, well, I'll tell you why.  Google is now the number two most valuable U.S.  company right after Exxon.  Apple briefly passed Exxon, but now is back down.  Google, number two, its market capitalization is three hundred ninety five point  four two billion dollars.  So that's important.  Actually, you know, what it's a reflection of is the increased Google stock price, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know, there's lots of ways to value a company.  You can look at the site or rank them.  You can look at revenues. You can look at profits.  You can look at the stock price.  You can look at ratios.  But I like market cap because it's actually what the market values you at.  So you think that's valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I always feel like the stock market is just kind of like a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it is to some degree.  But I think at the end of the day, you know, of all the different measures.  So are revenues. I mean, so, you know, look at the manipulation  that goes on with earnings.  You know, I mean, if you decide you want to pick some measure,  I would argue that market cap is the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  James Sirawicki in The Wisdom of Crowd says that because it's the crowd,  it is more reliable.  He even pointed out something very I thought that was weird that right  before the Challenger disaster, the company that made the O rings  tumbled in the stock market or no, right after it.  Before we figured out why the Challenger blew up somehow, the stock market,  the wisdom of the crowds knew that it was the O rings in that company tumbled  in the stock market.  And I mean, that could just be weird or it could be that maybe there is some  kind of collective wisdom that the stock market shows.  But it's over the long term, not over the short term. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, you know, the day to day fluctuations of market  cap are meaningless. Right.  But I think to say that Google is the number, you know,  the second most valued company in in this world that we live in is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is reasonable. Actually, that's a good way to put it.  Not the second most valuable company, the second most valued,  valued by the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What about the cash, the cash hoards at Google and its number two?  Where are already and Apple are already included in that price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, if you're an investor, one of the things you're looking at  is how much cash are they sitting on and how have they?  How do I get that?  And how have they? Yeah.  And how have they deployed it previously? How good are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're Carl Icahn, how do I get that?  Actually, he's given up because as Apple did a big buyback,  twelve billion dollar buyback and I can't say no.  ISS said, never mind.  They need this cash.  Don't don't don't deplete their cash reserve.  So I can say, well, all right, I'll take that.  Yeah, they're going towards 19 billion dollar buyback.  Actually, somebody said the other day,  if Apple continues at the rate that they're going, they'll be a they'll go  private in like by 2020.  I don't know if that's going to happen.  Google strikes a big ad measurement deal with Comscore.  Comscore traditionally has been the kind of platinum  ratings company, right, in the in the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And there are smart people there.  And Abraham's  are chairman, now chairman, just gave up the CEO title.  The issue with some of these companies, though, is that they are still based  on more mass media measurements and they're still based on sampling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's as if they took the Nielsen model and applied it to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because you can't measure everybody, but Google can measure most of them.  You can measure everybody.  That's what's interesting.  That's what fascinates me is that Google says there's a measurement we don't have.  Right. And they wanted to go to Comscore to get it.  Part of this is also, I guess, because advertisers buy relative BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Advertisers demand it. That's why. Right. Right.  So Comscore's validated campaign essentials  is the measurement technique that they use, and that's going to be part  of the double click ad network.  And of course, Google owns double click.  The combination says USA Today, and I trust them.  All the best analysis.  You know, they had a Flappy Bird icon as their as their as their as their masthead

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  yesterday. They have a sense of humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to give them credit for that.  The combination will let advertisers and publishers track online ads  in near real time.  That's something you can't do if you're getting the total number.  Right. Samples will let you do that.  Allowing them to change things on the fly if campaigns are not performing  as expected. That's because advertisers pay a dollar  amount per impression. Right.  Or per thousand thousand impressions. Yes.  So they want to know, OK, I'm buying an ad, but the impressions  suddenly went up or down.  How's that going to affect my buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And once we've been out here, we've seen a lot of companies,  including Medium and Twitter and Facebook and NextLink and Google.  More on that later. But but one of the things that's come up again  and again and again, and what Sarah and I have been talking with them  is metrics and the proper metrics.  And this is part of the old I've gone about this before on the show,  the old mass media view of we want volume and we're going to throw ads at them  just like TV.  And what that yields, what that what that brings into the world then  is up worthies and buzz feeds and slideshows and all that crap.  It's just volume for the sake of volume.  And this is still a measurement akin to that along that line.  Whereas we need to figure out how to measure at some level,  some would say engagement.  Ever wrote a great piece a while ago about how they measure total time read.  That's one way to go.  Another another measure we need is relationships.  Another measure we need is relevance.  What's the value of this brand to you?  Does it really give you any value?  I think that the key final metric we got to figure out is  outcomes. Did I did I get something from this that improved my life?  But we're still stuck in this idea of, well, show an ad at you.  And some small percentage of the time that will enter your brain  by osmosis and you'll end up buying this thing we want to sell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This reminds me a lot of the early days of tech TV.  When you're a new cable channel, you're never going to get brand advertisers  because you're unproven.  So you get direct marketing, you get stuff that's measurable.  And that's the state that the Web is currently in.  In fact, podcasts are, too, frankly, most of our advertisers do  a direct response of some form, because an advertiser can say,  well, I got 50 leads from that ad.  So it's worth it.  The return on investment is a clear calculation.  The problem is Ford, Coke, Pepsi, Procter and Gamble.  It's hard for them to say, well, we sold 58 million more liters of coke today  because of the Google ad. They don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But hold on, since Lisa happens to be over here in charge of the business.  She runs this.  So you had Ford for a good amount of time.  They had a branding mission, which was to make them a tech  savvy company that worked for them.  Right. They weren't going for volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  True. But the way they validated that with a lot of research.  So then they go in and they talk to the audience and say, what was the recall?  What? But they and by the way, they have since left  because they told us accomplished. Exactly.  Experiments over. It worked.  We got people understand that Ford sync is high tech.  Well, I wouldn't say it wasn't an experiment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was better than it was an experiment.  You helped them change the perception of the brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they and they knew it worked.  That's why they spent they were with us two years,  almost three years, spent several million dollars with us.  So it wasn't although for Ford, that's less than a Super Bowl ad.  But it was for us a fairly significant investment.  According to this article, you know,  traditional brand advertising is worth three hundred  billion dollars a year.  And Google wants a chunk of that. Right.  Digital brand spending is only 18 billion dollars in 2013.  And so they'd like more of that 300 billion to move over to the digital side.  So would we. Yeah.  And frankly, it's the reason I kind of understand this is because it's  the same issue for us is how do you get a metric to an advertiser  that they understand and will buy?  I agree with you.  Really, the real metric that they care about is is harder to measure,  like engagement and being as things like that.  But it ultimately comes down to results.  They can measure results.  Most of them can measure results.  The direct ones can. But Google wants more brand advertising.  The end game is to end, according to a com scores president,  is to integrate this with TV measurement.  Most of the ad dollars are on TV and over time that will shift to digital.  And you want to measure this in real time across all platforms.  It's interesting.  But probably a little too inside baseball, so I'm going to take a break.  Change log is coming up next.  Gina Trapani, put your change log hat on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Will do.  You can change your scarf.  What do you call it with the lips? The umbersure?  No, the umbrature?  No, what do you do with trumpet?  What's that called? Chat room. What's that called?  What? Umbrature. Umbrature.  Is that what it is? Get your umbratures ready, people.  Well, that's your that's your.  Yeah, because it's trumpets.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, really, I'm sorry, but when I hear a tuba, I just see a guy going

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  into a big tube.  But at least that catches the spit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This week in Google brought to you by 99designs.com.  When I see an app that's poorly designed, I see a programmer who is a good  programmer, perhaps, but didn't understand that he wasn't also a designer.  I saw something on secret this morning that said the somebody who thinks  he's a program designer is good at neither.  You could be great as you could be a great chef.  You could have a great business, but frankly, you need a great designer  to show it off for that landing page, that email template, the billboard,  the T-shirt, the app.  And the best place to go is is that place where two hundred seventy thousand  actually, what is that now? Two ninety two hundred eighty thousand four hundred  and fifty eight designers have gathered waiting to help you look better.  I'm talking ninety nine designs.  If you're worried about budgets, don't worry.  Ninety nine designs, very affordable.  We just did a ninety nine designs contest.  That's what they call them.  Where you go there and you say, I want a hoody design.  We've got how many? I don't I can't remember.  Twenty or thirty designs. We've got sixty.  We've got a ton of them. It was fun going through them.  Great. Cool stuff.  We bought more than the normally you'd say, OK, and you'd work with a designer  say, OK, I'm going to use this one.  We like so many of them.  We bought five of them because we thought we'll use these later.  These are great.  Ninety nine designs is a great way to find great designs, logos, car wraps.  There is there's one of them. I really like that one.  I don't think that what we're having a vote right now,  but I don't think that's going to be the hoodie.  But I think we'll do a T-shirt sometime with that.  I like gorgeous. Yeah. Yeah.  You can go to inside that TV and we know we know it's not done yet.  We think that one's that one.  That one's bold. Isn't that great?  Well, for a hoodie, it needs to be bold.  Like it needs to make a statement. Right. Yes.  These are all from ninety nine designs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Swag store here. There should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We do. You know, we do.  We we we used to have a swag store and we realized.  I'll tell you in a second.  We figured something out that I think really was true.  Projects started at just one hundred ninety nine dollars.  And happiness is always one hundred percent guaranteed.  I want you to boost your brand's visibility, get something great,  something that looks good.  If you're doing an app, please don't do it without help from somebody  who's really knows design.  Go to ninety nine designs dot com slash twig nine nine designs dot com slash twig  and get a ninety nine dollar power pack of services.  Absolutely free.  The power pack gives you more designer time and attention.  They'll bold highlight and feature your design project.  The ninety nine designs marketplace.  That way you get literally about twice as many designs.  Nine nine designs dot com slash twig.  Get that ninety nine dollar value.  We love ninety nine designs.  What we discovered was if you just have a store stuff, stuff sells very slowly.  But if you say we're going to sell this for 30 days and after that it's gone forever.  It works much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it a significant revenue stream? No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's more about about relationship with the audience.  Well, we went to the new Facebook headquarters.  I last I saw them.  They were in the one building in Palo Alto and we drive up.  That wasn't so long ago either.  Wasn't at all. Yeah.  So we drive up and I'm thinking we're both thinking,  sir, is making fun of California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're supposed to tell people, you know, there's an 18 inches of snow coming down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm staying here. You should stay here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the building looks really dull as the old Sun headquarters, I think.  Really dull on the outside.  You get inside, though, and this is great courtyard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's like Disneyland.  That's where their hacker is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly. So so they also they have a swag store now.  Makes me very happy to go in and buy hoodies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I cannot tell you how many.  A lot of people were part of the, you know, the geek trail or whatever it is.  They go to the Hewlett Packard garage.  They go to the Apple company.  But when they go to Apple, they go to the company store.  When they go to Google, they go to the company store.  That's a big. That's why I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Where is your company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't have one, but you can't get in either unless there's an employee with you.  You know why we don't have one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why tax?  I think, right, we don't want to collect sales tax and just a pain in the butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, just deal. It's just too complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Setting up a cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can just give it to us.  That's fine. We do, actually, we frequently do.  Yeah. If I'm nice, I'll give you a hat.  And a shirt. OK, now we're talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We frequently I don't want to say this out loud because we often have live  studio audiences and we frequently give them small parting.  Oh, oh, oh, they're coming up soon.  Pens, keychains, leeching off you.  So we don't want to sell stuff because it's cheesy.  And besides, who needs to make money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we need a special change log trumpet to sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's get you got your on brochures ready.  All right, everybody together now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google now just keeps getting better.  A couple of new updates this week.  You can now choose specific TV and video on demand providers  for viewing recommendations that Google now gives you.  You'll see Airbnb reservations that you may have made that are in your inbox.  You've got simpler alarm controls.  And now you've got information about getting to an appointment on time.  So if I've got my calendar, go do twig at one o'clock.  And Petaluma and Google now will actually show that appointment, which it does now.  But now it'll say, hey, if you're driving, you better leave by noon  before before the car, which is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If it's over a bridge, you better take your medication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, it's over a hyper death.  The Google now needs to say, bring your bring your anxiety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is I thank you for telling me this.  So I'm doing this right now.  My Google now and it says here's here's it already knew my zip code.  Here's the TV providers. Which one do you use?  Where is that? It's in the Google.  Oh, so you press the magic wand. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  yeah, there's there's a lot of good settings in the magic wand. Yeah.  Whoops. I say I have been Google now has become the first thing  that I look at in the morning now, particularly here because of the,  you know, just like the weather and I want to know what the temperature is  and whatever. But I it's getting really good.  It was just showing me news stories that I'm interested in  and showing me stuff that I didn't realize that I wanted.  Really love Google now, Google now.  So always getting better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you can choose your on demand provider so I can check Amazon Prime, HBO, Go.  I didn't get that.  I just got awesome.  That's really right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then and then I'll recommend times and, you know, I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You better leave work now if you want to see Game of Thrones.  I like that. Bye. Show's over.  That's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is a good one. Yeah.  Let's see what else we got.  Oh, we've got a Google search experiment is now showing restaurant menus  inside search results. Yay.  Yeah. So it's an experiment that hasn't gone out to everyone  because I tried it here.  I tried a couple of local joints and then I tried a couple of really famous joints.  I tried Peter Luger and Junior's Cheesecake and I just couldn't see this.  Now, it turns out Google said that this is just an experiment  and it's just going out to a few users, you know, a certain segment of users  are seeing it.  And it looks like an extension of the knowledge graph.  So it looks like they're pulling menu information from all menus dot com.  And we'll show it in line in the in the search result.  Again, I didn't see this.  I don't know if you guys see this.  I don't know if you want to try something near Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do a search chat just to see if you're getting it now.  So you search for a restaurant, search for the social club, our neighbor.  It would have to be somebody who has submitted their menus to all menus, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm.  Nothing.  What's the what's the big restaurant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What would be the most?  I mean, you can also just search restaurants and it'll give you all these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah, but we've already seen that.  What we want to see is also a menu, right? Right.  But like the restaurant graffiti doesn't have anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, so you got the reviews in line there and it just says menu at all menu.  Yeah. This this experiment actually in lines the menu in in in.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is which is an example of what you were saying, Leo, about data.  Right. Google has the data to know that what we always click on is the damn menu.  Right. So we'll give you the damn menu. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Yep.  Another change to search is that Google is showing with great prominence  the first playable music video for your search term in the official channel.  So if you search for Daft Punk at Lucky, the top result is a giant.  What looks to be playable video, it actually isn't a playable video.  It's just a giant image.  You click on it and it takes you to YouTube to play the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it always YouTube or can it be other sources?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It can be other. Well, Vivo is the company.  It can be other sources, but it shows up differently.  So for something that's on Daily Motion,  it will not have the full screen image.  It'll just be a card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it appears that these are usually the official videos,  like the Vivo video and not like user uploaded videos.  That's what you want. Yeah. Right. Right. Exactly.  And finally, a little YouTube update.  You can basically play most embedded YouTube videos on your Chromecast now.  Google quietly rolled out support for setting most web clips  web clips to the Chromecast media stick.  You just need to choose this little button bottom right.  Yeah, you just click on that.  And if there's a Chromecast on your Wi-Fi network,  you'll be able to choose, choose the the target and go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Your gigantic curved screen. Yeah. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The only clips that won't work are live streams,  private footage and desktop only videos, which I guess is a YouTube  YouTube video setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's so funny because I was playing a YouTube video last night.  And normally that lower right hand corner is full screen. Right.  And I hit it and it showed my Chromecast.  I said, what the. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's interesting.  It's an interesting choice of placement for that button,  because I hit that full screen button a lot. Yeah. Right.  So now I'm going to see the Chromecast button.  Actually, you know, funny, not on the change a lot, but sort of related.  I was I was digging through my display setting yesterday on Android.  And if you go into Android settings and you go into display,  there is a setting that says cast screen,  which I got me really excited.  I was like, oh, did I, you know, did I miss this?  Can you can you send your your Android screen to the Chromecast?  You can't yet.  But it looks like that's going to get rolled out.  I guess there's support for Miracast, which is a Wi-Fi.  Yeah. Yeah. So that's what that's what it is.  But they changed it from wireless display to cast screen.  So it seems imminent that you're going to be able to cast your entire Android  screen, whatever you're doing to your TV soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mine just says no nearby devices found.  Do we have a Chromecast on our network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't believe we do.  Can I take your phone?  All right. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It just doesn't work. I try.  I've got a Chromecast here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Only if you take my Pixel 2.  They go together like they're like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This apparently rolled out at the end of 2013, and it doesn't do anything right now.  So but I got really excited and then it didn't work.  So but it looks like that's that's something that's going to be happening soon.  So it's really cool to see the Chromecast kind of opening up  and just, you know, cast cast all the things I say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cast screen. It's in my it's in my Nexus 7 as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  That's all I got. I love it, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So last night I had nothing to do for entertainment.  I went into my Android settings.  That's Gina. That's Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, what I was doing, actually, is I was taking the subway home from work  and catching up on the all about Android episode that I had missed the week before  because I was I had a work thing.  I'd missed the show.  So I was trying to figure out how to lock my screen orientation.  So it was actually a tweet related discovery.  So there you go.  I was watching a Twitch show on my phone and I found a screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's my my new my new phrase I'm going to use all the time.  It was a tweet related discovery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Related discovery.  A lot of my tech discoveries are really discovery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's funny, because you, Gina Tripp, are a tweet related discovery.  Well, thank you.  And that is your Google change law.  Couple of sad notes, of course,  you probably all know that Shirley Temple passed away at the age of 85 yesterday,  that caused me to binge watch the 15 Shirley Temple movies last night.  Did you really know? No. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you have a Shirley Temple in her honor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, the drink, the drink.  The dress cherry juice and ginger ale.  Love that little extra maraschino on the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I also saw some video of her as a as a diplomat,  and she walked like she did when she was in the movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Vladimir Putin, you're a bad man.  The other that's that's my Shirley Temple.  The other sad note,  Sid Caesar passed away today, the great television comedian.  His show of shows really broke so much ground in TV comedy.  And one of the funniest men alive just loved him.  Not only that, but the writers room for your show of shows gave us  Woody Allen, Mel Brooks. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess I shouldn't do this because in the moment of obituary,  one should do nothing but respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But come on, Sid Caesar, he would he would.  This is a guy who had so much fun doing television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, word has it he wasn't a very nice guy, but that's that's fine.  He's a showbiz. But you know what?  You know what? It wasn't the golden age of TV.  He's always always show shows is always playing out as being the golden age of TV.  It was hysterical.  No, it wasn't. Let's watch some right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is Jeff Jarvis TV critic coming. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now I know. Future news, a TV news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? There was a movie called I think it was 12 from your show.  Of shows, they actually put them together in a movie is one of the funniest movies ever.  So I beg to differ.  I beg to differ the from here to eternity where they throw a bucket of water  and image even Coco's face. That's that's comedy gold, my friend. Comedy gold.  All right.  Now, we can agree to disagree on that.  All right. All right.  Anyway, and remember my favorite year, which was the kind of  fictionalized story of being in a writers room of a show similar to.  Yes, which is one of the great movies of all time. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And what that made about about John Stewart and the Daily Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're in a new golden age.  Yes, we are. You know, I interviewed somebody last night in Triangulation,  which was a guy named Brett Martin, who is a feature writer for GQ,  Vanity Fair in the New Yorker. Really great guy.  He wrote a book called Difficult Men, which is about what he calls  the third golden age of TV, which began with the Sopranos.  But the but the thing that changed it was you could suddenly make television  that didn't care about ratings because of subscription TV.  You could actually say, we don't care if the Sopranos generates ratings.  We care if it generates subscriptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's another way to put that.  I think that's true.  But I also think it goes back to our earlier discussion about metrics.  That's a way to get a feedback loop about quality. That's right. Right.  Radians don't give you a feedback loop about quality any more than page views do.  So so you need and we're talking about this with Ev Williams today.  You want a feedback loop to lead to quality.  You want that to be the outcome and some some would say that's just  ah Jarvis that proves paywalls are good for the world.  OK, but it's one kind of signal.  It's one kind of only kind of exactly. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We get a feedback loop.  I mean, the number of people in chat, the number of people  will download our shows. Right.  You know, the engagement of our audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Madam email we get.  What's the proportion of I've asked this before, but I always forget.  People who watch live.  Oh, it's less than 10 percent.  10 percent. OK, people who watch video then or versus listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is varies by show.  Some shows are more.  I mean, this is a talking head show, so it's still more audio.  But iPad today, which is a show about the iPad is more video.  So that really does vary on the content.  What surprises me is how many people do watch video of talking heads  programs like this, the way they're just so pretty.  The video adds nothing to the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I I've had friends and my brother is an avid wig watcher.  And he said that he will mount his his phone to his dashboard  and bring up the video. He said, I do not want to watch.  I want to only watch the show.  I was like, please, while you're driving through Manhattan,  please don't get in action.  Our show. He said, no, I want to see your faces.  I want to see what you're talking about.  It's way better with video.  So I get that. I get that a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't want to do video video.  Audio is so cheap compared to video.  So much easier.  But I also realized that audio doesn't get the attention.  In fact, there was just a great article on dig.  Dig is now doing original content about why audio does not go viral,  but video does go viral. Right.  And it's an incredible piece.  Wasn't it really? And it was the gist of it.  I don't see it.  The truth is, there has been viral video.  You know, Orson Welles,  I love you, you know,  Orson Welles berating the advertising agency.  A gunk. What, sir, is a gunk?  That's fine. A gunk.  But there are very few viral audios.  Yes, that's true. Viral videos.  I don't know if he said why.  I have an opinion why I think to go viral, something has to engage.  It actually got this from Tim Street.  It has to engage your emotions.  The more emotions that anything engages, the more viral it will be.  So if it makes you laugh and makes you cry,  that's better than just laughing.  And I think video is better at engaging the emotions.  Audio tends to be more abstract and intellectual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is another twit discovery  because I think that the presumption is,  and this is in our journalism school,  the presumption is that audio and video are different worlds.  For that matter, broadcast video and web video are different worlds.  We leave that aside.  The audio of it are different things, entirely different skills, and so on and so forth.  And so talking about this show,  the fact that a good proportion of people listen to it rather than watch it.  You know, you miss some jokes.  You miss, you don't see my pink face when I'm on my camera.  You don't see other things.  But the jokes become apparent.  They become known.  So one of my students has a new business idea and he presumed audio.  So I then show him twit and say, you know, I'm not so sure, folks,  maybe you want to do video presuming the option of audio.  And he got all he loved that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was inspired by you.  That's kind of what we've done.  Yeah.  And at great expense, by the way, in order, for instance, this studio,  we don't need it for audio.  Oh, God, no.  And it's a million and a half dollars extra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, folks, it's just a giant chroma key.  It's a giant green screen.  There's nothing really here.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, in Gina's basement.  Yes, I wish we were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That looks like such a cozy, fun, fun place to be.  You could help her shovel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, isn't it that audio is just video is inherently more shareable?  I mean, when you're listening to audio, you're out and about and doing things.  When you're watching video, you're doing it on your computer.  Right. And it's also short video is goes viral.  Right. I mean, Leo, I've seen, you know, your shows do great.  Right. But I've seen I've seen people take clips or do, you know, jump cuts of  moments in your shows, and those go viral because they're short and people just have,  you know, short attention spans and they're seeing them on Facebook or wherever.  But audio just doesn't isn't quite as inherently shareable.  And usually people are downloading it and listening to all their washing the dishes  or walking the dog. And there isn't a share button anywhere for them to press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a challenge for us because video is not all that shareable either.  And we want to we we don't really go viral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's very I don't think the other thing that people don't use enough,  especially for your shows, because they're so long, is share at start moment X.  Right. And you can do that.  You can do it. And I'm surprised it doesn't.  There's not a lot more I think.  Discoverable. It would.  You know, you get to see the rant or you get to see the funny moment.  And and then you might watch the rest.  It's the same thing I wanted to see with articles where we post on us,  which I've talked on the show before.  You can post an entire article.  The next level I'd like to see if that is that David Carr wrote a wonderful piece  on Medium about the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman.  And he had one paragraph in there about addiction that was just brilliant.  So what I wanted to do was to share.  Right. So what I did instead was, of course, I cut and paste it onto Google Plus.  Right. I wanted to embed the article  with that paragraph. Yeah.  I let it right. And then people would probably stay and read the rest.  Same for your show, I think.  Somebody can go in to consider how long our shows in are in, you know,  our four minute, 22 and say, well, that's a really funny moment  when Gina really socked into Jeff.  And then people would watch both ways. Right.  So what you want the audience to do.  Hello, chat room. This is your job now.  Is you want to basically annotate the shows to the good bits.  And you want, I think, a schedule of good bits in the show. Right.  And then share those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you know, viral is as somebody  has a couple of people in the chair are pointing out isn't the goal.  No, as viral is very short term discovery.  What viral gives you is the goal. Yes.  And so I would love share.  I don't care if we get a million views of anything or even 100000.  But but what I want is people discover what we're doing and say,  wow, that Jeff guy is great.  I want to see more of him. Yes. And then watch the show.  So I agree with you.  We'd like but there is mechanically it's very difficult right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this is one of the great metrics for repost on us,  which I don't know if I mentioned the show before.  Poor Sarah's heard it 10 times already this week is is that they find that the  the the click through rate from an entire embedded  post or article, which you think would be zero  because somebody's read the whole article is actually high.  It's five to seven percent. Wow.  Highly obviously highly qualified clicks because somebody says, oh, I like that.  I want to read more. I want to reread it or read more.  I mean, more. I like that article.  Are there more like you at home?  And and and so you go that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's true. I'll click through.  Even if I've read the gist of an article, I'll click through if I want to see more.  Yeah. Or I'm interested in belly fat ads because I don't get enough of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whereas now what's really happening is we have the cynical act.  I'm explaining them again, but up worthy and Charpeyte,  where you just are sharing the headline.  Buzzfeed, Buzzfeed, Buzzfeed, Charpeyte.  Charpeyte is different than Buzzfeed.  Because Charpeyte, however, we know what he meant.  Charpeyte has some great stats.  Well, I think I mentioned this show before where people share before they read.  So what they're really sharing is just the headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not sharing the article. Yeah.  I mentioned that on Twitter this this weekend.  I thought that was a very interesting piece of information.  We also saw this week that  Upworthy has taken a great dive in the number of hits, almost 50 percent  because of a change in algorithm at Facebook.  That's all it took to downgrade Upworthy,  which is apparently not so worthy.  Lived by the sword. Yeah, that's right.  The Upworthy CEO's response was, well, that's it.  We're just going back to normal.  We had a very unusually big December, and that's all you were seeing.  We're going to take a break. Come back with more.  I want to hear about your travels.  You and Sarah's travels around the Bay Area to meet with CEOs  like Ev Williams of Media and and Twitter.  Sarah Barton is here.  She's the dean of the School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  So nice to have you. Bartlett.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not related to President Bartlett.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I always think. President Bartlett.  I like that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Although Dean sounds good, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dean's good, too. Dean's a good title.  I always am scared because I always got brought up in front of the dean.  So I don't you're not that kind of disciplinary.  You do.  She's good at that, actually, yes.  The dean would like to see you now, LaPorte.  Oh, God, again.  Although the dean's list is a good thing.  I was on that other list.  The bad list.  Jeff Jarvis is here from also from the City University of New York  and the author of Public Parts. Indeed.  And a welcome weekly contributor on the show.  So nice to have you in studio. I love being here.  Gina Tripani stuck in Manhattan.  Good to have you two.  Well, you're in Brooklyn today. OK, that's right.  It's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That does not look like Manhattan, Leo.  Let me give you a note.  Paneling is illegal in Manhattan.  It's not allowed.  You can't know Chachkas.  Not allowed. Manhattan, no jets, blankets, not allowed.  Manhattan, only Queens in Brooklyn.  You got to be in the south of that stuff is allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe the Bronx.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bronx. OK, Queens, Queens.  Queens is not no panelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's funny. See, I'm learning about the culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was that was when Bloomberg got rid of the big sodas  that took all the attention. He also outlawed panelling.  Yeah. And Chachkas. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No humble figurines on the Isle of Manhattan.  How is Think Up going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Think Up is going great.  We we demoed it last week at New York Tech Meetup, which is a.  Oh, yeah. How'd that go?  It went really, really well.  I was worried. I heard it was a really tough crowd.  And they were really good to us.  The demo went well. The video was up.  The video. Yeah.  I'm not sure if they chopped it up into individual demos,  but the entire the video of the entire meetup is up.  And we were up against like a sex tech section.  What was like a smart vibrators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was there. You were there.  I was there. I didn't realize that was you.  Yeah, that was me. Oh, wow.  There you go. Yeah. No, it was really fun.  What do you mean up against smart vibrators?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you mean? What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a really complicated concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it a competition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, so the tech meetup is a series of demos from various tech companies  in New York.  And there happened to be and it was actually the first ever.  It was a sex tech section at the end of the night where they.  It was in honor of Valentine's Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, was it was it?  Yeah, sort of a February event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. So basically you go up and you demo in groups of two or three.  And we actually the other company that we demoed with was Lendo,  which is a micro a micro payment loans company.  And they actually got a ton of questions as well.  But it's really it's a really fun. It's a huge event.  It was really intimidating, but it went really well.  So I was happy with it.  And yes. So thank you. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. We still got to hear more about the sex tech, Gina.  You got you got male geeks out here.  You're not satisfying their needs. Yeah.  Let's hear one one stupid tech.  I am so biting my lip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There was a demo.  There was a demo of a smart vibrator.  And I forget.  I forget what the name of it was. Maybe I don't know.  Maybe Sarah, you remember.  And I'm not going to try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to tell you that I don't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's OK. What would you name a smart vibrator?  Tell us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Says the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's just say it's remote controlled wearable tech.  And that's that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was designed by someone who was living in Boston, I think.  And his wife was back in Singapore.  You mean over the Internet?  And so she can help to he can help her achieve an orgasm with the  with the with the remote.  I mean, the Internet, it was it was a riveting demonstration.  It was just a meaning to the word latency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to say the demo, like the the guy who demoed came off.  He was so earnest.  He was and like really was like it was a devoted husband trying to help

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  his long distance wife. What are you going to not like?  Is this Vibes?  Yes, that's it.  That's it. Check it out.  Whoa. All you girls out there.  I know there's I know there's two or three of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a video chat. I don't know.  We dare. Wait a minute. So there's no no, don't show that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So there's my favorite moment of the demo was a was a point at which he said,  and we even talk to women about, oh, well, it's a bad time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I thought, oh, I was like, so it was a little, you know,  there was sort of a bit of an anticlimactic moment, if I may use that term,  because they announced at the beginning at the beginning, they said, OK,  anyone with young people, you know, children under the age of, you know, X,  you really need to leave the room now because we're going to have this special sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Imagine listening to 50 Shades of Grey with a hands free vibrator

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that vibrates in perfect sync with the audio fantasy.  So there's an audio fantasy. Yes, yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you don't need the husband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, that's what I'm saying. You can be 3000 miles away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you don't need a husband at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, he's talking. He's talking over his iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but there's a video. There's there's a fantasy.  There's an audio fantasy.  That's the fantasy. You don't need the husband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, there were a few different options.  Yeah, you could. You've been replaced by a podcast, honey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You could choose different paths.  Aren't you the one who's interested in paths?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's more. There's more than one way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not to in any way overshadow. Think up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you see what she meant when she said, well, yeah, this is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is what I meant by being up again.  It's some tough it was it was it was a really nice demo, honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's wait, wait, wait, it's way. Oh, no.  Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no.  That's too much. So it's wearable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's 100 percent hands free experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is. It is indeed wearable.  It's wearable tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I'm just going to get fired for being in a  I wasn't work work environment.  The dean is here. It's OK. Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I didn't mean for this to go so it was the topic of my faculty meeting.  Now you've blown it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's an app for it.  That's what I think kind of interesting is has an app, Android or iOS.  I'm surprised Apple approved that, to be honest.  Seems like that's something Apple wouldn't approve.  They don't believe in people having.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think they had some problems with it, actually.  And then, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was part of the discussion was like how to legitimate  consumer products that are related to sex deal with, you know,  things like app store policies and even just getting getting, you know,  payment processors and different web services.  You know, a lot of the companies just won't won't work with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bet they only have problems in the US, though.  I think. No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She said globally, they have a problem.  Really? Not in Germany, not in Germany.  I think she was saying, I mean, there was a woman who I forget her name  who came up afterwards and was quite passionately, you know, annoyed about  how how the financial world, which sort of shied away, anti-sex.  Correct. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's right. A lot of negativity about sex, especially by bankers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's all the more impressive that you did so well, Gina.  Yeah, that's that's a tough act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let me ask you, how's think up doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Think is going really well.  Thank you. We have a last week. It went awesome.  We're going to open up and sign up to the public in the next couple of weeks.  It's going really well. Thank you for asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you. Thank you.  And damn you, Jarvis.  You couldn't let you couldn't let slide, could you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, not only is this slide one, though, I'd say  this episode, we'll be back with more in just a bit.  This episode of This Week in Google is brought to you by the financial markets.  Personal capital, actually, personal capital was started by  I want to say Ed Harris, but he's an actor.  That's right. The other Harris,  who was former CEO of Intuit and PayPal, learned a lot about people  and how they use money, talk about collecting data.  And after he left Intuit, he started a personal capital.  We had him on our show, Triangular Bill Harris.  That's it on triangulation.  About a year ago, he told me about personal capital.  They were just starting up. And I said, this is great.  I signed up for it immediately.  The idea is your financial life as you get older, as life goes on,  gets more and more complicated, more loans, more stocks, more bank accounts,  more charge cards.  And each one is on an individual site with a separate password.  Very hard to keep track of it or even see it as a whole.  Personal capital collates all that information into a single page  where you could see exactly how you stand, all your accounts,  all your assets on your computer.  They have great apps on your phone or your tablet.  It's real time, intuitive graphs.  And then once you understand where you stand,  you can make sense of your investments, of how to plan for your future,  how to plan for your retirement, how to build your assets.  If you're overpaying in fees, it'll show you where you're overpaying  and how you can reduce those fees.  You can get tailored advice and optimizing your investments.  It's a really great idea.  And I want you to try it free right now.  Costs you nothing.  Personal capital dot com slash twig.  Personal capital dot com slash twig.  It's a smart way to grow your money.  And I don't care how young you are.  This is something you got to start thinking about.  It's I wish I'd been, you know, kind of savvy about 401Ks  and investments and stuff when I was a young guy.  If you start putting money away now, just a little bit.  It really adds up personal capital dot com slash twig.  We thank Bill Harris and the personal capital team for their support of this week  in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Little little news update here.  I see from Twitter, Lee Ball sent in a update that  there's a new Android update for the next seven  to improve compatibility with Verizon's four G LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that goes to all next.  I should actually check this.  It goes to all. I didn't have it on mine.  I guess it would. Yeah, sure. Yeah.  Well, unless you're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  Because it's the same same technical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine doesn't have LTE.  So even if I got it, it wouldn't be much use to me.  But you've got your next seven there.  So check it. It's on.  It's one of the worst dances that we tech geeks do where you go update.  Is there an update now?  So update now. How about now?  It's so frustrating.  Very, very frustrating.  So a very interesting news story coming out.  In fact, this morning on Windows Weekly,  we talked about it that at Mobile World Congress,  which is just a couple of weeks off,  Nokia will show a phone based on Android Nokia, by the way,  about to be acquired by Microsoft as soon as the Chinese government approves it.  This is something Peter Bright and ours, Technica said could never happen.  He wrote an article said, and I thought it was a great article.  Neither Nokia, Microsoft or anyone else should fork Android.  It's un-forkable.  His point being, there's two parts to Android.  There's the Android open source part and there's the Google services part.  And yes, this AOSP part of Android is free and open.  It can be put on any device. Amazon did it and forked.  But you don't get if you do that, you don't get any of the Google services,  which means not just the Play Store and all the Google apps,  but it also means things like location services.  There's an open now, Gina, you probably know better than I.  So so jump in here.  There's open source versions of, let's say, location services.  But it's old and not been kept up to date and probably not very good.  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not as up to date as Google's proprietary layer.  It works.  And but, you know, people who have been writing this article,  that seem this this is sort of a thing that's been coming out over and over  that Google is not really open, that that AOSP is abandoned, where,  you know, we'll say that it hasn't been updated  in a really long time that Google is putting all most of its development efforts  into GMS, that GMS is the Google Google  mobile services, which is that proprietary layer that works on top of AOSP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, even to the point where the launcher now is a GMS app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. The Nexus five launcher is the Google now launcher.  That is a proprietary that is a closed source Google  app. Right.  So like so the AOSP is open source version,  but then you can layer all these things on top of it. Right.  And so the argument is and I think that this is like developers  who feel very passionate, religious, really about what open source is.  What does open mean?  What does Google mean when they say is open?  And this is what I think where I think bright is coming from.  And this Ars Technica article is saying, you know, Android's not really open.  You can't really fork it because the real value in Android is GMS  is Google's proprietary layer.  So so if Microsoft, you know, shouldn't fork Android and try to build on top of it,  Nokia shouldn't fork Android and build on top of it.  It's a lose lose situation because you either have to write  your own proprietary layer to catch up to what Google's done.  And Google has a tremendous head start.  And not only would you have to match feature for feature,  but you'd have to match all the quirks as well, because there are some bugs  in the open source layer that the proprietary layer fixes.  You know, you're not going to be able to do that.  Or you have to release a phone without any of the Google goodness,  which is just a crappy experience.  This is bright arguing.  Or you have to cede control of your phone to Google and apply for certification  and get all the Google goodies.  But but sort of, you know, give all the control of the platform or, you know,  give all the good stuff of the platform to Google.  Right. So that you can have, you know, you can have control  or you can have that, you know, the good experience, but you can't have both.  That's his that's his thesis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, Peter, of course, we've had him on many times.  He covers Windows.  And his point really is aimed at Microsoft and this rumor  that Microsoft and Nokia might be doing an Android based phone.  In fact, we believe that rumor is true.  Both Paul Thurotte and Mary Jo Foley said this is true.  They will announce it soon.  And what it is, is the Asha low end Nokia phones, the phones they sell  for as little as thirty five dollars in develop in the developing world.  And it's just not possible to put Windows phone on such a cheap device.  But it is possible to do Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait. Is that like is that a PR move to say, well,  Windows isn't cheap, but Android is? Could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or it could. Well, I mean, it is true that you can.  What they've been using is Symbian.  They've been using S60.  So that I mean, it's time to update it.  I think it's not unreasonable to say Windows phone couldn't operate on these.  But you're right. It could just be pure marketing.  Say we're not going to put our premium operating system on a thirty five dollar  phone, although it is on a hundred dollar phone.  The five twenty.  So the other side of that story is that Nokia will be providing  all of the services that Google currently provides.  In other words, just as there's a Google services layer,  there might be a Nokia services layer, including location,  Nokia store and all of that.  There's a rebuttal to Peter's article by Diane Hackborn.  Do you know her? She's an Android developer, it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She is. I don't know her personally.  She's a Googler. She's been working on Android for a very long time.  One of the earliest Android developers.  She's probably one of the biggest Android experts that exists on the planet.  And she wrote a point by point rebuttal inside the Rs comments,  which is an amazing read, because it it really gives you a sense  of how Google's thinking about Android kind of internally.  And her argument is essentially that AOSP is a fully functioning  smartphone operating system that anyone can install on any device.  And everything works.  And there's no other operating system that is that is that open  and that Google's proprietary layer is proprietary  because it interacts with Google's cloud services,  that the cloud services that Google builds or provides.  That's that's really where the business value is.  And that's where that's why it's proprietary, because that code lives  in the cloud. It does not it does not run on the phone.  That's why Google isn't including it into the open source project.  And it's a really it's a great, great read.  I absolutely recommend seeing kind of her perspective on it.  I mean, you know, she she went as far as to say she said, you know,  look, there's lots of good reasons why Microsoft or Nokia shouldn't  fork Android and build on top of Android.  But it's not this Android is absolutely forkable.  And she's she's really right.  I mean, Amazon forked Android successfully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's certainly forkable.  But Amazon a year before they did that, built the Amazon  Android store, really beefed it up.  And because that's their business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And what we're part of what I think we're hearing is that is that this is a way  to get the web on phones at a cheap price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think it's pretty clear that after all the scrugelled ads,  no Microsoft company would ever include Google's Google services  as a layer on their phone.  So that was a nonstarter.  The real question is, and I think that Nokia has answered it  because I think it's pretty clear they're going to do it,  that can you make a good phone based on AOSP?  And I bet you they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, can't you?  The big question is, can you make a great mobile phone experience  that doesn't involve rich cloud services?  Right. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but Microsoft has all those services, right?  Microsoft has cloud services.  So you tie in instead of you tying into Google, you tie into Exchange.  You tie into Microsoft, Azure.  And I don't know what services Google provides at Microsoft doesn't.  Instead of Google apps, you've got Office 365.  I think that. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's one to one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if it's exactly one to one.  I'd have to look down the list. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And there certainly is a layer of app code that you have to write  on the Android side in order to interact with the cloud services.  But, you know, a long time ago, and I forget who I think is one of the founders  of GitHub wrote this great post about what you should open source  and what you shouldn't.  And he basically said that, you know, you open source everything  except what's core to your business value.  And, you know, Android, the AOSP isn't that's just a platform  for Google to offer their services to users on top of.  That's not their business.  Their business value is the cloud services.  It's the data. Right.  It's the users. It's it's it's that.  That's what GMS is the bridge to on smartphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think where this comes from is the sensible feeling that why would Google  want to allow forks of Android isn't that bad for Google to allow that at all?  So that's why I was going to stop you.  Is there doing things to prevent it, even if they're not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That seems to be what people are arguing that Google is making Android  on fork bullet. They're trying to make it as closed.  You know, it's really it's closed, but it's wearing the open, you know,  it's flying the open banner, right?  That is the whole fight.  Developers hearts.  Yeah. But but but the really truthfully, they're evil and trying to take over  the world. And this is, you know, we've kind of heard this argument  about Android a whole bunch, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we heard it before, Gina.  Right. When when they weren't fast enough in opening up the the various versions.  Yeah. Oh, they're they're they're they're kneecapping open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Exactly.  And I just I don't I don't I don't think that that's true.  Yeah. That's a compelling argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. It's just people can't believe it.  I think you're right.  But I think people go, no, that can't be true.  Google's not allowing this.  Google must be trying to open as open as open.  Because, by the way, that's what Microsoft would do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, the question is, does Google get some yuck yucks out of this  and start advertising that Microsoft is using Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, no, because it's not Google Android.  It has no Google as to it.  It's all. Yeah, that's true.  They get no benefit. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, the truth is, though, like that, the the best Android experience  is AOSP plus GMOs. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, that's my minus minus cruff from other manufacturers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Exactly. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's got a good job of getting rid of. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Right. Just plus only GMOs. Right.  You don't even want to the other crap. Amen.  And this is this is true because Google shepherded AOSP along.  They this was they put they went all in on Android.  And they said, we're going to build this is the platform we're going to put out.  We're going to build our great experiences on top of it, much like they did with Chrome.  And no other company has had this sort of head start.  And, you know, no other company has kind of had this vision.  I mean, I would love to see I would love to see two companies.  And maybe it's Google and Amazon working on the on the AOSP actively.  So, you know, in open in the public, you know, in public,  I want to see nightly commits.  I want to see why hasn't location services been updated?  Is that Google's responsibility?  It's an open source application.  It's everybody's responsibility.  Anybody can update location services.  So when when when when people throw accusations at Google saying,  well, they haven't updated the mail client on AOSP for two years.  And why should they? Because they want you to use Gmail.  And that means that they're evil.  I kind of feel like, well, you know, theoretically, if it's open source,  anybody can hack the email client and make it better, submit patches back  and get those, you know, brought into the open source project.  And so everyone can benefit.  I mean, that's what open source is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's the question.  Has Amazon, for instance, contributed back to the AOSP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I asked I asked Jason Applebaum last night this because he follows  AOSP development more closely than I do.  And he says that, yes, there have been committers back to AOSP from,  you know, from from other companies, plenty of them.  More more, I think the low level, low level pieces of the operating system.  But yeah, that's including Amazon.  Yeah, I believe so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe so. I mean, this is the proof in the pudding.  If Nokia contributes back to AOSP, everybody wins, right?  Yeah, then that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, his his argument was, though, you know, he knows he's like, you know,  there's there's at least one bug major bug that I know of that has been fixed  multiple times, right, by different people.  And and the fix has never been pulled back, right?  Because what is what it's in your interest to have the fix in your software  versus everybody having to fix in their software.  Now, that totally goes against the whole spirit of open source, right?  Is that you're contributing back and that, you know, stone soup that everyone is  contributing and making easier and better for everyone.  But, you know, there's not there's not a whole lot of easy ways to enforce that.  And, you know, you need you need someone.  You need a leader who's who is encouraging that and and people  who are helping out with that. So that's sad to hear.  I mean, I like to see more of there's a major bug location services  that doesn't make it as good as GMOs.  Let's just make location services as good as GMOs. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really I think what happens, this is another case of the truth  maybe not matching the narrative that people want to or expect where  I mean, you would expect Google to be churlish, the dog in the manger  and say, well, you know, we don't want anybody to fork.  But in fact, maybe they have been generous  and maybe it is possible to fork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's this default position of what's Google doing badly. Right. And and.  You know, I know I'm going to come off as the fanboy once again,  but but so often when that question is asked, the answer is, oh, nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, watch with great interest.  This will be a good litmus test for that, for all of that.  And how good how good a neighbor Nokia slash Microsoft is.  Apparently, Nokia has somebody that said Nokia has been a huge contributor  to the Linux open source repository neighbors.  But remember, that's Nokia.  Now they're Nokia, Microsoft or sooner they will be Nokia, Microsoft.  We'll see what happens there.  I don't know if Microsoft contributes much back to open source.  I don't know. I mean, you know, IBM, we talked about last week

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  how Microsoft becomes the new IBM in some ways. Right.  You know, IBM certainly there's certainly your developers at Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  who work in their spare time and open source.  And I would think would love Microsoft to contribute back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's I think at this point, I think I think at this point,  any big software company just just for the purpose of winning developer  hearts has to have some money and some resources  dedicated to toward contributing back to beloved projects that we all use.  That's the right thing to do. It is. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Web 0844 is pointing out that Nokia had MIMO and MIGO,  which were Linux based phone operating systems, unfortunately orphaned.  But that's where a lot of that development contributed back.  So really, Nokia has done this before.  They've taken the Linux kernel and put a phone on top of it.  So it may not be such a stretch for them to do that.  Nest is final. FTC approval.  Google owns them.  Um, interesting that Google also owns a fairly big stake in Lenovo now,  not merely thanks to the fact that they sold  Motorola to Lenovo, partly for cash, but partly for stock.  But after the deal closes, they'll own 750 million Lenovo dollars  worth of Lenovo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So does that still put them in the same conflict that they were in before  in terms of the other hardware makers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A five point nine four percent stake.  So I don't know. Sarah's the finance person.  Is is that a big enough stake to say for people like HTC and Samsung  to say, oh, Google's still in the phone business?  It's five point nine four. Yeah, it's not a majority.  It's not a significant. I mean, it's big. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm guessing every company has its own standard on that.  I mean, it's not a regulatory issue. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and it's on the Hong Kong exchange because that's where Lenovo's traded.  Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Guys, did you go to Twitter, too?  We did. We got to sit down with the cost low CEO of Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and former CEO of Twitter, Ed Williams, about medium.  Yep. Tell us about.  I'll tell you. Tell us about your trip.  Then we'll take a break.  Then we'll wrap it up because we're almost out of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I'm new on my job.  I'm like five weeks old as a dean.  And I figured why not grab Jeff Jarvis and come out to the West Coast  and be a reporter. What's fun?  Basically go around talking to the big executives  who are leading technology companies here and find out how we can work better  with them as a journalism school, what their thoughts are about journalism,  education, what our students need to to learn how to do in order to be successful  as as our industries kind of converge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's so you focused on journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, it's a intersection of journalism and technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Medium is a journalistic enterprise.  Twitter is not, but has some impact, significant impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, I mean, there's some discussion about whether medium  is indeed a journalistic enterprise.  I think some of the conversation this morning with them was really about  the technology company primarily that loves stories, ideas and ideas.  And they're not out to save journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what they see themselves as a back end for some form of journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A platform.  A platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think what I would say is not breaking news ever is that what he does.  He said we read too much news.  He said this out loud. He doesn't want to do that.  He doesn't want to do that. He's done that. Twitter did that.  He's he's basically balancing his his own invention. Twitter, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels like a return to blogger in some ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But more to it, I think, you know, they want to have the finest  content creation tool they can have.  And they're they're a long way on that.  It's a it's a beautiful, elegant.  You submitted a lot of stuff. I've used a lot.  I'm writing a new white paper on, you know, the future of news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why would you submit anything to medium instead of onto your own blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, he writes about it on the blog, too.  It's not mutually exclusive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Distribution, right? Distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes. You know, the thing about media from the very beginning,  I said this to have when he first showed it to me is that I find that  when I start writing something on medium, it raises the bar immediately  on what I would write there.  And so. I'm writing something that's more more thoughtful, cared for,  maybe polished, polished, yeah,  then, you know, certainly Twitter or my blog.  Now, I've kind of said that he wants me to go ahead,  wants us to explore ideas there and do things there.  But I know there's there's the kind of little.  For the record post, oh, I think this or that, and it's over.  I don't want to put that in media medium.  You put a put a thought that you're working on, and he wants it to be collaborative.  So you work with people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that's a key difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, so instead of just on my blog all by myself, how is it?  Collaborative and comments at the comments on the side.  But I take my idea blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, there's comments by every idea and you can get into a conversation  by every kind of annotate your. Yes.  Yes. Oh, that's interesting.  And so you could ask a question.  You could leave a TK as we say.  You want that? No, some people wouldn't.  Well, in fact, medium, the first time I put something up there,  they offered to edit it for me and I said, no, thanks.  So they have editors.  They do have editors. Yeah.  Just a technology company.  Well, we asked them what they are.  You know, everybody's choking on this word that was on recode this week  of a platisher platform, which is just awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, when I saw that, I said not to.  I couldn't finish reading it because every time I hit that word,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going over a bridge.  Is it tight? Yeah.  But no, I think I think medium sees itself clearly,  as Sarah said, a technology company and a platform.  Twitter is still a platform.  And part of the reason that I'm here, just my own hidden agenda, all this  is that I think we've got to convince the titans of technology industry  that when they start to want to save news,  they don't make it a contribution.  They bring their best thoughts to it.  They bring their technology and business experience to it and not give up on it.  And so that's what I want to do with the technology folks  I'm seeing this week is to say, no, the things that you know  how to do in big technology, we need that in news and journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. As opposed to just going straight to a sort of nonprofit solution.  Right. And a charity.  Well, it's not sustainable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pierre Amadar launched the Intercept.  Yes, he did. Very much commercialization of news.  He's put a quarter of a billion dollars apparently into it  and brought Glenn Greenwald and Laura Fitton over.  In fact, they that they also brought that big stash of Snowden documents  along with them.  Some of the complain that that is the monetization of the Snowden documents.  Others have vociferously denied. Greenwald has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And meantime, he has shared some documents with NBC this week.  Did some things. I think he's trying to spread the load. Yeah.  So I don't I don't yet know.  I tried to talk to Amadar and I'm eager to talk to him about his business model.  As I'm not sure that he knows yet what it is.  We've talked about Bezos on the show before that the Washington Post.  I really hope he doesn't view it as a philanthropy,  but instead sees it as an opportunity to change the business models. Yeah.  There was an incredible exchange this week.  Absolutely amazing. Old P.  Marka Mark Andreessen on Twitter has been going berserk all week  in a wonderful way about the journalism business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was wondering why everybody I know suddenly followed P.  Marka. Now I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Save us. Save us, Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What did he say?  Mark Andreessen, for those who don't know, is a guy who wrote Netscape  or helped write Netscape, made a lot of money and is now a venture capitalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And a major, major note.  And and he's true to my heart.  He's saying that journalism can be a business.  Now he's he's excited about crowdfunding, which I think is one revenue stream.  And it's by no means a salvation.  But but he's he's yelling at the people in this part I love  who say, no, journalism is give up on it.  It's not profitable.  It's it's meant to be a charity.  And he's saying, no, it was a badly run business.  I hear people saying that. Yeah.  A lot of my journalism friends are communists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We love stories.  And the people who can tell stories, all journalism is is telling a story  about something that happens so that people understand it better. Right.  Well, that's one form of it.  I think the other forms include I shouldn't say that to the professors here.  They probably will spank me for saying that.  But it strikes me that that's the that's what we need is we need the story.  We need we understand things in terms of story. Humans do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Many of my professors would say the same thing.  I argue that stories are only one tool we have.  And we're not primarily storytellers.  What's the other story? What's the other way to do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Data data tools that raw data is not as is not as valuable as.  In fact, that's what you're looking for.  If you give me the raw data, that's one thing.  If you explain the raw data, i.e. tell a story about it.  I'll give you an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  After Hurricane Sandy or tomorrow, after whatever weather channel  is calling the next storm to hit, Gina,  we'll get stories. You know what the stories will say?  I could write them right now.  Gosh, a lot of snow fell. City digging out on TV.  They're going to put rulers in the snow and say, guess what?  It adds up over time.  They're going to tell us all this.  So what would you like?  I want a tool that says what streets are open, what streets are closed.  And I want that data to come from journalism.  Yes, you bet it is.  It enables the community to share what it knows.  That's journalism. You agree, boss?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's sort of some of the thinking that we're doing right now  is should we be teaching our students how to be community organizers,  basically to engage individual communities and help provide information  that helps them organize themselves.  And that's very that's sort of a new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a broader definition than the truth.  It is. Yes. Nothing wrong with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, I've been writing this this this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a librarian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, it's a platform maker that stopped us in our tracks.  Who are you calling librarians?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mr. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Meanwhile, we want to destroy some things.  I part of the reason that I wanted to bring, especially Sarah here,  was to look at the wonders that are twit and reinventing TV news,  which I think is vital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm never doing another standup.  I can tell you that after you're on your blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's there's there's a very funny Fox five video on there.  I have a guy who I think it's it's the top one  because you got interviewed by Fox, Fox five New York  about about the stupid things they do and whether a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm surprised that they wanted to do that story, to be honest with you.  But that seems self that seems self-defeating.  Yeah, Chad will have to play it.  I don't have the capability of playing videos back in.  And what happened to your laptop?  My daughter has it. Ah, she's using it for work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  During the Chrysler president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is an ad, unfortunately, but sorry about that.  I should have warned you, Chad.  It's all right. I like Dwight David Eisenhower.  I particularly liked Robin Williams' rendition of Dwight David Eisenhower  in The Butler. Did you see that? No. Very weird.  That's not the first person I'd have Robin Williams play.  No, get sick of hearing their own voices sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Local news really can be a bit much.  We we know that with that is a local news guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what we are talking about, obviously.  There are silly stories, pointless live shots, endless cliches.  And then there's Joel Waldman.  Joining us from outside our building.  Perfect. I couldn't resist.  You're putting the hand to the earpiece so we can hear the anger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the lower third.  Joel, can you hear us?  That's all right. I didn't see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In case you weren't there.  I love putting my hand up to my earpiece here, otherwise known as an IFP  for all of you at home who didn't know this.  Look behind me over over here at Fox five news.  There's absolutely nothing going on right now.  So we decided to turn it all around for go snowmageddon  and tell all you concerned citizens at home exactly  what annoys you and us most about this job.  Time we never have enough.  A shocking revelation. Thanks, local news.  Think again. Time is valuable.  Honestly, who has time to waste?  Maybe you do if you're watching this right now.  For the first time ever in this exclusive local news story,  we ask the tough questions.  Does news ever annoy you?  We put CUNY professor Jeff Jarvis on the hot seat  to give this story at least an ounce of legitimacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Doing a story about local TV news is a bit navel gazing, but it's a good start  because it shows me that you're willing to ask the tough questions  about what's annoying about TV news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like sticking rulers.  Almost an inch and a half.  Not an inch and a half.  And please no more wicked winter weather gimmicks.  Thanks for that cliche, reporter man.  And please stop, reporter woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've got this wind meter right here.  The winds are literally ripping across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you think this station had enough reporters covering its city  severe weather its first night, this was the second.  At times, the news we come across another chilling reality.  Reporters stretching the truth.  Are these holy men walking on top of water?  Holy smokes, a canoe in just a few inches of water.  But I've never wanted to knee anchors as badly as during these recent  blasts of cold Arctic air.  All right, we get the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't have to keep going.  Give me a little feral.  That's good. I like that.  Yeah, that's funny.  I don't think they're going to stop doing standups.  I would defend the standup.  Oh, well, OK. I try. Try.  Well, again, this comes.  See, I understand now why you guys don't want to accept the fact that really  what we are storytellers, because that allows some subjectivity to creep into.  No, subjectivity is great.  You want facts.  But the fact is the human brain wants people.  They want faces.  They want pictures.  This is one of the reasons why I was reluctant to do video.  Video is it's very clear to me.  The audio is intellectual.  It's it's abstract.  It's ideas.  Video is all about emotions.  Video wants pictures and wants.  And so for television news to abandon the standup would be, you know,  what do you get? You get, you know, the McNeil Lair, a news report, news hour.  You get the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You also get more information. You get more value.  Well, but people don't.  Well, I got bad news for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People don't want that.  So what is what is the job of the journalist to to are we the Brussels sprouts of media  or are we here to to help people understand stuff in a way that is palatable?  I would rather be a egg McMuffin with some with some broccoli in there  than to be just the broccoli on the plate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can't think of any food analogy here.  But I mean, it's not again, it's sort of not one thing or the other.  You know, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I you go right ahead and be deep data. I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I mean, it's a mix of things.  There's sometimes when I want to analyze data, there's sometimes when I want to have a story  that moves me, there's sometimes when I want some deep complex analysis,  there's sometimes when I want breaking news.  I mean, those are all forms of journalism.  They're all critical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just saying you understand why local news has a ruler in the snow.  That's real.  Yeah, it tells people what's going on here.  Here's a win. Here's the example.  Here's here's here's the example.  They shouldn't lie about a rowboat in three inches of water.  That's stupid. That is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But there's also stupid pictures on the blog of people standing up  in front of the George Washington Bridge and the Christie scandal we have in New Jersey.  Right. There's no journalism to be had there.  No, of course, there's no officials there.  There's no mixed.  There's no sources there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you do TV, I'm sorry.  You have to have pretty pictures.  You don't think Chris Christie is pretty?  No. Yeah, he's pretty.  I would have a picture of Chris Christie.  In fact, I'd have him on there, of course.  You want TV.  You're you're you have a response.  As soon as you go to video, you have a responsible to fill the screen.  Responsibly fill the screen with something.  And you might as well make it pretty.  Oh, well, OK.  So there's a jury out in trial.  Doesn't mean you can't have solid information.  So what I think is very important, and I know you guys teach this,  is that there be this very solid foundation of journalistic ethics  where you don't make up stories, you don't fudge things,  you don't attempt to prove a point by editing.  You you you care most and most deeply about communicating to your audience  the truth about a story to give them the information  they need to make the judgment that they need to make as good citizens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All of the things that are in the service of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. All of that, we agree.  And that is the foundation of what you teach. Right.  So all we're disagreeing about is how you present it.  And I would say that sometimes you want to present it with a little bit of.  But here's a good example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the jury is out in a trial.  I use this example in the blog.  And what do they do?  The anchor says the trial is going on.  This is what happened in the trial.  Now we're going to go to the, you know, Gina Tripani in the paneled courtroom.  Gina Tripani is going to say in that closed door behind me, there's a jury.  We don't know what the F they're doing.  I actually have nothing to say to you.  But you have the trials going on.  It's about this and that and that.  Now back to you. The anchor comes back and says, you know,  we'll tell you as soon as we hear anything, all of which can be summarized in.  Jury is still out. For more, go to the web.  And then they could get another story and think of more value.  And it's a it's a waste of precious journalistic resource.  The reporters don't report.  They are props.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would I would question whether how precious that resource is.  There's a lot of a lot of people that you could put out there with the camera operator.  That stuff's not precious. That's what TV news does.  And I would just say that if you did this imaginary TV  news station that you would like to do, no one would freaking watch it.  And part of your mandate is not merely to tell the truth and get the story out,  but to get somebody to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nobody's watching it now.  I mean, the numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's only because there's other places you can have people stay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I mean, I don't know. You have kids. I have kids.  They don't watch what you do.  They watch, you know, any news that they're getting, they're getting on the laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's stuff on YouTube that is any less.  YouTube's full of stuff.  Oh, yeah. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not trying to be news.  I thought it was presentational.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you look at the presentation on YouTube, there's a lot of attention  to presentation, otherwise nobody watches it.  Watch Epic Meal Time, which has no content.  Yeah, has no content.  My son loves it because it's.  Because of what they're seeing and doing, he loves they're mushing the hamburgers  into a giant lasagna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the conflation of informing and entertaining is the issue.  That's usually said in terms of, oh, it's crappy TV.  What I'm trying to say is something different, is that if I want to read a long  if I want to read a novel, that's entertainment.  If I want to read a long New Yorker story, that's often entertainment.  Snowfall, the Times did, that everybody loved was really, to me, entertainment.  Because I don't. That was a waste of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As much as everybody loved it, that was a waste of time.  And money and a lot of money.  And I would I would.  And this is very not politically correct.  I would complain far more about that than some idiot anchor  with nice hair standing out in the rain.  To me, that is a bigger waste of money and resources  that added nothing in both our conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think there's ways that we could probably inform you.  When I had my coffee with Katie, correct.  Did you mention this to Katie?  Yeah, well, I'm curious what she thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I wanted to know how long it was going to take you to.  I know it's a little bit longer than I thought.  The show's almost over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's going to be too long this week.  And so one thing I said was you.  You the one difference I see in going to Yahoo is you don't have to fill a clock  anymore. Right.  We overfilled the clock here at Twit.  But you don't ever had any problem filling the clock.  Yeah, you don't have to fill the clock anymore.  And if you want to say what's new in a story, you can do that in a minute 30  and then not have to say anything more until something actually happens.  So part of what TV does is think we have to have video, video, video, video,  because we have to fill an hour.  Well, if instead your job is to inform people,  maybe you can do that in a minute 30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, my experience of television is very different from that.  In fact, my experience of television was that we never had enough time,  that there was always the urgency to get stuff done in less time.  And that hurt TV more than anything else.  That's where you edit out the pieces of him downloading the malware.  Because it's not because you don't want that information,  because it takes too much time.  There is never enough time in mainstream media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why did they waste so much of it on an idiot standing up  where nothing happened?  I don't think they consider that wasted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they consider that the way that they make a palatable product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's my problem is that's the orthodoxy of old TV.  This is the way we make TV.  It's got to be the only way because it's the way we've always done it.  And I'm saying I want you know what you're going to do?  What I'm bringing you to New York.  We're having an event at CUNY in reinventing TV news.  And now I'm going to have you in a hacking TV event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would just I feel like I want to argue the case  for the average Joe who sits down in front of the TV.  And I understand what you need to do on television,  you need to make, which we don't do here, but you need to make pretty pictures.  I think you're the proof that you don't need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You need to make a move physically are the proof that you don't need pretty pictures.  That's why we have Gina, ladies and gentlemen, Gina Trippani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeff, I really like I thought that you were bringing up Circa was really at  Circa is that that news app.  I love it. I love it.  I barely look at it, but it notifies me when I need like so you can follow a story  and it notifies me when there's something new, right.  And when there's an update to the story.  And I really I really like that.  And I like that your point that, you know, the way the TV news works now  is that it's just people explaining the same, you know, the same story.  If you have all the background, you're just hearing the same thing  repeated over and over and over again.  But what you really want is just to know, has did the jury come back?  What was the verdict?  Well, you raise that. Don't tell me whether or not only don't only tell me  if they have right. I don't want to hear anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We went to visit Circa this week as well.  And they make a big point of that, saying that once you already know enough  in the story, then all you want is the update that you want to follow the story.  That's a new opportunity we didn't have in big old news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Circa came out of Ben Ha of I Can Has Cheeseburger  actually saying, I think we need to rethink how we deliver journalism.  In fact, I remember going to food camp.  He was there. Were you at that food camp, Jean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was. And we went back to the cottage and did the show with him afterwards.  Yeah. And I remember he had done with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Before he did Circa, he said, let's I want to talk with you  about what's wrong with journalism, what's wrong with news  and how we can do a better job.  And then and Circa, I think is quite successful, but it's a different thing.  I mean, yeah.  And I think connected devices are a little different.  You they are more goal oriented than sitting down in front of a television

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  or watching you question the orthodoxy of television.  You blew up the orthodoxy of television.  Yet here you are defending it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am defending it because it works really well.  I hate to tell you that.  Here's the bad news. It's working.  The audience is dying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  By what measure is it working?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, OK. OK.  You would say TV news is that thing that's on the box that comes through the air.  I would merely say video news and I would say YouTube counts.  In other words, consuming.  No, Circa is very different.  So there so there are ways of getting information of via web browser and so forth.  But I think what succeeds is people like to this is why we spent a million and a half dollars to do this.  People like to watch video.  They like to the leanback experience is not a dead experience by any means.  And in fact, I will give you the measure.  People watch more television now than they did 10 years ago.  That's the bad news. The number of hours.  Look it up. Look at the TV news portion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, maybe in the age there are in the age of the people who are watching TV news  and the portion of the TV news segments that is actually news as opposed to weather or sports.  Yeah, it's really that I agree with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that I agree with. But that's that is how much of local news.  That is the failure of local news.  Local news has always been horrific.  Well, that's really what we're focusing on.  I agree with you, but I don't think the standup is the problem there.  I think first of any, I think the biggest problem with with that is  underestimating the intelligence of your audience.  And this comes again for many years in the snow.  I have worked for all the networks and I know they don't want you to think of the audience as intelligent.  And that's kind of a mistake, if you ask me, because guess what you get?  Stupidity people.  But that's anyway, this has nothing to do with Google.  Hi, Gina, how are you? How's things up going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can I just say that there was someone in the chat room who said he he wanted or she wanted to go for wood paneling based on this?  I think this is you're changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're changing. That's something about the Twitter, the tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think of Yahoo's effort at news?  This is a very to me, this is a very good example of Yahoo  assuming people are not too bright.  So this every morning I get this is the newest thing from Yahoo.  It is a total of nine stories in nine different categories.  I can interact with it and presumably it will update it.  And at the bottom, it's gamified.  You've read zero.  You schmuck you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I send you kittens the more you click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But there is real news here.  Katrina's mayor, New Orleans Mayor Katrina Erika, convicted on corruption charges.  Senate approves debt limit.  Now, when I go to this, this is the product they bought from that kid who was doing some eyes.  He was summarizing news.  So when I go to it, I don't get the actual canonical article here.  I get a computer generated summary of the stuff you need to know.  Although I have to say, it's not so bad.  And then I can get additional stuff, tweets and so forth down here.  I think this is an interesting look.  I'm surprised you guys haven't seen this.  Derek Jeter will retire after this is a sports section.  So this is a summary not from any one source, but summarized by Yahoo,  summarized programmatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think it didn't take long for Calacanis to copy this, too.  Oh, Jason has no new ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's obvious.  Big picture.  Well, he has it.  It just copies everything, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, I had a conversation this week with the club of people who've been copied by Jason.  It's a big club.  A major member of it.  It's a fairly large club.  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what?  I actually like Jason Calacanis, but that's a fact.  There's no way around that.  So that's another way to do news.  I just think that when we use these devices, it's more goal oriented than when we watch TV.  My goal when I watch TV is sit back, relax and enjoy something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is part of what Sarah's saying.  That's why young people don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, they do.  They just do it on YouTube.  So you know how my son consumes YouTube?  That's a different model.  You know how my son consumes YouTube?  On the big screen TV, he's got it hooked up to the Apple TV and they just go through clips  and they watch it.  All that is, is they're programming their own TV.  But they're still leaning back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it's not with local news, produced by local.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the only time they watch local news is when there's gaffs.  Yes.  They quite enjoy that, which there are many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Which there are many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the Yahoo News app that I was showing there for those of you who want to try that  themselves.  I like Circo a lot.  I like the Yahoo News app a lot.  But I do feel like how we use news on these devices is very goal oriented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love this discussion and we're going to have it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I warn you.  Our show today brought to you by coming up our tips and tools and numbers of the week.  Our show today brought to you by Squarespace, a better web awaits.  I love their Super Bowl commercial.  Filled with all the junky memes of the internet.  Click here.  This is 50 pounds in 50 minutes.  All that stuff.  And Squarespace is saying essentially that the web has become this spam cluttered space.  But Squarespace lets you change that with an elegant, simple design that lets you make  your website stand out, website look good.  I just saw that Matt Cutts has said that they're going to downgrade on Google search sites  that have too many ads on the page, too big ads at the front.  They're going to get fewer search results.  He's saying, effectively, Google's saying we want more content.  A Squarespace site is going to give you great SEO.  In fact, they do support all the things Google asks you to do like a site map and so forth  automatically.  Their design's fantastic.  25 templates to start with.  They just added a tool that's so cool.  Design logos.  If you're a small business and you don't have the resources to do it, they've arranged to  get all the Google fonts, hundreds of fonts, and then all the icons.  And you can do your own logo.  It's so cool.  The icons come from, I can't remember where, but there's several hundred of them.  It's very easy to use, but if you have any trouble at all, they've got live chat and  email support 24-7 and a completely redesigned customer help site with lots of self-help  articles, video workshops.  Hey, I like that.  Twitter, we're What's for Dinner.  How about that?  That's good.  And it's very affordable.  All the plans now have e-commerce.  In fact, you can not only sell merchandise, but you can accept donations.  So this is great.

Gina Trapani with a tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'll admit, I held this back from the change log because I wanted to be my tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's fair.  You want to do this in front of the building with a microphone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where's the ruler?  I want you with a yardstick in the snow tomorrow, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got to be standing.  I got to go to Mountain View and stand outside with the Android robots before I do for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  stint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that.

Transcript:  So yeah, there you go.  So this is an Android tip.  Google's voice search on Android now lets you set and refer to a relationship in your  contacts.  So you have your mom in your contacts as her full name.  You can say to Google voice search, call mom.  And if you haven't set the relationship, Google now will say, well, who's your mom?  And you tap in your contacts who it is.  And then from there on in, you can just say, call mom.  Can I get to say who's your daddy?

Speaker: UNKNOWN

Transcript:  nefarious mogul named Robert Maxwell, who bought the New York Daily News.  And he went overboard in more ways than one overboard on his yacht and his finances.  And he used to come into town in his private jet and he would set up at the Waldorf Astoria.  And one of the people I know, knew the Daily News, who was a woman who was six foot two,  he called Tiny, would sit in the outer office and he would sometimes just call and he would  say, Tiny, get me the dickhead.  And that's better than Siri.  Tiny would sit there and say, oh, who's the dickhead this week?  I don't know who it is.  I think it's him, but I'm not sure.  Now if I connect to if I ask him, I'm going to get fired because I'll be the new dickhead.  Right.  By the time it connects, Leo may not be the dickhead, but he is now.  It could change.  So I like that.  Now I get to do this on Android.  Wow.  Siri's done this for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It won't say that aloud, but it will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it doesn't say it out loud?  Oh, well.  It doesn't say it aloud.  That, by the way, what you just saw is the equivalent of a reporter's stand up.  It's a little if you're just against like little fun stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's fun stuff.  No, no, no, no.  Jeff Jarvis is not against fun stuff.  I'm sorry.  We hear it here first.  You're the wrong guy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very good.  Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It'll yes.  It'll prompt you to choose from your contacts.  It won't say who's your daddy.  So I'm sorry.  Sorry.  Just now.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, didn't they give him a hard time about his apartment in New York City?  Was that him or who was that?  I thought it was Eric.  Or was it, I don't know if it was the Post though that did it.  So it was in a nice neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  So it's 22 million, reportedly says the Post, if you believe the Post, 22 million dollar  mansion on 1.3 acres built in 32.  Does it have a grotto?  I don't know.  It has abundant patio space, expansive park-like grounds, and manicured gardens and a pool.

Transcript:  And how do you scan receipts and stuff?  Well, when you get stuck, like I had to sign a letter and I was, my daughter had her tonsils  out so I was in the hospital and I found out I had to sign the letter and get it to someone  back at the school in like half an hour.  So I just scanned it in the hospital.  Scanned your signature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sent it and off we go.  Really handy and it works.  Yeah.  That's an Android app that I have used for a long time.  Scanner Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know if it's Android.  I hate to admit this, but I have an iPhone.  I think it's both.  I'm going to have to check.  Am I still allowed on the show?  You look like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're not going to be allowed a Mountain View, that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's another one.  Maybe it's just called Scan.  I've got to find the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Handy Scanner?  There's a handy Scanner Pro on the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, there's one that I use on Android.  I do use Scanner Pro on the Mac, on the iPhone and that's why I'm confused.  But there is a very good scanning app on Android, which I will get for you.  And then there's 5Bs, right?  5Bs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I didn't want to bring that up again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd like to tell you about a little something I've been using.  I'm using it right now.  Who knew that a New York Tech meetup could be so exciting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm so glad that you were here, Sarah.  Share.  You're going to believe me.  I'm glad that I've got backup.  We've got to share, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We can actually bring this right down if we really try hard enough.  Let's see if it's still up.  I don't want to say it that way.  Yeah, no, really.  That was a bad call there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's called Scan from Scan Incorporated, QR and barcode reader.  Very similar and you can use it the same way.  But it's unfortunately it's a buck 99, but it is on sale right now.  So it's particularly for QR codes.  But it'll also do paper.  Well, actually, you know what?  Now I'm thinking it doesn't.  Oh.  I think it's just for...  It's the QR and barcode scanner.  Oh, never mind.  I like it a little bit better than the one...  You know, every time I'd use the Google authorization app, Authenticator,  it says install this other app for scanning, which I don't like.  So I've used Scan instead.  I think we're out of time.  How long has this show been?  This is a lot of fun, Sarah Bartlett.  Yeah, you're going to get it.  Was Sarah Bartlett like a famous actress in the 20s, I think?  Anyway, but Sarah Bartlett.
