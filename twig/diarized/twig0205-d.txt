Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From SmarterWear.org, founding editor at Lifehacker, hi Gina. Is it taupe?  And from Brussels, Belgium, Mr. Black Glass, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How are you, Jeffrey? Tired, but otherwise fine. Is it late?  It is 1030, but I got four hours sleep last night and I have an early flight to Rome in the morning.  Well, we'll make this short. No, it's fine. I'm fine. But I'm going to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So could we do, all three of us do a hangout and then people could see it from our point of view?  Or should I just do a hangout and have you go in it? Or what should we do?  We could do that. Jeff can't get online because he's in Belgium. I can't. Glass does not work in Belgium.  Let me go ahead and host it. Well, it would work, but it would cost $6,000. I'm just kidding. Of course it works.  So what should I do? Just wait for my invite. OK, Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How would an invite come into this though? Oh, yeah. I wonder if the invite's going to come in.  I don't even know what I can do. Chad, I actually started it with you. How do you start a hangout?  You'd say... Start a hangout. I think it's hang out with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, Glass. Hang out with...  Who? Chad? Yeah, Chad. But it has to be somebody in your address book, right?  I don't think you got a hangout on here because I don't even see hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or maybe it's make a video call to... OK, Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All I have is Google take a picture...  Oh, I don't want these on. OK.  Hi there, everybody. Good to see you again.  These are Jason Howell's glasses, obviously. I don't have glass.  Nor am I having a seizure, though it might look as if I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Video call. I guess that's hangout. OK, Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Video call? It's not one of the phrases that's on here.  I only have... Oh, Google. Google. Take a picture. Record a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it hurt me. You also have to go to the web page and enable certain functions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now I'm recording a video.  Oh, crap. 10 seconds. Thank goodness. Now I know why there's a limit on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, don't you have to go to the My Glass page and enable that function?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, you might. See, I've got make a video call to Chad Johnson.  And then it'll... Chad, that probably sent you a hangout invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, NSA. No, it doesn't understand that.  All right, I'm taking these off, but that was fun.  OK, good. I feel a little cross-eyed.  Do you feel a little cross-eyed when you take yours off, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little bit. Yeah. A little bit. See, we did...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, but we...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so I can see you, Chad. I can see you in my glass.  Hello, can you see what I see? Not quite yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's a rumor... Oh, OK. Right here. Now Jason's going to do it.  You can bring it back. But I think you have to update yours, right?  Have you done a hangout on that?  If somebody invites me...  Oh, then it would show up on there that you've been invited?  Yeah. I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can totally see you, Chad. I don't know why mine's not sending video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We should point out that this is a very beta product.  It was never intended to be anywhere outside... Yeah, very. It's explores...  Yeah. It's a developer tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that is exactly the key. If you're a developer, that's who should have these things now  because you can start to write things for it. Otherwise, to use them...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They did cede them to a lot of people, you know, in the Twitter hangout, you know, Google Plus thing.  I'm one of them. If I had glass.  And it wasn't like I will develop software for it. Some of it was, you know, I'll change the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the curiosity... Scobel finds this all the time.  I'm in a conference today in Belgium, a world journalism educators' congress,  and people are standing in line to put them on.  And they're thrilled when they can say, okay, glass, and the thing listens to them.  That's really the key, right? Is giving it a command and having it do something is what's thrilling people.  Yes. Talking about glass.  Apart from the keyboard. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Well, we'll work on it. We'll play with it.  I had said I thought it'd be fun if we did this last week and we're trying...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I left the hangout because I could hear... I could double hear everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I heard it too. It was coming back. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it was coming back. Yeah.  So this is Jason's glass right now. Jason's looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. Well, bring it over here and I'll wear it.  And then can you invite the public to that?  Yeah, Gina, if you can rejoin because I'll mute myself.  I should have done that from the very beginning.  Oh, that's where the echo was? Yeah, it was my fault.  So now this is what I'm seeing.  Uh-oh. Oh, that's... Sorry. That was me inviting Gina again.  Okay. This is cool. This is cool.  So this would be something... And can we make it public so that people...  Well...  It says Gina Trapani's in the hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. So... Oh, look.  I just got your invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's my view you're looking at right now.  That's really cool. Yeah.  I have to say the bone conduction does work really well.  It sounds like I have a speaker. I'm kind of shocked that you can't hear it.  For some reason, I'm not sending video. I'm in. I can see your view, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's awesome. Isn't that wild? There goes Ozzy.  Look at Ozzy.  I don't know why mine isn't sending video.  I have to tell you, my video would be really boring.  It's just my screen in front of a window.  That's a cool view.  Yeah. You see our nice little family here visiting from Sacramento.  Wave, folks. Wave. Wave, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hi.  That's what people do on TV, don't you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see if there's anybody outside the window.  Oh my God, it's Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The funny thing is you can't see what other people are seeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can only see Chad, for instance. He's the other person in the hangout.  So I can't see what you're seeing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But I have a monitor so I can look out of the corner of my eye and see what you're seeing.  All right.  All right.  Yeah. But I have a monitor so I can look out of the corner of my eye and see what you're seeing.  All right. Well, let's just make this public.  And if people want to see what I see, I don't know why they would.  The view this way is much better than the view that way.  We got the lights, the cameras, and the...  All right.  If you think this is ungainly,  you can apply now to get the 42-pound 15-camera backpack for a loner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good transition, boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's called the Trekker.  It's one of the pieces of gear Google uses for street view imagery.  And it was the one that you perhaps saw going through the Grand Canyon.  It's a 42-pound backpack that lets you access areas where bulkier camera rigs can't navigate.  It's a 42-pound backpack that lets you access areas where bulkier camera rigs can't navigate.  The Trekker is operated by an Android device, consists of 15 lenses angled in different directions so they can be stitched.  The Trekker is operated by an Android device, consists of 15 lenses angled in different directions so they can be stitched.  Chad, you left the hangout.  So we can't make it public because...  Oh, you have to make a new one?  Yeah.  Okay. Why don't you make a new one?  We'll do.  And we'll make it public.  We'll do.  So, as the operator walks, photos are taken every two and a half seconds.  So, in the application, you have to say why you would want to take a journey, or take it on your journey, and do you have permission?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, okay. I make a prediction.  I make a prediction right here and now.  Maybe it's not a prediction. It's already happened. Scobal has already applied.  I'm applying right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a...  Lea Laporte. Where would I like to take it? My organization is Twit.  Okay, email. There's my email. Country where this would take place.  Oh, oh, I should take it. Where should I take it?  What country?  Where's your next big trip?  I'm going to Venice in a couple of months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your best bet is going to be if you have access to a place that other people don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like Galapagos or somewhere nobody can go, right?  Yeah.  Actually, they've already done that.  But email, but email...  How do I answer this? Do I tap it?  So, I just send them in a hangout request for those who...  I'm just going to watch Lea throw his tag out.  Ah, join hangout. Join hangout. Peacock.  Just tap it. Just tap it.  Okay, you're back. You're back.  Okay, now let's make this public.  Now, you are going to hear anyone who jumps in this hangout.  That's all right. I don't care. I can live with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no volume control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's all right. I can live with that.  Oh, son of a B.  The video can't be made public after it has started.  Okay, so you have to do it beforehand.  Apparently, and then I'll invite you separately.  Yeah, so start your own public hangout.  And do it on live, right? Do it at the Hangouts Live.  Okay. I don't know if you can make those public, but perhaps you can.  All right, whatever.  Okay.  Help us plan for import-export issues for the equipment.  Describe your interest in the Google Street View Trekker and your proposed Trek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who wants to carry a 42-bump backpack if they're going to something in some place, you know, so exotic and sort of restricted?  I mean, I get like that you want to contribute to the Street View and to the world's sort of access,  at least visual access to an area, but same time, like it's a commitment, you know, that you can't carry anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Sean Parker should have worn it at his wedding.  Perfect. Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Poor Sean Parker.  I felt bad for him. I don't think he did anything wrong.  He was so misunderstood. So misunderstood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was just misunderstood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he had an Elvin wedding because he and his wife were big fans of The Hobbit or something.  And so they took over a public campground, an asphalt-paved public campground, and groomed it to look like an Elvin wood.  I know where it is because I've stayed there.  In fact, I had my honeymoon there 20 years ago at Ventana.  It's a beautiful place.  And then he got, and then with unbeknownst to him, Ventana had illegally been keeping the campground private.  Actually, it was this county of Monterey had been keeping the campground private because it had a sewage problem.  So nothing that the Parkers did at their wedding was in any way jeopardizing the coast of California, the Redwood forest or anything else.  It was a Hollywood set, but he got treated like a pariah for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he really, they did rake him over the coals over that.  He got treated like the rich guy who didn't care.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  It's not good to be rich in this country.  It's not good to be famous in any way.  We prop you up.  We put you on a pedestal and then we like take one of those bats they use to destroy piñatas and you whack at it, whack at it until you're dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or here's another way life becomes a game of Jenga.  Yeah, exactly.  Tower.  Put you up, we'll put you up, we'll put you up, oh, we'll take another one, take another one, oh, there he goes.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Best to stay out of the public eye if you are wealthy or successful, if you can.  Oh, this is a good infographic from webpagefx.com.  This is a history of Google acquisitions.  I think every web page infographic should have a coffee cup with a stain at the top.  I think it just adds something.  Google's acquisition history.  Here's Google Heaven.  By the way, a new member of Google Heaven as of Monday.  Cool reader.  Aww.  Did the world end?  Aww.  Aww.  So what they've done is they've actually divided this up among different groups.  So Android you've got Cleversense, Motorola Mobility, PitPat, Talkbin, BlindType, Zettowire, Anyalux, LabPixies, Peekstream, Skia, BufferBox.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I don't understand is how many of those things were put to good use and how many of those things were in the great tradition of Yahoo and AOL bought and killed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think Keyhole, Google Maps, I mean that's what the satellite images came from.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So those were good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great example.  I think Zagat, or Zagat, I'm sorry, Google's done a great job integrating Zagat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's been a story we didn't talk about last week that the employees of Zagat were unhappy.  Can you be surprised at that?  Well, are they out of work?  I think some of them work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's probably why.  I always forget about Dodgeball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the predecessor to Foursquare.  Yeah, predecessor to Foursquare, which is kind of cool.  So Den's basically sold Dodgeball to Google.  Google didn't support it.  And then hopefully he came out of it with some cash and started Foursquare.  I think so.  Basically a rewrite, a Dodgeball, right?  I mean, early Dodgeball was SMS based.  Yeah, yes, it was different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The location.  What was possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And did it become Latitude or did it die because Latitude already existed?  No, it just died.  It just died.  I wonder what's going to happen to Latitude when Waze comes around.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think those have different overlapping, but different jurisdictions.  Yes, yes, yes.  Google has spent a recorded total of $22 billion on acquisitions.  And this is kind of interesting.  The average age until a startup is successful, a little more than four years, almost five  average years until Google acquired six years.  The youngest acquisition was less than a year old.  That was CalTix.  The oldest acquisition, Motorola, more than 80 years old.  Excuse the average.  Yeah.  Acquisitions by year, kind of a jaggy line.  2010 was the biggest, looks like the biggest year for acquisitions for Google.  I don't know what this is supposed to illustrate, but they've got Larry and Sergey dressed as  ministers with a shepherds' quirk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a heaven hell thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I get it.  I get it.  What does Google look for?  What has Google learned?  Two thirds of the acquisitions have been successes.  That sounds about right.  That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Versus my favorite acquisition story of the week, not to jump ahead, but Bebo.  What is Bebo?  Bebo was an early MySpace, an early social network out of the UK.  It was bought by AOL for, was it 650 or 850 million?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then AOL Armstrong, when he came in, sold it for 10 million and one of the founders  just re-bought it for 1 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that Michael Birch aims to reinvent the site.  It's lost most of its users since 2008.  Well, it's probably worth a million.  He sold it for 850 million.  Founded it with his wife in 2005.  Hey, it's a million bucks big deal.  It's pocket change.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like buying a car and saying, I'm going to fix it up.  Hey, Leo, I need you to leave the hangout you're in so that I can invite you to a new one.  How do I do that?  Low battery charge soon.  I'll do it for you.  It seems stuck.  People.  You.  End hangout.  End hangout.  End hangout.  Peacock.  Oh, and now I'm seeing what I'm seeing.  You.  Goodbye.  You've got mail.  Hello.  I give up.  I can't.  It's also hot.  Yeah, wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Got a little brand on the side of my head.  Google Graveyard.  30 days, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  30 days.  30 days.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Return policy.  Yeah, you see, got plenty of time to really mess with it and not lose a penny.  I think 30 days is very generous.  No, they're offering me a charger cable.  No, no, you could take the glass.  Thank you.  I've had enough.  I've had enough.  30 days, 30 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually, the customer service, as I was saying, was really good.  They actually, a box showed up for Mountain View today.  It was a glass branded like water bottle.  Oh, yeah.  Those were the mystery boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what were those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Water bottles?  Yeah, they're water bottles with the glass logo on them and just a little note that said  Water Explorer, you know, here you go.  Stay hydrated?  Stay hydrated.  Yeah, I guess.  Were they glass water bottles?  No, they were like, they were metal.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I kind of missed a bet there.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like, I don't know, maybe they just had some extra swash of ag left over and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, speaking of acquisitions today, Samsung bought Boxee Box.  Yeah.  That was the, originally Boxee was, I thought, open source software that was an enhancement  of XBMC, the Xbox Media Center, open source software.  They eventually decided to kill the software side and really focus on hardware.  They sold the Boxee Box through D-Link and Samsung apparently acquired them for something  less, something south of a 30 million dollars.  I tell you, you know, I'm not sure what, I don't know.  I love Avner Ronan, who was the founder of Boxee Box.  I really thought a lot of them.  Avner was great.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've met him as well.  I'm happy for him.  But they raised 28 and a half million in funding.  So Avner is going to be walking away with, I don't think he's going to walk away with  anything.  Because they said something less than 30 million.  Samsung has acquired key talent and assets to help us improve the overall user experience  across our connected devices.  It was good software.  Speaking of acquisitions.  On the way home, you're going to Rome, right, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, not on the way home.  It's weirder than that.  I'm flying to Rome tomorrow morning and back the same day.  This is a sin of sins.  I've never been to Rome in my life.  I'm flying there in and out the same day to go to a Google Big Tent event with Google,  with media people, all of whom will be speaking Italian and I'll be listening to translations  with headsets.  And I'll do the panel.  And then I looked at Google Maps.  The venue is a 20 minute walk from the Coliseum.  So I will at least walk to and go around the Coliseum and then go to the airport.  That sounds like fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something, something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I come back to Belgium then tomorrow night, late tomorrow night, Friday, I'm at this conference again.  And then Saturday, I take the train to London for the Guardians Activate event next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can go see Google's new or the site of Google's new London HQ.  I can go look it up.  They spent a billion dollars for the plot of land.  And they've now put out renders of what it's going to look like.  In fact, the total cost expected to be well over one point six billion dollars.  It will be three and a half football fields long, 11 stories tall, environmentally friendly.  It's near King's Cross St. Pancras Station, which is also where the Guardian is.  So you'll see the hole in the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like Times Square in its day.  It's developing.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One side take up an entire side of King's Boulevard, which is a new road that links the station with Regents Canal and Granary Square.  It's pretty central, isn't it?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It actually is.  Again, it's a neighborhood that was, you know, not great.  A lot of rail yards, that kind of stuff.  But it's up and coming.  And there's a canal there and other neat stuff.  And so it'll be it'll be soon.  Very, very neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google wants a tax refund on the taxes it didn't spend.  To add insult to injury, Google is suing the IRS for an eighty three and a half million dollar refund because they wanted a deduction for a stock transaction in 2004 with AOL.  The IRS disallowed the deduction, apparently in error.  And the lawyers found it and they said, hey, you owe us eighty five eighty three and a half million dollars.  Actually, AOL is suing saying it wants four point six million dollars as well.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They could just sign the check over to the UK to try to shut them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is one for you, Jeff.  German, a German minister.  Germany's top security official says, hey, if you're worried about U.S. intelligence agencies, just stop using Google and Facebook.  Actually, as it turns out, stop using faxes as well.  Apparently, that's also insecure.  Interior Minister Hans Peter Frederick told reporters in Berlin on Wednesday, whoever fears their communication is being intercepted in any way should use services that don't go through American service.  I can't actually say he's wrong on that, right?  Well, hold on.  Hold on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, hold on.  Right. Right.  But hold on.  Number one.  Why just say Google?  There's a lot of services, right?  Don't use AOL.  Don't use all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think he said don't use American services of any kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but then second, but hold on.  The way that the spying has actually happened, and we need Steve in on this, is that going to Google is on warrant.  What they're doing is eavesdropping, as Steve has described so eloquently and smartly, onto the actual fiber.  Right.  And they're doing that.  And the Internet, the way the Internet works, right?  Things can go routed any which way all around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's actually, I think, one of the real sore spots is even traffic that's not intended for the US often goes through the US.  Bingo.  So you could be using a French service, but it happens to be routed through the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And let's not forget the Brits.  We now know the Brits are doing this too.  So if it's going around Britain, you know, if it's going from Germany through Britain to France, boom, gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just depressed.  There's nowhere you can go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's basically don't use the Internet.  I didn't follow your advice.  I wrote a piece for The Guardian this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But just saying that I think that even though it's somewhat symbolic that the service companies, not the Internet service companies, but the service companies like Google and Facebook and such, need to start encryption inside their networks and to the users just to bring some faith to the Internet.  Because the truth is the government's not going to do anything.  They're the ones who are the bad guys here.  Legislatures aren't going to do anything.  Courts aren't doing anything.  And the ISPs, nobody's pushing the ISPs and questioning the ISPs and the bandwidth providers.  But that's where the vulnerability is to the government's buying.  And so I think that there is a need and an opportunity for services like Google to say, we are actually your best protector.  And here's what we're going to do about it.  Well, when you're at The Guardian, thank them for their Guardian Guide to Extradition because I've been really looking through the list of places where there's nowhere you can go, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is it.  That is amazing, isn't it?  Yeah.  It really is.  Yeah.  It's basically they've come down to three countries that would be perhaps OK.  Bolivia, the United States, and the United States.  Basically, they've come down to three countries that would be perhaps OK.  Bolivia, Venezuela, or Iceland.  I'd take Iceland.  I'd go to Iceland.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Snowden said Iceland kind of from the beginning, didn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's requested asylum.  Iceland has not responded.  I think everybody's going, oh, I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  And see, I don't understand.  Maybe in some ways he may have thrown himself on the sword because if he really I mean, he must have known that this was going to be the problem.  And he could have done this like deep throat style where he didn't reveal his identity or had a plan for disappearing from sight.  But it didn't seem like he had either of those.  And I'm thinking he really he felt like it would carry more weight if he said who he was and why he knew this.  And he really sacrificed himself because this was how he had to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true.  He also said that he wanted the leaks to be out first before his name was up because he wanted the story about the leaks and about not about him.  Right.  But he also the big question early on and he answered this in a chat at the Guardian.  Why didn't you just go straight to Iceland and try it there?  And the problem was that that would have taken too many hop over flights.  And by then the NSA would have said, why is this guy going from here to there to there?  And there were direct flights to Hong Kong.  That's why he went there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, you could fly Icelandic airlines to Europe and you get a free trip to Iceland.  Not from Hawaii.  So he really felt like if he did anything untoward, he would have been busted before he could reveal this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, didn't he have to get all of his travel pre-approved and all that?  That was that was the issue.  And so that he felt like they would have gotten suspicious or it would have been difficult for him to get clearance to Iceland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's obviously really smart, though.  It seems like he should have prepared some escape or he just knows, hey, I'm going to go to jail.  I'm going to fight this as best I can.  But this is the price I have to pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Washington Post had an absolutely shockingly, appallingly stupid editorial this week.  I had a lot of things that were stupid this week.  I'll do both of them.  The first was they did an editorial basically saying, you know, Snowden should come back to the U.S.  and plea and stop these leaks.  Hello, E-Leak to you, Washington Post.  Sir.  Then there's an amazing column.  Actually, you need to look it up, Leo.  I don't have it in the rundown.  But Google Robert Samuelson in the Washington Post wrote a column tongue nowhere near cheek saying that we should repeal the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really where the problem lies, isn't it?  If there weren't an Internet, all of this would be so much easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Repeal the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not really brought much good.  Let's just get this bringing too much trouble.  Let's just get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's just let's just roll it back.  We'll just go back to the way things were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This isn't the economist Robert.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody thinks that is that's I think Paul Samuelson.  It's a different Paul Samuelson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, yeah, that's the that was like that's economics.  One on one textbook is by this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This guy is life.  Flunked Life 101.  Quotes in there.  There are unbelievable quotes in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, let's read it.  I want to read it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is just dashed out.  You'll find the music.  You'll find the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Please repeat Internet.  It's such a bad idea.  If only we didn't have an Internet.  And then there would be marom.  It's kind of hard to believe.  I can't find it.  I just threw it in the chat room.  If you need it.  You did?  Yeah.  We have a chat room?  I think so.  OK, we're live and chatting.  There it is.  Oh, that's that's ours.  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Beware the Internet and the danger of cyber attacks.  Writes Robert J. Samuelson, opinion writer.  If I could, I would repeal the Internet.  It's the technological marvel of the age,  but it is not a symbol of progress.  Just the opposite.  We'd be better off without it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I understand the pleasures of YouTube and iTunes,  the convenience of GPS,  which does not use the Internet, incidentally,  and much more.  That's not the Internet, Bobby.  But the Internet's benefits are relatively modest  compared with previous transformative technologies  like the automobile and the toilet.  And it brings with it a terrifying danger.  Cyberwar.  Wow.  Unbelievable, huh?  The Mother Jones had a good article in which it supposed,  based on what we know about Robert, about Snowden,  that Edward Snowden is that he was in fact a cyber warfare expert.  The reason he had so much access is that he was testing vulnerabilities  amongst our potential enemies.  He was a hacker for the CIA.  Yeah.  I like that.  I think that's probably true.  So, you know, we wouldn't have any of this  if we didn't have the Internet.  That's true.  But we'd still have GPS.  I'm sorry, Robert.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Who is this guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a columnist, been there for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's the problem with opinion.  It's very different from the editorial side, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's no excuse.  It still appears under their brand.  I had a big argument with a big Dow Jones executive on Twitter this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the Wall Street Journal's opinion columnist  are basically from the Stone Age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they had a column on Greenwald that just said,  well, what if he did help Snowden and shouldn't he be arrested?  Asking what if doesn't mean crap.  There was no fact whatsoever in there.  It was liable.  And the executive at the news corps said to me on Twitter,  well, don't you understand this difference of opinion?  I said it's still occurring under your brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're in Brussels.  You're in the headquarters of the EU.  What do you hear on the street?  Are people upset?  Waffle, please.  Waffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.  Waffles would be good.  I'd love a waffle right now.  A Belgian waffle.  There's actually a little carnival down the street.  I went to this dinner, this conference, and the dinner took forever.  So I left with no dinner.  And so I walked by this kiddie carnival.  I almost think waffle, Belgium.  Yes, right thing to do.  But I rushed back here for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Frites.  They're famous for frites.  If you like french fries with mayonnaise, you're in the right spot.  They're also famous for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You sacrificed a waffle for twig.  I sacrificed a waffle for twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also, so I wouldn't be too bad.  I would have taken a duvel, which is a high alcohol beer.  I love duvels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Belgium has the best beer.  I would have taken a waffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would have been late.  I would have been texting Chad, like, yo, I got to get this waffle.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, really, Jeff.  I'm so sorry you didn't have dinner or a waffle.  For you.  I am so sorry.  Do you want to see what I had?  All right, here.  Oh, no.  He had something from the mini bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What they call a croque monsieur in the hotel is just a grilled cheese.  Oh.  Oh.  No bechamel sauce.  No bechamel.  Now that I've finished complaining.  Well, the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because we're, okay, so we've been tapping their phones.  We've captured their faxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a story this week that was, well, last week it was withdrawn by the Observer.  And then the guy who was the source is a known paranoid and the story never should have got  in, saying that Germany was trading stuff, too.  And immediately the German politicians, is one I know from the Green Party, was in right  away on Twitter saying, my God, we're going to go after this.  And I said, are you going to go after this?  He said, oh, yes, very seriously.  And then the story got withdrawn.  So, it still remains.  It's on US and UK.  And yeah, we're bugging governments.  And what Obama has been saying is kind of, well, you know, everybody does some of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's appalling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The US had, according to this German magazine, conducted, and this is not what you were talking  about.  This is another story.  This is a different story.  This is Der Spiegel.  And this one is credible.  And Der Spiegel had conducted a wide ranging effort to monitor EU diplomatic offices and  computer networks.  I mean, these are our allies, kids.  In fact, the French say this is jeopardizing future transatlantic trade talks.  Partners do not spy on each other, said EU Commissioner for Justice Vivianne Redding  at a public event in Luxembourg on Sunday.  We cannot negotiate over a big transatlantic market if there is the slightest doubt that  our partners are carrying out spying activities in the offices of our negotiators.  Now, we know why they're pissed off at Snowden.  This doesn't have anything to do with alerting the terrorists.  It has to do with alerting our allies to what we're up to.  That's why we're upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's corporate espionage.  It's corporate espionage.  It's exactly what we've been accusing the Chinese of doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz told reporters in Brussels on Sunday  it's shocking that the US take measures against their most important, their nearest allies,  comparable to the measures taken in the past by the KGB, the secret service of the Soviet Union.  He felt treated like an enemy.  Yep.  NSA had placed listening devices in diplomatic offices in Washington and New York,  had breached an EU computer network that provided access to internal emails and documents,  and access phone lines in EU headquarters in Brussels in order to monitor top officials' phone conversations.  It had seen documents from Snowden but didn't publish them in 2010.  Or is that of 2010 documents?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't imagine that it was anything from 2010, no.  Hmm.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's where the upset is.  That's where the upset is.  You think, you know, I mean, crime any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's government going far too far and, you know, but on my TV here in Brussels I have CNN International on,  lucky me, versus CNN Regular.  Right now I'm sure it's nothing but the trial on CNN Regular.  But, you know, more...  Zimmerman Trial.  Zimmerman Trial.  Yeah.  But the news in the real world, of course, is that the president of Egypt has just been ousted by the...  Right.  Huge story.  And I talked to somebody tonight at this conference, a wonderful woman who's a journalism professor,  communications professor from Turkey, and the things that are going on there are absolutely amazing.  I talked to her at the last conference I was at, I talked to an editor from Brazil.  There's this...  There's a Twilight of the Gods moment going on here that I can't quite figure out yet.  And I'm not saying anybody could, nothing to figure out yet.  But the government's going, on the one hand you have something like the American government,  supposedly a government of principles going overboard in just incredibly wacky ways.  On the other hand you have these countries where you have people able to take to the street,  and maybe it's mob rule, maybe it's a bad thing,  but who can now find each other and organize in a way that's just shocking governments.  The disruption that's going to come to government I think is huge.  And in the case of the US, A, you could argue that the government's bringing it on itself,  but B, you wonder why is that?  It's too complicated of a story. I don't know. We don't care.  I think that really there is a certain amount of...  The people of the United States are somewhat complicit in all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We want to be safe and sound.  We want to be safe and sound.  We want to be safe and sound.  We want to be safe and sound.  Complicit in all this.  We want to be safe from terrorism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Part of it too is that you can't spy on us,  but we've always known you can spy on everybody else in the world, and that's okay.  Which is we should have been mad about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, we're going to move on. There's happier stuff.  We shouldn't be talking about anything like this. It's too complex.  Leave this to the politicians. They'll work it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, you're right there on the run.  Have you seen the 15-year-old girl's hand power flashlight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a story.  The eye of the story isn't really happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is a happy story.  That's a happy story.  It really is a great story.  It's chosen for the Google Science Fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The video is amazing. This kid is unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's watch. You got the video there, Chattington?  Anne Makaszynski of Victoria, British Columbia  is the sole Canadian finalist for the Google Science Fair competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, my name's Anne, and I'm 15 years old.  I live in Victoria, BC, Canada, and today I'll be talking about my hollow flashlight.  So I became interested in the area of harvesting surplus energy  when I realized that humans are a great source of untapped thermal energy.  And my objective became to make a flashlight that runs solely on the heat of the human hand.  I decided to use some cheap Peltier tiles.  If this is a tile and you heat one side of the tile and you cool the other, electricity is produced.  In my case, I'd be heating one side of the tile with the palm of my hand  and cooling the other with just the ambient air.  My first step was finding how much heat per centimeter squared our body radiates.  I found this to be around 5 milliwatts,  and I needed only 0.5 milliwatts to obtain a good usable LED brightness.  Step two was to do a small characterization test of the two different sized Peltier tiles.  I found that both tiles produced sufficient energy, but only around a few millivolts.  I needed around 2.5 volts.  Step three was finding a way to boost my voltage.  My final circuit had only four components.  I obtained a good LED brightness with less than a 50 millivolt input and around 50% efficiency.  My last step was designing the physical aspect of my flashlight.  Because I only needed to heat one side of the Peltier tiles,  the heart of my design was a hollow aluminum tube.  The air flowed freely through the tube and also cooled the other side of the tiles.  My results proved my hypothesis,  and I was able to produce around 5 milliwatts of power and 5 foot candles of brightness.  I achieved my objective of creating a flashlight that runs solely on the heat of the human hand.  So here's my flashlight.  I'll just give you a quick demo, and I'll put my hand on top of it and turn off the light.  Wow! It works!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you.  This is great.  1.1 million views on YouTube of the hollow flashlight.  And she's 15 years old, a 10th grader from Victoria of BC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She said before it was at 200 views, and I was like, yes! 200 views!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just think this is just wonderful.  The more who see it, the better.  And it really, I think it's important because we talk a lot about STEM and how important STEM is,  and I think now more Canadians will get into the STEM stuff, and I think that's great.  No, I'm joking. I meant girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I joked at the time on Twitter that Google and Tesla were competing to hire her,  and then sure enough Google gets her into the science fair.  That's great.  Well, she's in the science fair.  She's in the science fair, but she's only 15.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't hire her yet.  All right, let's take a break. When we come back, we're going to do the change log.  We'll talk about a farewell to Google Reader and what you're using instead,  and an interesting leaked ad.

A Google changelog.  Gina Trapani has the latest from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not a whole lot to report this week, but I put on my glass because I think the biggest update this week is a Google Glass update, which, Leo, you don't have yet, but it's XE7.  It's rolling out slowly to explorers.  And I think that kind of the biggest update is that you can get a full web browser inside Glass.  So it used to be that if you did a Google search, you would get back just cards with links.  Now there's an option to view the website, so it loads the entire website.  It's the mobile.  It's usually the mobile skin if it's got a mobile skin, the site that you're looking at, and a couple of new interesting modes.  So once the website loads, you can swipe back and forth on the touchpad to scroll up and down.  There's a look around mode where you use two fingers to tap and hold on the touchpad and then you can you can look up around a pan on a on a page.  Yeah, Chad's showing us right there.  You can see an example like the Wikipedia page is their mobile theme.  And then you can zoom by dragging along the touchpad.  You can you look around, you can tap so you can you can actually navigate websites by tapping on links.  You can watch YouTube videos in Glass.  That's a clever way to solve that navigation thing.  Yeah, it actually is.  You know, I didn't have this update last night for all about Android and I but I just got it this morning.  I finished updating and I was saying last night on AA that I just couldn't imagine that this would be anything but cumbersome.  But it actually is pretty usable.  It's a lot more usable than I thought that it would be.  Although I was standing with my wife in the room and browsing websites.  I was looking up something on on Urban Dictionary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It kind of looked like a dork, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and she was just she was looking at me sort of not disgusted but sort of like, you know, because I have the screen on and I'm looking up at the screen.  Your head's moving around like.  Yeah, exactly.  She's like watching someone use Glass is just it's not nothing, nothing fun about it.  But but it is handy when you want to look up something on the web because honestly doing a Google search without having the web page was pretty useless before this update.  This update also gave you a couple more voice commands.  If someone calls, you can say, OK, Glass answer.  If you get a text message, you can say reply without having to touch the touchpad.  I'm activating my glass and then all your Gmail contacts are available now on Glass used to be limited to like 10 contacts and now all of them are updated.  So Jeff and Leo used to you guys and Jason, you guys should get this update pretty soon.  It's sexy seven and the glass has to be plugged in and connected to Wi-Fi in order to get the update.  What else do we have?  This is for you, Jeff.  Chrome OS, the Dev channel, Quick Office support just got enhanced.  So now you can do Microsoft Word and Excel filing at a file editing in Chrome.  The next web reports they were kind of watching the chromium chromium check in check ins there.  If you go into I think you have to go into Chrome flags and there's a there's a box to enable document editing and then you can edit documents.  It looks like this is local Chrome based, not amazing.  This isn't dry, right?  This is this is actual Chrome.  I'm not sure exactly what happens to the file when you're in Chrome OS.  I guess you can you can either store it on Drive or save it on your local your local storage.  But so easy Microsoft Word and Excel editing in Chrome OS.  Google News got a little little change this week.  They're adding sports scores and weather to the home page.  And they're also they've got these editor pick sections.  So they're giving business and tech sections.  They're adding these editor picks and that's what those are going to also expand to other sections.  Jeff, did you see this?  I know you're a big Google News user.  What do you think about that?  Have you seen the editors picks content or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't seen it yet, but I'm still I kind of like the purity of the algorithm view of Google News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep, yep.  Yeah, it's a collection of headlines handpicked by publishers.  Right. So it goes back to that old media idea of like someone editorial control picking picking stories versus having people that the stories that are most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's a soft editorial ego.  It's a it's a sob to them to the brands to say, oh, no, no, you really you matter.  You still matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Right. Right. Right.  And last thing, the Google search field trial, which if you haven't opted in, you can opt in at Google dot com slash experimental slash Gmail field trial.  This is this is the little bit of functionality that basically lets you search for information across Google products in your in your in your regular search box.  So email and calendar and files from Google Drive and reservations.  They've just added your Google or your Gmail contact information to to search.  So if I went to this, so if I'm opted into this field trial and I go search for Leo, for example, I'll see Leo's details from my Gmail contacts.  And they're also going to be adding Google Plus profile support soon.  Sadly, this doesn't work so well for me, but I keep most of my contacts in my apps account and it doesn't work for apps accounts.  But promise, promise of what's to come.  And that's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the change log and growling from the app users.  Yeah, I get your I search for Gina Trapani and I get your contact info.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. A little card comes up and says visible only to you from Google Contacts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, OK. Yeah. So I was interested to know what that you I was like, right.  Because information in your and in your contact in Gmail might be different than the information that's like publicly on my Google Plus.  So it says visible to only you.  Yes. Yeah. Yeah.  That's that's well, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is your information.  I almost took to it.  No, I think this is safe. There's no phone number in here.  Good. Contact info from Chad Johnson's profile.  There's some stuff and then from Google Contacts visible only to you.  There's some additional stuff.  So that's separate. And then it shows recent posts.  This is really cool.  Actually, that's not doing the right thing.  That's pretty cool. Yeah.  And that addresses our studio address.  Yeah, that's not where Chad lives.  That's why I said it's OK.  Yeah, good point.  But this is the contact info from Google Plus that you post on Google Plus.  And then you see here it says from Google Contacts visible only to you.  There's additional stuff.  And in this case, it's just a separate email address, right, which is public.  Public. Yeah.  But it would presumably have phone numbers and other stuff if I had that.  I think I do have that in there, which is odd.  So I'm not sure why it's not showing everything.  And then I find a USA Today article with you running 24 miles an hour on a treadmill.  Yeah, you know, just wake up in the morning.  Pretty impressive. You got to do it.  Pretty, pretty impressive.  Chad Johnson is getting into the running.  Traitor who will lose him to the NFL.  Yep, yep.  Good going, Chad Johnson, if that's your real name.  Thank you for the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's it, right?  You want to see the trumpet, the drums, the timps?  OK.  I don't want to truncate anything.  You did notice that Franz Kafka in the U.S. is being celebrated on Google on the front page today.  That's why there's a cockroach coming out of a door.  If you weren't sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why. Of course.  Yeah. For those of you who live in New York, it's like home.  Hey, neighbor.  Somebody turned on the lights.  It's Franz Kafka's 130th birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You remember back in the day when we used to think that changing the doodle was a big news story.  Every week we'd say, Google changed the doodle. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's funny because it was Time magazine that made this big splash about that one.  I don't know why.  Hey, there was a big splash.  I haven't looked yet at the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Washington Post, or USA Today, the paper editions.  But apparently there is a full page ad in each of them.  In the US.  The first smartphone designed, here's the ad, engineered and assembled in the USA is coming tomorrow in the US.  That's Independence Day, the 4th of July.  You'll eat burgers, watch fireworks, and celebrate the freedom to be whoever you want to be.  The freedom to be spied upon.  Can't wait.  This is with the same spirit we're bringing you something new.  The first smartphones you can design yourself.  This is what I want to know what you think this means.  Because today you should have the freedom to design the things in your life to be as unique as you are.  And this is just the beginning.  Imagine what will be possible when you have the world's best design, engineering, and manufacturing talent located here in the US.  This is Google's first Motorola phone since they bought them two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When are you having your event up there, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to see them next week, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Wednesday after Twig, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right after the show next week.  That's right.  Driving to the Googleplex.  Special invitation.  Guy Kawasaki is now doing some evangelizing for Motorola.  He said, as a personal favor to me.  So I'm thinking we're going to get to see this thing, right?  This new phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're going to get to see the phone.  Yeah.  Pretty sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think that means, customizable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were speculating last night on all about Android.  My brain immediately went to software.  I was thinking, oh, they'll have different skins or different launchers.  You'll be able to choose.  You'll be like, am I an explorer?  Am I a sports nut?  Am I a cook?  Am I a fitness?  And then they'll have different things.  But this seems specifically, Jason made the good point that this seems specifically kind of about the hardware.  This is about a phone that you can design yourself.  So we were speculating that maybe it's that you kind of get to design the back of your phone.  Maybe you can choose a color or you can get it engraved with something.  But we were saying that like, not too much.  Choose your carrier.  I mean, the Moto X is going to be it's not going to be Verizon exclusive the way the droids are.  It's going to be across carriers.  So there's that.  But what else?  What is really customizable?  Most phones are just sort of like, black rectangular slabs.  There's not much that you can customize except really kind of the back.  I don't know.  I mean, if I want to get sparkly rainbows on my phone, would that, you know, the verge is saying laser, laser engraving, laser engraving, OK, colors and laser engraving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you ever heard of everything dot me?  So they have they have software that you use as a launcher on your phone that pays attention to what you've been looking for and changes your desktop, your wallpaper, everything, your apps, even.  Depending on what you've searched for.  So so all of a sudden, if you search for Adele, you see a lot of Adele on your phone.  Do you think it could be that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, yeah, that could be something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's something I want.  You can get that right now in the Play Store if you want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there are there there are apps that kind of sort your apps.  It seems like there are different modes.  Like when I'm traveling or having a conference or I'm traveling, I'm using apps like Tripit and Navigation.  That's true.  And local so much more.  And I wish that my phone should be able to know that that I'm away from home or that I'm in a new city, you know, and it really could adjust to to feature those apps.  I think more prominently when I'm in that mode and I'm trying to think of other other times, even just, you know, going to the gym or, you know, there are certain apps that I would use there or I mean, on one hand, I think, well, I really like to customize my phone.  And I really like to figure out, you know, I like to make my little folder of most used apps and it would annoy me maybe if my phone just sort of morphed without my intervention and especially if it got it wrong.  But I think that there is some innovation around that.  In fact, one of the things about Android 4.3, the K release is is that it might have some like, you know, most used apps sorting versus least used stuff.  So is everything that me is that is that an app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a launcher. It's a launcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you can get right now if you want.  Joanna Stern writing for ABC says sources at Google have told ABC News that their new 500,000 square foot factory in Texas will be able to deliver the personalized device to buyers within days of placing the order.  You choose the color and the engraving.  They apple did this with the iPod, right?  Through the website, buyers will be able to select from a palette of different colors.  One color can be used for the back and other for the front for the trim.  Users will be able to engrave a name or message on the back cover as well as upload a personal photo through the site to be used as wallpaper.  So when you take it out of the box, it'll have your wallpaper on it.  It will run Android 4.2 point to you'll be able to buy the mid range priced phone via the web.  But also carriers will have it in their stores.  All major US carriers.  And it won't be a droid if you buy it from Verizon.  No, no, no.  You cannot customize the this is Joanna Stern still.  You cannot customize the internals of the phone processor.  Remember, you will have a variety of storage options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it will be an unlocked version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if it's on Google's website, there ought to be a nexus.  This should be the next nexus, right?  Those Google edition phones, as we now know, are not next.  Right.  They're not because updates come from the manufacturer, not from Google.  Well, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They work together on it.  But right.  The manufacturers involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  The manufacturer in this case is Google.  Yeah.  There are also, according to ABC, added voice capabilities to leverage Google's advanced voice recognition technology.  It's smart enough to know when you're driving and will automatically launch the speakerphone function.  You know what?  They do that now with I think Joanna's iPhone user.  But you could have your car home will automatically launch when you when you are moving at a certain speed or when you dock the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you say that's a new API in Android now as well.  Yeah.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Driving, cycling and walking instead of having to fumble to find the camera icon on button users will be able to flick the phone to launch the camera.  We could do that right now on the HTC one and the Galaxy S4 on the lock screen.  You just flick it over and it has the camera.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you can do that on stock as well.  Stock will do that.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is fully made in the US.  I think that's that's a selling point from Americans point of view.  You know, obviously internationally.  And it also helps them customize faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it would make your phone less likely to be stolen or have less value.  It's got your name engraved on the back of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good point.  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just I don't know that I would put my name on my I guess I put my name on my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could put, you know, at his name.  Here's a couple of photos supposedly revealing the rear case from the French site nowhere else.  Teal, red, purple or green.  No, if you go teal, nobody's gonna steal your phone.  I can promise.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I don't want that teal phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's like the glass colors are very bright.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google actually I use I use a purple gel case.  Yeah.  And my wife hates that.  She hates that.  You know, it's just so unmasculine to use purple ink, but nobody ever steals a pen from men.  Nobody wants it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you dot your eyes with little hearts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  That hurts.  In league with my wife.  You gals stick together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think purple pens are cute and gender neutral.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like purple.  I listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't do pink with her.  So it's pretty much all purple and teal.  I try to be in green and yellow.  We try to go pretty gender neutral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what color this is.  It's like a royal blue for my laptop.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a color theory.  Have I shared this theory with you?  No.  There is no there is no teal.  It is actually a conspiracy by women that they point to different colors and call it teal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know that magenta does not in fact exist.  Did you know that there is no magenta that is actually true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm image searching teal.  It's a Tiffany's conspiracy is what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Magenta is not in the there's teal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the other one I hate I think is the same as mauve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mauve is a color no one knows what the hell it is.  Yeah, you're right.  That's that's that's a good test.  Actually, let me ask Gina.  Do you know what color mauve is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's in the red family, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's more sort of purplish.  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't you googled it.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did.  I did.  I'll stick to stick with teal.  I'll give you mauve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So magenta is actually an after image.  Is that mauve all that?  Those are mauve.  The most ridiculous image search for mauve I've ever seen.  There's there's purple and red and tan and pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what happens to me.  They point to tan.  Oh, that's mauve.  I say no, it's not.  Mauve.  I'd search for mauve color.  We have unearthed the conspiracy right here.  Thanks to Google.  There is no mauve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a suspicious.  I meant mauve.  Now, here's this is this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the color mauve color chart.  These are all mauve.  So there you go.  I mean, this looks like gray, but it's actually tan.  It's first blush.  Don't get that wrong.  You see, you could tell you're a guy.  Did you see that you can install Android 4.3 on your Galaxy S4?  Yeah.  This only works on the Snapdragon S4, which means I can't do it because I have an Exynos based S4.  What?  So what's the difference in 4.3?  It's not first of all, it's not key lime pie.  It's still ice cream.  It's still jelly bean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  That's right.  Not a whole lot of not a whole lot of differences.  A lot of kind of under the hood stuff to reduce battery usage.  Well, that's good.  But and maybe some some camera UI changes, but not that but not that crazy.  I think they change that the fact that the menu is a big is a circle.  So the fact that it's just kind of an arc, but nothing else that really jumps out at me.  Nothing earth shattering that I was like, oh, I absolutely want this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't know why they did a point release.  They could have done four to three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, four to three instead of four point three.  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  I'm ready for key lime pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am too.  Google Earth now has Street View.  So they're really you know, I recently deleted Google Earth from my Android phone because I felt like Maps did everything I cared about.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It takes up a lot of space.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what so I would love one of you experts to explain which is there a compelling reason to have Google Earth instead of maps and maps and maps I guess has turn by turn which Google Earth does not and latitude.  I have a confession.  What does yes confess away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I cannot navigate Street View to save my soul.  Really?  No, I end up going into alleys and up and I can't go there.  I go nuts.  I go absolutely nuts.  I cannot use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why you have a pixel you just touch where you want to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  When you use maps in the pixel model is pretty cool because you can pinch the maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's very cool.  That's very cool.  Out to this day we mentioned that Google readers gone.  Did you know that out to this is this is real?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a this is a huge deal before there was Google my children.  There was all to this day and all in the world.  It was the coolest.  It was the big search.  It was everything little story here.  Back when I still work for advanced publications, the new houses, cutting ass, new house,  just papers, we I ended up on a big team with tiny.  We were going to buy all to this.  Wow.  And we did all kinds of due diligence and all kinds of meetings and all kinds of this and that.  And then end up getting I think we got outbid by Yahoo.  I think was what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it was started in nineteen ninety five.  One of the it was it was the search engine everybody used.  In fact, absolutely.  It was the I remember using and I remember in about probably ninety eight or maybe two thousand  Dvorak started to test people's tech savvy by asking him which search engine they used.  If they use the newcomer Google thumbs up, if they said out to Vista, then they were behind the times.  In two thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now probably Dvorak is the one morning the death of Alta Vista.  I love Alta Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In 2003 was bought by Overture.  Overture was bought by Yahoo.  It was bought by Yahoo.  Overture was an ad company that Yahoo bought.  That was Bill Gross's company.  Right.  It's Alta Vista is not really it's been around but not heavily used anymore.  And if you go to Alta, I couldn't believe it was still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The logo was still there.  It was still there.  I was I was shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it is till the eighth.  Yeah.  Let me go there.  I haven't been there since nineteen ninety eight.  There it is.  Wow.  It looks just like Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would have just assumed that it was a and here's trending searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The number one search.  Here's the funny thing is Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want a real good joke.  Yeah.  Scroll to the bottom and see where it's powered by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably powered by Yahoo.  Right.  Mm hmm.  And I know it's nothing on the bottom anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, then do a search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, do a search.  OK.  I'll search for Digger Phelps.  I don't know why it's the number one search.  Who's searching?  Oh, because that's why.  Because he's ill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now scroll the bottom.  Powered by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Powered by Bing.  There is no Yahoo search.  Yahoo is Bing.  So that's what you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  So who was the product manager sitting in some dark little office amazed he or she still  had a job for the last five years?  So I got to I got to change all the business.  But Bing in there.  OK, I'll do whatever it takes to keep my job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Number two search Camp Tawanga.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, because there was an accident.  He searches.  A tree fell in Camp Tawanga.  So but apparently knows who I am.  Oh, because it's got my Yahoo account is logged in.  So it does have Yahoo stuff.  Up at the top.  Yeah.  Anyway, it's July 8th is the end.  Other things Yahoo will be killing.  Yahoo Access, the browser plugin.  Yahoo browser plus citizen sports.  Yahoo Web player.  Foxy tunes.  Wow.  Yahoo RSS alerts.  That's sad.  Same day as Google reader.  Yahoo neighbors.  Yahoo stars India.  Yahoo downloads beta.  Yahoo local API and Yahoo term extraction API.  Huh.  So let's talk about reader.  Was there a was there a you know, did the earth come to a close?  Anything?  Anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, just went with the there's an argument to be made.  Some people are making the argument that this is a good thing because when Google did reader all the other RSS readers went away and by killing reader, there's been some new development in RSS lately.  I don't know if I agree or not, but I silver lining in any cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's too late.  If you haven't exported out, I think you're done right.  Google takeout no longer works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think we should try.  Let me check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just went to as many different replacements as I could and signed up and said import my Google reader.  So I have choices.  So I did.  This is the dig reader, which is actually very credible.  It looks very much like the Google reader and in fact still uses JK.  All the all the keys are the same.  I think they've done a nice job.  I think this is pretty sweet.  It has built in sharing.  Then there's, of course, Feedly, which is a little prettier, although Feedly can be made to look as bad as Yahoo.  I mean, as Google reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Takeout is still for readers.  Still up.  It's still up.  Last chance.  Hurry.  Services.  Yeah, you can go to you can go to reader.  Although Mihai Paparito, who actually worked on reader at at Google, he launched a site.  It's reader is dead dot com.  And he's saying to basically take out doesn't include it doesn't all your red items, your start items, your tagged items, your shared items, the shared items.  People you're following the comments on shared items, your liked items.  So he put down he put together a Python script, which exports all this for you.  I have not tried this after, you know, yesterday after two days ago.  So I'm not sure if this Python script will still work.  But but yeah, you only really get the OPML and a couple of adjacent files from takeout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Feedly has it.  One of the nice things about Feedly is it does have the kind of more traditional magazine look.  But there is a view that looks very much like Google reader.  Feedly has more much more sophisticated, more mature, much more sophisticated sharing capabilities, works with if this than that, which is neat.  I'm like Feedly fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you import you can't import OPML on Feedly, can you?  Unless I missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I didn't even do that.  I just it had a button that said import your Google reader.  Yeah, that's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That button doesn't work anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's gone.  Yeah, that's so hope you did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the only one that I found that I could I could just import my OPML was because I was I had done takeout, but I'd waited to move over was the old reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  R E E D E R and that's temporarily free.  Yes, maybe permanently.  I don't know.  I was like 2000 people on the import.  Yeah, I used Net Newswire for years as a feed reader on OS 10 and it's it's come back and they also were on Android.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  I think they have a Windows version of this as well.  I might be wrong, but it's owned by BlackPixel now.  So there are lots of choices.  If you're one of the few that half million or whatever that still use a reader, there are choices for you.  I think that's about all we need to talk about anything else.  The Bing challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think challenge being challenge still second place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Vivo was a hot topic for a while.  People were thinking the music video site might move off of YouTube and go to Facebook.  Such a big deal that Google has today announced that it did in fact make a deal with Vivo, including buying a stake in the company.  Means that's a that's a that's a lot of money Google spent to keep Vivo's music videos on YouTube.  Fifty point two million users a month, according to Comscore.  Not huge, but one of the companies, one of YouTube's biggest partners.  Terms of the agreement not disclosed.  Billboards said between 40 and 50 million dollars, which is a good deal.  I mean, I think that's a fair deal if it's for 50 million views a month.  And really, that's the that's the MTV, isn't it?  Now kids don't kids don't watch MTV.  They want music videos.  They go to YouTube and search for them.  And Vivo was, you know, a play by the record labels to make sure those were legit.  And then they got the money.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like Twitter made an update to their developer guidelines.  I see your link.  Let's see.  Yeah, they've been they've been auto following and bulk following.  That's good.  That's gonna that's good for users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because I mean, your your typical app didn't do that.  But there were specialty apps that people could run and have say anytime anybody follows me follow follow them back, that kind of thing.  And they just junk sit up Twitter also less benignly has announced that it's going to allow advertisers access to information that you provide Twitter and further third allow third party tracking cookies for advertisers to propagate to Twitter.  And you can opt out if you are if you have a Twitter account, you can go to your settings and opt out of tracking.  So that's something that they just announced today.  I you know, we've talked about this before.  Jeff and I kind of are in the same page on this.  We don't really we don't really care if people track us tracking cookies.  Yeah, Boyn Boyn had a good article on what to do because they're privacy advocates.  So Jenny Jardin wrote an article on how to there's an article she links the article on advertising age.  Unlike Facebook, which is also doing the same thing.  Twitter does let you opt out of this.  Advertisers will be able to tailor ads for you based on your activities, not only on Twitter, but off Twitter.  And we'll also use personal information like email addresses to target the ads you see.  Twitter's senior director of product and revenue says users won't see more ads on Twitter, but they may see better ones.  So go into your Twitter settings.  And now there is a do not track check button.  Your visits to sites that feature Twitter are not available to personalize your experience.  Facebook does this with a like button.  And I guess there's a Twitter like button.  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, this has to do with the personalization.  Taylor Twitter based on my recent website visits.  Right. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's tracking basically.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then Taylor ads based on information shared by ad partners.  Display ads, but things have already shown interest in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But the point is not only on Twitter, but other places you go to visit a site that has a Twitter button on it.  Twitter knows now that you visited that site because it's a third party tracking cookie.  And now so I go to let's say the Starbucks site.  I don't know if they have a Twitter button on there, but I bet you they do.  I go to the Starbucks site.  Now Twitter knows I went to the Starbucks site and I may happen to see an ad for Tim Hortons on my Twitter feed.  Because of that.  All right, let's get our tips, numbers and tool of the week.  Starting with Gina Trapani's tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is pick this up on Lifehacker.  If you're on Android phone and this totally happens to me.  So I tested it out and it works really well on your Android phone and you tap the Google search bar and you start to type into Google search.  And it's just slow, super, super slow to type in.  And then and then and then, you know, press enter to run the search.  If your Google searches on your Android phone seem super slow, Lifehacker recommends this tweak.  Now, this is one of these kind of proceed with caution.  Be prepared for it.  Maybe not to work on your phone, you know, kind of kind of go and go and knowing that this is kind of a kind of not recommended tweak.  But that does work for a lot of people.  If you disable a built in app called Search Application Provider, which can run kind of slow on some handsets, excuse me.  If you force stop that application, your Google searchers will speed up significantly.  And they did for me on my on my Galaxy Nexus.  So, yeah, if you just you could just Google speed up slow Google searches in Android with this tweak, you'll see the Lifehacker article.  Just go to your settings and apps and you swipe over to all apps.  And there's this built in app called Search Application Provider.  You tap it, disable it.  You'll get a little warning that'll say, hey, if you disable system app, you know, things might get wonky.  Feeling brave. Tap OK.  And then try your Google search again.  You'll see that it's a it's super fast or it's faster than it was that it has been if you're if you've got the slowdown that I had.  So give it a try. Speed up your Google searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what happens when you reset the phone when you restart the phone.  Does it does it go back on again with default?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're you're actually disabling the app versus stopping.  So I believe that that that sticks from one star to the next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Did you end up buying the Google experience phone or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did. I did. It ships on July 9th.  And you got a one ships. Oh, yeah, I got an alarm. Interesting.  Yeah, I'm excited. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there anything, Gina? Is there anything about the Motorola announcement that might make you say might cancel that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't care about laser etched handsets.  I don't care about that.  In fact, in fact, the thing that I love about the one and I shared this with you guys is that the reason why I chose the one because I just think it's a beautiful handset.  I think it's a really nice phone. It's the hands that I want to carry.  So I'm not concerned about that.  I mean, I am. Look, I'm sure that my updates are going to come out a little slower than the Nexus and the Moto X will get them.  So there might be some some, you know, shaking of the fist when when those phones get the updates.  But otherwise, I'm not I'm good with it. I mean, I want to see it.  I want to see the Moto X and see what they do with it. But I colors and laser actually doesn't doesn't really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the reason. Here's the reason that one was the right choice.  By the way, it is gorgeous. You're right. And the front speakers and all in the aluminum unibody and everything.  It's really a gorgeous phone. I'm kind of I'm not crazy about the button positioning, but you get used to it.  The reason it was right choice is that HTC with an unlocked bootloader, it's easy to root.  I don't know. Yours doesn't come rooted, but it's easy to root. Right.  And you could put any ROM on it you want, including and I'll show you a little later on my favorite ROM.  I put because I've rooted this. The Google Experience ROM is available for both the Galaxy S4 and the one.  So I put the Google Experience on there. And after a while, I thought I kind of miss sense.  So I went back to sense. But the point is you have the choice.  And in fact, I have both sense on here and the Google Edition tomorrow.  I might reboot and go into a Google Edition. I could do both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's kind of you can you can add sense to a senseless phone. No, no, that's that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm not going to I wouldn't be able to go to sense. Oh, you get it. I got I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. And that's what I'm going to show you. So that may not be the case. OK.  But but let's get Jeff's number of the week and we'll talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Truth is, my number was I don't have much time to go before I can't even have a waffle before I have to get on Twig.  So I didn't have a lot of time to get numbers, but I found this moderately interesting, somewhat obvious.  Have you got enough caveats now?  Nelson Matos, who's the emerging markets VP for Google, said straight out.  And if you think about this, it makes sense. But he said straight out that the next billion people online will not speak English.  Wow. Full stop. Wow. And so Google's growth is going to come.  For example, this was a Times of India story. So they were saying it's going to come from the native languages of India.  Wow. Vernacular languages. Isn't that interesting?  And you think about it that way, that's a rather sobering way for us English speaking folks to look at it.  I'm here at a conference where people are speaking five languages.  It's just unbelievable. And I'm this stupid American who speaks 1.1.  And they all said to me, they'll love it. Hey, you got the one to speak, man. You speak that. Everybody speaks that. It's OK.  But Google can't rely on that. So the fact that none of the billion will speak English just sobered me up a bit.

Transcript:  I asked, I keep on, you know what I can't stand is genders. Because I'm a genderless guy.  I can't stand because my brain just is not there.  DDoS, slavs. That some nouns are feminine and some nouns are masculine.  Cannot do it. Cannot do it. Those synapses were not exercised.  So I say to people who are speaking Dutch, well, here you don't quite have that.  They say, oh, no, but there's all these other complications. You don't want to do it. It's really complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there you go. We're just going to have to stick with English. I think English will not lose its ascendancy. I hope. I pray.  No, no, just for my stupidity sake.  So I think this will work on your Google Edition phone, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, talk to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is what I've been doing. So yeah, because it's nice to have it's nice to have the choice. Yeah, right.  Yeah, I bought an AT&T HTC one. And of course, the nice thing is HTC, if you go to their website, lets you unlock the bootloader.  And then it's a trivial thing to root it. So once you've rooted it, you could put any ROM you want immediately.  As soon as the Google Edition started coming out and enough people had it, people were sucking the ROM off the same thing with the Galaxy S4.  And you could make a Google Edition phone out of any HTC one. I think you can go the other way, too.  And what I would recommend, the site I'd recommend is trickdroid.org.  There are a number of people who make sense ROMs. These guys make a sense ROM as well as a Google Edition ROM.  So you can get the Google Edition ROM here if you have an HTC one, a rooted HTC one, and get stock Android.  I put 422 on there all day yesterday and it was nice.  I'm not sure I buy the argument that somehow because Google did it, it's a better UI than what, say, Samsung or HTC or somebody else is doing.  They also, though, have an HTC Sense ROM that is much, you know, they have some nice improvements in it.  And it's 4.2.2 here in the US. We still are 4.1.2 on the HTC one.  I'm pretty sure that as long as you've rooted it, that you can put trickdroid 8 on.  And that's what I've got on here. And so then you get all the benefits of sense and you get choice.  Now, what's funny is I, you know, the reason that I didn't really care about the Google Edition is because I use Nova Launcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You use Nova Launcher, right? I don't. I use I'm just vanilla. You don't need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if you use Nova Launcher, this looks just like vanilla 422.  You know, I mean, I don't. There's not. This is sense with a few extras. This is sense.  So and then I like there's a few things like I like to have multiple docs so I can scroll through my docs.  There's there's I can do this. I could swipe up for Google search.  I can tap this for Google. Now, there's just there's a few things you can do with Nova Launcher.  So I'm pretty sure I'd be curious, but I believe trickdroid will work on your Google Edition phone.  And if you have a non-Google Edition HTC one, they also have the Google Edition ROM.  So what I did is I downloaded both and I just I reboot. And if I could choose, it's a dual boot phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have a dual boot phone. I have a dual boot phone. I don't want to choose one or the other.  I don't know. Exactly. Yeah, because I would like to compare the two.  I don't necessarily think that Google has the best Android UI, but like as an Android developer,  it's in my interest to be really close to what Google thinks is the best Android UI.  So like even even the fact that the buttons on the HTC one aren't in the right order, they're not the Nexus experience buttons.  They're not like the recommended order of buttons like that bothered me a little bit.  I was kind of like, oh, this is, you know, but and the GS4 has the menu button, which you love. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like a physical button, although I've gotten used to this HTC.  And once you overload the the two buttons, there's only two buttons at the bottom, capacitive buttons at the bottom of the HTC.  Once you overload them, though, they do everything you want.  So I'm completely happy. And you still get, you know, the overflow menu, the dot dot dot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You haven't given that up. The overflow shows up in the action bar versus on the bottom. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it shows up where it's where it's supposed to. So right up here. Right. Right up there. Yeah.  But I can also I can also press and I think I can I can't remember what I've assigned it to.  But I yeah, that did that do it anyway. I can I can press and hold.  I can't I can't remember. But yeah, you have all the functionality.  Plus is the very nice and it's dual boot.  Trickdroid has both ROMs, the the Google Edition ROM and a sense of very up to date senses.  The European four to two version. And I think I'm pretty sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I might play around this. I go back and forth.  Part of me is like, do I really want to do with my phone and maintain to, you know, two setups and have to update my apps like both and, you know, whatever.  But I might just play around this just to get a sense of. Oh, well, that's the other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the other thing. The first time you install them, you probably should wipe it.  But after that, I just wipe the cash. I do not wipe all the data. So I don't have to reinstall apps.  That's probably not approved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you're booted up into the Google Edition and app updates come down for the Play Store, they stay there.  And then you but then you reboot into the into the sense edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't you have to update those apps again or only no, only maybe the Google Apps because the Google Apps are built into the ROM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other apps don't get wiped out. So it's just accessing the apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's nice. That's pretty sure. Don't quote me on that one.  And I just like I do think you should wipe the cash and I do wipe the cash, but I do not do a full wipe.  I should try it right now. Anyway, it's great.  And you get a dual boot phone, which is fabulous. And then the best of both worlds.  Yeah. And I just think I think the sense camera app is great.  Although and this is another tip because of the Google Edition coming out, you can now download an APK of the Google camera,  the Google Edition camera, the stock camera and stock gallery and put that on your phone.  So if you don't like Samsung's crappy camera, you can have both.  It becomes a separate app. So then I more choice. Right.  That's what we want. More choice.  Play Store. I don't know if it'll show up in the Play Store.  The keyboard has and cloud print has. Right.  But I don't know if they'll put has ever has. Yeah.  I have to say stock gallery is the best gallery that I will grant you is really much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's saying something. That means there's a lot of room for innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know because it's very simple, but it's very, very simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And sometimes it's just kind of slow. And I don't know. I feel like there was times when I Samsung's gallery is the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it? Yeah. But now you're going to get the sense gallery and you could have both, by the way, both can run.  You don't have to choose one or the other. In that case, the sense gallery does have all that.  Those, you know, the highlights and the zoe's and all of that stuff. Right.  So you kind of want the sense gallery. But you can have both.  All right. I think we're done. We're done talking hacking phones.  That's really a conversation for all about Android. That's where you'll find Gina Tripani every Tuesday.  She's here every Wednesday. And of course, smarterware.org, think up dot com to do text dot com.  She's a very busy person. Yeah. 2.0 this week.
