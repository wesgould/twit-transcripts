Partly because we have many interests and Pruitt is here. He is our photography guru  and is the father of hardheads at Ant Pruitt and his show is twig.tv slash hands on photography  twigs.tv slash op. Hello Anthony. Hello Mr. Leporte. Actually Ant's your middle name so I  shouldn't call you Anthony. I should call you Ant right? Call me Ant. It's a lot easier to say.  I like Ant. Ant's a good name and it's unique. My son is Henry. He calls himself Hank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cause same thing. It's like boom says it. When I first met him, I called him Hank and then I felt  bad because I didn't really make sure it was approved. Hank approved. But he was cool with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or you can call him sodium. What is it? Sodium deficiency? I can't think of that name on TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I do like that I keep getting fed his TikTok. Good. Unlike the other crap that he's high on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TikTok these days. It's salt underscore Hank if you want to subscribe. Jeff Jarvis is here. Wait  a minute. I threw away the title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello Mr. Professor. Hello. Happy, happy Ed Balls Day. Should I, dare I ask? You lost me at Ed Balls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  10 years ago, 10 years ago on this date, the British politician Ed Balls went on Twitter  and somebody showed him how to use it. And he obviously was searching for his name. So Ed Balls  tweeted Ed Balls. And I'm juvenile enough still. I still find that funny as does the entirety of  the United Kingdom. So there's stories all over media about how it's the 10th anniversary of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ed Balls Day. Or Ed Balls. He is currently the shadow chancellor of the X-Checker. He looks like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the kind of guy who would tweet at balls. Yeah. He was. So if you go down to line 61, you'll find

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  the link where you see the original tweet. Oh, let's go back. You know, if he were smart, he would

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  he would sell that as an NFT. It doesn't sound that tech savvy. Yeah, maybe not. Clearly not.  You know, it's even better because the picture, his avatar on this is of a little child.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Really even more piquant, if you will. It does. It's juvenile to laugh. I fully admit it. I've been

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  10 years old, but I find it very funny. Apparently, this will forever be known as Ed Balls Day.  It is. It's Ed Balls Day. Happy Ed Balls Day, everybody. 500 years from now,  when people celebrate Ed Balls Day and they go, what is the origin of this day? No one knows.  I hope so. Lost in the mystery of time. They're going to be like, what's a Twitter?  And she's right now regretting her. We serve meatballs on this day. She's really regretting  her appearance on this show. Scotch eggs and... Stacey Higginbotham is here from stacey on iot.com  at gigastacey on the Twitter. She's also the host of the iot show with Kevin Toffle. Hello, Stacey.  Hello, everyone. Hello. Hello. So Google's quarterly results are out. And wow. Another,  you know, yes, earlier today, we did the Microsoft quarterly results. Later today,  we'll get Apple's quarterly results. Google's earnings is smash sales records,  and particularly in the digital ad market. And this might maybe explain a little bit about  flock and Google's abandonment of the third party tracker. They don't really need it.  They're doing just fine with first party ads. Thank you very much. First quarter sales,  revenue 55.3 billion. That's up year over year, 34%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That is so bonkers. And they're like, it's an increase from the diminishment of the pandemic.  But if you actually look historically, this is far and away just crazy. Just, I mean, like,  10 years ago, we're looking at sub 10 billion in Q1 revenue. This is quarterly. It's bonkers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, quarterly. 3331 billion alone 32 billion alone from search, Gmail and Maps.  YouTube 6 billion. That's almost a 50% increase. A lot of people staying home and watching YouTube.  Now the profit. They laughed when they bought YouTube. I know. Boy, they got their money's  worth. Profit. Remember, this is a three month period. $18 billion. It's got to be nice to make

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  like one and a half billion dollars a week. Also, I mean, think about this. They've been shutting off  all of these crazy unprofitable businesses for the last like two years. So if you think about it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to reapen what they sell. That's what you do. If you're a smart business, you get rid of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  the deadwood. Well, yes and no. You have to have the other bets to help offset  the eventual decline of search. It's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Credit to Ruth Porat, a very good CFO, because the judgment you have to make is, is this losing  money but going to grow or is this losing money forever? And she apparently has done the right  thing and cut the stuff that's never going to make money and has kept the stuff that presumably  will make money down the road. This is a profit increase of 162% from last year. Now remember,  last year, as you said, Stacey, wasn't great because the COVID had already hit, but still,  this is pretty good. Google will dedicate $50 billion, more than it made actually,  for repurchasing of shares. This is very good for the stock price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Let's talk about that for a second. Yeah.  Let's talk about that for a second though. I think that's because there's another story  somewhere in the rundown about how, well, Google and Facebook, all these companies grew so big by  making acquisitions. And now with the antitrust breath down their back, instead of having the  cash that they have go toward what I would argue are productive things, they're doing the financial  game and they're buying back shares, which helps no one but the shareholders and doesn't invest in  the future of the internet and doesn't buy other companies and give others the benefit of that.  And this is to me a side effect of the antitrust mood that some folks are in right now.  Maybe. No.  And I think it's actually too bad. I say that as a shareholder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, no, Jeff. I think there is a legitimate case to be made that you're like, hey, you  should invest in things, but Google's cash on hand exceeds a hundred billion dollars.  So when you have that much money sitting around, that is a function of you are accruing.  I mean, I know in Wall Street terms, there's no such thing as too much cash or too high profits,  but when you have that much cash sitting around, you do have to do something with it. And yes,  you could say I can't buy any more companies, but well, yeah, I see that they can't buy any  more company or that they might be hesitant to buy other companies. But I also see that  you can't deploy a hundred billion dollars buying small things. You have to buy big things.  And I would say the ability to amass that much capital over a relatively short amount of time  is indicative of the fact that there's no competition for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a problem for Apple as well. There is a benefit to stock repurchase. There are a couple  of benefits. Of course, it does increase the value of the stock because you're decreasing the number  of shares. But remember that the stock is one of the ways companies like Google attract the  best employees. So improving the stock market, the stock value, the stock price helps you acquire  better employees. So there is a direct benefit to the company. And I think you're right, Stacy.  It's a problem for any company that rakes in so much cash. They got to do something with it.  You can do acquisitions, but acquisitions are more than the cost of an acquisition is more than the  money you spend. You then got to assimilate them. You've got to use it properly. There are many,  many cases of companies throwing away money on acquisitions. Microsoft threw away money on Nokia  and Overture and took huge write-offs. Google's probably the same. The other thing you could spend  money on, Jeff says, is R&D. Here's the graph of Google's R&D spend. And R&D spend has been going  up and up and up. It was $27.5 billion in 2020. I don't know what it will be this year, but there's  a very steady increase in R&D spending. So it's not like they're cutting back on R&D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I would also argue they could pay their taxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, but that's up to government. You're right. They're not going to pay more than they're required

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  to. Right. No, I know. I'm just pointing out that if we tax them appropriately and shut off various  loopholes, we might be able to, instead of Google saying, oh, I'm going to invest in my R&D to bring  fiber to the home or invest in wireless networks or whatever, we could actually do that maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on a federal level. No, I'm with you. We should tax the rich,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  damn them. That graph you showed, I figured that would be the draw to get some of the best  employees into the company. Just how much money is being invested into the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to work for a company that's on the move, but if I'm going to hire you and I say,  come to work for this great company because it's wonderful. And oh, by the way, we'd like to give  you stocks so that you can participate in our success. That does add some value to it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that would add value to someone that's in a leadership role. I don't think it's for the  people that are under, like in the subordinate levels. Engineers get stocks to build something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's how Amazon is. They get stock and they get rich on it.  Yeah. Amazon's like, here's your set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm saying to get the stock, but I'm thinking the draw would be more along the lines of,  come join this team and build something big. That's because you're not motivated by money.  Yeah, maybe that's... That's nice, Ant.  I have my moments. Don't get me wrong. I like cash too, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're competing against Microsoft, Facebook, Apple and some small startups. And I'm sure that  if you're coming out of college, you've got great skills. You are the top 1% of programmers, say,  or engineers. You have your choice of any company. You might be saying, well, I should work for a  startup because I like they're going to change the world because they figured out how to do blood  tests with just a drop of blood. Or I want to work for... I think if you're looking at a company like  Google, there's a risk for Google that, eh, Google, they've done it all. They've been there. What could  I do to make a difference at a behemoth like Google? So it may be hard for them to acquire people  on the market that you described who are looking for the great company to work for. It might be a  lot easier for them to attract people by saying, oh, and by the way, our stock is worth 700 bucks  a share and you're going to get a hundred thousand of them. Welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah. Now you're talking.  Now you're talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I've been told, I have no idea. No one's ever offered me a job for any of these companies,  but I have been told that that is one of the reasons companies want to keep their stock price  high because they use it as an incentive to bring people in and probably to keep good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But even without the stock repurchase, Google stock was headed. Well, actually it wasn't a little  stagnant. You're right. You're right. Amazon's was going up. Google's was a little lost, a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  steamed. That's why I don't like to talk about stock value so much when we talk about tech in  our context, because it isn't always a reflection of how well a company is doing or how well it's  innovating. In Apple's case, there's stock market values through the roof, but a lot of that's  because they rebuy a lot of things. They bought it back, right?  Yeah. So they were out of- Which they didn't do for a long time.  They didn't. And their stock has gone up a lot more since. And so that's a way you can kind of,  that doesn't tell us anything about the company, just that they're willing to reinvest profits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  My view is, as you know, is the internet is yet young. And so more investment in internet  development of new things makes me happy. The problem is Google could go into an entirely new  field, but they'd get smashed for new, even if they didn't buy it, they just went into it.  They'd be accused of steamrolling somebody else right now. And so I wonder whether that money  could be invested in entirely new lines of business that would be productive,  but won't be now. That's my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The wheels will.  That's that Washington Post story that you're talking about, which I thought was  biting the hand that feeds it, but still, because Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, they have to do that every now and then to prove that they're not under his thumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. It was honestly an argument to break up the big tech companies. I mean,  remember this is in Washington, D.C. and Congress probably reads this, how big tech got so big,  hundreds of acquisitions. And the thing that's the most interesting about this is that the  acquisitions are clearly designed to do a couple of things to either make, and this, by the way,  is David Cicilline from Rhode Island, who is the chair of the Antitrust Committee. He said,  these monopolies have exploited the weaknesses of the existing law and lax enforcement  to maintain and expand their market dominance by buying up or burying those they perceive  as competitive threats. And here's the biting the hands that feed you part of it. Here's Amazon.  So on the left, it's kind of hard to grock this right off the bat. Acquisitions in the original  business, which is selling books, on the right acquisitions in sectors they own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Which was never really the original business. That's a mistake right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's say e-commerce. Yeah. Well, Amazon knew that, but watch, because initially a lot of  e-commerce purchases and then here and there purchase in new sectors. But as time goes by,  we're at 2007, suddenly the e-commerce purchases slow way down and by 2012, most of the acquisitions  are on the right hand side. They're in new areas, publishing, Twitch, social, video games,  IOT, video, e-sports. They're suddenly buying robotics. And so that's, and no, you might just  say, well, that's a company that's growing, right? And entering new fields. But if they're  using their monopoly on the left side to enter new sectors on the right, that's when the antitrust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, how would they use it? How would they, how did they do that? How do they use a monopoly

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  in e-commerce to go into Twitch? For Amazon? Yeah, how was the monopoly? Wait, are you talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about Amazon or Google? Explain how Amazon, this is Amazon, explain how Amazon uses its monopoly  power in one market to enter new markets, Stacey. So Amazon, actually the Wall Street Journal did a

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  lovely article citing examples like two weeks ago, but for example, they have the ability to  sell lots of things. So when they started talking about Ecobee on the smart home side, Ecobee is  the maker of a smart, what's it called? Thermostat. Amazon actually invested in them too. They told  Ecobee that they wanted data from the smart home that Ecobee didn't want to give them,  even if it wasn't tied to Madame A. And they were like, no. And then Amazon's like, give us this  data or we won't list you on our, for sale on our platform. Oh, that's a really good example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Right. That's bad. But the example we just came through, how did, how did the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  the power on the left lead to Twitch? It doesn't every single time, but you could say that if I  am on Twitch, people's big, big revenue generator is tips and placement of like devices. Maybe Amazon  forbids a creator from going on Twitch and sending things to another website, for example, or using

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  affiliate links someplace else. Well, in the simplest form, you've built up a cash haul that  you can use to acquire people. Yeah, it's cash. Yeah, it's obvious. Right. Or you just, you just

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  do a loss leader on acquiring people and content or you use your network effects. You know, a really

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  good example is how, is diapers.com. This is all an e-commerce, but it's, but it's exactly how  antitrust works, which is, you know, the undercut, you know, diapers.com until it was non-profit,  it wasn't profitable anymore. And then they bought it and it's how you kill competitors.  So that's, you know, that's clearly, you know, monopolistic behavior and it's illegal under US  law, but if it's not prosecuted and that's what's Cicilline is saying, look, as we didn't enforce it,  so they were able to do this kind of thing. Twitch, it might be a little bit harder to  explain, except that maybe Amazon said, you know, gaming is the next, they bought other  e-sports as well. Gaming is going to be a big category soon. We ought to expand into that  category. And maybe they didn't use their monopoly to do that, but that, but there are plenty of

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  examples of them using their monopoly. Well, they can always do it later. I mean, they don't have to,  you can buy something and be like, well, we're not sure how this is going to work out, but we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  going to keep an eye on it. Right. Anyway, that's, you know, we'll see. The EU is expected to announce  an investigation of Apple's monopoly in its app store this week. Congress is clearly  poised to do something. Even the White House, as we talked about before, they hired Tim Wu and a  number of other people who are very much about breaking up big tech. This is on the horizon.  And who are dangerous to free speech. Well, we could talk about section 230. That's another,  yeah, another area. My blood pressure, you just love my blood pressure. I don't have allergies.  Yeah. Well, let's not get there. Let's not get there yet. We'll save your blood pressure for later.  Let's finish the financials. Yes. So they had a, they had a, Google had a good quarter.  Cloud. Now let's talk about cloud because I think Stacey probably has some stuff to say about that.  Was, was very big. $4 billion in the first quarter. That's another 46% growth from the year  prior. Microsoft had a similar, in fact, maybe even larger growth in its cloud sector,  huge growth in the cloud sector. Is that, that's as much a change in the way things work these days

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  as anything else and COVID, right? Maybe. If I'm looking at, I mean, Google's cloud earnings are  nothing compared. Well, not nothing there, but, uh, Miniscule. Amazon's, Amazon's are going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like 15. Google's a fraction of Microsoft, which is a fraction of AWS. Let's put that one. AWS,

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  let's see, they have Q4. I don't think Amazon has reported yet for, uh, Q1, but Q4 of last year,  they were 12.7 billion. I'm just looking to see Q1 of 20, uh, looking for the number. I don't know.  Um, but the point is so small. Profit margins on, I would be really interested in having Google  spin out its profit margins on cloud. I feel like they do a lot of marketing and stuff that  AWS and Azure don't have to do because Google is still very much an also ran cloud. They have,  um, I feel like they must give a lot of way basically. Um, I don't know what else to say  about that, but they're spending, I mean, it makes sense for Google to have a cloud operation  simply because they've got to support their own operations. And this is like an add-on to everything  they have to do anyway. Does that make sense? Yeah. So if you look at their CapEx and their  data center planning, you know, they might as well throw a cloud in there. Brady R in our Discord

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  chat was wondering if, if you could say that Google's cloud has anything more than a hobby

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  at this point. It's more than a hobby simply because they hired Thomas Kurian. I mean,  this, this is a big deal for them. They do want to boost this and they're going to get much better.  They finally hired people who are cutthroat and willing to like offer cloud and real enterprise

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  services. So yes. And by the way, he's got a big contract with, um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh really? For back end broadcast. It's a Spanish language digital transformation, but I, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Stacey sounds skeptical. That's just, you know, I don't get so excited about media companies.  They're your cloud demands as a media company are not as exciting as your cloud demands as  many other types of companies, I guess. I, I'm just, I don't know. I'm like, fine. They're not,  it's not like getting a financial services, like a bank or something, or even an interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  industrial manufacturing client. It's a media company. The self same Brady R asked, uh, or  actually responded to you, Jeff. Yeah. There's an area he'd like to see Google put some of that  money into Google fiber deploys. Yeah. Yeah. They kind of backed off on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's not economical for Google. I know. That's okay, but they got enough money. Let's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  let's help some people out here. They announced two new deploys in Utah last week,  of all things. I thought they were done with it, but apparently not completely, not utterly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold back. Yeah. Uh, would the cost of that eventually go down over time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, no. So their issue is Google, Google thought they could do it. They, they built their own  equipment. They came up with some really innovative trenching things, but what happens with fiber,  it doesn't scale like, you know, deploying servers or software scales. It's, you still have to dig,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  dig a trench. Yeah. And they were probably counting on, and you've, you're an expert  on this Stacey. So I'll defer to you on this, uh, sharing telephone poles with utilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh yeah. They fought the good fight to try to get access to telephone poles. And there is actually a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook is pioneering a better aerial fiber. Uh, this is for the last mile that they, because you  can trench to a certain point, but at some point you got to get to the house. You're not going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  trench every house. The trench is usually to the house. You usually do aerial. You hang it from the  telephone poles for like along the roadways. And then there's the last like a hundred feet to the  house. So it's the other way around. Okay. Got it. That makes sense. Google also, it's not, I don't  think they talk about this a lot, but they actually build their own Metro fiber ring around each city.  They don't use other people's infrastructure for this. So they, like in Austin, when they finally  launched it, they brought us all in and they showed us like where they actually live. And I was like,  that is like a full on telco deployment. I mean, it was pretty significant. I thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  even so you couldn't get it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Right. And what they wanted, the technology they thought they had for, they called it  micro trenching. It didn't work out. So then they ended up having to like truly dig holes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, okay. So Google's got, okay. So we're all in agreement. Google has a lot of money.  We don't agree on how they spend that money.  And we wish they would spend it on something that we would like, you know, like a pony, but no,  they keep buying back stock. Are we in agreement? That's kind of, that's the gist of that conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Have they bought back a bunch of stock in the past?  No, this is, they don't buy back stock a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  50 billion is a lot, especially when your profits were only 33 billion. That's a lot.  What were their profits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's just for the quarter. That was just for the quarter.  It was 18 billion for the quarter, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But the 50 billion is over a year or something.  Apple's numbers are up too now.  Oh, Apple's are out? All right. Let's go to the tape. You have a ticker tape in your office?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Are you asking me?  How do I make a ticker tape? What does that sound like?  Let me reach out to the Bloomberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you have a Bloomberg-y Mr. Jarvis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He seems like he'd have a ticker tape over there under a glass dome.  And Stacey seems like she should have a Bloomberg table, terminal over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Do I look like, am I made of type?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go. Linotype. Yeah. All right. I got something completely different.  Completely different. And then we'll do Apple. But I was just reading this great article.  Do you know what the Mandela effect is?  Negative.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Mandela effect is based on a researcher's discovery that most people think that Mandela  died in jail. Nelson Mandela. So really?  Yeah. Fiona Broom, who's a blogger named the Mandela effect after she learned a number of  people shared her erroneous belief. Human rights advocate, Nelson Mandela perished in prison in the  80s. Of course, remember he got out of prison.  He was president of the country. But there is this Mandela effect. So I'm going to test you  on the Mandela effect. Are you ready? Does the Monopoly man have a monocle? True or false? Yes  or no? Monopoly man? True. Yeah. It's a monocle, right? Right? Yeah. No, he never had a monocle.  Okay. The New Yorker dude has a monocle. That's probably where this comes from as a confusion.  Just like a lot of people think that they grew up eating Jiffy peanut butter, there is no Jiffy.  Oh no, no, no. It's Jiffy or Skippy. Yeah. Or Giff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Which also proves that Giff is Giff because Jiff is Jiff, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way. Let's just be clear.  All right. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're not going to fight about that now. Later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I didn't read the book. I saw the movie.  No, this isn't the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, geez. Yeah. The killer never says the line in the movie. Instead,  he says good morning when meeting Clarice for the first time.  Good morning.  Let's see here. This is kind of fun.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you remember Ed McMahon?  Monocle is Mr. Peanut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Mr. Peanut. Yeah. That's what happens, I think, is in your mind. Remember because  everybody thinks that the comedian Sinbad was in a movie as the Genie, but he never was.  Right. I did hear that.  Because they mixed. Yeah. Did Ed McMahon ever show up at anybody's house with a big  oversized check?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Yes.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, there was somebody else. That I do know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  Star Wars fans have apparently a lot of Mandela effects.  What did Darth Vader tell Luke when he revealed his parentage? Did he say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Luke, I am your father?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  He said, no, I am your father.  I am your father.  No, I am your father. Yes.  I am your father.  You remember that. Very good.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We watch a lot of Star Wars and as the heart of it, so much so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. I'll give you some more. There's some more of these. Okay.  This is a bizarre one.  People think C-3PO is all gold. He's covered with gold. You know better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. He has wires hanging out of the right near his belly, but I believe that's more like a shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The lower portion of his right leg below the knee is silver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Why would people think about this?  Okay. I was kind of thinking he was brass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did Tom Cruise in Risky Business dance in his underwear and Ray-Ban sunglasses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't watch Risky Business.  Oh, it's a classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, the sunglasses were a different scene.  He didn't wear sunglasses. Yes, right. Very good. It wasn't Sinbad, it was Shaq.  I heard Sinbad.  Okay. The widespread belief that an entire feature film exists called Shazam. Oh yes,  starring Sinbad as a genie. What they are probably recollecting is Shazam with Shaquille O'Neal.  That was Shaquille.  But people, I tell you, people will swear, oh no, no, I remember Shazam. It was a great movie with  Sinbad, right? Never.  This is why witnesses are not-  Are terrible. Eyewitnesses are terrible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was Shazam with Shaq, but people thought they saw Shazam with Sinbad.  Yeah.  All right. That was just a break so that you would be able to stop your discord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Before we go in, can I just do a little plug for something?  Yes.  Thanks to Stacey.  Yes.  So Tuesday, Stacey and her wonderful husband are nice enough to come and speak to a group of  people trying to start their own media businesses through my little school.  Nice.  And I wanted to thank her for this. And if you are running, if you're an independent journalist  running a Stacey-like business, trying to make a go of it, serving your market directly,  DM me if you qualify and we'll try to include you in with your email address.  I'm trying to start a business.  Stacey and Andrew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have this idea for a podcast network.  Could I come in and-

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's like, Leo, you are far above and beyond my business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, not true. That's great that Andrew's doing it too.  That's great.  I'm very grateful.  He's the money man.  Yeah. It's a two-part thing, right? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah. He's also, I have seen the presentation. He's actually doing a presentation for you,  Jeff. He's very conscientious.  Are they PowerPoint slides or keynote?  He would be doing PowerPoint and Google slides.  I would be working in keynote, but what was I going to say? He's run a publication for years,  longer than I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Nice.  Stacey, when you found yourself on the street and debated to find another job or not,  what was that conversation like with Andrew? Did he say, listen, we don't want to do this?  No, don't do that. Or did you say, I want a job or do you say, I've had my last job,  I'm fed up with it? How did that happen in your head? What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, when I found myself on the street, it was like a week, if not less, that Fortune said,  we would like you to come to us. So my time on the street, I don't have a resume.  I didn't have that. And Andrew, but as I became increasingly miserable, Andrew was like,  you could start a business. I was like, no, no, I don't want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Ah, so he took you away. Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  He did. Well, I think it became pretty apparent that if I didn't start a business or leave that  job that Andrew was going to be like, I don't want to be, I don't want to live with you.  It wasn't really that bad, but I was pretty unhappy.  How long were you there? Not even a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So from the first glimmer of a thought of, did you think about, I'll get on this in a second,  but I find this fascinating. Did you, before you went there in that week in a regnum,  did you think, no, I shouldn't do this. I should go, or did Andrew say, or did you think then I'm  starting a business or was only when you were in the new job, you got miserable and said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  All right. When I was overwhelmed at GigaOm,  starting a business was always on the table as an option. So probably as far back as 2013.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it was festering. Yeah. Like some sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So when you started it, one last question. So when you started it,  was there a cycle of hope and despair to hope and normalcy kind of, was there a moment you  said, Oh, what did I just do? Or did you, from the first minute say, thank God I've done this and

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  never look back? Oh, no, no. I still question it. Like even today I'm like, I should get a resume  put together. Really? Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're such a success. I respect that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's very hard to do something on your own. I'll talk about this with your people, actually.  This isn't really a, I don't think a great, for existential soul-searching purposes,  I find having my own business hard. Every time I go by a McDonald's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it has a help wanted sign. I still make a mental note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah. Like seriously, I have my plan. My plan is Starbucks barista for the win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, cause I worked at McDonald's and I know how to run a fryer. And I think if ever I need a job,  there you go. There's somebody looking. You can push those buttons.  I got the skills. They might say, you're a little old. How long has it been?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  40 years. You could be a greeter at Walmart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can always do that. No, no, no. People would never be able to shop  because you talk them to death at the door. I think you'd be a great greeter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I beg your pardon. Hey, wait a minute. Come here. Let me tell you a story before you go shopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are good Walmart greeters and dinners. What color was C3PO's leg?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There he is dancing, by the way. See the silver leg? See there?  Was it a spare part? Yeah. I think that's what the, uh, those  little job was we're doing when they, uh, and here's another animated gift from the discord.  My name is Kazam. You know, that's one thing that we miss that we don't have in the IRC.  It's probably a good thing is animated gifts, but they are all over the discord. Everybody does that.  It's a good thing. It makes it fun. It makes it. Yeah. Gifts are the best.  I kind of regret, uh, in Slack. They have that capability too. I finally had to put my foot down  and said, I'm trying to read these messages. Can you say, Oh my gosh, are you one of those mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  bosses who say no animated? Oh, Leo. I just said in the general channel, right. I just want to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  able to read the messages without having wade through dancing bears. If you don't mind. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then what's funny is you like within a week after that, you put a chip in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know. But I, well, but I had a good reason. That was when we were raising money. So, uh,  I had a little animated thermometer gift that showed, you know, how much money we'd raised.  And I apologize. I said, I know I'm not supposed to do this, but I'm gonna break my own rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Later on, I put it in blue on the run. Now we'll talk about base camp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, oh, put a pin in that one. I do want to do it real quickly before we take a break. I want to,  this was also from the discord, uh, Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google talking about  on CNN about the COVID crisis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At the highest levels from president Biden, secretary Blinken, there's been focus on  engaging to see how we can help India and the other countries being affected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I won't play the whole thing, but I think it is important to note that Google is putting some of  that money, uh, $18 million towards COVID relief in India. Uh, and I would hope to see other  companies do the same thing. It's a global crisis. It's not a United States crisis. It's not a  problem we can solve in the U S all by ourselves. Uh, because if, if people are dying in other  countries from COVID-19, uh, that's just as much of a risk to our shores as it is to theirs. So  I'm glad to see it is enlightened self interest to help the world. That's exactly right. Yeah.  It's a global crisis. It's not a local crisis. You know, sometimes you got to do things globally.  Unfortunately, uh, we will come back and I do want to do, um, your little, uh, your little thing.  Did you see the little, no, we did Google earnings. They're done.  Apple's earnings. You pro apples. We could do apples. This isn't the apple show. Did you see,  yeah, no. Okay. You, you're right. Keep me honest. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Can I play the federal trade commission keeping you to your promise? I know she's tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got it pulled up. I'm ready. No, no, no. Good. Cause I don't so good. Keep it, uh,  real quickly. And then we will go to our ad Google's ad from the Oscars the other night.  Did you see this? I'm what's called the code. This was really good. Child of deaf adults.

Transcript:  My parents were both born deaf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many people are deaf in the world is this search 466 million. Hello and sign language.  And he gets a little grandchild. Turn on caption. Isn't that great? Love the captions.  Oh, okay. I'm going to cry now. Damn you Google. And they're teaching their baby sign, which is  wonderful. Oh, I love you. Yeah. We can't wait for you to meet him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's actually appropriate for the Oscars because one of the nominated movies,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the sound of metal is exactly about that. The experience of the deaf community and, uh,  boy, if you haven't seen that, it's a well worth it. What a good movie. Um, yeah, that's touching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it? Yeah. All right. Now we can take a break. And then when we come back,

It's a Barack Obama's now normally audible has great actors hired  to read these. But in the case of a promised land, which is the former president's  memoir of his time in office, he reads it and it's great because you're in effect hearing in his voice  what it's like to walk into the oval office for the first time, what it's like to sit down with  the cabinet table for the first time. You know, he describes the situation room. He says,  from movies, I thought it was going to be this giant cavernous place with this big table and lots  of screens and stuff. He says, really kind of a small room with some TVs. It would be shamed to  be at a sports bar on the wall. It's really great. He's got a sense of humor. He's a very,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  very talented writer. I began writing this book shortly after the end of my presidency.  And he can read. After Michelle and I had boarded Air Force One for the last time and traveled west  for a long deferred break. The mood on the plane was bittersweet. It's just really great. But that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  one of the things I love about Audible is it brings the experience of people into your ears,  into your life in a way that no printed book can do. And you can listen to audio books,  whether you're watching the dog or washing the dishes. Lisa and I have formed a new habit,  which I really like of instead of watching TV at night, we'll go to bed early and we'll put  an audio book on and listen to it together. And it's really wonderful. She picks one, then I pick  one, then she picks one. I'm just a huge fan. And we're really happy to have Audible back as a  sponsor.

And folks, do you ever listen to audiobooks? I don't know if you're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a BOLU member. Oh, yes, sir. I love audiobooks. And I got a bone to pick with you because on  Twitter this Sunday, you brought up an audiobook that you loved and had all of the different  emotions involved and whatnot. And my argument is American Gods, the full cast version. Love it.  Oh, love it. So daggum good. I put that audiobook up against any of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, and I've listened to it. I own it. The 10th anniversary edition is a full cast production.  Audible does this with some of the books. They did that with Neil Gaiman's, I'm sorry, Neil Gaiman's  other, his comic book, The Sandman. The production of that is just as good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Are they pulling it from the BBC versions? No, Harper Audio. So let me play a little bit of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  American Gods for you. They took her to the cemetery in a big old Cadillac. They took her  to the cemetery, but they did not bring her back. Old song. I have taken the liberty,  said Mr. Wednesday, washing his hands in the men's room of Jack's crocodile bar,  of ordering food for myself to be delivered to your table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, let me tell you, you may have seen the TV version of this, which is great. You may have  read the novel, but you have not experienced American Gods till you've listened to this.  And just imagine, you know, lying in bed and listening to this. It's a movie and your brain  makes a better sets, better everything than any movie can be. It comes to life. You are there in  that alligator bar. You are there. It is amazing. I agree with you 100%. That's one of my favorites.  All the Neil Gaiman stuff is good. And by the way, many of Neil Gaiman's audiobooks, he reads  himself, which it turns out he's a very good reader. But there are, here's the BBC one. You're  talking about BBC. BBC did Never Wear. Yep, I have that one too. Christopher Lee, James McAvoy,  Natalie Dormer, David Harwood, Benedict Cumberbatch is in it. And this is RT De Carabas.  The best possible experience. This is why you've got to join Audible. I'm just saying.  You see, I have two credits. I know. And I always look forward to credit day at Audible.  It's on the 22nd of every month. What am I going to listen to next? What are you waiting for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Can I give you an Audible hack? Yeah. So first, thank you. Welcome back Audible. Thank you. Glad  you're here. Second, the reason I'm on Audible and have been is because of Leo and the commercials  here. Oh, good. Which got me all enthusiastic. So,  I saw I want to learn my German again. I'm so bad at it. I decided so Pimsleur is a wonderful  language course. I love it. Half hour a day. I've been doing an hour a day and I was doing  Spanish in the car, but for reasons I want to do German now. But it's expensive. It's like,  I know. It's 20 some bucks for every five lessons and there's five levels with 30 lessons each.  And so if you buy it straight out, it's 550 bucks. And I was about to do that and I went to Audible  and I saw that if I switched my plan, I was on the Audible Premium Plus plan, getting a credit a  month. I switched to the Audible Premium Plus annual with 24 credits. Oh yeah. Instead of  two a month. So I got the entirety of the Pimsleur program in German for 229 bucks.  Good deal. Now then, I'm using my whole year just on Pimsleur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll add to your hack. There's another place where you can get a lot of college courses.  It's called the Great Courses. I get the catalog. It could be really expensive.  They've got the Great Courses on Audible. So we've talked before about John McWhorter. He wrote the,  what is it? Our Bastard Tongue. A Bastard English Tongue. And Talking Back, Talking Black.  Talking Black. He is a lecturer and he does the story of human language among others in the Great  Courses series. I've been listening to this. So if you ever thought, oh, it'd be really fun to study  with Professor McWhorter because he's one of the great linguists alive, he's at the Manhattan  Institute, you can go and listen to these lectures right here on Audible. The thing is, it's more  than just audiobooks. It's all sorts of stuff. Einstein's Relativity and the Quantum Revolution,  Modern Physics for Non-Scientists, The History of the Medieval World, Building a Better Vocabulary.  I wish, honestly, my life is too short. There's too much good stuff. I just, I want to listen to it  all. And it's all available to you right now at audible.com slash twig or text twig to 500 500  A U D I B L E audible.com slash twig. It's really a way to get more out of life because while you're  doing other stuff, you know, raking leaves, washing dishes, walking the dog, you can listen to Audible  and expand your whole world. I think it's the single most valuable thing that I've ever done  and I'm really glad to have him back as a sponsor audible.com slash twig or text twig to 500 500.  Gee, I wonder if Apple had a good quarter this year. How could we find that out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Let me tell you, Apple had an astonishing quarter this quarter. CNBC calls it a blowout quarter.  Their sales for the, this is their second quarter of their fiscal year, just so you know, they're  not a calendar fiscal year. Their sales were 89.6 billion, which is 54% from the same period in 2020.  Driven by device sales, iPad and Mac sales nearly doubled. This is possible,  partly because COVID people have been buying computers left and right. They also for the  first time in a long time have boosted their profit margins to 42%. Profit margins are the magic of  any financial, I don't know, it's profit. And Apple has done a really good job there. I mean,  their margins are exceptional for a hardware company. At 42 at 38%, they were great at 42%.  Holy cow. It's like they don't actually have to make physical devices.  And then the other thing worth noting is their service revenue was 16.9 billion, which is about  19% of their total revenue. And we were like, not even a year ago, we're like, Oh, Apple really  needs to get into services. And they're like, Okay, sure, we'll do it. And holy cow, they're  doing all right there. And that's where that's where I'm going to assume a lot of the profit  margins are coming from that and the freaking expensive $1,000 iPhones. I'm sure the gross

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  margin went up because of services for sure. Yeah. They are by the way, we said Google was doing 50  billion in stock buybacks, Apple's going to do 90 billion. Yes. Do we know what Apple's current

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  cash on hand is versus Google's? I'm going to look that up. It was well over 200 billion last I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  checked. I'm sure I don't know what it is currently. I could probably find that for you. They're  spending it down. But with revenue growing at that rate, you got to spend it fast to keep up.  It's incredible. $17.73 billion in China alone. I mean, it is max sales up 70%.  You know what else is up? Dogecoin. Yeah, I know Jamer B loves that.  Elon Musk and Mark Cuban. I think Elon's doing this just to see what he can do with tweets.  He just loves the power. Dogecoin, which was created as a joke, cryptocurrency, a meme,  the Doge meme, a Shiba Ibu, thanks to tweets from Musk and Mark Cuban saying, what did Elon Musk say?  He had a funny little tweet. He calls himself the Doge father. He's also mentioning he's  going to be on Saturday Night Live on May 8th. The Doge father. Yeah, that's by the way.  As I've said before, it just proves you don't have to be funny to be on Saturday Night Live.  That's all. I guess we've known that all along, haven't we? Mark Cuban tweets, because Doge is  the one coin that people actually use for transactions. We take many others via Bitpay,  but people spend their Doge. That means more businesses will start taking it.  The greatest inhibitor to its growth is you can't spend the Doge you buy on Robinhood. That's why

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  he likes Dogecoin. Oh my gosh, you could have magical speculation in cryptocurrency markets,  fueling massive speculation in the stock market. Holy mackerel. Now you know why GameStop.  Well, GameStop wasn't fueled by Bitcoin or crypto. It was just fueled by bored people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with stimulus payments. I think there was a correlation between the Stonks folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I thought it was just they're like, I'm bored. Let's make some fast cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fast and magic cash.  And that differs from the Bitcoin investors. How?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, I'm saying that's the correlation. I'm not saying there was a direct link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's see what the current Doge price is. I'm just curious.  31 cents.  Oh, it's not that high. How much did Father Robert have?  Well, he started it like four cents.  He had millions. Father Robert had millions, but he sold them for a thousand bucks total.  He could have had maybe several hundred thousand.  Welcome to crypto, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But just over a month ago, it was roughly a nickel.  Yeah. It's a big jump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon has said it's going to raise wages for half a million workers between 50 cents and $3 an hour.  That's, you know, they were at 15.  So the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.  Amazon gets a lot of heat. I think this is one way they're responding to that heat to say,  no, not only do we pay our employees, well, we're going to pay them even better.  It'll spend more than a billion dollars on incremental pay for those workers.  So I think, you know, we talk a lot about Amazon and being not a great employer, etc.  I think it's important to also mention that they are going to give everybody a big raise.  Let's see. That was our money segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's sort of par for the course from a raise standpoint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's okay. You can call me your money, honey. Go ahead. I know you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will not be called a cadet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. Moot has left Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had questions about this. I didn't even know this moot person was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Who or what is a moot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We reported it. If you'd listened religiously, which is the only way to listen to Twig,  you would have known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I have my sacrament right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Yes, that's right. You've got to be on your knees while you listen.  Chris Poole, who founded 4chan, left 4chan, came to Google. He was there five years.  He held several roles, including starting at its social media arm. I guess that's Google Plus.  CNBC isn't clear. Eventually taking a role on Google Maps. His last official day was April 13th.  He has not responded to requests for comments, nor what moot means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Any mention of how many shares he has?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He sold the 4chan for an undisclosed amount to a Japanese entrepreneur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was he 15 years old when he started?  He was a kid. He was a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Age 15.  Amazing.  That was in 2003, so he's a little older now. The boy genius of the underground.  Anyway, so much for that. It was actually fairly controversial. The reason I remember it is when  Google hired him because 4chan does not have the cleanest reputation.  4chan is not as bad as it... I mean, it's always been bad, but it doesn't seem as bad when you  compare it to 8chan.  Some anchoring going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Is that what you call that anchoring?  Well, in pricing, it's anchoring when you set a super high price and then a low price and a  medium price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get it. Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  When you anchor it like this is what something costs, or this is how decent a site should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Freakonomics thing where you set a low price, but you don't expect anybody to buy  at that price. The anchor. That's why Apple always says starts at $999.  But if we really want to make that profit, you ought to buy the $2500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You've got to buy a minuscule amount of storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $2399 for the top of the line iPad. That's where your 42% profit margin comes from.  God. For an iPad. That's before you get the keyboard, which is $350.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That thing is crazy expensive, but I'll admit I would love to have one as a reference display  for editing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because it's the mini LED. There's just a new display technology that's reputedly very good.  It's P3 gamut and it's got very wide color dynamic range, high dynamic range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would love that compared to what those things normally cost. They're normally like $6,000, $7,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a reference display. Yeah. But it's only 12.9 inches, but it's still a reference. It's  very accurate. Yeah. The only reason I get it is maybe if I could do all my photo processing on it.  I don't know. I'm going to have to decide by 5 a.m. on Friday.  I got your back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You're just going to buy it, accept it. I mean, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you saying don't fight it? Don't fight the feeling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Just roll with it and you can argue that it's professional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. I have last year's iPad. I don't need another iPad.  You certainly do not.  It is probably the case. No one ever needs an iPad.  With a new screen, I think it's important to test the technology.  Oh, God. Thank you. Bless you, Stacey. I take back everything I said about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've only said nice things about me.  Oh, yeah. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  In my hearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I always say nice things about you. What's that you got there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is the sixth gen. This isn't a pro.  The reason I don't use it is because it's just underpowered.  I just don't have a reason to use it. I use it to read that Washington Post stuff  or every now and then some other online consumption.  But I would love to process more on it, but it's just not powerful enough.  I would like to have a pro, but man, they are super expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You can usually do trade-ins. I know Kevin, he has a pro and he loves it.  And he's looking at the trade-in value.  As long as Apple doesn't switch out the chips, you're fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ScooterX in our chat room is just trying to drive me nuts.  He's basically typing the specs in.  2D backlighting system with 2,596 full array local dimming zones,  2732 by 2048 pixel resolution at 264 pixels per inch.  ProMotion technology, wide color display, P3 two-tone display.  ScooterX, stop it. Sold.  Yeah, probably buy one.  5 a.m. I have to get up because I'm sure they'll be in short supply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Want to talk Basecamp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. What was this? All I saw was the headline. Fun names.  What was that all about? Fun names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So there was a reckoning at Basecamp where they had been keeping a list of fun names.  And they're evidently, I guess offensive enough that people wouldn't even tell  anybody what they were.  So first explain what Basecamp is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You better explain that.  So I'm actually fairly familiar with it because the guys who founded it, Jason Fried  and David Hennemeier Hanson are really great guys, very smart.  They created I think some of the earliest web 2.0 software.  There's software as an app, as a service that was running off the web.  DHH wrote Ruby on Rails. He's very well known for that.  And Jason Fried has written a number of books, including Rework,  which he wrote about 10 years ago about doing innovative new companies for the 21st century,  things like that.  It was originally called 37 Signals. You might remember it as 37 Signals.  They renamed it after their biggest product, which is called Basecamp.  Basecamp is basically a web-based project management system.  A lot of companies use it. Very popular.  So these are people who created accounts on Basecamp.  By the way, Basecamp had a very generous free trial.  So probably a lot of these are free trial.  So apparently some of the names were kind of like the names you'd hear.  Bart Simpson prank mowed the bartender with on The Simpsons, right?  I'm looking for a hugging kiss.  Amanda hugging kiss.  I'm looking for Amanda hugging kiss.  Get it? Or Seymour Butts.  Is there a...  IP freely.  Uh-huh. Yeah, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But some also evidently made fun of the southern cultures.  They were racist.  Yes.  Well, let's back up for a second here.  So what we see first is the founders of Basecamp, the bosses, saying new rules.  A few points.  One, there'll be no more societal and political discussions at our company on Basecamp account.  Period.  Number two, no more paternalistic benefits.  We're not going to nudge you.  We're going to give you a raise to make up for it.  You're not getting anything like that.  Number three, no more committees.  Period. None.  Number four, no lingering or dwelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Again, Freed is a thought leader in new ways of working.  That's a shtick.  He's famous for that.  So this has an even...  Yeah, it might be a shtick.  It is even more...  And again, I've interviewed Jason and David both on our shows, on Triangulation especially.  And I have a lot of respect for them.  But go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So real quick list.  No more lingering or dwelling on past decisions.  No more 360 reviews.  Yay.  No forgetting what we do here.  All right.  So it was kind of...  It was a very Jason Freed kind of,  this is the way we work and I'm going to change the world in that.  Yeah.  Well, Casey Newton did some really, really good reporting on this.  And found out about Team Outdoor.  This is on his, by the way, brand new platformer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Casey left...  Was it Vox or The Verge?  I can't remember.  To go solo.  To become, as Stacey would say, a sovereign writer.  Sovereign writer.  Sovereign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The Verge and Vox are the same.  If you want to be a Casey Newton, then DM me so you can come and hear Stacey and Andrew  There you go.  Be the next Casey Newton.  You could be.  So it turns out, this is to the point now of this list,  that this list resurfaced and there was a diversity committee and there was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody would talk about these names, by the way.  Nobody knows what the names were.  They were that bad.  They were so bad, nobody would even utter them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So what turns out was there were people, there were employees who were trying to have,  as many organizations, including my own right now, are trying to have right now as a racial  reckoning and trying to have the proverbial difficult conversations everybody says they're  going to have and don't have.  They were having discussions on the internal tools and they had a committee about this  kind of stuff and people were very interested and then boom!  Stops because of that note saying, oh, we have new ways to operate here.  No politics.  Now, to me, to say that a company isn't political is like people saying the technology is neutral.  It's not.  Companies are political.  What you choose to do as a company, what you choose to do there is political by its nature.  You need to be able to discuss these things, especially today in America.  You've got to be able to discuss race.  Is it political?  Yeah.  And it's also core to the society and where we are and how we reckon with it.  So Casey did, I think, really good reporting with current and former unnamed employees  of anonymous sources going through this and comparing it to Coinbase,  where the same kind of thing happened.  They banned internal political discussions.  Well, when that happens, it's probably because they don't want uncomfortable conversations.  And so what this comes out is it looks like, oh, this is a really cool company  getting rid of 360 review and committees are so boring.  And yeah, politics gets people in trouble.  Let's not do that.  Well, actually, said Casey, it may be that they are trying to steamroll over  the problems that they should be dealing with.  So I found this to be just a fascinating one, two punch.  I read the base camp post first thinking, OK, more from Jason.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then to get the backstory from Casey was really good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it the backstory or is it just Casey's?  I don't I disagree with you.  It looks more like Casey's gloss on it without actually any direct experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, he interviewed employees.  I mean, that's how Casey didn't work there.  People were talking about quitting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So I think the issue there's this is tough.  This is worth talking about simply because it's tough and it's common in,  you know, in many organizations.  It's how democratic can a company be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, we know this one isn't.  It is not a democracy here at Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  We know that maybe that's why I'm banning gifts on his internal.  Maybe that's why I'm sympathetic to Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His thought might be, you know what?  This is an internal.  I don't know if it was it wasn't slack.  It's slack like it's base camp.  But this is an internal this place for get for doing.  We're here to conduct business.  Work done.  This is not for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But if it's if you have a racist experience at work, that that part of the business,  that's what you got to absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But should it be discussed at base camp or should you go to HR and say that dick is a racist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I mean, well, so when it's your company culture,  if the company culture is to have a broad have a set of basically a racist meme,  let's just call the list a racist meme that people have been contributing to for years.  And you're like, hey, this isn't cool.  And they recognize that they were like, that isn't cool.  Let's take it down.  But as people pointed out in Casey's story, also outside of this list,  is if you're talking about things like compensation on the site,  you know, if your compensation is basically built on tenure there and everybody who's there is  white and male because, you know, they're just tackling diversity issues, then you have to talk  about these things as part of business.  And maybe it's something about focus groups that you're trying to, you know,  it features in software like black people really hate something about our software.  I don't know.  I'm just making things up.  You know, you have to be able to talk about that.  And I think the big uproar and I think what's hard and what we're going to be dealing with  for decades to come, and I think it's going to be painful, but really important is  we have lived forever in a society that is inherently racist and we don't always  recognize those things.  And when people pointed out to us, it's really uncomfortable because no one wants to be,  most of us don't want to be a jerk.  And so when you start talking about that in work, some people are going to be uncomfortable.  And you can always point out, hey, well, maybe everybody else has been uncomfortable this whole  time and they just didn't, they couldn't talk about it.  And so now they are, you know, but it's still hard to get your work done and also be made to feel  bad. And this is going to be a dynamic that we're going to have to deal with.  And Jason basically is saying, we're going to not have these conversations as a way to not deal with  it, which I think is reflexively what many people will want to do, but it's not the right thing to  do. And it's not going to help us address all of this. And I think this is gathering so much  speed because this is a microcosm of literally everything we're having to talk about and go  through in America today. And I think that's great, but it is hard. Okay. That was my, Stacey gets

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  really sincere. No, and I think that's a really good point. I think what you're seeing is that  Jason and David, who, you know, look at the end of the article, it says, and I think this is true,  that basically Basecamp exists as Jason and David's kind of, basically exists for David and Jason's  enjoyment, one employee told me at the end of the day, if they're not interested in seeing things  in their work timeline that make them uncomfortable, it distracts them from what they're  interested in. And this is the culmination of that. And so I understand. I mean, that's kind of how  Lisa and I run this company. It's for our enjoyment. As a small company, especially,  that's kind of not unusual. But you make an excellent point that there has to be somewhere,  if people are uncomfortable and there are things going on that make people feel uncomfortable,  there has to be somewhere to discuss that. So here's what Casey wrote,

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  interviews with a half dozen Basecamp employees over the past day, paint a portrait of a company  where workers sought to advance Basecamp's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion  by having sensitive discussions about the company's own failures. After months of  frothed conversations, Fried and his co-founder moved to shut those conversations.  They just cut it off. Yeah. And there was a DEI committee,  there was a DEI council that attracted significant support, more than a third of the company,  20 out of 58 employees volunteered to help. They began examining Basecamp's hiring processes,  processes, how Basecamp employees socialize, what speakers they might invent to all remote events  and such. But in the aftermath of these discussions, employees began to discuss the list of the  customer names. That's when it got uncomfortable and that's when they shut it off. That's a problem.  And to act like this is forward thinking company, when that's what's happening,  that's not transparent and that's not really dealing with the issues you should deal with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's my view. And it's really a shame because people do. Go ahead, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do agree with the point that these conversations should be had and I think it's good to have them  in a private HR setting, if you will. But if that doesn't happen, then yeah, that's when you take it  to the big board or the general audience if you have to get heard. Would it be okay if they said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  all right, we're going to set up an area of Basecamp that's for these conversations, but we'd like  to segregate that from the area where we're trying to get work done and trying to make this business

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  run, but still have those conversations. You can't run a business. I think the point you might be  thinking about is can you run a business today without running into, let's say, systemic racism  and sexism? And many people would argue that you can't. We think we can because we've done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I understand. But I think it's probably unproductive and it might hurt the business  of the business is that there's disagreement. Anytime you're going to have a political discussion

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  among any group of people bigger than five. It's not politics to say, hey, we should be recognized.  I'm sorry, systemic racism isn't politics. It is the way we...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but understand what the conversation is like. You would say that, which you agree with and say,  you know, and then somebody's going to say, no, you're full of it. And then somebody else  can say, no, no, you guys are crazy. And then there you're going to get this battling going on in this

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  message group. So if you talk about it from that, sure. If you say, but if you're, I mean, these  conversations come up, like I'll just tell you, I had a conversation with my editor at IEEE at one  point and I had brought up using smart home products as people using them for domestic violence,  right? As a coercive tool in domestic violence. And that was not the point of the article. The  point was something related, but not that. But I focused on that and he was like, oh man,  they're going to hate this. And I was like, why? And these are the kind of things like, so we had  this back and forth and he was fine with it. He's like 27 years old and he's like, of course we  should be talking about this, but you know, the old guard doesn't like it. But that's a conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to you and the editor. What if you put that in the public group and had 20 other people weighing in

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  on it? I think that's okay. And you can always have someone say, all right, this is done moving on.  I mean, well, I think that's kind of what Jason said. Well, sorry, you can't say this is done  forever moving on when it's like, you can say, Hey, I don't think we're having a productive  conversation now. And I think this is a skill people need to learn. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We can have these conversations, but we can choose a different forum. Forum. Did that come out right?  Yeah. If we're going to talk about operations, let's talk about operations. If we're going to  talk about some issues, let's talk about these issues over here in private eye to eye and get  this stuff hashed out so we can get back to operations and making money. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I also think there's value in doing it in a public forum because it allows people,  if you can keep it civil, it allows people to be exposed to other people. Like I sat in a meeting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  where the top editors made fun of microaggressions. See, that's why I say a separate forum because I've  never seen it be civil in a big group. It always devolves into a bunch of finger pointing and  misunderstandings. And then it's always out of context because things are written.  So you don't know the tone that is written. So yeah, the right way to handle this might be say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  look, this is not a forum for this. Let's have a company meeting, get it, bring in a facilitator.  We sit down, let's all discuss this. Facilitator needs to be there. Otherwise that's part of the  problem with the online forum is there's no facilitator. And we need to hash this out. And  yes, you're right. This is an issue we have to address as a company and we as the owners and  managers have to address, but this may not be the perfect forum for it. That would be an appropriate  reaction, I think. To shut it down and say, no, no, we're not going to talk about that. That's  dysfunctional. Yeah, that's wrong. That's just dysfunctional. A lot of families, a lot of groups  do that. We're not going to talk. No, no, no, no, no, no. We don't want to talk about it. And that's  not going to help an organization of any kind. So yeah, maybe this is a little, on their part,  this is kind of a knee-jerk reaction to, I don't want to hear this anymore. And that's a little  dysfunctional. I think maybe you're right. I just feel like, I don't know if Casey Newton is going  to get the actual, I guess somebody has to do this work, but this seems like an internal company

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  matter. Maybe not. Well, except for Jason Fried. Well, until he made a big announcement.  Well, he just put it on the block, but he's also someone that literally people look to understand  and deal with work-class culture. It's true. Yeah. I mean, he's worth profiling for that reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  alone on this. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. And it's a very outspoken, he's outspoken and the company's

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  outspoken about this stuff. Yeah. Yeah. It's unlikely that someone would take my internal  memos and post them. Even if I posted them, they wouldn't be talking about it. But no one cares  what Stacey Higginbotham is doing on her workforce. It's an interesting story. Yeah. Yeah. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll come around and say, yeah, my initial reaction might be the same if this kind of stuff happened  in our internal Slack at Twit. But I think you're right. If this stuff comes out. I think your point

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  at the end was right. You have to address it. There's ways. Right. But the thing is, Mr. LaPorte,  you should. There are ways to deal with it. Right. That's the thing. I've seen you and Mrs. LaPorte

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  say in meetings, hey, let's have a discussion over here. Yeah. And that's the right way to handle it.  If something comes up, you all have been very blunt about saying, come to us and let's talk

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about this. Part of the problem in a business is you want to get the job done of the business.  It's really easy to get sidetracked on these admittedly important conversations. But to the  point where the job stops getting done, then the business is going to collapse. So you got to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't get me wrong. I'm with you on that because I enjoy having my bills paid. But at the same time,  if there's a problem, I want us to hash out the problems. And I'm bold enough to come to you  directly in private, not with any disrespect to say, hey, this is an issue. Let's address it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  please. I think our Tricaster has crashed. We're stuck on the same shot. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I had issues with it this morning. I had a reboot Tricaster this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes we get in that situation. I'm looking at the, I'll take this opportunity  to look at the stage in the ClubTwit Discord and remind everybody. This is where we're going to  take audience feedback. I love it. This is where we take audience feedback. If you have anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you want to say to me, raise your hand. I hope you have on you. Raise your hand. I'll take this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  opportunity to mention that we have now a ClubTwit, which is pretty exciting. And it's been going  really well beyond my expectations. A lot of people had said to us, you know, we don't,  there's too many ads or more likely people say, I don't mind the ads, but I don't want any ad  tracking. And this is kind of, everybody agrees we don't want to add tracking, but advertisers  love ad tracking and they've kind of been pushing us in that direction a little bit.  We use services like Charitable and Podsites that we think are non-intrusive. They aren't the same  kind of tracking that is happening on the web. But at the same time, there are people who don't  want that. So we decided we should offer a way of supporting Twitter without ads, an ad free version  of our podcast network, and that's called ClubTwit. For $7 a month, you get ad free versions of all of  our shows. In fact, this ad will be cut out of the ClubTwit version of the show. But, and it was kind  of an unexpected benefit. We also decided besides the ad free versions, we thought that's the chief  benefit of this. No ads means no tracking. It's, you know, you get a feed that's just for you.  That's just, you know, the shows with no ads. We also thought we should set up a Discord server.  Discord is a very popular chat platform originally for gaming, now widely used for by a variety of  communities. It's become an amazing community that we've really had fun doing shows in and doing  other stuff in. So that's another benefit. You get to participate in our ClubTwit Discord. You also  get an additional feed that's not available anywhere else. That's the Twit Plus feed. And it's really  just stuff that's on the cutting room floor, the discussions before and after shows, little shows  we're doing in the Discord. Lisa and I did an Inside Twit last weekend. We also did a Linux show  on Saturday. We'll probably do that again this Saturday. Little things like that. And those go  in the ClubTwit Plus feed. So all three ad free plus the Discord plus the Twit Plus feed,  $7 a month. And if you want to know more, certainly no obligation. The beauty of this is nothing has  changed. The free tier is exactly as it always has been. Everything we've always done for free is  still available. And no one's going to look at you askance if you don't pay the seven bucks a month.  It's just a feature for people who wanted it. twit.tv slash club twit. But I have to say we've  been having a lot of fun in that Discord. I think you'll see it's well worth the $7 a month.  Nobody has raised their hand, Stacey. You're lucky.  Why am I lucky?  Nobody wants to get into this conversation. YouTube is doing so well. I mean, we saw the  quarterly results for YouTube on pace to bring in an annual revenue comparable to Netflix.  That's kind of mind boggling. And what a brilliant strategy to create a platform where you don't pay  any money for the content. You just make money on the content. Revenue of $6 billion for the quarter  up, as I mentioned, almost 50% from the year before. It's twice the growth rate of Netflix.  Netflix has about $29.7 billion in revenue, or will have in 2021. YouTube will probably exceed that  this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So what is that? I wonder what proportion of that is advertising, what proportion of that is YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TV? Oh, they don't break that out. That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's really interesting to know what drives the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's some numbers. YouTube users watch a billion hours of video, 1 billion hours of video  every day. Netflix, 400 million. So it's more than twice the content consumption. Netflix spent $17  billion to create its content. Of course, they don't have ad revenue. They have subscriber  revenue. YouTube does give some portion of its revenue back to the creators, but we don't know  how much. So it isn't exactly free. It's tiny. I think it's pretty small.  I can confirm that. Yeah. Yeah, we never made much money on YouTube either.  I don't know if it means anything. In some ways, they're very different businesses,  but it's still video entertainment on a screen. Just two different ways to look at it. Unfortunately,  if you use a Roku, you're not going to be too happy about the YouTube experience. And Roku says it may  lose YouTube TV after Google has made some demands. It just doesn't want to live up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just negotiation. Yeah, this happens every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, this is carriage agreement. Yeah, exactly. This is cable TV. This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the new cable TV. Welcome to Roku says Google has asked Roku to do things. It does not see  replicated on other streaming competitors platforms like creating a dedicated search results row for  YouTube within the Roku TV smart interface, giving YouTube search results more prominent placement.  Google has required it to block search results from other streaming content providers.  When users are using the YouTube app upon Roku system, you can't recommend anything on a different  channel. Roku alleges Google has asked it to favor YouTube music results from voice commands  made on the Roku remote. If the YouTube app is open, even if you set the preference to Pandora,  if you say play Barry White, it's going to play it on YouTube. That seems really if you've got  the app open, you know, Google has threatened to require Roku to use certain chip sets or memory  cards that would force Roku to increase the price of its hardware. YouTube says,  it's just a negotiation folks. We've been working with Roku and good faith to reach an agreement  that benefits our viewers and their customers. Unfortunately, Roku. Oh, this is interesting,  Jeff. Unfortunately, this is from YouTube TV. Roku often engages in these type of tactics in  their negotiations. We're disappointed that they chose to make baseless claims while we continue

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  our ongoing negotiations. They're being mean to us. When I was in the edge of the business,  when I worked for advanced and they owned a cable company, people would sit me down and say,  this is how it works in the cable business. Just for the sport of it, they leave not one scrap of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  meat on the table. Just for the sport of it. I have a little experience of this working for  Tech TV and the cable business. It is a brutal, brutal business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If this were to go down and YouTube doesn't end up on that platform, who's the winner there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  YouTube and Roku. Yeah, exactly. Nobody. And the biggest losers are we the viewers.  The viewers are the losers.  Do we want to cover these Facebook stories? Facebook stopped employees from reading an  internal report about its role in the insurrection. Buzzfeed News. They got out anyway.  Comic is unapologetic about putting garlic on fans' shopping lists. I just found this amusing.  Mike Trapp. It has come to my attention that some of you have had garlic added to your online  shopping cart while watching the latest Um, Actually near an Amazon device. At the time,  I was hilariously trying to use voice commands to make Mike Drucker's echo buy groceries he  didn't want. Well, this was obviously very funny during the filming and never dreamed it would  affect our viewers in the final cut and thus become even funnier. As a comedian, I must sometimes  experiment with bits that it may not work. And in this particular case, I knocked it out of the  effin park. Nevertheless, some of you may not want garlic added to your order, even though  you never really can have too much garlic. Probably low anyway. To these viewers, I'm sorry for the  inconvenience and only ask that you consider what a gosh darn hoot this is. I'll try to do better in  the future, but it'll be hard because this is the best. To which I respond, add garlic to my shopping  list. You could have picked a different thing to add. But I think he has a very good point. You

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  can always have more garlic. Okay. All right. All right. By the way, I actually write handwritten

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  garlic on our shopping list every week. Well, it's not a terrible thing because garlic's  relatively inexpensive. It's cheap and it doesn't last long. I actually bought on Amazon a garlic

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  keeper because I was so unhappy with the state of our garlic. So there. You know what I need now?  Maybe you can make a recommendation, Stacey. You seem to have kitchen sense.  I need a basket to hang the onions and the shallots in.  You can't just put them in a basket. Well, we put them on, right now we're putting them on a counter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I want something that just kind of. I have a bread basket that I just stick them in.  Is that what you do? I feel like it needs air. It needs air. That's why I have a garlic keeper.  It needs like a mesh of something. Yeah. And you should never store your onions and garlic

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  near your potatoes, by the way. My point. Exactly. Oh, I found it.  I have a basket. A three tier hanging basket fruit organizer, heavy duty wire organizer with  ceiling hooks. I wouldn't put your garlic in your fruit. How are you going to hang that? Just stick  a basket inside your freaking pantry. No, but if you're hanging it's in the air and it can circulate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It keeps the vampires away, Stacey. So my basket, this is like a basket and then at the bottom,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's a little ridge. Yeah. So the onions are off in the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  In the basket circulates the air. I mean, you do you man, but I don't think you need to. I mean,  unless you'd like really want a hanging basket. Garlic on my shopping list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Put a hanging basket on my shopping. Burger King's new ad forces Google home to advertise.  This is old. How did this get on the list? Because I put it in there because it was a greatest hits

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  on putting things on people's shopping. That was the classic. They got a lot of trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for that. Okay. That was relative trouble. Yeah. I mean, it's not like they went to jail or they  got fined or anything, but people sure shook their fists in the air at them.  Let's do a Google change log. What do you say? Play the drums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh no. Try caster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Try some more ram. The chat room is so mad at me.  I'm sorry. Google ads COVID restriction alerts, new road trip mapping features as vaccines enable  safer travel. So this is actually really good. If you search for hotels in Toronto, this is an  example from nine to five Google, you will see a big pop-up that says quarantine for 14 days required  after entry. And then there's even a checkbox that says receive an email. If this guidance  changes, Canada's really cracking down on the travel to Canada. So that would be a very good  thing to know. These are all for those in the U S who were interested in taking a trip  after staying home for the last year. You can also, let's see here. You can also,  in the explore tab on its travel site, instead of just showing flights, the page will now show  places you can get to by car because it's obviously a little safer to go by car during the pandemic.  You can tell it flights only if you prefer, but it's nice to have that as a addition.  You'll see more destinations on the map too, including smaller cities and national parks.  So, and you can filter that as well, but some more ideas of places you can go as you plan your road  trip. And finally, they're adding more features for road trips. Oh, that's the more features  for road trips. Google does say travel demand is growing considerably. In April, 2021, the company  says searches for hotels were at the highest they've been in the last 10 years, but at the  same time, searches for quote travel restrictions by country were also at an all time high, which is  one reason I think. If we don't help the world, we're not going anywhere. Not going anywhere. We  might get back into a gosh, so sad if we had to go back inside after all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It was hot out today. You know, I was thinking I'm not ready for summer and heat. I was thinking  it's kind of okay to sit inside all of that. I was fine with that. I think we've modified, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  pork. We did Windows Weekly earlier and our host Paul Thurotte got his, it was two weeks after his  second shot. In fact, today's my two week mark. Thank you. And I'm tempted to go out and kiss  somebody, kiss a stranger just to celebrate. Just to get in trouble. Just to get in trouble with my  wife. But he went out, he went to Boston, hung out with friends, went to bars and stuff and came back

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with a horrific cold. Well, he's not a spring chicken either though, right? Well, but also if

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you don't, if you're not exposed to any germs for a whole year, yeah, that's what's going to happen.  If you take off the mask and don't wash your hands and suddenly you're going to get something.  Thank goodness it's a cold. Yeah. I mean, it's not the end of the world, but he's really  sounded bad, the poor guy. So maybe just stay away from people. How about that? Have some whiskey,  Mr. Thurotte. Yeah. A little peanut butter whiskey fixes all that stuff. Oh, whiskey with honey and  lemon. Yeah. Sure. That's my hot toddy of choice. Hot toddy. Get back in my body, you hot toddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  What whiskey do you like? Oh, for that, I just do whatever bourbon or whiskey I'm  laying around. I have a Bainbridge Island whiskey. It's nice. I don't have bad whiskey lying around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it's here, it's good. I discovered something at Safeway. They keep all the good stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  locked up behind a counter. You have to tell them. I want the good stuff. I didn't know it was behind

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the counter. There's some good whiskey back there. Some Whistle Pig, some Angel's Ending. Strange  thing to have grocery stores that sell booze. Do you not do that in Jersey? You have to go to a box

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  store? Well, a few do. Yeah. Google? Yeah. In Texas, you don't either. That's right. It is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do they call them? Package stores. Is that what they call them? Yeah, packaging stores is what  we had in the Carolina. We just call them liquor stores, but sure. Same thing in Canada. You have  to go to a special place to get your booze. You just have to go to a beer store. Beer store. Just  beer. No longer. Google Fi, happy birthday. I didn't realize it was six years old this week.  They have a new simply unlimited plan that lacks unlimited plus extras. Oh, what a way to celebrate.  In the beginning, remember Google Fi was simple. There was one plan. $20 gives you unlimited text  and calling and then $10 for every gigabyte of data. That was it. Then they introduced a couple  of years ago the bill protection thing. That was for $80. Then a year later in 2019, the unlimited  plan for $70. Now, this is their third new plan, simply unlimited. Unlimited data, although you're  capped at 22 gigabytes, so it's not really unlimited. Talk and text. Unlimited. But you don't get the  international. See, I've been paying for a Fi and one of the reasons I use Fi all this time is  because it's great for international travel, but what a waste for the last year. Well, but you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  pause it for three months at a time, which I finally did. That's good. It took me a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to see that. That's good. So this limits international data benefits to the US, Canada,  and Mexico and no tethering. $60 a month for one user. And as you add lines, it goes down $30 for  every line when there are three or more members. So that's the simply, that's not complicated at all.  Simply not unlimited plan. Simply limited until you get 22 gigabytes and then it's limited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What? So $60 per line per month? Yeah. That's a lot of money. That's a lot more than we've been

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  paying, right? Because we only pay if we use data. So I don't, yeah. There's also-

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  A lot of people are raising their prices now. The post pandemic price mageddon.  Oh no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Spotify is raising their prices. Procter and Gamble raising their prices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lots of companies. Yeah. Spotify went up on the family plan, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's only like a buck. That's how they start though. You know, it's a buck here, a buck

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  there. I don't believe it. That's how it works on the table. Also they have a hundred dollars off

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on select phones to celebrate. We'll see if they have some new phones soon. Yes. So we should talk  about that because- Well, but is that change log or is that real? Oh shoot. Darn it. No. I'm so  easily distracted. Squirrel. Squirrel. I-O. I-O. You know why? Because I really hate the change log.  It's so boring. Google run Android Earthquake. Why do you do it then? Because somebody said I had to.  It's not boring. It's not boring. Sometimes it's- It's relevant information about Google delivered

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  relatively quickly. We're doing it. Now we know who said you had to. We're doing it. And Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're doing it because we called the stupid show this week in Google. So we got to have something

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  in Google-y in there. Yeah. As opposed to this week and Jeff and Stacy and Leo arguing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what it really is. This week in Discord. Not with a capital D, a lowercase d. Google run  Android Earthquake alert system now providing warnings in first two countries. Drop, cover,  and hold. Here comes an estimated 6.1 earthquake 16 miles away. God, I don't want to get that  announcement. I'd rather just be surprised. Now available in Greece and New Zealand.  There you have it. I guess we have it in California too. So wait a minute. I'm confused.  They have- The detection system has been live for the past few months in Northern California  or in California. Oh, it's the US Geological Survey's Shake Alert system.  Now available to Android users in Oregon as well as California. It will roll out in Washington this May.  The big one comes, you'll be carrying your iPhone. The detection system. See, the thing is that's  really interesting to me is the sensors in these phones are sensitive enough to pick up the shaking.  I guess though distinguishing between an earthquake. Oh, I know why. Because it would be me and John  would both be shaking at the same time in the same way. Then you would say, oh, there might be an

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  incident going on, right? You're right. Well, it could just be tied to the fact that the USG,  whatever. USGS Shake Alert. GS sends an alert out and then you check it out.  I mean, we could all get together in a room and shake our phones a lot. That's true. But it seems

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  like that there's something. Google's too smart for that, Stacey. Well, so I actually just,

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  like literally before the show was talking to a company that provides sensors that measure  earthquakes. They use highly sensitive accelerometers. You need them in two locations to do this.  There's actually pretty solid algorithms that you have to develop to figure out if it's an actual

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  earthquake. So what I'm guessing is since you don't get these alerts on your Android phone  now in the US, but you can get it now in Greece and New Zealand. They're trying it out in Greece  and New Zealand before they roll it out in the US. But Android owners will be able to opt out  from Settings, Location, Advanced, Earthquake Alerts. It's in there. And it says, according to  9to5Google, the detection system has been live for the past few months, but Google has not been  using it to send alerts yet. Rather, those that looked up quote earthquake near me in Google's  search were asked if they felt shaking. Did you feel shaking? That's not what I want if I search  for earthquakes near me. Do you feel something? Yeah, that's how it feels.  You're feeding the algorithm. Okay. So we don't have it yet. They do in Greece and New Zealand,  but I'm guessing it's a small pilot just to see if it's safe. Get ready for-  Three stories through the changelog, folks. Oh, we're moving faster now though. Get ready  for guacamole. One of the things I like about my Google Nest Hub Max, when I set a timer and it  starts beeping at me, I can just shout, stop. And it will stop. I don't have to say the, hey,  goog thing. As an example, hey, I'll add garlic to my shopping list. I don't have to say that.  I just have to say, stop. Which is what apparently a lot of people are doing right now.  Anyway, this is called guacamole. It'll let you snooze without saying hey, goog.  So- I don't understand.  Is it an alarm? Skip saying for help with quick tasks,

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  but they don't say- How does it always listen? So then it just is always listening?  Well, no. I mean, this is a relevant question to ask. It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So ringing alarm can be canceled just by saying stop or snooze. So-  Because it knows because it's ringing the alarm. The alarm is ringing and it says,  okay, let's listen for snappy snooze. Okay. When the phone is ringing, you can say answer or  decline because it knows. Oh, okay. Again, context. That makes sense.  Yeah. That's awesome. So I think it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  They didn't explain it very well. Guacamole is the name of the update?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's the name of a very delicious avocado-based dip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm like. I'm like, if you said, let's talk about guacamole. And I'm like,  yes, let's. And then you're like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You were excited. We've been-

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  How much garlic do you need in that guacamole? Should we order some more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. The feature is code named guacamole. Don't bother me.  Why? Who knows?  Why? Who knows? Because it's fun to say holy guacamole. That's why. Wait a minute.  Is it working for you, Ant? Or did you just get an earthquake alert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no. I just got the update for another part of the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, coming here. Which one is that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's moving us along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The denoising option in Google Photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sharpen and denoise rolling out to Google Photos. Mr. Photographer, what does sharpen and denoise do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, see, if you look at a photo that you take in low light, you tend to get a lot of grain and  noise and artifacts right there in the background, if you can see it on this camera.  But the hard part about this is a lot of times Google's HDR AI will try to  fix that before you even see this part of it. So I was wondering, I don't know how useful that's  going to be, but I finally found a shot that actually had this noise in the background.  So it's a dim shot of a bottle of whiskey and a glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so you get all that grain. Oh, it kind of does. Yeah.  It does pretty well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I can tell you, Ant, that I feel so sad when I take a photo and Google's like,  this is a photo, but can I recommend a shot for you instead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That is an insult.  And then you're like, dang, Google, so cruel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I just wanted to complain about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they missed a bet. They should have called this bring out the sharpen and bring out  the noise. But okay. Sharpen is what? What is sharpen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sharpen is, in layman's terms, the best way to try to give your subject a little bit more edge  to stand out from its surroundings. But you don't want to over sharpen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always over sharpen. I know.  Because it looks really bad.  It looks really bad.  It'll have halos around them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like this feature for Google Assistant. If you flub your voice command, how many times do you  do that? You start a command and it just kind of disintegrates on its way. It's like, oh, just

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  forget it.  Put garlic on my shopping list. No, I mean shallots.  Shallots. So I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google is working on knowing that when you kind of correct it that, oh, in fact, I think this  happened the other day. I said something, I set a timer for five minutes, I mean 10 minutes,  and it set a timer for 10 minutes. So it's starting to learn.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  It's in your head.  They call it the BERT system, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers.  It's basically natural language processing. It looks at every word in the sentence as a whole  and tries to make those corrections on the fly. That's interesting.  And I think it did happen to me the other day.  So you want to try it right now?  No.  Okay.  That would slow us down and we're moving on. YouTube adds even more video resolution controls  and options on mobile. So now you can change the resolution. Just play with the options  if you're on mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I didn't like that. The change in resolution, it used to be so much simpler. You just hit the  hamburger button and it gave you your list of resolutions, 480, yada, yada, yada. Now it's  like scrolling through and okay, no, you want the maximum. But well, then again, this maximum isn't  quite the maximum. So you hit one more screen. I didn't care for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it's the choice between simple choices and granular, more granular. And I guess they're  opting for more granular. You can change your YouTube channel name, but not your Google account  name. So if you didn't like your YouTube channel name, which by the way happens all the time,  or your profile picture, you can change it. And there were instructions here at cnet.com.  It's in the edit channel section. But you can't, sorry, Jeff, you can't change your name  in your work account. It took Google 526 days to give you a way to search through your 172 games  on Stadia. But you know, they're a search company. They should have figured out that people might  want to search through your games. They're adding a new revolutionary search bar to Stadia.  And that's the Google change launch.  Congratulations. It looks like Kevin Toffle is going to be a GT yellow jacket.  This is so cool.  Georgia Tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh, yes, he did post it. Okay. I didn't know. I was so excited for Kevin.  And a hell of an engineer. Yeah, he's a rambling wreck from Georgia Tech.  Yes, that's a little sad because he wanted to be a sun devil, not a yellow jacket. But  he was really excited about this program. It's all online. It is a legit program for him.  It's a master's computer science.  It is a master's. He's been teaching. Well, he's been taking college, like community college  programming classes, and he loves teaching people how to program, but he can't get any  jobs in teaching without a master's. I am more working with Kevin, obviously, but he's going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  be so great. Obviously, I have only a bachelor's and I have started three master's degrees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  We won't tell Kevin that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You'd think that his kind of experience would get him a teaching gig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  They're very focused on having that degree before he can...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is he trying to teach at community college level or something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah. I think he's... So, Kevin, every week he sends me something new he's coded up just for fun.  The other day, he was like, hey, look, I just made my own version of Trello.  And I'm like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. That's impressive.  Okay.  In Python?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  In Python, I mean, he does... It's in Python sometimes he sends little quizzes he's done and  see. I mean, it's just whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's very proud and nobody cares. So, we're going to play this song for Kevin Toffol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Georgia Tech and a hell of an engineer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead, sing it.  A hell of a...  It's all good fellows that drink my whiskey clear. I'm a rambling wreck from Georgia Tech  and a hell of an engineer.  Hey.  If I had a daughter, sir, I'd dress her in white and gold and put her on the campus to  cheer the brave and bold. But if I had something, sir, I'd tell you what he knew.  He would yell to hell with Georgia like his daddy used to do.  This is a very interesting song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish everybody had a marching band. I wish everybody had their own marching band.  This is just for Kevin Toffol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like individuals?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He is a rambling wreck from Georgia Tech and a hell of an engineer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love this song. I'm not a Georgia Tech fan, but I love that song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How long does the degree program take? How long is it going to be doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You can do it at your own pace. It's designed for people who have real jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Professor Toffol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Really excited for it, y'all.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So let's take one more break and then I will do some more news. How about that?  Speaking of rambling wrecks, I want to talk about the Enterprise Tech 30.  This is a list developed by Wing Venture Capital in partnership with NASDAQ.  The Enterprise Tech 30 is a list every enterprise startup wants to be on.  It's great for you. If you're a founder of an enterprise tech company,  it's the highest endorsement of your success, both current and future.  If you're trying to build a publicly traded company, man, this is a watershed moment in  your journey. But for the rest of us, it's also a great buying guide.  If you're an enterprise executive and you're trying to bring more validated and credible  digital innovation into your organization, look at the ET30. This is the way to go.  Now, there are a lot of lists, but I have to tell you the thing about the ET30 that's great is  you can't lobby your way onto it. You can only be selected.  And the selection committee is very good. Very good. So it's a really valuable list to get on.  Awardees to the ET30 are on a fast track of growth and to change how business is done.  They're on their way to future IPOs, multi-billion dollar exits.  The Enterprise Tech 30 focuses on companies with potential at all stages of maturity, not  those just mature already with traction. There are a lot of startups in there.  This is a hard thing to do. Enterprise Tech, especially if it's not public,  they're not publicly held companies, it's fairly opaque. It's hard to tell if a company is doing  well or badly and people are cagey about their growth and revenue. Sales cycles can be very long  and arduous. There are a lot of different stages you can be on and some of them,  you just don't have a lot of growth. There are a lot of lists. They're often dominated by consumer  brands, well-known brands or mature startups everybody already knows about. Not the ET30.  This is the way to discover new Enterprise Tech. There's no bias. These lists are created by people  who really know what they're doing. You can consider it an honor to be on it, a buying guide  for executives. High performance operators will use the list to guide their decisions on what  companies to go to work for as well. Kevin Toffle. Really, really good. If you go to the  website, enterprisetech30.com, we're on it right now on the video enterprisetech30.com,  read about the methodology. I think it's important. It's at the top of the list  because that is going to give you an idea of how valuable this is. There's no lobbying.  This is really deep research. A very, very valuable list. You can get it right now.  All you have to do is go to enterprisetech30.com to see who's on this year's list. It just came out.  Thanks to Wing Venture Capital and NASDAQ and the ET30 for their support. EnterpriseTech30.com.  The ET30 is out. I saw you pop that in your mouth, Stacey Higginbotham. I saw you pop that in your  mouth. Did you bring enough to share for everybody? Oh, that dog ruse fooled me. Oh, I have a package.  I have to go get a package. I didn't bring enough to share. The package is called Cheez-Its.  Your Cheez-Its in the mail. Your Cheez-Its are in the mail. Stacey, how pedestrian of you.  Cheez-Its are great. Do not knock. Cheez-Its are delicious. I agree.  Wheat thins or Triscuits. Wheat thins for the win. Yes, yes, yes. All three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Thin pepper crackers. I'm sorry. I can't do a show without them. That's more like what I

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  expected. She needs assistance. That's what I expected with Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Guacamole and then ants taking a little swig at something there. Oh, sorry. My goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Gracious. You weren't supposed to see that. Is that like a Snifter glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see it all. I see it all. This is a Glencairn. Oh, nice. Glencairn whiskey glass. I'm running out  of whiskey, so I'm trying to sort of go through it because once the bottle gets below half,  it starts to taste bad. So I'm trying to go through it. What? You mean once it gets old?  Yeah. Once it's about half empty. Does your whiskey have time to get old?  Tastes bad. Well, this is a two-year supply and I'm finally down to like my last two.  Yeah. You got to come to my house. This is my special one, my Glenjronic 18.  Wow. Look at you. I only drink that for really special occasions, but it's about  two years old and it's under half, so I got to get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know some ways you could get rid of that. I know how you could. Ant Pruitt's on TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this new? Yes, somewhat. Yeah. I'm on there. I only did it because of her, but I thought of Mr.  Jarvis. See, we corrupted you. No. Who's laughing? That's a track, a live track on there.  It's one of their sound effects. But I thought about you when I put that together because she's  always on TikTok. Yep. There you go. Queen Pruitt. Old timers on TikTok. And I laugh at it  because she grabs her glasses because she can't see the phone. Oh, I do the same thing. I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  not use my glasses to look at TikTok. I like to get up close and personal. She didn't know I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that of her. I showed it to her later. Oh. She was okay with it. I was going to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  oh, did you enjoy being married? She was okay with it because she knows it's true because she

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  can't have see the phone screens, but that's just old folks on TikTok. That's how we look, apparently.  I have other things out there, but I just wanted to share that for Mr. Jarvis. Well, be careful,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  though. Do not do the single ladies move on TikTok. I thought that was a good story.  Jekyll Knight is the choreographer behind Beyoncé's, Queen B's single ladies, all the  single ladies. He has copyrighted the dance moves from the single ladies video. I don't think you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  could copyright dance moves. Apparently. Apparently he has. Do you want to see it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This is Jeff and I typing copyright dance moves. Exactly. Choreography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It was a successful bid. Oh, it wasn't added into the copyright law until the 1976 law as a form of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  dramatic composition. So the move is with your hand to show your ring, put a ring on it. Is that the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  thing or is it this whole thing? That's a good question. I thought about this and it made me  think about Michael Jackson and it made me think about James Brown. When you think about Michael  Jackson from an entertainment standpoint, he was an amazing dancer and entertainer, but he was known  for that moonwalk. Right? Right. Well, James Brown did the moonwalk too. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh, well, so hold on. Hold on. If I'm looking at the criteria, protection is more likely if it's by  a skilled dancer, if it's for the entertainment of others, and finally, if it involves a story  or a theme. So that means I can't copyright the Leo. Okay. So hold on. Does that list say

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it has to have all three of those components or just one of the components? Because people on

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  TikTok are trying to entertain. Well, it's all of those things. Remember the attempts by

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Carlton from the Fresh Prince of Beverly Hills to Alfonso Ribeiro? Alfonso Ribeiro tried to sue  Fortnite Epic Games because there is a Carlton move. But in that case, the judge said, oh no,  no, you don't own that one. I've seen that all the time or something. I mean, it wasn't copyrightable

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because he didn't really invent it. Right. Yeah. Whatever it is you're trying to do, we get it.  Okay. You look like you had gas, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh, you can't copyright end zone celebratory dances. Oh, that's interesting. Or yoga positions

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  or social dances. What? Why not? Seems unfair. Oh, I-

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Not really. Yoga positions have been around for millennia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well, yeah. Okay. Thousands.  So Sundar Pichai says significant announcements at Google I.O. as product cycles return to  normal. We know Google I.O. Chromebook, Chromebook, Chromebook.  Will be May 18th through 20th. We will stream live streaming. I hope, maybe Jeff, you should  join me so we can hear you squee when there's a new Chromebook. We will stream the May 18th.  Squee. Squee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Squee. Keynote. It's on my calendar already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Put it in. What day of the week is that? It's a Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Okay. 1 p.m. ET, so 10 a.m. your time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Perfect. We'll do it right before Mac Break Weekly and hope that he sticks to an hour,  but if not, we'll push the shows a little bit. Let's see. What does it say here? No, it's two  hours. Two hours. Well, we'll be pushing Mac Break Weekly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  One to three. The developer keynote is 3.15 to four. And the what's new in Android  is 4.30 to 5.00 ET because I'm at the center of the universe, so figure it out, people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's good because all about Android is that night, so they'll be covering that.  Great. So the tease is that product releases are returning to a regular cadence. I had thought  that was a little sleepy last year at Google. Well, we talked about that, how they kind of  pulled back on the phone. Yeah. There was nothing in it.  So let's see. Pachai said YouTube shorts have six and a half billion daily views as of March.  That's the new compete with TikTok thing. Right.  This is all from their Googley quarterly results. So yeah, the new schedule is out for Google I.O.  The keynote 10 a.m. Pacific, May 18th. So we're adding to that to our calendar as well, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Were you surprised that Samsung didn't mention any Chromebooks this morning?  I thought they would. I really did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I was hurt terribly. Yes. I actually watched it.  Hoping.  Because I don't understand why they can't make that nice machine and then just say,  and you can get it in Chrome, I guess because you could also get it a lot cheaper than Microsoft.  So maybe they don't want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So basically they announced the Galaxy Book Pro and Pro 360 laptops. And they said,  and this was very odd, they are more like smartphones. I want a laptop that's more  like a smartphone. Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Because people use them every day. It was kind of interesting. They use it every day. They love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Touchscreen, stylus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Touchscreen. I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. It feels to me like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Touchscreen laptops, but I do like stylus interoperability with the laptop  because I like using Photoshop and doing retouches with a stylus. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Take it feels like, well, we have this really successful product category, these Samsung phones.  We should make everything more like that. And that seems like a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, they're also say they also did a shtick about how you're a, it's more  interoperable with the phone, which has been there for a while. And B,  your laptop should be your ideal hub for your IOT.  Right.  Wake up Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, with that argument, isn't Apple pretty much doing the same thing with iOS and how you're  trying to continue to link everything together between iOS and Mac OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I was like, I think that's terrible. Don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't want more iOS features on Mac OS. That isn't what I like.  I agree.  Yeah. All right. 15 inch Galaxy Book, 11th generation Intel.  It was all Intel though. No AMD, huh?  Nope.  Thunderbolt 4. They'll brand it EVO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It bored me watching it and I eventually turned it off because I had to come in for Floss Weekly.  It bores me talking about it.  But I was like, dang, no even, no Chromebooks really?  Yeah. That's sad as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, significant announcements. Google has not released a new Chromebook,  a Pixelbook in two years, three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Four years. Those are 2017. Oh, actually no, that's right. You're right.  Right. It's my Pixelbook.  The Pixelbooks.  They have the slate and then watch what we call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So they do. And I don't think they want to get out of this business.  That's actually important business for them, I think. Yes.  So SpaceX petitioned the FCC to let them fly their satellites for the Starlink project,  the global internet project lower. The operational altitude was originally  1100 to 1200 kilometers is going to go down. Wow. 540 to 570 kilometers. That's  336 to 354 miles high. These are very low earth orbit. That reduces latency, increases speed.  Amazon objected they were worried about it. But after the FCC issued its order,  Amazon said its concerns were adequately addressed by the conditions the commission placed on approval.  I think this is fantastic. I don't have any thoughts about that low earth orbit. There  may be issues I don't know about like astronomers, pictures of the sky, things like that.  The astronomers are not keen.  They're not happy. But I think global high speed internet at every square inch of the earth is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  good thing. Yeah. If it's truly global high speed internet, that's reliable. Yes. Yeah.  Yep. It's a big if. We have yet to have that for satellites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's going to be a transformation. Sorry. At a decent cost with decent devices.  It's expensive now. If you want to get in the Starlink beta, it's 500 bucks for the equipment  and 99 bucks a month for the internet. Yeah. But remember satellite broadband service was

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  terrible and expensive and slow. And then when you think about satellite phone service, it was  expensive and slow. So in this, I mean 99. Yeah, that's money, but it's not that much money for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  satellite. Publix bullies chicken tender sandwich Twitter account into silence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So this account existed to do one thing to tell you when the chicken tender sandwich was on sale  at Publix. It's all it did. Publix is a supermarket. Publix in the south. The sandwich  has the chicken tenders, the mayo, or this, that one sandwich, 2000 calories. Oh, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's, I, that's more than my entire budget for the day. 2000 galleries. Bless your heart.  Have some sweet tea with that and just kill yourself right out. Right. Just go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Diets, man. When I hear people talk about 2000 calories and stuff like that, I'm like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's breakfast. Yeah, but you lift, man. You lift. I get about 1600 calories a day total. Dad,  you lift. If I lifted, yeah. How many eggs do you have for breakfast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I really want to do like I should do, I would have six at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  My doctor said I could only have eight a week and I was really sad about that because I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  eat a lot of meat. So I do six. I would do six at a time, but nowadays I only do three or four  for breakfast. We go through a lot of eggs in our house. I highly encourage my name.  That's why you moved to Petaluma. We're egg country. I love it. I love it. Mr. Howell put  me onto Skippy's right down the street from the studio. Oh, love it. Thank you, Mr. Howell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's Skippy's? You never told me about Skippy's. It's the egg store. They have eggs and a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  other stuff there. Yeah. Is that next year's sushi gas station sushi store? It's right down the street  from the studio and they go in there and they got just a mound of eggs, organic or what have you,  and so much cheaper than going to the grocery store. I've lived here my last 30 years. I never

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  heard about Skippy's egg store. I go there every week now. Skippy's egg store? Is this it? Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's it. That's it. I'll get 20 jumbo organic eggs for like six bucks. Get 20 for like six bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that Skippy right there on the cash register? Is that Skippy or something? Dad, I'm not sure,

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  sir. That's gotta be Skippy the picture there. Sure. Oh, yes. I don't know their names. They're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  just ma'am. Our founder, Skippy. Our founder, sorting eggs right there in the framed photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't look that big. Oh, it's an egg farm. It's an egg farm. Yeah, it's a local farm. So,  you're supporting them directly. I like to live across the street from this.  Yeah, it's right there. I don't know about Skippy's egg farm. I'm serious. It's like five minutes,  if that much, from the studio. So, every Wednesday or every Friday when I'm at the studio,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  when I leave, that's where I go. I know it's in Northern California because it's right next door  to Funny Farms Hydroponics. So, it's definitely Northern California. Okay. It's your first stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Skippy's egg store. Let's see how the eggs. What else do you need? What are those big,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the big gallon jugs? They have cheese and they have ham, like sandwich meat, ham and whatnot,  but cheese and milk. I usually get milk there and get cream there because I like heavy dad gum cream  and coffee, not that half and half stuff. Give me all of that. It's a good day for Skippy's when

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Aunt comes home. Have you ever heard the, we talked about this on Sunday with Philip Elmer DeWitt,  who worked at Time Magazine. He was in that magazine. Isn't he great? And he said that at  time they had- I used to work with him. Yeah, you know Philip. Yeah, you were at Fortune, right?  Yeah, he was at Fortune. They used to have a phrase called bury the pickle. It's a journalism  phrase. I saw that. You guys, have you ever heard of that? Bury the pickle? No. It's not like bury  the lead. It's writing a headline of a story that's so misleading that the actual fact of the story  is not apparent until deep within the story. This is the pickle berry story that you were talking  about. You say in the show notes, explain this to me, Leo, from the Washington Post. Minutes before  Trump left office, millions of the Pentagon's dormant IP addresses sprang to life. After decades  of not using a huge chunk of the internet, the Pentagon has given control of millions of computer  addresses to a previously unknown company. In an effort to- well, then now we get to a little bit  closer to the truth in an effort to identify possible cyber vulnerabilities and threats.  And then if you dig a little deeper, this previously unknown company is called the Pentagon

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  and in fact, the whole thing- This story was all, yeah, this was terrible. I could not figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They sent a reporter, this is the funniest part. They sent a reporter to the business address for  this unknown company. Wait a minute, let me read this. This was funny. That part was funny. Yeah,  it's bizarre. As listed in the records, the company's address in Plantation, Florida,  outside Fort Lauderdale. It's called Global Resource Systems. It's a company founded in September  that has no publicly reported federal contracts, no obvious public facing website.  They spent- the reporter, this is where it began. This is the pickle, by the way. This is where it  began. The reporter found this, heard this. She said, she looked it up. The office, the company  addresses a shared workspace in an office building that doesn't show Global Resource Systems on its  lobby directory. That means she went there, right? She went and looked Global Resource- I don't see  it here. You're going to see that in a minute. A receptionist at the shared workspace said Friday  she could provide no information about the company and asked a reporter to leave. Leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I said, good day, sir. I must be onto something big here. They told me to leave. I'm on the trail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eventually, this goes on and on and on and on and on and on. Finally-

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Shaggy cable story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a shaggy cable story. Finally, a spokesperson for the Defense Department  confirmed in a statement to the Washington Post, the Pentagon still owns all VIP address space,  has not sold any of it to a private party because this address space, which is 11 dot- we talked  about it on Security Now yesterday. It's 11 dot something something something. They own the whole  11 dot, which is I think 145 million addresses. It's a huge number of addresses. The Pentagon,  remember, we have to remember the internet began as a Defense Department research project, DARPA.  Of course they did. They said, well, we'll take those. Not that we'll ever use them. In fact,  there was at one point, and Steve thinks this is the real reason for this, at one point Congress  wrote a bill, but it was never passed to force the Pentagon to sell these  addresses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, with the IPv4 like-  They'd be worth-  Oh, we're out of IPv4s.  Oh yeah, they're worth a hundred million bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. That bill did not pass. The Defense Department does not use them, but the problem is  you could set up botnets because they don't use it. You could do all sorts of nefarious things  pretending to be 11 dot. And so what they did is it's actually a completely reasonable security  process. They routed all the traffic that had been going through that just to see, and then they  searched through it just to see if anybody's doing anything bad with it and shut it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's the equivalent of having an empty house and checking on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Checking on the empty house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Thank you, Stacey. If only they'd said that in the lead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good day, sir. I said good day.  Good day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, the other question is minutes before Trump left office, part of the headline,  and the chat room came up with some pretty speculation that probably this completely normal  security procedure, this checking the house, this inventory, had approval from the prior  administration. And they didn't want to go through the whole process again with a brand new  secretary of defense and all of that. So they said, well, but you know, look,  we better get this done before the inauguration. So that's why they did it then. And I think that  makes sense. I don't know why. But in other words, as suspicious as this all sounds,  there's absolutely nothing nefarious going on. It's completely normal. Completely normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good day, sir. I said, good day. I love that. I love that. Good reference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More serious story. A man named Dan Kaminsky, who is a very well-known security researcher,  who's done some really, really good work in his life, passed away at the age of 42, very young age.  So young.  Really sweet guy. I did not know him, but Steve did and said he's just,  everybody who knows him says he was very, very sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This obituary was the nice, is it really a formal obituary? I don't know. It was,  as a journalist who has worked for years closely with some sources, I thought Nicole Perloth,  who has covered this area for years, did such a good job on a guy that I, many of my friends know  and were crushed by. So it was wonderful. And can I just say this story as a mom,  it made me feel so good. Here is a mom who had a real influence on her kid and did a great job.  That's all. Send it to your mom for Mother's Day and be like, you are this woman. You are  like this level of mom to me. And the mom will be like, thanks. Perloth writes in the New York

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Times obituary that Kaminsky was a respected practitioner of pen testing, the business of  compromising the security of computer systems at the behest of owners who want to harden their  systems from attack. It was a profession that his mother Trudy Morrow said he'd first developed an  act for as a four-year-old in San Francisco after his father gave him a computer from Radio Shack.  By age five, he had taught himself to code. When Daniel was 11, his mother said she received an  angry phone call from someone who identified himself, 11 mind you, as a network administrator  for the Western United States. The administrator said someone at her residence was monkeying around  in territories where he shouldn't be monkeying around. Daniel had been examining military  websites without her knowledge. The administrator warned to punish him by cutting off the family's  internet access. Mrs. Morrow warned the administrator if he made good on his threat, she would take out  an advertisement in the San Francisco Chronicle denouncing the Pentagon's security. I will take  out an ad that says, she said, your security is so crappy even an 11-year-old can break it.  They settled on a compromise punishment.  Really amazing. He discovered in 2008 a problem. This is his best known problem with the DNS system  and got everybody in the country to fix this. He called Paul Vicksey and Vicksey,  once he heard the explanation, said, I realized we were looking down the gun barrel of history.  It meant everything in the digital universe was going to have to get patched. Of course, Kaminsky  was very, very responsible. Told Vicksey first they fixed it before it was ever revealed to anybody.  He kept it a secret until he presented it at Black Hat. I can go on and on. Kaminsky was a  lifelong type 1 diabetic and unfortunately succumbed to ketoacidosis in the hospital.  He apparently had been hospitalized frequently in recent years. Very sad, but here is a man whose  life really made such a big difference. I think his mom is pretty darn cool.  He is somebody everybody in our community has heard of. We mention his name a lot talking  about security. EFF said Kaminsky was a friend of freedom and embodiment of the true hacker spirit.  The founder of Defcon and Black Hat suggested he should be inducted into the internet hall of fame.  So I can go on and on. But yeah, I think you're right, Stacey. Everybody should read Nicole  Pearlroth's story in the New York Times because it's really, really good. It's really, really good.  The final quote is great. The internet was never designed to be secure, Mr. Kaminsky recalled in a  2016 interview. The internet was designed to move pictures of cats. We are very good at moving  pictures of cats. We didn't think you'd be moving trillions of dollars onto this. What are we going  to do? And the answer is some of us have got to go out and fix it. And he did. So if you feel safe  on the internet, you can thank Dan Kaminsky. He'll be missed. I think we are ready. Can we do,

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  can we do, John, can we do immersive mode in Zoom? Have you figured that out yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do we? What is immersive mode? This is new. We haven't, I don't know. We haven't tried it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What is it? Well, kids, kids could virtually punch Leo. I was going to say the VR.  No, it puts you in it. I like what Stacey suddenly thought of as the very important

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  use of immersive mode. I missed it. What was it? Punch me. Oh yeah. See, Jeff's enthusiastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah. We can punch Leo. What is immersive mode? I don't get it. So, so if you, if you've got a

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  class, it looks like all the kids are sitting in rows in a class. Oh yeah. Teams did this ages ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a, Teams has this. There it is. Come on. Microsoft teams had this. In fact, the NBA  used teams, big monitors in the seats to pretend people were watching the basketball games.  Oh, I didn't know. Well, that's how they, oh.  Yeah. They were big monitors in the seats. Yeah. Teams has this, it's, Teams is more like you're at  a, in a theatrical, not, you know, a seating. This looks more like you're at a class bench.  That's cool. Immersive mode. That's cool. Can you punch me with this though? That would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Not in real life. I can just look like I'm punching you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In order for us to use it, you'd all have to be in the same zoom meeting and you're not.  Each of you has your own dedicated zoom. Oh, that's right.  But we, we, I mean, we've done it kind of here. That's what we do with the avatars. Yeah. You've  actually be kind of cool. You know, if we could simulate this table and put you at the table,  Stacey's arm was destroyed. She was, she actually, she, she said I could punch Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I was very excited about this. I know. Sorry to disappoint you.  You know what? One day Ant is going to be back in the studio and I'm just going to have Ant,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it'll be a punch by proxy. Oh geez. Ant's arm is a registered weapon. You can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm scared now. Instead of a full punch. I'll just have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Also, my punching may be amazing. You don't know that. It's not mine,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but it's not mine. I have seen Ant's biceps. I have been to the mountain top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Stacey, that was a, that was a threat Stacey.  You want to watch the- Your honor, she tried to hire me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to watch the kids guide to the internet from Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Welcome to the Jameson family. Hey there. It's us again. This is my brother, Peter,  mom and dad, and I'm Dasha. Today we're going to be showing our friends,  Andrew and Lisa, the basics of the internet. And we thought you might-

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Peter's definitely- It's a dangerous place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Peter is definitely up to something, something no good. I don't know about this Peter kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  When we installed internet access on our computer, I got the whole family involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's true. Everybody had their own tasks to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a lot of work. Don't you want to know where Peter is today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now that I've gotten on the internet, I'd rather be on my computer than doing just about anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying. What'd you find on the internet, Peter? What is it exactly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really cool. The internet gave us a whole world of  exciting new possibilities. So I guess this is a story of how it changed our lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can meet girls on the internet.  It doesn't that look like a face of a guy who's pretending to be innocent,  but really is up to no good. I'm just saying.  I think we're hearing about Leo's childhood. That's all teenage boys.  All right, get ready because we're going to do moral panic.  Is this the Washington Post brain interface story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your tech devices want to read your brain. What could go wrong?  Go wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something's never changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Hey, you could use your brain to just turn on the TV and turn it off. Isn't that cool?  But ethics experts say they don't know what could happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is it going to find when it reads your brain?  What could it put into your brain? It actually says that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, a little by the way. Now this is not moral panic.  This is really a scary story from the Washington Post.  She never returned her VHS copy of Sabrina, the teenage wish.  I love this story.  The DA's office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This happened to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  20 years later, she faces a felony charge.  She was trying to change the name on her Texas driver's license.  When they ran a background check, all they're seeing is these two words, felony embezzlement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So Blockbuster back in like 1999 or 2000, sent a ton of people to collections for tapes that they  either did or did not take out that were never returned.  This happened to you?  But this happened to me.  I did not get charged with a felony, but I did get sent to collections, which for me was a huge shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's terrible. No, that's almost worse than me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Blockbuster, yeah, Blockbuster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's the jail you don't get out of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  They had some sort of database error.  And what happened is people who took out movies like right after you on the card or something  got attributed to your card.  So they had me taking out some video I never took.  So this woman, and there's a bunch of people in the comments talking about it,  but it's from the same era when Blockbuster got super aggressive and had this whole  database issue.  They were jerks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, this woman didn't take it out.  She said, but she was living with a guy who had kids and she's thinking he went and got it  and didn't take it back.  What's even funnier is the cast of Sabrina got into the act, including Melissa Joan Hart.  Yes, who did the shruggy emoji.  Okay, that's terrible.  No, this was highly traumatizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.  I remember once flying out of the country and I remembered, oh hell, I didn't return a video.  And I thought I was going to come back bankrupt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the fees just mount up.  Compact interest works both ways, buddy boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.  What a ridiculous industry that was.  What a ridiculous industry.  Speaking of ridiculous industries, Verizon is looking to sell its media assets.  Who didn't see that coming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh boy.  How much do they pay for Yahoo?  What else did they buy?  AOL?  Tech Crunch.  Tech Crunch.  That came with AOL, I think, right?  Private equity firms among possible bidders for Yahoo and AOL.  You mean naming it Oath didn't fix all the problems?  Yeah, so Yahoo is now at this point a toxic asset.  That is so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, that's the other thing.  There's another story in the rundown that says that Yahoo was killing cultures because  it kills all these things like Yahoo Answers, which as laughable as it was,  was part of the culture and it's just gone.  There's no sense of archiving here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it sold Tumblr off to WordPress for what is considered a nominal sum.  They already wrote down...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Have naked bodies back or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Well, no, I don't think they brought back nudity.  No.  They already spent about...  How much did they spend on this thing?  A lot of money.  Nine billion dollars to acquire AOL and Verizon.  It's thought they might get four to five billion selling it off.  So that's a fairly big write down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, I don't believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They already wrote down four and a half billion in 2018.  They knew it was a turkey already.  November, they sold HuffPost to BuzzFeed.  Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Mail, TechCrunch and Gadget.  They generated seven billion dollars of revenue in 2020.  That's down.  But I guess it's probably a money loser in the long run, right?  Yahoo is so left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Why would you keep an underperforming asset?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yahoo is so laughable, but what if they had different leadership?  What if someone else...  Well, we've tried that.  They tried that.  What would you do with Yahoo?  Were those the right leaders?  What would you do with Yahoo?  What would you do with them?  I don't know.  I'd...  You're the leader.  You are now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Congratulations, Anstin.  Don't make him the leader.  I don't want to leave that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Turkey.  I'd sell a lot of it off because...  Yeah.  But no, what if someone that was like a Nadella...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if Elon Musk bought Yahoo?  No.  Possibly he's smart.  No.  No.  See, the reason none of those people have bought Yahoo...

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Because they're smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The reason a telco bought Yahoo is because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you do the math.  That's all I can say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Because Rupert Murdoch wouldn't even buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one wanted it.  It was a turkey.  Marissa Meyer is arguably the best possible person to try to turn it around.  She couldn't even turn it around.  I think it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Do you think she's sitting now thinking, I'll make a bid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  She's got sunshine.  That's her new thing is sunshine.  You know about that?  It's kind of a step down, a little bit from running Yahoo.  It's a contact list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Is that Reese Witherspoon's thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  She's got sunshine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's her sunshine.  Is it sunshine.com?  Maybe she's teaming up with Reese Witherspoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, Reese, I'm sorry, is Hello Sunshine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, hello.  This is just sunshine.  It's his contact manager.  That's it.  That's what Marissa Meyer is running these days.  Actually, she partnered with the programmer she took from Google over...  Here she is.  With...  What's his name?  She took from Enrique.  She took him over from Google to Yahoo and then on to Sunshine.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I gotta say, her fashion sense is still on point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at that.  Wow.  It looks like a butterfly's wing.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  He has always been amazing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Hey, where are we in this show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We are ready to do our picks of the week, ladies and gentlemen.  She ran out of the Cheez-Its.  I did.  I'm like...  She's out of Cheez-Its.  She's fainting.  Saturated with Cheez-Its.  She's ready for a trip to Skippy's Egg Store.  And we'll do that in a moment, but...  Let's in a bit.  The picks of the week.  Stacey Higginbotham, before you pass out from lack of calories, what is your thing this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Okay.  So my goal for y'all is to come away with a good idea for a Mother's Day present.  So I'm going to throw out some gadgets and ideas for you to put to your mom.  Okay.  Possibly.  Love it.  If this is interesting.  So first up, not a tech gift, but a really good gift for many people in many parts of the country.  Yes.  If your mom likes taking people outside an outdoor picnic blanket set up.  This is a good gift.  This is a good gift for anybody.  Like a picnic basket, a blanket.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Just get the blanket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  She doesn't need a basket.  Those things...  The blanket's useful for so many things.  All through COVID, we kept one in our car because sometimes you get takeout and you're far away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're saying give mom a corporate gimme.  Blanket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, no, no.  She doesn't have to.  They sell them at other places.  I think LL Bean sells them.  They don't give her, but like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look, mom, I've got the loyantouche blanket for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Okay.  You can also do that.  And if you want to make it super special and you have the ability, pack a picnic and give it to her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that.  And guess what, mom?  You get to take home the blanket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're a winner.  Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You're going to try to phrase it a little bit better, but yes, I would give her the blanket.  And have the basket ready.  Yeah, that's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And then when she opens the blanket, you could be like, great.  Now let's go to our picnic.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could do what my wife did, which is gave me something and said, have my son wrap this  and give it to me.  I love that.  That is also an option.  Honestly, the right thing to do, but go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So around the holidays, I told you all about the $30 plant sensor that I bought.  Yes.  And I have now had that for 167 days, it has told me, and I've changed the batteries once  I'm about to change it again.  So this is about six or seven months of having this thing.  So it's still working.  So I'm going to recommend that for your mom.  And if you want, you can also pop a house plant in there.  It's a Bluetooth sensor.  I'm going to put it in the notes for Jason to make his life easier.  And then the final idea, because this went over super well with my mom, is the Ember  coffee mug, which is a connected heated coffee mug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mom would love that actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Everybody loves this.  I mean, it is perfect as a gift because it's kind of extravagant.  The mug is like a hundred to $120 depending, but it's just so like, yes, it's a good gift.  So those are different price ranges.  $30, the blankets range and two of them are good.  So there's my Mother's Day.  Very nice.  If your mom's into these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Love it.  Happy Mother's Day.  Is that this Sunday?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh, no, here's the other thing.  It's May 9th, but the postal service is behind.  So let me recommend next week you ship that card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good point.  Don't delay.  I gave my mom a Whirly Pop and a six pound bag of popcorn.  Yes, she liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She liked it a lot.  Simple pleasures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Number of the week, Mr. J.  Oh, you're muted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Hello.  I had my allergies.  I had a sneeze.  Oh, yes.  So the Oscars, if you remember them, averaged 9.85 million viewers on Sunday.  In 1998, it was 55 million viewers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was not exactly exciting.  They were in a train station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Nice train station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, it's a good train station, but still a train station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It reminded me of kind of the very first Oscars, which were about that size.  Yeah, that's true.  Way back when.  Yeah.  A little dinner.  So I saw Axios said that theater operators were happy.  I don't fully understand the rationale here.  Kind of say, well, all your streaming stuff didn't work.  Oh.  I think people are saying movies, movies.  I got Netflix.  I got everything I want.  I don't know if I need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm glad Nomadland won.  I thought that was a really powerful movie.  Actually, I also thought Judas and the Black Messiah was really good.  And he won Best Supporting Actor.  I think they thought Steve Soderbergh was a director, big Hollywood director.  I think Soderbergh thought it's going to be Chadwick Boseman.  Chad Boseman.  Yeah, he pissed off a lot of people.  We're going to end with this beautiful moment, this tearful moment, this proud moment.  And it wasn't Boseman.  He was nominated, but he did not win.  And it just was kind of like a balloon with all the air let out.  I was just like, okay.  Poor Questlove had to say, well, it's been great.  See you.  This used to be a national holiday for me.  I was a little disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But I think I didn't watch a single movie.  We used to try to watch all the movies.  Yeah, I think that's over.  Netflix led with six wins.  Amazon with two.  That's actually a big story.  Netflix was dominant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, and they don't have the business.  But at some point they can wave goodbye to theaters.  They don't really care.  They put them in the theaters so they can win Oscars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what's needed.  Yeah.  You remember that, who was it, was invading against the idea that a streaming movie should  ever be nominated for an Academy Award.  That it should be in theaters.  But you know, economics has a way of trumping your heart.  So that's it.  That's my number.  Yeah.  Very low numbers.  Lowest rated Academy Awards ever.  Least watched, lowest rated.  Mr. Ant Pruitt, what's your pick this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have three.  The first one is I finally created an NFT because why the heck not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope you get rich.  I hope you get rich.  What are we bidding in?  Ethereum?  Ethereum.  Okay.  Ethereum.  Look at the cat.  The cat.  I call it what the hell cat.  What the hell cat.  You could own this fine cat.  You'd be the owner of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's really cool.  It's really neat.  It's a great picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I snapped that photo not too long ago, but then I just decided to have some fun with  post-processing and editing and turned it into that.  You put flames and fire behind the hell cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Minimum bid currently 0.5 Ethereum.  Sale ends tomorrow.  Hurry, hurry, hurry to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm going to relist it just to stick it out there because again, why not?  It's not costing me much of anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, that's who makes the money in these NFTs, right?  You have to go to a company to generate the NFT and they take some money, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just like any other place that hosts content.  How much does it cost?  You can pay for it.  It ranges.  I think I put in...  I think it was $30 or something like that.  Oh, that's not too bad.  Okay.  Yeah.  It was nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do they take a cut of the sale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not on that particular contract.  That's good.  It varies.  I did a little reading over the weekend on this stuff and that's how I ended up on that  particular platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good way to learn about it too.  Yeah.  You're now our resident NFT expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not an expert, but I do have something out there in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not as much as anybody.  AntPruitt.com slash NFT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an easy way to get to it.  Next, I did another short film.  This one's a lot shorter and I did it in...  Do you remember the first time you saw...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lisa showed me this and she was so proud of you.  She thought this was so good.  Is this with the Canon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's with the Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sony A1?  A1.  But that's...  I took an old video of the hard hit and decided to redo it.  With the new video and he obliged, which reminds me they're at their first track meet as of  right now actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry you're missing it.  Get out of here.  Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, we're going.  But that's my short and I had fun with that.  Showing off the camera and just sort of going down memory lane with him.  Filmmaker Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is the old video that you made?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was about four years ago, I think, or three years ago, something like that.  Gosh, he's a grown man now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at him.  He looks more mature than when I met him.  Not even...  It was about a year ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the boy looks like me more than I look like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he does.  That's really cute.  That's nice.  That's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is also...  Is that linked on your website?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's on my YouTube channel.  Okay.  Perfect.  YouTube.com slash Ant Pruitt.  And then lastly, there's a book out that just got released by the prolific author and photographer,  Mr. Rick Salmon.  I wanted to give him a plug.  It's the photo pursuit stories behind photographs.  It's a good insight into...  Yeah, you can tell someone how to grab shots for different scenes and compositions,  but the why is also helpful.  And the emotional part is really, really big too.  And we talked about that on the previous episode of Hands On Photography where I was able to sit  down with them.  And we talked a lot about emotions in photography because I know for me,  about 95% of my photographs have something to do with a feeling that I had at the moment of  clicking the shutter.  And this book is just another reflection of that from Mr. Salmon.  Rick is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to watch his interview on Hands On Photography.  It was this week's, right?  Twitter.tv slash hop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last week's?  Yeah, it was last week.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really, really good.  Twitter.tv slash hop.  Yeah, I just think Rick is great.  Really good get for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm going to go to the Hardhead's Track.  Oh, yeah.  Run out there.  Get on out there.  Don't miss it.  They did send me a video of their 100 meters.  I just posted it into our IRC.  Oh, that's what that was.  The senior got third in his heat for the 100,  and the freshman got first in his heat.  You should be in it.  I still need to work on them.  That's the senior on the left of the frame.  Get out of there, dad.  Go, go, go, go, go.  Look at that.  How fun.  He got third, but the freshman, he won his heat.  I need to work on the freshman.  His gate is not quite where I want it to be.  Even though he wins this, his gate is still not quite right.  I can get some more speed out of him.
