Transcript:  Coming up next on this week in Google, I'm Jason Howell. I'm here with Jeff Jarvis and Stacey Higabotha  We're gonna talk a little bit about Android P because apparently the developer preview launched today  Also, Google is apparently working with the Department of Defense on analyzing drone footage. That's a little weird  Facebook is searching for the line between satire and fake news and your Amazon Echo is laughing at you  How does that feel all that more coming up next on this week in Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's time for twig this week in Google and this week  There's a lot of Google actually our dock is filled with Google and I'm excited about that  I'm Jason how filling in for Leo who?  Well, I feel like every time I fill in for Leo. I say he's gallivanting. He's not quite gallivanting yet  He's more in transit so that he can get to South by Southwest and then gallivant a little bit  So I'm happy to fill in for Leo  I'll do my best to fill in for him. Anyways joining us, you know him you'll love him  At least I think you love him Jeff Jarvis buzz machine comm professor at the CUNY School of Journalism

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How's it going Jeff? All right. I was trying to show you the outside  Oh, what's going on outside camera? Oh  Is it snowing? You can't see this white is what is like white out? Yeah. Oh wow, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Austin

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ready I've lost to droid Oh Stacey. That's mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at all that green on the trees you can actually see the green on the tree. I can't see anything. No  Stacey Higginbotham white creator of the IOT podcast at IOT podcast calm and so many other things. How you doing Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm doing super well. It's a beautiful sunny day in Austin  It's been awesome  If Leo had planned his travels so he could just like pop in that door right behind me and just be like hello guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As long as you let him in downstairs first  Yeah, he gets there. He's like I'm coming. She can do that remotely because she's Stacey. That's true  You you are you are the the queen of IOT

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Last week last week  She ran out of things. She had no things. There was no thing. I was very upset

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you gotten more things Stacey, so this isn't a physical thing, but it's it's applies to the things  I do have some more things that I'm now testing but they're not ready. I mean the internet is filled with things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why they call it the Internet of Things

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are things all over the red out Stacey went through everything there was all the things there was no thing left

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, thankfully it only takes a week to regenerate new things  And so I have a feeling that's gonna be a change for this week. We'll check in on that later  I thought we were going in like reverse order and we're gonna kind of change  We'll save it for the end  So I had time to kind of poke through and read all this stuff  I will I will say one thing before we kind of get into the show that in times  Past when I've done this week in Google. I've also been doing a daily tech news show that's called tech news today  well, we don't do that anymore and I realized how a  little more challenging it is to drop into twig when you're not like  Knows to the news every single day every single story that comes through  So I spent good good amount of time reading through a lot of these Google stories  I didn't work up a good like direction or thread to them. So I was it's take it as it goes man. Take it as it goes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Normally, you're usually so on point. Whereas the rest of us are like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, I mean obviously we should start with  Quantum chips, right because that's because that's totally where our strengths lie as a as a team  Would you say?  We might as well see squeal I know that's that's reason enough  Google is claiming to be near  Quantum supremacy they say and apparently this is a thing. That's the moment that quantum computers can outperform a  traditional computer Google doesn't isn't saying that they're necessarily there yet, but they're developing a 72 qubit processor  Which is apparently a step up  Well, it's definitely a step up from the nine qubit design that they showed off back in 2014  It's called bristle cone. How many how many?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many cubits was Noah's ark that was that was cubits with a C  It's the Bible I'm gonna guess 40 but probably not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many cubits was Noah's ark

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  300 cubits 330 cubits in height 300 cubits in length. So Google you got a ways to go before you become a god

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google not more popular than God but then Jesus  Bristol's Beatles. Yes. I know I'm getting my wires crossed. I apologize  Bristle cone is basically their research test bed for all this stuff  scaling error rates all that kind of stuff with machine learning of course because Google loves its machine learning and  Google's saying it's cautiously optimistic that bristle cone can outperform a classical computer  sometime soon  So quantum computing that's about all I got

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now explain this to me how could it just be at the point of being in a computer  I thought that the whole point of quantum was it was already  Way steps ahead. Why is it? Why is it? So that's that's what I'd like to talk about because that's good  That's what I was hoping for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Normal computing goes one way  That it functions in a complete quantum computers function in a completely different way  So basically saying it's better than a classical computer is kind of like saying  I'm trying to think of a good like that. Hey, so is better than

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Humans can swim as well as fish or something like that. It's  There's totally different mechanisms of ways to go about it  We swim in a completely different way than a fish if that makes sense. So this is a terrible analogy, but so  What the simulations they're performing on a classical computer  And to get to that level you don't need as many qubits  To go beyond which is where everyone's excited about and worried because this could you know break like AES  Encryption at its highest levels, which I think is 256 right now  So we're gonna quickly get to that point but we're not there yet and so  But this is still exciting because once you unleash a quantum computer, we're not exactly sure how it works exactly  It's not exactly a Schrodinger's cap problem, but we can't like check its work  Except by comparing it to normal computing simulations. Did that make any sense? Was that at all helpful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean that that makes us about as much sense as quantum computing ever actually does like I know technical level to me  I understand that it's really important and that it's a it's a big wave what you're describing actually really kind of reminds me  Of what we've been hearing the last couple years about this buzzword  About this buzzword we can't stop hearing about which is artificial intelligence and stuff that it's doing all of this learning and all this  All these calculations on its own. It's not nearly as easy. It's it's not the same thing as saying hey, let's look at the code  it's more like hey, let's look at the  Results and that's about as clear as it gets if I understand how artificial intelligence  Computing works. So  That's yeah, that's close close

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good enough. Yeah, cuz like a  Qbit is like it's like a bit right like a binary bit except it has so much more information potential. So a  72-bit computer would be nothing but a qubit is obviously way more in  Encompasses way more information. I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to explain

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I understand  But with if quantum computing has the potential to break things like a s encryption and everything I mean  I'm trying to understand like is that good overall like it will that then spawn even more secure systems  Let's say because it's so hyper capable of this sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mathematic most people look at it as being like a y2k problem times a gajillion  Because there's so much that revolves right now on a ES encryption and we don't currently have an alternative  There is actually a company called secure RF that has just been certified a couple weeks ago by NIST as being  quantum unbreakable  But to explain how that works  I would have to send you their white paper that has a lot of equations and math in it because I don't actually  Understand how it works. I had them explain it to me and it didn't penetrate at all  There was a lot of math but I can direct you to it I can send you a link to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I will glance at the white paper and you will see the equations  I will go why did I ever start the show with quantum computing in things we can't explain and next week blockchain  It probably is but I get equally confused with blockchain  I can probably understand a little bit more about blockchain. I get it's it's it's the way the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Presumptions people make when they apply it to something. Well, of course, it's gonna affect the the fruit industry by  Enabling you to understand where the kumquat came from

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We all know that Jeff we all know that  Let's see here. What else you know, actually I'm now realizing I started with Google  I could have so easily started with the big Google news at least in the Android world. So why don't we start there?  Yeah, I'm computing was like the  Really?  Yeah, okay, so let's talk about this because I think there's a lot to be said about this so today  I was predicting that Android P  The next version at least the developer preview of the next version of Android was gonna release on Pi Day  It was some sort of it which is three, you know March 14 3.14  It just made sense right Android P pi pi is delicious  Why wouldn't Google do that? And of course they wouldn't do that because that was too obvious. That's how Google does things  Android P is now a thing starting today. It exists if you're a daring individual  Who likes to install potentially buggy software on your device go for it?  Although I think most people that are writing about this are saying don't actually do that unless you have a spare device to put  It on and it has to be a pixel this time around so they're allowing you to  Load this through the SDK. So you got to do them the full manual approach in order to get it on there  It has to be a pixel device is not going to work on any of Google's other devices at this stage  It's not even going to work through the beta channel  So if you opt in through the easy beta channel through your Google account  It's not even an option yet. So they're probably waiting for a more stable version of this before you'll be able to do that  But among the changes yes a lot of changes here  I think and I think it's too early to know  Like how these compare to what we'll see when it releases  Officially in months down the line because usually with these developer previews  We see little bits and pieces and over the coming months  We'll find out a little bit more things might go away and everything like that but notification improvements  So the full notification panel top to bottom is now redesigned. You can see this these are pictures of  the Android P notification  Shade and it's all white. There's no transparency. It's solid white kind of  Similar to what we've been seeing a lot with material design kind of a broader card based  System you also see inline photos there so inside notifications  You're gonna get more context around things like messaging  So you can for instance on the left side you see an inline photo actually as part of the notification on the right side  You see a conversation. So instead of just showing you the notification  Of the message that just came through it's gonna show you a few of the messages prior as well  So you get a little bit of at a glance of an I just love notifications. Let me act in the notification

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I just hope there's more of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it seems like it seems like there is they have the kind of the smart replies integrated in so on that right side  Screenshot you can see some of those or even the smart replies. Oh  So you can see it's baked into the system, which I'm not surprised at all that they're going that route  And that just allows you at a glance to be able to use your notification even further to hopefully avoid, you know  Having to jump into an app  Every single time you get a notification to do some by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just a question while we're on smart replies just a little little tiny detour  Just just one block detour detour away the smart replies  Universal in the sense does it you know see you there is what everybody says or if you're in a certain age group doesn't say  awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Smart replies from what I understand smart replies are tailored to you  So they actually have insight into and depending on the implementation  Insight into your location they have insight into your speaking style how you would reply to these certain things  They're taking that all into factor into account to hopefully give you a reply that speaks in your voice  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  mine all  This this explains much because mine all involve a lot of exclamation points  Assume this was just Google getting super excited about things, but maybe it's me being super excited about Google is reflecting your excitement

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you use a lot of exclamation points I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sort of do I am enthusiastic, but and it yeah, I I but  Yeah, okay. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Enthusiasm is good thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's working. That's awesome. Well do people to be I asked once if people knew that I was using  You know cuz I use them actually a lot. They're they're very helpful to me  So I I'm like yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Assaulted that you do that to them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No one's been insulted yet  But I'm waiting for Google to do the I will honor the embargo because that currently is never one of my replies and that would  Be a reply to have yes fine. I'll learn the embargo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but but but at the same time if you make honoring an embargo  Such an impulsive button tap you might not remember that you did that later  It's probably best that you have to type that out. It's almost like you're writing your signature like yes, I will

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, you you take your embargoes. I mean I've never broken an embargo. I have once accidentally but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rarely do the embargo thing to be honest  It's hard to not talk about things if I don't know about that well, but then I want to know about them anyways  I certainly wasn't on the embargo that lifted at 10 a.m. For Android P developer preview. That's for sure  um  As far as notifications, I think that's it based on what we've seen right now  But I'm sure there will be more like I said other features indoor Wi-Fi positioning  So if you've ever been inside and you're doing any sort of a navigation  You know anything and you realize that your GPS signal is lost or weak or whatever  This is a way around that is basically based on Wi-Fi round-trip time  Which can calculate positioning indoors when GPS fails if three or more access points are in range  so it can kind of triangulate your location within I think one to two meters when you're indoors and  No, that seems like a signal for you know certain maps capabilities. You already have like indoor mapping

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think in some regards, but this will I thought they had been using Wi-Fi for better geo positioning  for a long time in  Including indoors. I mean they had the whole skyhook deal  So I'm curious what is it just more granular at this level it must be yeah because I know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Know what you're talking about there, too  This seems a little bit more specific like I don't know if what you're talking about is as fine  of details, you know like one to two meters or  you know is that is what you're talking about capable of doing like  Step-by-step navigation inside of a building. I'm not quite so sure  Okay, I would I would imagine that I would be relying on GPS in that regard and this would hopefully remove you from that. So I  Guess we will see so notch Jeff. You mentioned the notch  Notch is gonna be not just gonna be one of those words of 2018. I think it's so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  stupid  Alright why is that so stupid?  Because it's it's because it no no Steve Jobs would never ever have allowed the notch. Yeah, it is a design  Sin  If you want to have you know a screen with two little ears that do different things and I'm fine  But the ears is okay, but to make it as if God made screens with notches. Come on. Come on. Stop stop  And then copying Apple why come on Google have some spine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but but are they copying Apple essential had the notch first  I mean technically they had the first device that released with a notch that I can remember anyway copying stupidity. Why?  Everybody's jumping on the notch bandwagon. It seems like so I did a switch with Megan Moroney  Where I use the iPhone 10 for six weeks. She surprised me with that  I thought it was gonna be a month and end up being six weeks a little long  But anyways, she got the pixel 2xl  I got the iPhone 10 and I have to say like in my time with it like the notch really did not bug me  At all. It was fine. Like I understand over time. I kind of understood why like I get the fact that  People have more of an expectation now or maybe hardware manufacturers have instilled more of an expectation in people to have  Their displays go to the edge  We also expect for sensors and certain things to be up at the top of the phone  This would be a way to accomplish both I guess in my use it didn't really bug me that much and I thought it was  Gonna totally bug me, but it it really didn't so I guess to some degree. I'm kind of like whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It reminds me of people who watch DVDs and widescreen versus full screen  Yeah, yeah, you know  It feels kind of like that kind of debate where you know, eventually when you're watching the movie if the movie's good  You just focus on the movie, right? You're not really focused on  The blackness or whatever  Right. Yeah, so I that's kind of how I look at the notch, but I am NOT a die-hard  I do not have just passion for this issue. So like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, and I think that they're probably so and they've made they've made some other changes which we'll talk about in a second that seem  to be inspired by the  Reality that is the notch the impending notch, but I think that they're also building in  Smarts to allow you for like you go into immersive mode, which is the full screen say you're watching a movie movies a prime example  Instead of giving you the movie with the notch out of the side of it for some for no real good reason  And then you miss out on that portion of the video or movie that you're watching  It would have the ability to in immersive mode cut off the notch so that you still get your square  It's still a very large screen. It's just the way it should be anyway. Yeah, I mean exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All you need is kind of a little line there so the screen has its logical basis. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not the notch  But they're also they're also making changes to the status bar up at the top and one of the big ones that seems to  Be getting the news right now is the fact that they're putting the clock on the left hand side of the screen  Which when you think about an OS that has support for a notch and if there are going to be more phones  Potentially, I'll just throw this out there potentially a pixel 3 that has a notch just saying crazier things could happen  That at least puts the clock on one side  Versus everything being weighted onto the right side so it more evenly distributes  What you have up there and some people are seeing the clock on the left side as being a a notch influence decision  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Notch gate I'm looking at my phone. I'm like, okay now I'm gonna have to train my brain to look at the clock on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know it's the worst thing in the world, isn't it change  What else there are some requirements so like kind of underneath the hood maybe less UI more  Underneath the hood developers will have a requirement to target modern versions of Android  So they can't up they won't be able to update their apps  Past a given date without actually updating it to entirely to the latest API level  So that's gonna require developers that want to update their apps to keep things  Current and in the past, you know developers who didn't want to support a certain feature  Whatever have been able to continue developing their apps but still targeting, you know last years of the year before as API  So that they wouldn't have to kind of update and bring everything to a certain level  Google's putting in the requirement that basically says after a certain date that they will determine with each version of Android if you  Are going in to make any update to your app beyond that date and you're still targeting older APIs  You won't be able to make that update you're gonna have to it's gonna force you to update to that modern API level  That's got to be good for security reasons for keeping everything consistent  also for encouraging developers to actually support some of these new features instead of  You know instead of putting it off, but it is definitely Google kind of you know  Stepping on the toes of developers and saying we know what's better for you than you do. So just do this  So I don't know how much that's really gonna get on anybody's nerves  I'm sure some of developers won't like that very much  What else  Lots of little things. I mean, this is the first developer preview so that you know, there's a camera API. Yes multi-camera. Thank you  I  Don't I don't really know what this what the exact details about that are other than that it will support multi-cameras  With the API and they say that will enable you to do creative things, you know with that official support

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are creative things? I don't know. Well, I think that's the whole what's the camera that does the depth of field?  Like I want to focus on later light row, right? I mean eventually ready you could do that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's it's supporting triangulation those sorts of things  Yeah on the system level instead of requiring right, you know  The hardware manufacturers or developers to kind of come up with their own unique ways to tackle it. So  Open mobile API for NFC payments. Oh, I missed that. What's that all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have that from the Android police one. Oh absolutely able to access secure elements and enable smart card payments. Okay  For an API not bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does anyone do you guys use Google Pay? No, no, because my credit card my credit card will go was that doesn't accept it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Oh, that's a bummer. You'd use it. Otherwise. Yeah, I would yeah. Yeah you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  know I  Had it on like I want to say an older phone maybe but at that point in time no one took it  So then I didn't add it and now I'm kind of like, huh?  Should I try it again? I have been struck by jealousy when people walk up with their phones and they yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like I could be that it's nice when it we don't I haven't even gotten to the point. I don't even  use the  Starbucks order ahead app. I  Do just a creature of old habits

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it work? Yeah, well sometimes it takes so I actually was in a line at the airport at a long Starbucks  Like a really long line  And the guy in front of me did a mobile order and he and I picked ours up at the exact same time  Because he I guess he thought he was gonna take so the answer is by the time I think about it  I'm usually already  Sometimes I do it from my car before I walk into the Starbucks, but then I feel really silly. I  Don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alright, so the thing that has me upset about this update. Yeah, is there cutting off?  old Nexus phones and  Pixel C tablet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  They are so Nexus 5x Nexus 6p and pixel C no longer supported  It's been confirmed no longer supported with the dev preview and then of course they looked into it  Iran amati odors technique ask Google and Google said officially that those devices will not be getting Android P  When it releases though, they will be getting monthly security updates through November of this year  And then I think the monthly updates will the pixel C is still really useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if I could still use my Nexus 7 I would it's a wonderful device

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's obsolescence is irritating. Yeah, it's so funny that you mentioned that Burke here at the studio showed me a Nexus 7  An hour ago and he's like so I just got this what can I do with it?  I'm like, I don't think you got a whole lot of options on that. They are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a great. Yeah, I saw it's at my school  They're putting some old tablets on classrooms so they can have a display of what it's available or something, right?  And they you know smashed up an old Nexus 7 because that's all it's good for now. It hurt

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, there's a lot of there's a lot of camera software like turn your phone into a camera  So like people power makes one so that's an option

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I love the Nexus 7 because it actually fit in my rear pocket. Yeah. Yeah, it had the pocket ability pocket ability factor  It did it's great. So that's that's gone and my and I do carry around the pixel book now everywhere  I travel with it. Yeah, but it was wonderful traveling with the pixel C and the keyboard. It was just great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But how does that compare then to the pixel book? I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Same same problem is the pixel but here's the problem. I'll tell you dr. Android. I will tell you  I find that Android on the pixel book is just not ready for primetime. Yeah a  Lot of things just don't operate very well  You know, I get times when Netflix I've got to try to  Restart it ten times and doesn't know that it's there and some apps are still small and it's just not  It's just not there and not ready and so for chrome what I love chrome is an OS but for chrome to be the primary  OS on the device with Android apps as well  No, it's it's it's a smoother operation. I think to work on an Android device  through the web

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah, but then but then the the  the keyboard  Functionality of the Android device like the the I don't know. I just I find it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Keyboard was great. You had a pixel see didn't you? I yeah, I had the pixel see I have the keyboard

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought the keyboard was great. My keyboard was alright. I don't know. I just you know what?  I never forced myself to live with it though  And I think you probably need to kind of overcome that hurdle to really get to that. I don't know Jason

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know Jason you you can live with a notch, but not the pixel see keyboard. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Question your judgment. I don't know. It's easier for me to overlook the notch  But the keyboard if it's if it's a keyboard  I don't like and and I think the more the more pressing thing for me is that I just don't feel like Android  OS was a very  Productivity like it wasn't very good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not it's true it's terrible yeah, that's why I've been yeah, I'm with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and so so I mean even if I was to get myself over the keyboard aspect like I just don't enjoy working in Android  For those types of things. I much more enjoy the Chrome OS experience for that  So maybe I'm biased the pixel see came out in 2015 December 2015. So it's now three years old believe well  Well, no, sorry two and a couple of months, so I guess it's just officially beyond its time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know I saw a study a couple weeks ago a mobile device and this is on mobile devices  And it was from Chetan Sharma. It was his end-of-year study  They said that the average life of handsets in the US is now three years  so  Having less than a three-year. I know that's surprised. It's sort of surprising and sort of not surprising, right?  I mean devices are super expensive. There's no  so  It feels like a three years should be then looking at your minimum support time for these devices for everyone  Who's not and this isn't the people watching the show, but you know the rest of them for your aunt and uncle

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just I was just I saw some old friends the other day and and the father is is very old now  He's in 90 something and he's his wife died something like four years ago  He still has the flip phone because it still has her picture on it  And he'll open up the flip phone many times a day just to look at the picture  You know, there's reasons people hold on to these things that you can't imagine. Yeah, and  The plan is planned obsolescence. It's it's it's the sin that we talked about for years and in capitalism and now it's not always

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not always planned obsolescence in some cases. There are legit things like security patches  How many people do you want working on that and then there's also like actual hardware elements and you know  Apple just got in trouble with this with the battery. They were making a decision from an engineering standpoint, right? Yeah  I mean, I'm not saying that there isn't an element of that, but I don't think it's always evil  I think sometimes it's just a perspective that we don't respect in the tech industry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right, I think you're right and I think I think that there should be a  Principle that's a company comes out and says we will support devices for this minimum amount of time three years and and past that  Will continue security updates for two years something like that, right?  That says that when you make an investment and it is an investment for a lot of people and we're one percenters into the tech  World will because we'll spend the money as if we even if we don't have it to get the latest thing  That's just not true of a lot of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so official support like we support it for three years that is  Keeping it up to date on up on the major OS updates  Yeah, I would argue for that. Yeah  I mean, you know the the other challenge this I think you guys were kind of touching on this a little bit like using  Burke as the example with the Nexus 7 is that he pointed out to me that it's actually running Android 7 on it right now  So, I mean it's relatively modern version of the OS Oreo is 8  LM and what is it?  Nougat is 7 so it's only one official  That's a surely released version behind yet. He says it's slower than molasses, you know, and so great  It has the latest version of you know, one of the more recent versions of Android on it  But it's that doesn't necessarily make it better to use it actually slows it down and the other is too is the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is the vendor problem we tend to buy?  Pure Android or we buy Android when I go to India and see the phones there  You know, they're three versions back and that's what they're running. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well Android go hopefully will will address that it helps that yes, which  New versions of Android phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry  At the same time Google does bring, you know  The new Wowie things the fact that Google Lens for examples on the rundown is coming to all Android phones  That's cool. Right? That's great. And but but you can't do that on a  Old old old phone. I get that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I mean even even then a show of hands who's using Google Lens all the time on there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was my next question to you. Do either of you use Google Lens? No, I did it once

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the problem that is the problem especially when is it when it's baked into something like Google Photos like yeah  That gives everybody access to Google Lens. And yes, it's neat when it works  I will say it does not work all the time even when you you know, you go to use it  Depending on what you're pointing it to but you know, it's embedded in in your photos app and  So it's a neat feature of that app, but it's not revolutionary  It's not point your camera at something and it pulls up a link for you to buy something, you know immediately  It's a little bit more kind of on the back end. So speak I suppose that's the water

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But on the other hand, there's things that remind you too much  On my phone the stupid squeeze thing drives me crazy. Oh me too. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love the squeeze

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hate the squeeze I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hate the notch you hate the squeeze man. What do you love get off my lawn modern technology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For technology dumb thing. No, I agree with you though Jeff and  and it was interesting because like I said Megan and I switched phones so she had the pixel 2 XL for six weeks and  I she was talking about the squeeze all the time  I love the squeeze how it summons assistant whatever that the assistant is only ever summoned on the squeeze by accident for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's never on purpose. I put it in my in my in my  vent holder in the car

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and when I take it off it squeezes well, you can change the  The sensitivity for this if you go you have to you have to train it system gestures active edge  And there's a little slider here so that a light squeeze would pull it up easily a firm squeeze would pull it up a firm squeeze

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm the kind of a guy who gives a firm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I love it for so my favorite thing to do with the squeeze is actually turn on the flashlight  And I did because I've got it usually it's what I've stuck my phone someplace and I'm trying to find something  I realize I can't see anything. So then I'm like I squeeze it  I'm like turn on flashlight and it's like what though and I'm like, haha  I don't know. That's just me. I  Lose a lot of things behind a lot of places Jeff  It's very dark where I live, I don't know  I do want to add because someone's talking about it in the chat room  I actually gave you a piece of software that they don't want they don't support it anymore  So I'm offering you a different one to run on your old Android device for security stuff  It's a company called or a software called salient. I  And if you look that up  You will you will see that you can download it and use it as a separate like camera  It's not ideal, but I mean it's not gonna function like an s cam  But it is it has a point if you want to use it. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mean, yeah, this is and this is kind of what I was telling Burke is like, you know  Does your Nexus 7 really have a use as a traditional tablet in the way that you know?  You used it when it was first brand new and probably not diminishing  Definitely, but there are a whole lot of ways that you can repurpose these devices  You know like don't don't feel like your only recourse is to you know, take it out back and and do the office space to it  Take a hammer to it like you could turn it into a security alarm system  Like you're saying or you could turn it into I saw something the other day that on XDA where you can take and you know  Well, actually this was more a raspberry pi, but I'm sure you could do it with an old Android device  You know have it be the receiving screen that you mount in your car for Android auto or something something along those lines  You can get creative with it if you have the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the patience and the understanding to do or you can give it to a kid and just tell them it's a  Camera, I think my daughter. I don't know. She's still I had like a Samsung 3 maybe and she  She's still videotaping the dog with that and she's having a grand old time. Great. That works. Perfect. It's a good cat

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is gonna she wouldn't put  Target clothes on her American Girl doll. She's gonna get at some point that you're you're pulling one over on her

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She does not like technology. She is not it does not get designer treatment for her  really  I'm good with that. Actually, I'm like here's your  Thing otherwise it can cause you a fortune right she does have it she does have a MacBook so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In our home we have nothing but Android devices not true I do have an iPad but that's really  specifically for like music production sort of things  So it's not like our kids ever use the iPad  Yet because of things like YouTube and I'm sure just popular media in general, you know, whenever my eight-year-old  broaches the conversation of of hey, I want to get some sort of piece of technology  It's always labeled as iPad or iPhone. So  There's a brand awareness there, even though in our home, it's all Android. I think it's just well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you hand her an old Android phone and she'll be like, yeah, that's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or she actually want the I know I I don't think I think I probably could I mean her she has a tablet  You know, each of my girls have a tablet that they can use only on the weekends for a couple hours  They're both Android tablets and they don't care  It's got the screen that gives them the thing that they want to watch, you know as far as that's concerned  I'm sure there will be a time though when there are more pressure in, you know  There's more pressure in school and I've heard about that anyways being being a thing where you know  The kids that surround you are well more brand aware and I'll be curious to see at that point if it makes a difference or not  If it makes a difference between iPhone and Android, I guess start saving up now Jason. I know put it away as a budget item  Those things aren't cheap  All right, so I think I mean there's there's a few other features but they're really kind of  Nerdy and in the weeds and everything like that. I think ultimately we're gonna hear more  about this at Google I o in a come in a couple of months and  Probably there will be an update to this  Android p developer preview in probably like a month month and a half. It seems to be what they do  they do a little refresh every every other month, but  I'm really  It is pie no, no, no, it's not no no, but it ever presumes oh  Yeah, I don't know. What do you guys think?  I really thought that I didn't think that pie was gonna be high day and I would be perfectly so I thought that's that made  A lot of sense, but is there a dessert that you hope it will be they don't they don't announce the name when they let out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The developer preview now, they don't they would do that later. So it'd be a lot of path after pie day. Yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm I'm fond of puzzles, but that's a pretty regional dessert  But why not educate people about them because they're delicious puzzle  Pizzle P I Z Z E L L E. I've never I think it's a it's like a waffle cone cookie kind of I don't know how to describe it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're delicious. They're not too sweet better than that, you know, if they're gonna go brand name, you know, what do you do? It's pez. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could so yeah if they go brand name that's a good one though because you could so see a pez dispenser of an Android figurine  on the lawn  Spin out little green pezzes and you know, yeah when you go to a Google event they're handing those out left and right  Oh, I love that  Yeah, now I heard pez as an option, but that's a really good one Android pez swag. Oh, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Giant as dispenser. I could just see it right now. Yeah, people would love that. You're right. Do it man

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get on that train pez  Marketing opportunity Google people if you're listening, you're welcome. You'll be getting a shipment of a Google pez

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, if you get a Google pez dispenser, I would like one. Thank you, Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or at least just a piece of pez from it. No, no pez candy is nasty

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, okay go Google could do the pez strip in the color the Google colors to the candies could come out in Google colors

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, or the candies could be little Android figurines

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now you're getting horrible no with that they wouldn't fit they would jam the dispenser they jam the dispenser

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they make it the same shape, but they'd etch into them edge in you could do that. Yes, you could  I like our little product marketing meeting. Okay  And  Speaking of product marketing. It's time to take a break. Actually  We're gonna talk a lot more about other Google stuff not not Android stuff. I think we've kind of  Hashed out most of what we know about Android P  Maybe there's a few other tidbits in there, but definitely diving into more Google  But I hear I hear Leo has something to tell you. Hey Jason. Hey Jeff. Hey Stacey. I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not here. I as you know, I'm on my way to Austin for our big event on Friday at South by Southwest  But I I had to just jump in for a moment to tell you about this thing. I love  This thing and Stacey you were the one who told me about the lighthouse  The lighthouse I don't even want to call it a camera. It is a camera, but it's so much more. It's a microphone  It's a speaker. It's got built-in artificial intelligence. It's the only camera that gets your busy life  You can't always be home  But if you have kids pets a nanny a dog walker and other people coming and going  There's one way to stay in the know about what's going on in your living room  Lighthouse we have a lighthouse at home and I just love it  It understands that life is more than just a bunch of motion alerts easy to set up you pair it to your Wi-Fi  you put in a good place and then a  Couple of things happen. First of all, you can invite others to be in your circle of friends  You can have other owners but also invite people who are you know  Going to be seen by the lighthouse and you can also set it up to the lighthouse doesn't record when you're home  Which Lisa has asked me to do so it's great for privacy  But when we're not home those lighthouse sensors the 3d sensor sees your home in full 3d  It can distinguish between people and pets and other kinds of movement. It uses facial recognition  So when it sees somebody it doesn't know it pings you on your smartphone  It lets you know and you can immediately turn on the camera and see what's going on live streams in 1080p HD  Has automatic night vision plus two-way talk and a security siren. You can automatically have the camera turn off when you're home  I like that feature you can turn the camera on and off whenever you're in want  so you're in complete control of it, of course bank level encryption for your video data and  Because it keeps a 30-day library of everything it's seen you can ask it simple  Natural queries like what happened when I was gone it literally understands. I'm not there  This is what happened when I was gone and it only shows me the important stuff  you could say complicated things like show me when the kids and the pets get home or  Show me if there were any pets at all. What did the kids do when I was out yesterday?  What did the pets do when I was yesterday?  Tell me if you don't see the kids by 5 p.m. On weekdays  You also can the kids can wave at the camera it recognizes waving and will ping you and say hey Michael  Wants to talk and I can turn on the camera and have a conversation with him. That is awesome  Especially for younger kids that don't have smartphones who just want to say hi  When it comes to security lighthouse uses its artificial intelligence to tell you  only when it detects actual movement from people or  Sometimes large objects like doors when you're away from home and you want to see those doors open and close, right?  no more false alerts just because it sees a shadow or pets or  Or like that other dumb camera that was supposed to be smart that I bought that thought of mine for for days  I was getting alerts it because it was a mylar balloon. It thought was a person in the house. I  Love lighthouse. I set it up use it every day. I always know what's going on in my house  I want you to get a lighthouse you can go to light dot house  Light dot house to learn more. Don't forget if you want to buy one to use the promo code to it  You'll get 15% off a lighthouse camera and because it's still early days early customers get 90 days of AI service at no cost  I  Love our lighthouse. We have two  And we have one here in the studio, which is normally plugged in but I unplugged it so I could show it to you light  Dot house by the way, this is awesome  It tilts and rotates so it makes it very easy to point at exactly what you want to see and what you don't want to  See light dot house  15% off when you use a promo code  To it don't get a camera in your house get a smart device in your house  The device Stacy when I told Stacy I got the other guys camera she said you do this  You should have got a lighthouse  So I did light dot house and we thank them so much for their support of this week in Google  Don't forget to use the offer code to it for 15% off and now back to the show guys. I'll see you in Austin, Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whoo, and I'm surprised you said that because you called him a doofus

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the least of things I've called

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's light  Cool so you're going to South by Southwest I imagine well, I mean you're kind of there  Is it kind of like not a big deal because it's so normal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is it is actually such a big deal that I am not I'm not doing most of it this year  Leo is the only the the Leo event that is happening. I shouldn't the twit event  Is it twit twig all of us?  Thanks to it twit. Yeah, the twit event is happening Friday morning  At the Capital One Center at Antones, we're doing a panel on IOT security or just security and  I'm doing that and not much else, but I hope to see everyone there if you're at South by Southwest 8 a.m.  Antones  Be there be there and Leo's also hosting something tomorrow night, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we've got a meetup right tomorrow night. Is that right? It's a meetup in EAT  Oh Friedman's bar. Yeah, that's right Friedman's barbecue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And no, Leo's not buying dinner

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. He is not buying dinner nor he said it was an open bar, but it's not really an open bar either  He's not buying you dinner. Nor is he buying you drinks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean the bar is open for business the bar is open

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's and if you're not from Texas, you might be pleasantly surprised because the alcohol is relatively cheap here. Nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cool. Well, I wish I could go it's been a year since I've been South by Southwest  Maybe next year  Maybe next year. We'll see  Okay, so we got some Google news here  Let's start off with Zagat. Is it Zagat or Zagat? I never really knows Zagat like Bob Zagat or I always say Zagat  Zagat  Well doesn't matter anymore doesn't matter anymore Google you may remember bought Zagat back in 2011 for  151 million dollars now Google selling Zagat to the  Infatuation which is apparently a restaurant review company. I've never really heard of the infatuation, but there you go  Apparently they're doing really well. They turned profit last year. They've been around for a number of years  Zagat reviews if you may have noticed over, you know, the the last few years very de-emphasized on on Google's part  Google, you know while it was owning it really just kind of tended to opt for its own recommendations  engine and  I feel like prior to the the buyout  Zagat was I mean it was very much a household name at least at least I was very aware of Zagat and then  promptly stopped hearing anything about it supposedly Google did a redesign back in 2016, but you know, they weren't giving it the  The treatment that it deserved so now it's going to the infatuation  And sounds like they're amped to have it as part of their network  so  Anyone any either of you guys well, I guess any thoughts Jeff last Jeff Jeff's no, yeah, Jeff's no longer  It was good while it lasted Jeff  But I don't know Stacey. Were you much of a Zagat user? What did you think of the integration?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like way back in the early dark ages before the internet was on your phone  I had a Zagat book that was yeah about it  Yeah  But once I had a phone, I think I well I started I switched to Yelp and then I got crank it Yelp  so I switched to  Just Google reviews that they had and I imagine Google is just like hey, dude, we could crowdsource this. Let's uh,  let's get rid of this Zagat stuff because  which is I mean it  Zagat was crowdsourced stuff before it was even cool. So sure it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a crowdsourced social network in print basically  Where they chose the clips that you saw it was a super useful tool at the time  But you're right, you know now that you mention it  I mean we have really great reviews engines now like there are like there are very trusted easy-to-use  immediate places to  be able to kind of check the tenor and the the reputation of  Restaurants and all sorts of other businesses super quickly Google obviously has its reviews and Yelp and whatnot  So a brand like Zagat maybe was you know a brand that's kind of locked in time  It was much more much more useful when it was a print option and there weren't a whole lot more to compare to it  And now times have kind of changed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's locked in paper  but I  Will say so there is a piece of news that I am excited about what's that and it's very small  But they're now gonna let you leave messages video messages when you call people on duo because I am one of like the 12 people  Who call people on duo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the other people are very happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People are all related to me and I forced them to do it  To download the app so I was excited that I could because no one ever actually picks up because no one uses it on a regular  Basis so they're like my phone's making a weird noise. I wonder what's happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And why is that person staring at me that meanwhile it's the knock-knock feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you know, so now I can at least be like hey  I called but I can't imagine more does anyone else out there anyone Bueller if

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If my wife is traveling or if I'm traveling and we you know say hey  We should hop on on video chat to do this. I've gotten in the habit of calling her on hangouts  I find it to be more sorry not hangouts duo  I find it to be more resilient like network resilient and it tends to do a better job there  And it's just like I know she's got a pixel last generation pixel. I've got a pixel device  I know the apps installed on there outside of that never use it. I mean, I have no one else to use it with

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My husband's like this is stupid just call me on hangouts like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But why so what why why opt for hangouts from his perspective just because he's used to that or I think it's cuz he's on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  An iPhone and so he's had hangouts on the iPhone for a while and downloading duo. I mean I I  Made my BFF and my parents download it and my mom she is that person who's just like what's happening, huh?  Stacy Stacy are you on the phone? Yeah, are you you're staring at me, but I just hear a ringtone. You're staring

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why are you looking at me and waving at me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, I think I think the call when I when I make it through to someone I'm very excited. So I just  So yes, I would I'm glad they're still developing on it. I would like to see  Other people like it. I don't know. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, see it be more of an integral part of Android as a whole and pre-installed that we just we just  Don't get those things when it comes to messaging or video messaging or whatever. It's always kind of broken and convoluted  apparently the the messages that you leave are  Going to disappear automatically after a day. So they are ephemeral. That's a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's there so if I'm on my deathbed, I'm not gonna use that I'm gonna use something different. Yeah, you want to yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, don't give your final message to the world on snap

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No snap might not be around much longer so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I do very hot. That's all right. I don't use it anyway, so whatever  Let's see here  What else did I find in here? Um, Google? Okay, so what's that? I was gonna say Google fiber  But you go. Oh, yeah, I know. No, that's that's that's an interesting one  So this was things to speak about things that may not last. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So on on motherboard, there's a post that you can find on the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Motherboard there's a post about kind of checking in with the progress of Google fiber  eight years ago, we started to hear about fiber for the first time and  You know big ambitions when fiber when Google fiber was rolling out to be a disruptor  to the broadband industry offer really fast gigabit speeds in the US low price 70 bucks a month and  You know ISPs, of course kind of jumped on  You know into these areas and lower their prices so it did disrupt to a certain degree it kind of changed what ISPs were  doing in these areas  But ultimately as the article points out the adoption was low  Obviously laying fiber is time-consuming. It's it's costly very costly Google had recently back in 2016  kind of shifted their  Their approach to next-generation wireless technologies. They kind of put everything on pause  They you know had a couple of different different people at the head of fiber filter through their some layoffs all that kind of stuff  But now I mean there's just it's at a standstill fibers really not doing a whole lot right now  We're not hearing much about it and Google's just basically saying well when there's a when there's something to change  We'll let you know we'll unpause  Where we're at right now  Did did fiber disrupt enough or do you think that there's still fuel for for the fiber machine going forward what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's two there's actually three things that fiber I think did and I said I sat in the audience when it was announced  I said it Casey when they started  And I hoped desperately for it here in Austin and didn't get it. Yeah, but so I've been following this whole saga they  Changed the price for broadband in the markets where they introed they also helped bring gigabit  Internet to more places by getting communities to stand up and say we want that and getting consumers excited about gigabit  Even if even today most people are like, I don't need a gigabit service. That's ridiculous  It also changed the pricing for free stuff  So Comcast actually has a free broadband for kids in school that are on the free and reduced lunch plan and  Originally that was I think it was about five megabits per second  But or was it may have been even less in Google  They had a free service that was either five or ten megabits per second  And so Comcast boosted their offering to match Google's so in that sense  If you got a free lunch in the Comcast area and applied for this program, you got better broadband  So that's it's small but it matters. And then the third thing is they brought they highlighted the issue of  For the FCC and has changed some rules about making it easier to get poll attachments  Which is so esoteric and nobody wants to think about it  But it's essential for getting any sort of infrastructure broadband infrastructure out to cities  So in Austin for example AT&T owned two-thirds of the polls and  Google was like we want access and AT&T is like, I don't think so and  there was some legal things and  They that was actually one of the reasons why they kind of stopped  Deployment I think is they were like god. This is really hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding, right and you think of Google and it's and it's  seemingly infinitely  Deep pockets for stuff like this and also their their spending pattern there their funding pattern for back when fiber was  Just getting started and even a few years into it where Google, you know  only very recently did Google kind of change course and and  Changed its way of thinking around how it was spending its money and how it was funding all these crazy things that we know are  Just insanely expensive  it's very recently kind of tighten the tighten the strings a little bit on that and  You know, so something like this especially fiber fiber is very known to be incredibly expensive and even

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google did a lot of things to reduce they did a lot of things to reduce the costs  So it's it's not enough to they actually had some very big innovations one  They were making their own networking equipment to the way they went about picking cities helped market this stuff and then three  They had they had done some work with new drilling innovations  That would make it easier in some places. So  There were in technological innovations and Google kind of style innovations to make it cheaper  But it still wasn't cheap enough and they still had to deal with people in  Google as an engineering focused  They hate customers they contracted out some of their fiber digs and those guys are used to working for AT&T and it just I  Don't think they maybe realized the scope of the problem and then also people  People didn't sign up Google's in love  I mean, this is probably like the duo problem all over again or any other good Google product that people are like  I don't understand how to use it. They were like, why do I need a gig? I don't need a gig. That's ridiculous  AT&T's got me locked into a contract. I'll just go with them. They have a gig now, too. Hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, Stacey. What about the argument?  Especially from you do you buy that wireless is gonna be as good as  Fiber for those customers who say I don't need a gig

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so fixed wireless  Will be good in some places as long as we can there's a couple of places and things that might disrupt it  So I talked to the arrow guys a while back and they're the guys doing  30 I think it's a 34 I used to have it on my  My board what what a frequency?  But they're using millimeter wave. It's the same sort of 5g basically for mobile or sorry for fixed wireless  they said that  Because the spectrum attenuates in weather and with trees so it gets disrupted  Snow is actually a bigger problem than rain for them. So I think it's gonna be kind of like satellite television, maybe  So, I mean it's a very similar kind of idea except your satellite dish will be paid it'll be pointing to some place  that's actually not in space it'll be  Trade that yeah whether

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your and Carson a couple years so smooth that I went off the air a little while ago because the power went out here  And the generator I have a generator sit went on and everything went off and yes  No, can cause real havoc on anything. It's above the ground Wow  Whereas the fiber is nice nice and safe below the ground. Yep. Yep. Well, I mean there are fiber cuts all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's that's not a very easy  Well, yeah, but like we're not gonna add any time soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm wondering it's probably a tenuous connection here, but I'm wondering if there's any possible  connection to  You know the need of drilling to make this fiber happen  Google's probably move moving on from the whole idea of drilling for fiber  Anyways at this point, but there's an article that was put in here. Maybe Jeff  I'm not sure if you put this in here or if you did Stacey about Google researching hypersonics  I did I was fascinated by that for for drilling  You know and in this article points out it seemed like a cause on geothermal energy and tunneling but I'm like, oh well this  I don't know  So hypersonic technology hypersonics is basically five or more times the speed of sound  Usually that refers to aircraft or weapons in this case. It's focused on  climate and energy systems  Thanks to a company called hyper sciences that's developing this drilling system. Google might actually buy the company according to this article  But it basically it fires concrete projectiles at two  Two or more kilometers per second ahead of it. Say that again. Say it again. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stop and say that again fires concrete

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  projectiles at  two or more kilometers per second ahead of the drill bit and so drills  deep wells ten times faster than what you have with existing systems and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't this useful for the boring company too, yeah, isn't this useful for boring hyperloop across the country?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, how big are the what are the limitations on projectiles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I presume you can just do a bunch of you just stack them up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. That's a big assumption when you're dealing with under the ground rocks and different striations and alright

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's fair. Oh kill joy Stacey. Sorry. My mom is a geophysicist. We talked about I was getting hyperloop  Alright, I want you to store

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This I will send it to her  but you know what it is actually kind of neat think about when they talk about like geothermal Google's very aggressive in how they power their  data centers and they need more a  data center would be great powered by if you could find a geothermal spot and have it just  Power up next to the data center. That's awesome because you'd have continual power. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Renewable you do two things you put it in the Arctic  So you cool the computers and you geothermal the energy and you geothermal I don't think that's a geothermal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Make sense to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Quantum computers because then those have to be super cold and you would just do that in the Arctic and  It might not even be cold enough actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Claims it's five times cheaper than today's tunnel boring machines able to dig tunnels at two and a half times faster Wow  So we hit Google head-to-head against Elon Musk's boring company. So no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so if he can if he can do that with tunnels just think what it could do for fiber  There you go for drilling for fiber, huh? Yeah, I mean even

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like your fibers only

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only below the sod. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if you could do it though for the undersea cables?  Which currently just truck along at the bottom of the ocean some of them are buried some of them aren't actually there  They're buried but not very deeply what if you could bury them more deeply then you wouldn't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which which with the fear of what the Ruskies are gonna do with undersea cables  That's a that's a that's an important matter of security, right? They're out exposed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bad things can happen to them no more shark attacks. I love that story about sharks being attracted to undersea cables

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And cutting off whole whole regions to the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Concrete blame the sharks. Why don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sharks are all that is a cool. So I'm glad you put that on here Jeff. Yeah, it's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And apparently there's gonna be more information to share at South by Southwest. So  Really so apparently we will hear more about that. That's what I read. Maybe I misread that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm envisioning an IO will all be in tunnels that have been bored by the hypersonic tunneling. That's what I want

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The new IO will be completely

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, by the way, you know, cuz you know, you know on this show I had my bridge phobia  Right. Yeah, so I always figure but I don't problem going in the Lincoln tunnel cuz it's bored into the stone, right?  So it's okay. So so even if they had a little problem in the concrete, it's not gonna leak  I'm not gonna have a problem. It's okay, right? I  didn't know the Bart is  Above the rock in the water in a tube that gets dropped into the water. Did you know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't know that now

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that scares me. Now, of course, I say it should be bored into the stone but in an earthquake territory  Yeah, that would be a problem. Probably don't want somebody

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's interesting I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and and  New York is unique because it's bedrock is actually good rock  It's I think isn't it granite or schist or something really stable as opposed to like something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whatever it is, Stacey. It's the best because we are the center of the university nothing but the rock for New York

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel like there's this whole story about I can't believe I read a whole story about the bedrock of New York  But I believe you guys have really good rock  For supporting tall buildings and digging stuff through without it crumbling  We don't we're in limestone country

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was that was a quite a quite a detour. I apologize, but I just know there was a tenuous

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jason allowed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That it works it worked I will allow for it how else can we detour here the US Department of Defense  This has a little bit  Some people kind of a little curious a little worried  I'd say employees at Google anyway some of them US Department of Defense is partnering with Google to create  Artificial intelligence that can analyze drone footage  So apparently project maven, which is with the US Department of Defense all about identifying objects in drone footage some employees at Google  were  outraged to discover this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Boston Dynamics because of justice the Boston Dynamics would be used for defense contractors, yeah and  and you know unmanned warfare and  Yeah, I don't see this playing well with Google employees. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know the fact that Google's offering assistance to the military for something, you know something along the lines of surveillance  Also, there's the ethical considerations around the use of machine learning systems for this sort of thing  Google says that it's working quote to develop policies and safeguards around the use of machine learning for military applications  And then another Google spokesman  Stressed that this is a research project. Don't worry. It's just a research project. We have no plans to implement it  There are no plans to implement its results into AI controlled military hardware. Don't worry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I think I think that the these technology companies need to operate more like hospitals  What do you call those kind of committees you have in hospitals before you do something that might be new?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  IBRs there's yeah, what's that stand for IRBs IRBs internal review board

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, internal review board. So, you know you have cases like like something that Facebook somebody Facebook does something really stupid  It's on the rundown  asking people whether they think that  It's okay for pedophiles to look at photos of underage naked children  Who in the place would ask that right it's obviously stupid it's obviously wrong they they apologize for it immediately but but  How something can have it's just an experiment. It's just a test is too much the the  justification for too much  Stupidity stupidity in technology companies. And so this kind of well, it's just a research project that you know, it's just knowledge  Not gonna cut it anymore when you control the world man. Yeah, Stacy. What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a lot of things to throw out all at the same time. So I'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thing Google drone military drones, are you okay with that or no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I I feel like Google usually picks technologies that benefit that have a benefit outside of  They might do something like this if it had another benefit for like society or their information gathering  And I guess it does from the sense of information gathering, but it does strike me as a project that  It's got bad PR associated with it and also  It it's kind of it lives up to everyone's fear about Google which is they can see everything and they may one day use it for evil

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so I mean because  in  Boston Dynamics, I think they probably didn't like that  That visual as well of being associated with something that was clearly scary as all get out  However, I'm like the sand flea is cute, but that's the only one that's cute only redeemable Boston Dynamics robot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there's scary and  Fascinating all at the same time  Equal parts scared and fascinated by Boston Dynamics robots

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of Google projects can be used for surveillance and could have sure they have the  At least the veneer of they could also help humanity  So I think this is just a I get why people are outraged. I do get worried about exactly this sort of thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So or maybe the the safeguard that people, you know tell themselves anyways, which is well, it's one thing if Google is is  Doing the surveillance for their own means  It's another thing if Google is doing their surveillance for an arm of the government or for the defense, you know, or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right the technology is gonna be out there and published and is available and the government can can use it too that doesn't stop anything  But how complicit do you want to be right in these activities?  directly, yeah and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rightly, I think they say not complicit at all. And I think it's good that tech companies are  Asking themselves this because they are in a position a where everyone's like, oh we hate you tech companies. You're evil  They've suddenly become evil. I know Jeff. I'm just saying in the popular mind people are much more now. We're like, wait a second

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But well, yeah, and it's gonna get used against them because you have you have I'm sorry you were finished

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and I was just saying so it's good that they're actually having these conversations now and I hope that  they do and I think Facebook with their survey I'm like what that I think was just I  Don't know how that even got out there. I really don't I'm like oh, it's just so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and and now you have not because it's my friends on the left at the Guardian are going all moral panic  But now you have right-wing filmmakers making a film about the evils of Google and Facebook good segue

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were on the same page on this one. Jeff. I had it open the notes open and everything  Yeah, well, and and this is kind of what you guys are talking about, right? Like big tech  And what what is driving big tech?  How is that like what are the the grand effects of these decisions that these ginormous?  Mammoth technology companies are making but that how that's mixing with politics got Peter  Schweizer Schweizer Schweizer, I don't really know but apparently a right-wing journalist  He actually at one time it was I think the script the speechwriter  For speech writing consultant for President George W. Bush. Anyways, he's producing a documentary  Aiming to show how these technology companies filter the news how they highlight their own agenda  It's tentatively called the creepy line, which I think is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a perfect title right like it is it is using Eric Schmidt's famous quote. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but it's a focus on censorship on oppression in digital media and big technology and big tech and  Apparently will be screened for the first time or at least expected to be screened this May at the Cannes Film Festival  He's also done previously a documentary with Steve Bannon  Produced by Steve Bannon called Clinton cash  So that kind of gives you a sense of the direction that you can probably expect out of this documentary

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is where the tech companies are they're gonna get attacked from both sides now as big to use Stacey's word evil empires  joking Stacey  And and and that means that like it or not or however  Virtuous they know they are they have to be very careful and and I want them to be innovative  I want them to be smart  But I want them to be careful about doing dumb things that are gonna get used against them and the entirety of the internet. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm curious I'm equal parts curious and I don't know what the other part of this is like  I  Know that this is going to be a fueled, you know, if fueled right wing sort of  perspective  Based on based on who it's coming from  Doesn't mean I don't want I'm not interested in watching it because they're even even though  You know my own personal agenda, which I will keep entirely out of out of this show. I'm still definitely feel  Like the point that we're at with technology companies like I'm worried about it  I'm worried about the ramifications of what we think we know  But we actually don't and how that's how that's painting and shaping the world  It's certainly been a reason that I've stepped away to a certain degree from from social media in the past year

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't know. I I just saw two stories. Don't please Jason. Don't do this. Don't do this  I love social media for two months and I saw a different world  No, I know or had bonds you just did it night I tried to read that thing four times and I couldn't I couldn't do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It no, I mean to piss man. Sometimes he's good. Sometimes you're like, what are you smoking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pissed me off. I can understand though. I can understand the perspective right like when you're on  Social media when we have a habit around social media at least I have a habit around Twitter that started back in 2007  it's a daily habit and  So so much of my much of my daily reality is shaped around the moments that I have when I open Twitter and I see  What's actually going on because I do read that instead of reading a newspaper to use Farhad's example  And I don't know if it necessarily makes me a happier person to do that  so when I say stepping away and being worried about technology like I  mean not entirely but I certainly feel like my life is better when I'm not consumed by all this stuff and  I don't think I think there are a lot of people that don't don't make that  Realization might not I don't know. I guess they have to realize that for themselves

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I started watching more tennis so she'd watch less cable news. I get that. Yes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  So anyways that will come out later. No, we have celebrities promoting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Assistant

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah during the Oscars you guys watch the Oscars did you care I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Watch the Oscar. I I do watch the dresses though and on social media  But I did want to see the commercial. Will you play the commercial? Yeah, we've got a few of them in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we can pick one of them. I mean, it's you know, it's an article that kind of points to a  Couple of them see I mean you can literally just pick one of them and just go ahead and play it  But it's basically celebrities realizing  That Google might just be smarter than them for doing some of these things

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  over over our  Nope backspace backspace

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Over feels like we started searching two hours ago  Feels like we never gonna find this show  No, no, no, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what you see for those of you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  Chrissy  Teagan John Lennon legend doing I mean we've all been there right trying to enter in something on a remote  On the on-screen keyboard and it's the most painful experience in the entire world. Well, maybe this is actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not the most I I've had a pretty bad. That's that's pretty bad  But I will say I we have an older chromecast but we don't have the new one which works with the  Google home and I really have thought oh it might be worth 70 bucks just to be like  Show me this. Oh, sorry. Sorry everyone. My phone did it too. My phone did it too. I'm sorry not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who knows how well that translated  But yeah, so which actually so I think what I've realized over the last couple of years is that Google  Google has a smart marketing team like I like sometimes you watch these these marketing campaigns and it's just like I roll  Super cheesy, whatever. I don't get that as often with Google as I do with others yet  I don't know how effective they are at actually selling  Their stuff. I don't know if you guys talked about this a couple of weeks ago, but there were stats on how Google's  sales of the pixel devices had been in 2017 IDC  Basically said that 3.9 million units shipped in  2017 of both last generation pixel and this generation pixel and you compare that to you know, the behemoth  Obviously, but Apple selling 77.3 million iPhones in the fourth quarter alone. So 3.9 million total  77.3 million in a quarter and it just kind of it just screams at you that like Google has all this money  They have marketing prowess. I like their their marketing campaigns and their ad campaigns, but it just doesn't seem to do much  so I wonder how  How an ad campaign around assistant is really gonna move the needle for for Google? Yeah, I don't know either

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think it's you know, it's the same problem we had with what we're called. What's the what's the photo thing?  We talked about earlier  lens  Lens. Yeah, it's also remind you exists. Yeah, that's true. You can use this you could use it on your phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or if you are using it confirmation that you're doing something right? Yes, John Legend doesn't you're on the yeah  You're on the right team. You're on the John Legend

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chrissy Teigen team Stacy. Were you starting to say something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was I was gonna say it's kind of like and I'm very curious because everybody has been a buzz about the the Spike Lee directed  Apple HomePod commercial which is pretty but I am just like  Why are we so excited about this thing for a product that quite honestly is not awesome?  Nobody's no none of the reviews out there  Seem really excited and yeah, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a whole lot of asterisks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Involved in reviews great if you live on a remote island and only like to communicate with penguins  Yeah, yeah, but the ad is cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Audio listeners, you're just gonna have to trust us

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's FK twigs Harried woman comes home from work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The New York apartment with many locks to find her best friend the HomePod right? Hey Siri, let me something I'd like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think she's relaxing. I think the drinks helping too. Yeah. Yeah. This is me after twig  I'm done

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There we go now it's coming around  Now do you have or have you tested the HomePod whoa

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin has tested the HomePod. I sent it to him because he's an actual Apple music person  Uh-huh, and I don't have any I couldn't actually play anything on it  so  He was the logical tester that's one of those asterisks. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I mean, it's very limited on support of how long devices can use it. Yeah, this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is it is a long but kind of fun cool. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's funky looking. I like the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like the visual aspects of it her mind. She's now expanding her apartment and redecorating

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She forgot that she had a horrible day at work at this point  Well, when you could redecorate your apartment no kidding  Where is where's this ad even playing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a long one. Oh, I see it. I see a deer in my backyard trying to almost not even look at through the snow  It's so deep  geez

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so there's an ad that's not that's an Apple ad where they're like, yeah  This will change your freaking life as opposed to like here we're gonna show you how to use our product

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right, right  I  Actually saw an article right before coming here. It's not the bottom of the dock  Josh  Almost 20% apparently almost 20% of the US has a home  Smart speaker at this point at least according amazing. That is amazing. I thought so  Does that include like Sonos and other brands or that those smart speakers? Let's see here. This is per rain  rain and pull string  Teamed up with voice spots. I've never heard of maybe you guys have but they interviewed  1057 adults across the US and based on how they you know conducted that study  So I guess that's the important part that I don't I can't read here  But they found nineteen point seven percent of the people they spoke to say that they own a smart speaker  So I imagine it would I mean  you know, it doesn't seem like it's isolated to just Google homes or the or this  Home pod or whatever. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Guys, I screwed up. I said Spike Lee. I meant Spike Jones the dude who did her  Okay, I okay. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My brain just I was like wow, this is like Spike Lee is I love his work, but this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From him. Yeah, sorry. Sorry. My brain was thinking like Jones, but my brain

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that makes more sense that it's more music. Yeah music video driven  Yes, but yeah 20% so which I'm curious to kind of ask you about Stacy like 20% of the US population  does this mean that we are  Officially like in the smart home Renaissance or

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure, so I buy the numbers I do think that there's a ton of people who have these I  Think what this means is we've hit the limits of our current user interfaces  Yeah for actually controlling devices and we've all realized it and so the next step this is gonna be like  You know like I think of gaming with like joysticks how you you had we started out with like the  Actual joystick and then we got more sophisticated  What's gonna happen is we get more sophisticated user interactions like voice is awesome for some things  It is terrible for others and you can already see this like Amazon and Google are both trying to cram things like routines into this  because  It's still too hard to like  You can control something but like every single individual device in my house and I have like almost a hundred at least maybe more  Like have you ever counted well, I mean like every light bulb so  Is this funny  It's so funny. I know it's just I thought you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People who were really into this might have eight ten things in their home

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have at least thirty five. I have at least thirty five  No, I have forty now Wi-Fi connected devices and so that doesn't include, you know  Wow, 20 light switches probably 30 smart bulbs that doesn't include any of the sensors

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I think you are the queen of things. I think if you really add it up though

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think most people would be surprised how many devices that are in their home that are actually connected via Wi-Fi  and you just don't think about it, you know, like our  That we set up the first day we you know  We upgraded our heating system and then never thought about before it's connected to our Wi-Fi. It has been we just never use it  To control anything but it's another IoT device in our home

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and any connect to any appliance that you buy starting this year and next year will have connectivity built into it  Whether or not you turn it on it's up to you, but yeah, it's gonna have it  So I mean Comcast last year said that in its homes  They had an average of 11 devices  11 Wi-Fi connected devices and again think about it a family of four  You're gonna have your computers your phones probably a Kindle a tablet  And then basic stuff like a printer, I mean people still have printers, I think I don't know  So start from there and then add your TVs and you're not even into weird Stacey like stuff yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right and depending on the size of your household. I mean just everybody has a phone that right there is four or five people depending  You know and your laptop six seven eight. I mean just in general you probably had ten devices easy  You know what I want you know what I want for my birthday which isn't from six months

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know for my number next week Stacey is an inventory of your things. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can actually I don't actually know if I could give that to you  That's actually one of the scarier aspects of this. You don't even know what things are buried into your life  Well, yeah, cuz I can only see the Wi-Fi stuff  But I have like I said like the Zigbee light bulbs  So then I have to go into each individual app because I personally have like four different types of light bulbs  But then also my my like motion sensors, how many of those are there? I don't know. Yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, okay. So you've got a home full of things  Yet we have it is thing castle. Yes. It's the thing. Yes the thing castle  No kidding and you know, then you have companies like Amazon who are deciding they're not gonna sell  Certain things anymore. For instance the nest  Products newer nest products are not going to be sold by Amazon Amazon's current inventory of nest  Products they're gonna drop those off as they sell out and I think Ness has said well, we don't want our stuff in your store. Anyways  And I don't know it just kind of has me wondering like  We're at a point where people have you are  buying these smart home devices, which gives them the capability the access for  You know the sea of devices to connect to it  But it feels also in some ways like they're the smart home war is kind of heating up right now to the point where it's like  Yeah, well, maybe we need to buckle down and our products only support our devices not yours

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google and Amazon in this case are behaving exactly like the carriers used to behave when they started blocking and throttling things like Skype or  What's that and things that can and this is this is not a good look for them  No, this is really against this is bad for consumers Kevin  and I talked about this a lot on the show because obviously that's a big part of what the show is about but I  Am so frustrated with them and I am so frustrated like  This appears to be part of an escalation of the hey, you can't play  You know YouTube on Amazon fire TV or  Amazon Echo shows which sucked right and now they're saying that  Gizmodo I think had a story that talked about a conference call and so this is coming basically the Google guys think it's coming directly  From Bezos saying fine  You don't let us play YouTube. We won't sell your gear. So what's the next step?  My Amazon Echo suddenly stops controlling my nest thermostat  Because boys get along I do mean boys  Yeah  This is the sort of thing that well, not only do you hurt your customers you hurt the whole space, right? No one's  No one's gonna buy this stuff and then eventually some senator is gonna be like wait what? Oh, this is not cool at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I've really felt like  There's been a lot of cooperation like for a little while it's it's felt like  In the beginning there were all these different standards for IOT to connect to but then you had these home assistants that really end up being this  Unifying force to be like, oh, we don't really care what you have is it will control it all  And then now it seems to be veering away from each other and I fear that because like you said it  How is that good for the industry as a whole as consumers?  I don't want to have to look and see oh, well this device only supports these  IOT devices and this one supports those so I've got to choose my side and I guess I like those things  So I got to go this way like consumers don't want that they need simple and I feel like  Possibly that might be moving further away from that and this is why I want standards not ecosystems

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everyone's like ecosystems and I'm like  Take your eco sit because ecosystems are they're fluctuating  You can like get mad at somebody but with the standards you're just like this has got to work with this all the time and  By God it would not mess with  Innovation. I hate that excuse. There there are standards that can mess with innovation, but the basic stuff  Interactivity  You know, it's actually interoperability. It's not just interconnectivity and that's what makes this so hard  We and I don't  Would you feel like you're not going to be able to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you feel better talk about how do you feel better if your echo laughed at you? I was gonna say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon finally admitted this by the way, cuz like I've been looking at all these stories and I'm like, oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this real? This is awesome. Apparently apparently echoes are randomly laughing at people  They're all gonna laugh at you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We played the laugh on our show it is not it is not something it is more of a tackle it is more of a tackle

Transcript:  Yeah, it's the second link that I have there is a tweet  Josh if you if you go to the dock, there's a there's a Twitter link there that'll play for you the cackle on a JBL  echo device  Yeah, let's see here if we can hear this  Here we here it goes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow hardly

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mean other than that it's on repeat and now it sounds fake  It hardly sounded like it was coming from a device. It just kind of sounded like someone in the background laughing as they were recording the video

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so there's so much so many questions I have about this  I'm like are they all using the same skill cuz like you could have a skill on the echo and maybe it would just like do  This like just to prank you randomly, right? Like it could be or is this somebody  Hacked into people's like I don't understand has Amazon acknowledged this at all  They acknowledged it and said they're working on it. They actually technically they acknowledged that people have reported this to them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe we acknowledge that you say there's a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so  Amazon responded to the creepiness in a statement to the verge saying we are aware of this and working to fix it  So the fact that they're working to fix it implies that there is something they could do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's so weird. Is this like it? Yeah, is this a prank an internal prank like somebody on the last day is like check this out  Laugh into the echo database and set it to go on and it's randomized in some way that you can't find it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's so weird. But I will say that if in the middle of the night that happened, I would be like what just happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you're free jump out of bed. Yeah  Movie  Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry we're gonna do this we're gonna do this right now you got it is because this is what it would do  To you at night  Okay, here we go got it set it all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  uncontrollably and randomly oh, could you imagine that like that like  Standard horror movie like your dolls are suddenly laughing at you cackle that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that would that would that would not fly that that's a Halloween prank that maybe Amazon needs to consider never doing if they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never yes, I'm guessing it's the Russians trying to get us to fear our technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That stranger things seem to be happening right now  Is there any are there any final stories in here that you guys want to make sure that we get in before we go to tips  I was I wanted to get that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was I was excited about that Amazon. Oh, I think we should do Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rethinking everything. Yeah, cuz Twitter so so and  I guess I should disclose that I'd want me working for the brand even they asked me my opinion before this happened  So Jack Dorsey as you may have seen put out a tweet storm  In which he said, okay  we recognize that Twitter is having a  Impact on the health of the public conversation and we have to do something about that and they've put out an RFP  To get people researchers and such to help them figure out what to do here. They're admitting that they don't know exactly what to do  It's pretty refreshing actually. I think Twitter one could argue that they should run this sooner fine, but they're doing it and  And so I wrote a post saying that the the flight to quality is on the runway  I think we see Google Facebook and Twitter all now grappling with how to deal with manipulation and  Harassment and trolls and a lack of quality and  It's not gonna be easy and they're gonna make mistakes and they're gonna mess some things up  But I think it's an important that they're taking this on themselves. So salute to Jack  Yeah, it's not an easy challenge obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter is not alone. I mean, I feel like all the big tech companies, you know kind of kind of attaching to what we're talking about  earlier about the big tech  pushback, but I mean they're all forced to realize at this point that  There are unintended consequences to yes Silicon Valley  Approach to you know move fast break things and all that all that sort of stuff  Whether they whether they want to address it or not, they're realizing they kind of have to  Yeah, at least Jack Dorsey's taking a good look  I think it's interesting to open it up to the public and to experts like like he said to say hey  What ideas you got because like we need them right?  And you know, meanwhile we see you know when Facebook is putting out fires with this and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because of a law in Germany the next day gay law in Germany  They've got to get rid of anything that could be possibly going to be a problem  In Germany, they've got to get rid of anything that could be possibly considered as hate speech within 24 hours  And they're gonna find a huge amount of money. So satires kind of gone out  With the bathwater and so now we're never good at satire. They go  So now there's there's a there's a religious satire site  I'm forgetting the name of it be something be and they did a funny piece about how  CNN has a washing machine  For spin cycle it doesn't gain anything in my translation, but that can't take it off  Because because these systems can't figure out satire  So now Facebook has to go and try to get help and figure out satire. This is hard stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and the Snopes apparently  Heard from people that you know, they were taking the article litter literally so they ended up debunking it  Because Snopes has a relationship with Facebook that ends up signaling to Facebook that Snopes was on it  And that it's actually fake news because that's what that relationship is all about is this stuff that's posted here real or fake  So then Facebook ended up hitting up the Babylon B was the name of the thank you  Which is very funny administrator to let him know that his satire is getting the smackdown  Basically, which when you read it, of course, there isn't a washing machine that spins news

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, but the problem was when they built the system for the fact-checking  Yeah, they didn't have a satire box, right? So so Snopes had to say well if your uncle Abner really thinks this is true  Okay, we're gonna tell them it's not but the that  Triggered the flag because Snopes had no opportunity to call it satire. Yep. And then as I say as I said ten times  This isn't easy, but they're working on it. They're trying I think that's a positive thing. Yeah, absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's hard to draw a line between satire and fake news  You know a lot of there are a lot of people that would say off fake news is entirely satire  It's it's satire to the point of just look at all the fools that fell for it  You know what? I mean, like that's the point of its existence is to prove that people will fall for anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just saw a story on HuffPost. It's not on the rundown, but  Rebecca who are the bad who are the financial backers of Breitbart Rebecca?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm I'm happy. I don't know the answer I guess  The the Bursar's the more Mansour Mansour Mercer Mercer Mercer Mercer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the Mercer's gave a bunch of money to the New York  Museum of Natural History. So some pranksters went in and put in  Things like hey kids build your own fracking  test  Stuff to try to shame the museum out of taking their money, right?  And so this notion of fake news and satire and and guerrilla theater and it all gets mixed up together  And that's the world we live in  Dana Boyd evidently gave a brilliant speech today, which I can't wait to goes up online at South by Southwest edu  About the dangers of getting too addicted to this notion of facts and and media literacy  And so it's a complex world that we're expecting the platforms to do  binary things and that's what they tend to do is binary things and  They've got to do things in the grays  Anyway, all right. I was the other that is a confusing world with Stacy to sleep

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm waking up. I'm waking up. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, I know what'll wake you up Stacy  You're saying whatever your thing happens to be this week

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I have a double related thing because this is actually related to okay  So my thing is a site that I read about this week and I started trying out with various devices in my life  So it is called hold on. I'm gonna find you pre-bot. Is that really what it's called?  private private  or privacy and  Polices it's an AI powered summary of any privacy policy and  It looks at things like  Yeah, so so go check it out  pre-bot dot or pry bot sorry org  Pole lysis and you it has a bunch of stuff already loaded  So you can look at like Twitter's privacy policy  It looks at the types of info that they connect collect why they collect it and then the options they give  So I started running a lot of my iot stuff because one of the things I hate about their data collection is they're like  Yeah, we're gonna collect all this data and we're gonna share some of it with people most of it's for us  And yeah, we want all of it to make our product better  So it's very basic but the only option you have if you don't like it is to  Not use it, which I think is actually  in some ways it makes sense because a lot of the connectivity and data collection on these devices is  Necessary for it to work  But in other cases you're like dude  I just spent an hour installing a new thermostat and you're telling me that  If I want to use it  I have to buy by this privacy policy and then I'm gonna return it and have a restocking fee  Possibly those kind of things driving nuts. So  This is fun. But the story that came out  I think it was was it yesterday or the day before on movie pass with the CEO saying hey  We're actually a data-driven business and we're gonna track you before your movie and after your movie  None of that's actually in movie passes privacy  None of the details are in that privacy policy that they post to users  It doesn't say it says that they're gonna get your location, you know as part of this  But it doesn't say we're getting your location for whatever amount of time before the movie or after the movie. So  The two things together one it's like hey, this is good  But it also shows how inadequate the current state of privacy  Disclosure is actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No kidding. I missed that part of the movie the movie pass kind of news from yesterday  But it was very I mean very interesting from the keynote. He he did not care at all, you know for based on what I read  I didn't actually watch it. We'll watch him up there. So I don't know what his tenor was  I don't know what his tenor was when he was delivering it, but it was like yeah, we track you before we track you after  It's kind of how I interpreted it. Anyways, it seemed like he was like, yep data's currency and we got all of it  Right. Okay. I guess that's why you're paying eight bucks for a limited movies per month. I guess that's it  How do you feel about that? You know, maybe maybe that's ten bucks  Well, yeah, I think you have some sort of a promo or something for eight bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, so that's and that makes sense, I mean again you don't get anything for free in this world and now  Free and this is another thing that I think is important with a lot of web services and IOT is we have to actually start  Understanding that free is not free that there are costs both to your data and privacy, but also even societally and  You know, I that's a big topic, but we could talk about it another time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your pick actually reminds me of I mean this site that I'm sure you're already familiar with  TOSDR org terms of service didn't read very similar right like it's whole purpose and you can install  Browser add-ons on both of these sites that we're talking about is to let you know about these things that maybe you didn't know  About these companies that you're signing up for you're agreeing to all that kind of stuff  Because if you're not pouring through those pages upon pages of  Text when you sign up for a service, you know, you could be agreeing to something that is a very bad idea  So they they do this to make it a little bit easier for you and I'm happy that they do  Jeff you've got a few

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I found this one charming. So Chris Hughes who was Mark Zuckerberg's roommate one night was  On his you know, it wasn't a rich kid when he went to Harvard just a smart kid and he was doing his job and  And they and he and mark had to have the talk  They had to have the talk about equity  so  none of them knew anything about this stuff, but Hughes was a little more naive and he  went to Zuck and asked him for 10% and  And he and Zuck went on on a walk with one umbrella in the rain  Zuck evidently loves to do all these things on walks and told him no  What you do is not worth 10% and I have to have equity for other people and so he gave him 2% and  At the IPO that 2% was worth 500 million dollars. So I haven't heard a complaint since yeah, no kidding. I  Little story here. So so way back when back in the day  I was asked to come to an event for News Corp actually to moderate a panel with Mark Zuckerberg and Nick Denton  And before we went on  Zuck was asking Nick  Advice about hiring salespeople and he just mentioned off handily something might give me in salespeople equity and Nick jumped on his throne  So don't do that salespeople come and go there, you know, they're widgets you can hire them anytime  No, that's do you you don't know how valuable your equity is gonna be  True words were never spoken. Yeah, no kidding

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No kidding  We all need to meet a Zuckerberg and get 2% don't we?  So you know, I'll take point 2% life goals  My tip is an app that maybe I looked in the dock and I couldn't see that you guys had ever brought it up  On the show, maybe it came up somewhere along the line  But we're talking a little bit about Android P and some of the flay the flavors some of the features  flavors of  The new OS part of this is smart replies in your notification shade  And you can do that now actually with an app that Google is beta testing right now called reply  You can't find it in the Play Store  They're doing a very limited beta test of this but I'm linking to the APK mirror side APK mirror  Created by the folks behind Android police. It's a trusted place to get some of these APKs that are harder to find  So you can go there you can download it onto your device and I can even show it off right now  Basically what it does it gives you some controls  Well, I won't pull up the settings but it basically gives you controls to determine what pieces of your data  It can actually use in smart replies and then it connects into  Messaging apps so that in your notification shade you get some of these smart replies for instance  This was a test from the reply app. It says want to grab dinner  Interesting that a robot wants me to go to dinner with them, but great I can reply sure I'm down or what time  I just send that and it sends off  Burke sent me an image of his tablet. Oh, you know, let me get away from that sent me an image of his tablet  I wish I had the the preview of that in my notification  but on Android P apparently I will his Nexus 7 that we were talking about earlier and  So it's a sent an image and I saw it on my browser so I can say hey that looks good. I send that  He'll get that reply  and it makes  Messaging just a little bit easier from a notification shade. So it's called reply. It's by Google  And if you want to find it, you can just search apk mirror comm you'll find it there and you can install it and  I've noticed that it's really handy. It also has like a while driving feature  So it detects when your device is in driving mode or that your device detects anyways that you're actually driving and it will cancel any  Notifications or auto reply to say hey, I'm driving  I'll get back to you when I park that sort of stuff and there's a bunch of other features that it does kind of  Intelligently based around like your calendar and all that kind of stuff  But if you want a little preview of what to expect out of Android P, that's a way to get started

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't wait. That's cool. I can't see an explanation points exclamation points for years. So yeah, apparently
