Hello, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hello. I thought you were going to just say the Internet of Things verse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is the IOT verse.  Actually, there's some IOT news.  There is.  We'll talk about it.  Also, Danny Sullivan from searchengineland.com and marketingengineland.com.  Hello, Danny.  Hello.  And I see the Starship Enterprise on the shelf to your right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's pretty. Oh, yeah. I switched it out.  Pretty sweet. That's my giant Mega Bloks.  NCC 1708.  Really?  Enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's very good.  You can make that on Mega Bloks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can get the license Mega Bloks did.  And it was a very different kind of a build, but I was very excited to get it.  Interesting.  It's nice. I can't show you, but the little things on the end, the engines will glow even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's very good.  Nice. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So before you go any further, please do not open any links in the Google Doc you may have received.  Apparently, this is breaking this afternoon.  A massive phishing campaign targeting Google accounts.  Journalists particularly targeted.  They are malicious links.  And apparently, if you click on it, you will then give permission to something called Google Docs, which isn't Google Docs.  And it gives you access.  It gives it access to your Gmail.  You can read, send, delete and manage your email on your behalf.  How nice.  That is scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can remove it.  You should remove it.  Here's Tom Warren with his tweet.  Apparently, he's got a good screenshot, so I'm thinking he might have got bit.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think a lot of us have received it.  Did you get it, Stacey?  I got one, but it was after the clicking or after I don't click.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Where does it show up?  Does it show up in a document?  It's an email.  It's an email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Inviting you to the document.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apparently, it comes from hhhhhhh.mailinator.com.  And the recipients are BCC'd.  Is it your habit to just go ahead and open those shared documents?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I usually look, but because that looks sort of legit, I might have, like if I was flipping through, I might just click it and be like, oh, did one of my editors send me something?  Click.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, it's caught a bunch of people that ordinarily wouldn't get caught by something like that, so it looks like it was fairly sophisticated.  I got two of them, but people had gone around saying, no, don't open this by that point.  So I was like, whew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you to everyone who went this way before I happened to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and I'm protected because I don't actually ever read my email.  Well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Must be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although now I'm looking at the one I got right now, and it looks just like what you got.  That would have been an alarm to me.  Like, it's like it's invited you to open this document and that whole two hhhh.  I'd be like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is definitely if you're just flipping through.  But I mean, I don't know.  Some days when like if I get back from a meeting or something or I've been on the phone, I inbox is like you're just like clicking through, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and notice, by the way, this one appears to come from Joe Bernstein at Buzzfeed.com.  It isn't, in fact, and it says Joe Bernstein invited you to follow the document.  I don't know if that's customized for whoever it's aimed at.  But you could easily not realize that it actually came from HHHHHHHHH.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like it comes from one of your friends.  Right. Yeah.  Or at least a legitimate contact.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, I didn't get one.  I'm sad.  I'm hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If I clicked on mine, I mean, we can make that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And do we know if anybody got bit by like besides, I mean, anybody who clicked would have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, apparently, I mean, the device article I read was said it was all over Twitter and that several journalists like several unnamed journalists have been affected.  I think some people advised.  So I'm doing a quick search on Google for Google Docs.  There's certainly plenty of coverage of it.  So, yeah, it looks very sophisticated in the sense that it I think all seem to come up off of a Google domain.  I think that's how it was meant to look as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, wow, look at the Petaluma City Schools sent me an email saying there's a widespread email scam.  Do not open.  So, wow, that went out 30 minutes ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That makes sense.  That makes sense.  Actually, my kids, my kids, my imaginary other child, my kid is on Google Docs.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The schools use use Chromebooks and Google Docs.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they think at this point, though, it's something that Google would somehow be able to identify and stop.  Like if you clicked on the link, because if I understood it, like the link took you into the link took you into a Google domain.  Like it looked like there was some kind of actual app that was running off of Google's domain.  It's not that Google created it, but you know, you can you can create pages on Google's domain.  You can create all sorts of things that actually have a Google URL because Google has these common things are licensed out.  So I'm spinning through articles myself to try to see Vox has one.  What we know and how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what we know how it works.  Wow.  Well, I'm glad we led with that because presumably there are people watching live who may be bit with it.  And you're right.  Good work here.  We have done our job.  We can go home.  Thank you, everybody.  Good night.  I would love it.  You're right.  This shouldn't be possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There should be sure Google is working on this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There needs to be malware protection in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It says that like, you know, it takes you to Google's real login page, apparently.  And then when you enter your password, you get redirected redirected to a third party site.  So what's happening and how they're taking you to their password?  I don't know.  It's I can't tell enough of what's happening, but that's one of those things you think Google would do.  At the very least, Google could put a big thing up on their their password login page right now saying warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't think they want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Two factor, two factor, two factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But that wouldn't save you either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Would it?  Not if it's there.  If you want to change your password.  So presumably once you get access to the accounts password, you try to change it.  So like the person wouldn't get in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  When you're it's you're giving permission to another site and then I don't know.  I don't know.  Like when you authorize another site, if it needs to have two factor or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So here's in the Google subreddit.  It used the existing Google login system.  So that's actually this really scary.  Yeah, because that means they were using OAuth.  They had set up a page to use Google's OAuth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look at that does bypass two factor.  Oh, OK.  And emails.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the first thing they do once they get Gmail permissions is to spread it.  And that's why it's coming to you from someone you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  That's why I won't I won't share with you who sent me mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Somebody you know, if you by the way, though, you should email them back and say you were infected because that's the if you get it from somebody, it's a sign that they were bit.  They know.  They know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I won't ask how they know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like it's the same service public service message you offer all your friends when you're suddenly like, oh, dude, your Skype spin spam.  This has been just got it.  It's been a long time, though, since.  Yeah.  I mean, there was the Skype one that was fairly recent.  But other than that, it's been quite a while since I've had to do that.  It used to be like, you know, like once a month, one of your friends would have something, you know, it is apparently spread quite severely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm in our chat room.  Reverend Anson and Amini is telling me in the chat room, the three universities he does work with have sent out the email that I got from the Petaluma schools.  It's pretty widespread.  And it makes sense.  That's what's scary about this kind of attack.  Email is instant.  And it's this stuff spreads so fast.  It's one of the reasons any viruses are of dubious value these days.  You're going to get a virus within minutes that will take a day for them to to modify their software to detect.  If you clicked allow, if you did log in and clicked allow, you're done.  If you didn't click the link, close the tab or press deny, you're OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What was that a thing from something like HHH?  If there was that thing again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  HHH mailinator.  That's the email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the actual email it's from.  But it won't say that.  It will say from somebody you know.  And it will say CC'd the HHH.  If you did get bit revoked, revoke access to Google Docs because this quote Google Docs is not Google Docs.  And the real one doesn't need access because it's your Google account.  So if you see in your access list Google Docs, that's bad.  And then you'll look in your sent box because those are people you just spammed.  And inform whoever sent you the email of course that their accounts been compromised as Stacey did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It sounds like Google shutting it down.  Has Google, has it been stopped?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's an interesting question.  Could they?  What do you think Danny?  Could they somehow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's like what they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Globally revoke the permission?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you're going to their password page, I don't understand how when you go to that password page, it's.  It's a Google app.  Doing this other type of thing.  They create a web app in Google.  It sounds like it's some kind of application that has gotten into their system to use that password page or in some way in a selfish way.  And they should be able to block that.  They should be able to say, well, we know what's happening here because it's all sending back to this other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I guess so if you authorized it, you're authorizing an application that by now presumably Google has shut down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  I guess someone in the chat room saying that Google did disable the app.  OK, so it's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're safe.  Well, are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, if you go in and change your password, you're safe.  But otherwise, they still have access.  They did not get your password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're use Google's own system, which does not give them a password.  It merely authenticates.  And then you add this bogus web app to your account, which then minds your Gmail.  We don't know if there's an additional payload.  That's unknown at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, I was like, what is the point of this?  What else are they doing?  Right.  I mean, clearly, did they grab all your contacts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They could have grabbed all your email.  I doubt they did because of the quantity of data that would have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a lot of you got to be downloading.  Yeah, you know, it's very possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I'm sure Google's actually looking because now Google has access to their source code.  So I'm sure Google is looking at their app to see what else it did.  It may well be that the only purpose of the app was to spread itself, which would be kind of an interesting joke.  But there's no further compromise, a compromise, as far as I know, because you didn't use Google's own authentication system.  So there's actually this important distinction.  I'm sure everybody watching knows that.  But you can make a page that looks like a Google login page and steal people's credentials.  Danny, how can you tell if that's what you're getting or if you're not?  That's what you're getting.  Or if you're getting a real Google authentication, it's a pop up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know, usually your first clue is to look at what's in your address field, right?  Because, you know, it should look like a...  The pop up doesn't have an address for you.  Oh, you mean when it comes to the pop up?  Well, yeah, I'd probably be wary if you're getting a pop up then too, because like, why are you getting that kind of a pop up type of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But the pop up is what Google does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, when I go and I try to authenticate something, it usually takes me to a page where I have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It does? You don't get a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's fine.  And now, very short, our news editor is telling me you can read the link.  But I mean, like, if you can find the link, and like I said, in most cases, I usually see it.  It's in a browser and I can see the link.  You can tell.  I'm very saying if you get the pop up, right click, and you should be able to use an option that lets you see the link.  And the link should generally be from a Google domain, not something like, you know, such and such, dash dot Google, et cetera, et cetera.  Even further advice is coming in from Barry Schwartz saying, right click, copy the link and paint it into notepad so that you can see it better.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, let's use this as an example.  I'll do it. I'll do it right now.  This is Unroll.me, which you absolutely do not want to sign up for, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's your password?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, this is this is your mother's name.  This is the authentication box you get.  And you get this from many people.  Where is this at?  This is Unroll.me, which is something you do not want to sign up for.  We've talked about that.  Yeah, OK.  Because you can sign up with Google, Yahoo, Outlook or AOL.  Those are all...  This is OAuth, too.  This is the...  So when I click this, I should get an OAuth dialog.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's see what we got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Continue.  And that's what I'm talking...  I guess it is a page.  And then you're right.  You can see at the top.  You can see at the top.  And that...  But the problem is people look at these...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that, by the way, ought to, if you have two-factor, trigger the two-factor to come in as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It will. I do have two-factor.  So the next step will be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And if it were a fake system, then I don't think you would get the two-factor because...  Right.  ...you know, it's not going to be able to...  Google's system is going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This says https://accounts.google.com.  The problem is you might also see accounts.google.com.tv.com or something else.  Right.  And if you...  So you've got to look at the whole thing between the slashes.  You should also look at the certificate.  You see, it says secure.  And, you know, I can learn more about my secure connection.  You know, this annoys me.  Google changed how this works, by the way.  It's going to change again, too.  It used to give you a chance to look at the certificate right here.  And it doesn't.  And this is really annoying.  In order to get the certificate, you now actually have to go elsewhere on the page.  I'm going to close this.  Close this.  Get back here.  To get this certificate, I think I have to go over to...  Geez, this is crazy.  Is it developer tools?  I think I do.  And then security and view certificate.  That is...  I'm really sad that Google did that.  That was a change fairly recently in Chrome.  And so that's too many steps.  It should be I could right click on secure.  Ask Barry that.  I should be able to click on secure and say, see certificate right over here.  Instead, this is crazy.  Developer tools, which normally opens here,  or here, and the word security is off the menu to the right.  Security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To be honest, I don't even think most people are going to get to the point where they're going to try to look at a certificate and understand if it's telling them what it's saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's why we want it to be easy.  Because if you could pop up the certificate, it says, issued to star.google.com.  And then you can verify it.  That should be a much easier thing than this ridiculous developer's tool.  That's not the way to do it, Google.  And I was a little disappointed that they changed that recently.  Anyway, because I check certificates a lot.  All right.  Well, should I just go ahead?  I'm going to click and see if it asks for my two factor.  Oh, I don't know.  Should I allow unroll me to get my mail?  Now I wait a minute.  I guess it's not going to ask for my two factor because remember, I'm logged in on into Chrome on this.  Anyway, let's just deny.  Deny.  I deny you.  Oops.  Looks like you declined access.  Damn straight.  What made you decline?  I'm worried about security.  That's in there twice, by the way.  So that's clearly a popular answer.  I'm really, yeah, we use security.  Yeah.  Bank level security as well as your emails provider security.  Yeah.  You're really security.  You're really secure.  Net buy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We encrypt your data before we sell the metadata.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly.  So did I make a mistake?  I just read an article said that you shouldn't buy a new pixel right now.  This is a bad time to buy a Google Pixel.  A Pixel phone?  Pixel phone.  Why?  Because well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was there a good time to buy it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the best Android phone.  Android.  Yeah.  You disagree?  I love it.  Well, I had bought the little one.  I have one.  I like it.  This was after I got the Galaxy S8 because I thought, oh, yes, that's the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You should definitely get the big.  Yeah.  Just all big phones from now on.  Yeah, only big phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know it's got a bezel.  No, stop.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not in the big phone club, but keep going.  I'm sorry.  Well, I thought that's why I got the little phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I thought maybe I'm not in the big phone club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I used to have an iPhone 6S and then I got the 7 and the big one and then I look at the  S now and I'm like, oh, I can't deal with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You got the plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Got the plus.  So.  And then the same thing with the Pixel.  So I thought, well, the Pixel would be great.  I'll get the small one.  That'll be awesome.  And I was like, no, it wasn't awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want the big one.  So I traded it in for the big one.  I got the big one.  And because I thought I was going to use the S8.  Is that traded in?  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I didn't trade it in.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You had multiple pixels running through now.  I said that so that people wouldn't think that I was just throwing money at one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you got the big Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I traded it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I put the old one in the drawer and I got a new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could at least sell it on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I will do something with it.  You know what I actually do?  And I give it to the staff, staff members.  I saw yesterday, I saw Burke was about to order a 6P.  I said, stop.  Don't order a 6P.  I've got phones up the butt.  He said, I want a phone up the butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They certainly don't want a phone that came from up your butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, it's actually I gave him the other one, the little Pixel.  He says, too small.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, but he has now the HTC U Ultra, which is big.  But I'm going to keep the S8.  I got the S8 Plus and I like it, but I don't like it enough.  I think Samsung junked it up and it reminded me how much I like the Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, the pure Android is nice.  It is so much nicer.  And if you're going to, if you like Android, I think going with a Google branded phone is great.  Other, unless you want to go for Motorola, which pretty much doesn't mess with them too much either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Motorola is a good choice, but.  It's just so expensive.  Tell me about it.  Anyway, David Ruddock writing at Android Police said, even if you can, which by the way, you can now.  I thought it was going to be a long wait.  It was a week.  Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore.  I'm not sure I agree with this.  He says this.  This is this is kind of the ultimate in in spec, spec geekiness.  The Snapdragon 821 is old news.  Oh, come on.  It doesn't support advanced network features across the four carriers, which aren't available yet anyway.  Right.  And then he says the Pixel 2 is coming out.  Well, yeah, but in September or October.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's not that far now, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is it's May, May, June, July, August.  That's not that's six months from now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Minimum your phone along.  Nurse it along.  You think your phone you got now can't last six months.  What's it doing going?  I can barely walk now.  I just give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He also points out that Google has told people that we will stop supporting it October 2018 and stop doing security updates like a year after that.  Is that is I don't know.  I'm a little disappointed.  I thought Google was going to support these like they supported Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just got I thought Google was going to have things like, you know, proper inventory so you could buy them.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I don't think they can support them.  I'm sorry.  Like this was like Google.  No, we're really serious about our phones, which is like the third time they've been serious about phones.  Right.  Because we had the Nexus when they first came out with the Nexus and then we did different things like now we've got the super Nexus.  And then it was like and now it was like we've got the pixel really super serious about this phone.  We're running ad campaigns.  It's got Google Assistant and then you can't buy it.  That doesn't tell me you were super serious about the phone.  That tells me it was still kind of like a little bit of a hobby.  Well, you know, I get not wanting to gamble on on getting a bunch of inventory because you're not certain if you'll actually sell it.  But it also then when people do want to buy it and they can't buy it like, you know, I want to say, you know, that doesn't happen with Apple.  But of course, it does happen with Apple.  But that happens with Apple because there's so much demand, not because Apple goes, well, let's only produce a little bit and see if anybody's interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I can't I do not understand why Apple can't keep air pods in stock.  I don't understand why Google can't keep this phone in stock.  It seems to be an epidemic in the tech industry that they just don't can't make them fast enough.  I don't know why that is.  But I think you should buy a Pixel XL if you if you need a phone right now.  Obviously, if you can limp along for five and a half months, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, if you need a phone right now, you could easily get a good solid two hundred dollar phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, if you wanted to get a Moto G, get the fifth generation Moto G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you wanted to get to the fall when the long generation phones are going to come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And he does make a good point, which is that this was a flawed.  The Pixel was a flawed phone out of the box that Google had rushed it out and had to compromise.  It's not it doesn't have it's not waterproof, doesn't have wireless charging.  There are a lot of issues with it.  It does have, I will submit, the best camera on the market, better than the cameras, better than the Galaxy S8 even.  You could argue that the dual lenses on the LG G6 make it more attractive.  I've seen some really nice wide angle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I lent I lent one to my son to try because he was on the photography or the Pixel.  No, the Pixel. And he would totally be using the Pixel because of the camera.  Yes. If only it could do Apple messages.  Yes. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  By the way, blame Apple for that.  That's oh, I know, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's like that's the lock in for him right now.  All his friends use messages and no one wants to be like they can't do group chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nobody wants to be a green bubble anymore.  I don't want to be the green bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How did we get back to here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know. All right.  Lately, you've been very critical of my story choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I wasn't thinking of the story.  I was thinking because you were complaining about iMessages.  And I was going although I was I could complain about Aloe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I could complain about Aloe.  Aloe hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's wrong with Google?  Well, no, that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm saying I feel like we're all the way back in like the early aughts again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't mean you meant in general.  You talking. It's like we're all using aim and I see Q.  Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm just like, oh, how did that happen?  That was more like it just aside.  It was not a criticism of your story choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm feeling I'm very sensitive.  I'm sitting in front of you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. What do you think, baby?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it looks really nice.  It's awesome for this.  Look at this. I can zoom in.  Really nice.  Oh, man. Look at this.  Let's go to search.  Let me go to search engine land and show you how good.  Oh, please.  How good your site looks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just want you to put that weird circle thing up there and do something.  Oh, I watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, I can do that.  Look, you know, I can scroll.  See, it's got a knob.  Your site now has a knob on it.  Look at that.  And oh, you're really going to like this.  Let's let's get a let's get a really good story from Danny Sullivan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Where at? Which one? This one?  How Google Assess?  Authority.  Oh, yeah. Actually, that was my next story.  That was my next story.  So so I really like to make it big so everybody can read it.  And then let's say Danny says something really interesting.  Watch this.  I can then go, oh, look at this.  Danny's talking about page rank.  You know, Google didn't just reward pages with a lot of links.  It tried to calculate how.  By the way, this is really germane to our conversation last week, isn't it, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, it is. I was like, I saw this and I was like, oh, it's so sad that Jeff is not here to talk about this today.  But Danny, since you wrote this, we can ask you all the hard questions.  We fought for 40 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We fought for 40 minutes last week on this.  Battle it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was there some kind of fight?  Because I got a tweet, somebody saying that I needed to fight more or something.  I was like, but I wasn't even on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I should let you recap the battle, Stacey.  And I will if you don't want to.  But oh, God, so I have a dog in this hunt, as they say in Austin, Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I use that phrase just yesterday.  Anyway, so Leo is of the opinion that Google is going.  It's losing authority, the moral high ground.  Authority. There you go.  When it comes to starting to dictate what's truth and how it's going to show things and what has authority.  And Jeff is of the opinion that because Google is an authority that we turn to, it should favor absolute truth like science.  And then we got into this whole digression of absolute truth and algorithms being biased.  And it was it was a long, long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jeff, as you know, is part of the Facebook Craigslist Integrity Initiative and journalism.  In fact, CUNY, his university, has kind of been charged to keep track of news integrity and kind of to divvy out the money.  They put aside a lot of money to help people, advertisers and platforms do a better job with fake news.  My concern, and this is actually right up your alley, Danny, so I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.  My concern is that in my opinion, in the early days of Google, it was the whole point was to reflect what's on the Internet and and to rank it using PageRank based on other pages' interest in it.  You know, it's it ranks more highly because that's what more people are talking about.  And not to judge the ferocity of the content, not to judge the content at all.  And I'm concerned that if Google starts getting in the business of judging the content of pages, that is a serious kind of I think it breaks PageRank.  It breaks. And my fear is that talk about filter bubbles.  Now you've got a Silicon Valley company as the as the ultimate arbiter of truth.  And that worries me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, gosh, we're to unpack.  In Google's original system that was called PageRank, they talked about it as being the democracy of the web.  And the idea was that links could be like votes.  And so the pages that got the most votes or the most links potentially would win.  But and this is what the article I talk about today goes into.  It was never just a counting game.  Even from the start, they tried to figure that some links were more equal than others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They did think about quality. They thought about the quality of the links.  And we acknowledge that they've had to do that.  I mean, that's what Matt Cutts does with did with his spam fighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. And then in addition, they didn't just look at the popularity, but they also would look at, say, the context of the links.  This is why, you know, you would find Amazon at the time you search for books.  Amazon would come up for number one.  But if you search for cars, you wouldn't find Amazon because even though Amazon had a lot of links and a lot of important links, nobody was linking to Amazon saying cars in or near the links.  So it wasn't contextually relevant.  And I think that when you talk about back when it started, the idea of like just fake content or untruthful content or debatable topics, I don't think you had as much of it that was going on.  Instead, you know, you had relatively lots of authoritative content.  Not perfect. There was obviously such an issue.  But the real challenge, you know, back then was simply the people who were trying to to spam and completely mislead and completely try to, you know, try to rank the search algorithm so that they would just get monetary gain or some other benefit off of it without having any any real relevancy.  You know, people will debate whether or not SEO is just spamming and it's not because Google even will tell you you should do it.  And, you know, if you're relevant and it makes sense for you to be doing is a good good thing you should should be happening and doing.  But, you know, you go into extremes or you can have just outright misleading stuff.  But but it wasn't like I'm trying to alter your opinion necessarily.  It was more like I'm just trying to hijack some traffic.  You know, these days you have a lot of content that's out there.  You were in this sort of post truth world that's going on.  And, yeah, I think that Google does need to figure out how to deal with it.  And I think it's perhaps a little too freak out prone to say that Google is preventing you from getting to content or they're putting you into a bubble by some of the changes that they're trying to do.  One of the challenges, first of all, they literally don't know what's authoritative.  And that's part of what the article I got into today was explaining.  There's no signal that they look at and say, well, now that's an authority or here that's truth.  They don't know what truth is.  And how could they know what truth is when you even get into some issues where even we as humans don't know what the truth is?  Right. So what they're trying to do is look at a bucket of metrics to figure out whether or not something seems to have some authority.  And the change that they made was and I saw a little bit of what Jeff wrote and he was like, you know, Google is now going to wait more towards authority.  That's not new.  It's not like Google just suddenly decided to wait more towards authority.  What's new is that they're going to wait more towards authority when you start getting into more granular kinds of searches.  So if you had searched for Holocaust, it wasn't like Google said you search for the Holocaust.  Well, authority, we don't care about that.  They would give you really authoritative sites.  But when you would search for things like did the Holocaust happen, Google would say, well, that's not a very common search that happens.  So you might really want something that's more granular and more specific, just like if, say, you search for weird computer error that you got.  You might type in the computer error.  You don't want to get some page off a CNET that says computer errors are bad.  You want a page that specifically talks about that error.  And so Google's algorithms in these specific searches would tend to skew towards let's go for the very specific content, even if it doesn't necessarily have as much authority as it seems like it needs to have.  So when you would search for did the Holocaust happen, you'd end up with pages telling you the Holocaust didn't happen.  They were the only pages discussing it because people weren't writing a lot of content explaining why it really did happen because so many people understand it's an accepted fact.  It's just like why you wouldn't find a lot of content necessarily on why the earth is flat.  And so I just did that. It's funny you should say that.  I'm sure you'll get some right. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, actually, mostly what I got is proofs that the earth's not flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Right. But see, so, you know, but then that's been kind of a joke thing that's come up.  So then people maybe that's not the best one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You do get the Flat Earth Society, but it's not in the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's not. But, you know, and then it's but so they would skew towards these granular things and then you would get sites that are out there.  And it's like, is that the best thing to be doing?  And the algorithm isn't perfect.  The algorithm has to make decisions all the time.  So you could say, well, if they go to more authoritative content, they're biasing it.  Well, if they don't go to more data, authoritative content, they're biasing it.  The algorithm is not unbiased.  The algorithm is going to have a bias just like anything that makes decisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the point that both Jeff and Stacey did make.  Yeah. So there is bias in here.  So I don't want but I think that that doesn't give you permission to add more bias.  Well, I don't even know what more bias is.  Wouldn't you want to have as little bias as possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, there's no such thing as little bias.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you're just there's bias.  Yeah, you can't have less or more of it.  You can double down on a position that's biased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But well, I would say use as little bias as possible to give you good search results.  Obviously, part of the problem is the quality is hard to define.  But let's assume the quality is bias.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you're you're if you're choosing quality, like let's take it away from search for a minute.  If I'm taking a table, that's a matter of taste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Well, in its quality is part of the bias.  I may choose to spend more for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no. So so presuming that Google Google is going to have to define the word by quality in some fashion.  And and I think what the way to define it is a quality link is the link that gives you what you're looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, actually, they they don't define quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They don't want to. I know they don't want to. But they have to.  It's implicit. No, but it's implicit.  That's like defining pornography.  No, but they have to because it's implicit in what they're doing.  So even if they don't want to say they have somewhere in that algorithm, a definition of quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would define it as they don't want to generate search results that make a lot of people's eyebrows go up and say, what are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's so that's the kind of example that's that's OK.  Let's assume that that that kind of is my point, which is people's eyebrows going up isn't always a good metric for whether that information is important.  And in fact, people's eyebrows went up as I brought up last week.  I don't want to get this whole thing again that when when you know, was it Galileo who said that the earth revolves around the sun, their eyebrows went up?  Sure. No, I don't think so.  And so that's not the best metric in a lot of areas, including science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think part of the difference is if Galileo had published something today out on the Web, first of all, even then he was respected.  Right. So he would be publishing with some degree of authority.  It would be recent. So it would show up as part of the news discussion that would be happening.  It's not like it would just be like, well, that freaks us out.  We're going to get rid of it. And you'd have almost like an immediate debate about what was going on from from there.  So I don't know. It's this I get what you're concerned about with the filter bubble.  There are good reasons to to be worried about that.  Those actually are reasons you'd be more worried about the personalization of search that Google has done since like 2009.  Not because of their shift with authority, right?  Because everybody sees different results. You do a search there. I do a search here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's I that's the filter bubble part. I reject that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't worry about. So so wait. OK, let's take your Galileo example and say that that is a bad example, not because it doesn't fit your argument,  but because in that time frame, there was not a rapid fire discussion among people who were deemed authoritative.  There was the church and people like mailing letters back and forth, which is not so.  Google, it doesn't make sense to argue that in relation to the world we live in now with Google and how information is talked about and shared now.  So picking quality today, Galileo, like Danny said, Galileo would have a much easier time of it because other people would see his stuff.  The church would not hate to be shouted down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't. I don't think so.  The problem is that people with controversial opinions are shouted down and that was controversial for the church.  Well, all right. Then don't use Galileo.  But people with you will acknowledge that people with controversial opinions today get shouted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They are not. So so remember the dude who said autism, the truth is not seen cost.  Yeah, but truth is not democratic.  Autism. Scientists were like, well, that's crazy.  But a lot of people are like, oh, that makes a lot of sense to me.  And that was that was something that got hold, even though it wasn't true.  And he came back later and said, yeah, I made all that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So but I think it's also important to understand that it's not the change that Google's making doesn't mean that the results are necessarily going to be clean of controversial opinions or or, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I like what you said about it.  The more granular the search, the more likely you're going to get those eyeball opinions is the general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But if you're going to if you're going to do a search for did the Holocaust happen?  And the first thing that they were listing was a white supremacist site telling you that it wasn't.  And then virtually all the rest of the page was made up from denial stuff.  Let me let me ask you this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat. Yeah, yeah.  No, somebody in the chat room kind of encapsulated my my thinking very well.  And let me ask you if if this is nuts to say this.  But he said I should find it. He said, I think it was reverb mic.  Yeah, Google's the card catalog, not the periodical section.  Do you know what I mean by that? It's both.  Well, it's both. But if so, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's and it's also too simplistic an argument because your card catalog is I want some books on this topic.  And the librarian comes back and says, here are five books.  Right. So that's what I thought we have in the library.  Google has a million thousand books on any search you want to ask for.  So it could dump five hundred thousand books at you.  But that's not very helpful. It has to sort them in some way.  It has to decide which ones it thinks are the most important ones that it tries to show you.  And that's what actually a librarian would have done in a library if there were a lot of choices.  And I just don't know. I'm trying to get started on this topic.  They might say, well, you know, a really good book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. So a library actually is curation, but the card catalog is not the card catalog is an attempt to be complete.  But Google doesn't do that because that you will be unusable.  You don't want a million research results while you want them in order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I get the goal that we want to have unbiased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're just saying it's impossible. And that's my question.  I just there aren't unbiased things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I also get what you're saying about, well, I don't want it to be as biased.  But I think it's easy to think of being too biased in terms of, say, political views.  Do you want Google to be more liberal and less conservative? Not really.  I don't think people would agree they wanted to do that.  Very much not. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's but that's my concern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Right. But but the idea of saying, well, I don't want it to be as authoritative because I want to get, I don't know, less stuff.  I I get that as well.  But then it's like just trying to find that I think they are trying to find the balance that's in there in a way that provides results that work for most people most of the time.  And this is why I'm glad you were here.  If you really want to find some of these sites and you really want to get to dive deep, it's not like the sites aren't in Google.  It's not like you can't locate that reassures me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You actually you actually crystallized it for me because you said a general search.  The more general a search, the more they're going to impose an order on it.  The more specific a search, the more likely you're going to find the variation of of thinking on that.  And so and that actually is, I think, a good way to compromise.  So if you if you search for Holocaust, that's different from searching.  You know, did the Holocaust happen or even more?  I want to read Holocaust denier sites because you would Google would give you those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. If you were explicitly and that is a different thing.  Right. I give you like one of the fine Holocaust denial sites.  Google lists them and you can find them by search for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that actually reassures me because then that gives me what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It goes into the other thing, too, which is part of the change they made, which was not to detour you into some of these weird areas.  Right. You search for Holocaust and it's just did the Holocaust happen.  And all of a sudden it sent you off into this very specific discussion, which is not really what you were intending.  Well, but yeah, I mean, that's and it comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This came up because of snippets. Right.  So in a snippet, it would say no.  Is climate change real?  Yes, because a snippet is Google deciding what is factual.  But that's different from search results.  Yeah. And snippets are really the most problematical thing here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's why you can still search for who invented homework.  And Google will tell you it was Roberto Nevelez in 1995.  In Venice. Oh, yeah, it's still up.  It'd be up forever. Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, I didn't mean to bring this back, Stacey.  I know this is a well-worn. How did we get here?  Well, I just but we had Danny on. He wrote this article on authority.  I thought this is looking at the surface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I'm glad actually I'm glad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, right. It was all it's you started, Dan.  I'm glad that you were here because I think you actually did say that's something that reassured me.  And because of your deep understanding of how Google works, that's that actually is reassuring.  General is one thing. Specific is another snippets. Forget about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You did move the conversation forward, didn't he? Yep.  She's grudgingly admitting that I'm not. I am thankful, especially if that means we don't have to come back to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Stacey is so tired of my bet. Noir. My my my obsessions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We all have our I have crazy obsession. What's your obsession?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What will you bring up every time on this show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, probably net neutrality. OK, let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's take a break. Let's do it.  There's some there's quite a bit of news on net neutrality.  We're going to we're going to fuel Stacey's obsession next.  Oh, dear. And then we want to talk about Google's results because there's a lot to parse there, too.  Our show today brought to you by the best new way to search for business travel upside.  Upside. I'm just like I'd be kind of fell in love with upside over the last few months.  We book a lot of business travel.  And, you know, if when I was at Ziff Davis, big company, there was literally a travel bureau.  There were people you would call and they would book your travel for you and do the whole thing.  And they had pre negotiated prices with the airlines and hotels.  And that was awesome. But most businesses aren't that big. Our business isn't.  So upside kind of does it for you.  Upside is the best new way for small and medium sized businesses to book their business travel.  Comes to you from Jay Walker, who founded Priceline.  And, you know, after his great success with Priceline, he thought, what can I?  Well, what where else can I work?  I also can I make the world a better place?  It bundles flights and hotels together for one low price.  You will save a lot of money. And then upside is very smart.  They have a little bonus for the people doing the travel booking, a free gift card with every.  Trip you book and good gift cards to Amazon.  There's actually you can see a variety of gift cards when you look at the website.  Go to upside dot com and check it out.  In fact, do a trial booking. Just see, you know, compare it to other sites.  See what you get. I think you're going to be really pleased with the results.  There's no need to spend time with a long, you know, elaborate list of choices and prices.  Upsiding instantly finds the best six flights and hotels you get to choose.  By the way, no mysteries. You get to choose the hotel by name, airline by name, flight time.  You still get all your frequent flyer miles and everything.  They have great 24 7 concierge level customer service.  You can call them, you can email them, you can chat with them or reach them on social.  And that is before, during and after every trip.  So that's really nice to have that a good.  That's one of the things a good travel agent gives you someone to call if the flight, you know, got delayed or.  You know, got delayed or canceled.  If you're a frequent business traveler, your company is going to save a ton of money and you are going to get a gift card worth one to even $300.  Now, when we do it because we're paying for the travel, we just apply the gift card right there to the cost of the flight or the cost of the hotel.  We actually so you can apply it directly.  But if you're doing it, you know, you know, because your company makes you do it, you get to keep the gift card.  You actually get even even more with overseas trips.  You'll get the gift card via email within 72 hours after booking.  You don't have to wait till you travel.  There's no limit on trips or gift cards.  And the gift cards are for a variety of different businesses.  Target Nordstrom, Amazon, 50 different brands.  They even have a hub where you can keep track of your gift cards.  This is just a win for everybody all around.  Book your business travel at upside dot com.  By the way, use a promo code twig when you do it.  That'll let them know you heard it here, which is good for us.  And it'll guarantee you $100 minimum gift card on your first trip.  Save big on travel and get a big gift card every trip.  Minimum purchase required.  See site for complete details offer code T W I G.  This is all we use now.  Once we discovered this, it was like and I did get to talk.  I was actually I said, can you know, before we do the ads, can I talk to Jay and Jay is like such a character.  And I said, was was William Shatner your idea for the Priceline ads?  He said, yes, it was. Yes, it was.  That was like in 1999 or something.  Two thousand. And and I said.  Bill owes you a great debt because it made him the hippiest guy in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It really it was great for Bill and obviously great for Priceline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This isn't Priceline, it's upside. It's Jay's newest and it's awesome.  Let's see. And who knew that Bill Shatner could do karate, right?  Or sort of.  So Stacey has a little obsession and I don't blame her.  And it's something we call Internet freedom.  Thank goodness Congress has decided to vote for Internet freedom.  Just seeing if that will set her off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's just this is just a bill proposal and people propose bills all the time.  But you'll notice that my two senators from Texas, home of AT&T, are the Restore Internet Freedom Act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What does it do? It makes sure the FCC will never again.  Thank you, Mitch McConnell, Marco Rubio.  Thank you, Tom Cotton. Thank you, Ted Cruz.  Thank you, Mike Lee. Thank you, Rand Paul.  We'll never again try to enforce net neutrality.  That's freedom. Freedom if you're a big ISP anyway.  Not so much for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's so tough about this story is, holy cow.  I mean, having complained about this forever and tried to cover it forever.  This is such a hard sell to normal people.  Like you look at the hubbub, right?  Rightly so about ACA and health insurance issues.  People are like that. People get that.  And the Senate is still the Senate and the House are still trying to cram something that what looks to be like many Americans are not in favor of.  But when it comes to net neutrality, this is it is so hard to make this fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I kind of blame Tim Wu because it's the worst possible name.  They should say I'm against Internet discrimination or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. But the case. So here's the deal.  The carriers are these people have been lobbying the governments like AT&T and Verizon for over 100 years.  This is not a new game for them.  They have buried it for the long haul.  And so, you know, originally we talked about discrimination and then people got mad because how can you talk about how can you define  what discrimination is, especially on our networks?  We know what it is. So people tried to get away from that because the words became tainted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So neutral, safer. You're going to be neutral.  Net neutrality means you're not going to weigh in on the bits.  All bits are equal.  Right.  Now Ted Cruz says net neutrality is Obamacare for the Internet.  What the hell does that even mean?  What does it even mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A great soundbite.  Obamacare for the Internet.  What does that even mean?  Well, a lot of people like Obamacare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But no, it's clear that the word Obama applied to anything will make it bad.  So this Restoring Internet Freedom Act, by the way, you're right.  It's not a bill yet. It's just perhaps a bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it would probably just call it trickle down Internetnomics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I'll say it again. I said it last week.  Mito-nomics.  This really, when somebody said this, I saw a tweet. I wish I could give the guy credit.  He said, net neutrality, what the FCC tried to do does not regulate the Internet.  It regulates companies called Internet Service Providers who want to break the Internet.  It tells them you may not break the Internet.  It is not Internet regulation. It's not saying what can happen on the Internet.  It's saying companies who provide Internet to people shall not.  Now, this is the opposite.  And this is where, you know, we're really in an Orwellian, actually, what is it, 1984, where, you know,  peace is war and truth is beauty. Lies and truth.  This is, this is, this is, what do they call that? Speak.  Double speak.  What is it? Double speak. This is double speak.  This is not the Restoring Internet Freedom Act.  This is the Restoring the Rights of Internet Service Providers to Gouge You Act.  It would prohibit, it would nullify the open Internet order,  and it would prohibit the FCC from ever issuing a similar ruling.  Now, remember, I did say that it's up to, I want, what happened?  The Internet's been nullified.  My screen is black now.  Wait, this isn't episode 404 yet. What's happening?  You know, I did say last week Congress has to decide, not the FCC.  It's appropriate to say, Congress, what do you think?  And I think if they made this a bill, they might see some opposition on the floor of the House and the Senate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, what really stuck in their craw the last time was that after,  was Tom Wheeler kind of being a little wishy washy on whether or not he was going to implement Title II.  He was.  He was. And then I think it was, I'm not sure if the timeline totally meshes up,  if it was John Oliver's, you know, dingo speech that really did things.  Or, but at some point in time, the White House did come in and say,  hey, look, a lot of people are really upset about this.  This is this is becoming an issue.  Can we look at this? And then Wheeler did look at Title II.  But before then, he had people on his staff who were already advocating for Title II.  And this was not this was not a foreign proposal.  It's just one that he was like, I'm not really that into it.  Can we do it in some other way? This is going to cause a lot because he knew the drama.  Yeah, he was right to try to find another way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But there was no other way. And then the judge told him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And so, yeah, if we want if we want Congress to go back and deal with the Telecommunications Act.  But right now it feels like all we are doing in Congress, and this has been this way for a while.  I'm not going to blame it just on this administration.  We're just like. We're fighting back against a status quo that is ancient.  And any time we try to move a step forward, we're just making these stupid knee jerk laws to like put us back.  I just it's so frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, as as this is our particular bailiwick net neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And of course, I have a big stake in it.  You all have a big stake in it because we are we provide content on the Internet.  And if you know, this is why we care if Comcast were to say Netflix isn't going to count against your band your bandwidth cap.  And Comcast has, I think, draconian bandwidth caps.  A terabyte doesn't sound like a lot of is not much.  That sounds like a lot. It's not.  If Comcast were to say, oh, good news, Netflix will not count against your bandwidth cap.  But Twit would. And that in its very essence is net neutrality, you know, non non neutrality.  Then it would be harmful to me and my business.  I the twit exists because you can get bits from the Internet of easily.  Right. And so does search engine land.  So does marketing engine land. So does the IOT podcast.  So does you know, so we are very much impacted by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And as you much more efficient as a Republican, you would think having to go and do a separate deal with every ISP to make sure your bits made it to the end consumer is time consuming.  It's expensive, et cetera.  So it doesn't even pass the efficiency test from that perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would love to see Congress take this up.  Let's take up this stupid Freedom Act because I think that we would then write to our members of Congress as we've shown that we're capable of doing.  We showed it. Tom Wheeler was convinced by more than a million comments on title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got a car yesterday. It was fastened. It wasn't Uber or Lyft.  Those are not in Austin. But my driver, I was talking to the driver and he's he was going out of the country.  He said, yeah, you know, I'm really upset right now about net neutrality.  I was like, tell me more about your thoughts here.  I couldn't believe I was having a conversation with a normal person and they brought it up.  Not me. It's very exciting for me.  Good. Kind of scared of a little with my passion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And people who watch this should be should be and I would love to see Congress take this up.  I would love to see Congress not only take this up, but also look at taking up improving the competitive landscape among Internet service providers.  Because part of the reason this is an issue is you don't have choice.  I mean, we're lucky here. It's we have Sonic Net as our provider.  Sonic doesn't have bandwidth caps, fights, you know, do all the things right.  So we have an Internet service provider that believes in that neutrality.  But but at home, I don't have that choice.  And most people in this country don't have the choice that 86 percent of Internet users in the United States have two Internet service providers to choose from.  Their cable company and their phone company, neither of which in the big in the case of the big companies, support neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I try to think if there was a way to do it where you likened it to getting phone calls, I just have to play with the metaphor a lot more.  But like, you know, one way of describing it is as if you were to say to someone, hey,  Telemarketers going to be able to call you all they want, and it's not going to use any of your minutes for phone.  But if if people, you know, in love want to call you, it's going to cost them a lot more money.  Good analogy. You know, and people, I think would be like, what do you mean?  It's going to cost them a lot more money just to call my phone number.  It's not like a paid. Well, you know, they haven't paid us.  So we have to charge them more or whatever.  So, you know, there may be some ways of playing with it along like that, because, you know, in terms of how people think of it as utilities are the same thing.  Sorry, but it goes to the same thing with the privacy stuff.  It's like the ISP I'm buying, like I'm buying my electricity.  I'm not expecting then that like my data gets sold to telemarketers.  I'm not expecting that if I want to buy electricity that I'm going to have to pay less if I use a certain appliance, you know,  or I have to pay more if I want to use an appliance, not because the appliance is inefficient.  But can you imagine like can you imagine if you had a house and you're like, well, I want to put in all Whirlpool appliances and they're like, oh, you're going to use Whirlpool appliances?  We're going to charge you twice as much for electricity.  And you're like, why they use the same electricity is like another appliance.  Well, we don't have a deal with Whirlpool.  Like, I don't care. You don't have a deal with Whirlpool or not.  I'm buying electricity from you. What I what I want to put into it doesn't make a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the consumer won't actually even see those tradeoffs because someone like Leo has to make them.  And he's probably going to you can't pass the cost of Internet content exactly down to the users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, because I'm free. Well, so and you are too.  And frankly, so is Danny. So how could we do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, we're screwed. It's Farhad Manju in the Times did a column where he was trying to frame it as an issue of consumers versus big corporations, which that's I mean, at its clearest.  That is what it is. But we're arguing for consumers.  We're arguing that they were arguing in favor of something they haven't seen yet.  They don't know that there's a problem against the unknowns.  So you might not get the hottest, coolest new service.  Snapchat might not exist and people are like, ah, Snapchat exists. I'm cool.  So it's a very hard thing. And yeah, I.  I can't believe we're here again. Again, see, this is my theme for the show.  How did I get here again? Why is this happening?  Stacey rewind. This is the show. I realize I've lived all of this before and I didn't enjoy the first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, we have. Well, as you point out, it is not an official bill yet.  It is a proposal. Well, it says they submitted legislation. They submitted legislation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But, you know, you remind me again how a bill becomes a law.  I don't. If you find sponsor enough sponsors, you can get nine sponsors, nine senators.  Yes, yes. And then then they're going to have to vote on it and then or does it go to committee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then it goes to committee first and then the committee says, and I'm off to committee and I'm standing online with a lot of other bills just to bide my time.  I didn't pay attention to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, I'm just a bill on Capitol Hill came after reading.  What was it? It was a came after Schoolhouse Rock came after my time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what? Play this. I was going to say play it, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to because I'm sure it's on a bill. I showed it to my daughter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sure it's on YouTube. Right. Well, I hope and pray that I will.  But today I am still just a bill. Hey, Bill, now you're a law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here we go, ladies and gentlemen, Schoolhouse Rock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you sure got to climb a lot of steps to get this capital building here in Washington.  Well, I wonder who that sad little scrap of paper is. Who is that sad little scrap of paper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I'm only a bill and I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill.  Well, it's a long, long journey to the capital city.  It's a long, long wait while I'm sitting in committee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I know I'll be a law someday. At least I hope and pray that I will.  But today I am still just a bill. Hey, Bill, you certainly have a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know what? I have never seen that. Oh, it's I know it because everybody of your age sings.  I'm just a bill on Capitol Hill. It taught you so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It did. It does. If only more people could learn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, now I know it's got to get out of committee, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We got to find the Schoolhouse Rocks people and have them do a song about net neutrality.  John Oliver did the best one, right? That's the one.  But that was like a six minute effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And a lot of work. And you know, he's obviously a raging liberal, so I can't trust him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's not authoritative by Google standards, not by my standards, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can't trust that man. He's all for regulation, government regulation.  All right. Enough. We got the point.  Make keep in touch with your Congress critter.  And when they have it open for comment yet, Ajit Pai's proposal.  But when they do, we will let you know exactly how.  And the other place to go and stay on top of this is EFF.org, the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Right on the front page. The FCC wants to eliminate net neutrality.  We can't let that happen. They will tell you everything you need to know.  These are great people. It's the number one nonprofit defending digital privacy, free speech and innovation.  And they're nonpartisan. But they really, you know, they tell you how you can get involved.  Don't surrender the Internet. And this is really good.  This is really good. Email your representatives. Better yet, call them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Call them. Always call. It's easy. I'll even call mine, even though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is Ted Cruz your, he's one of your senators. Who's the other one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, both John Cornyn and Ted Cruz are my, they're both sponsors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're both sponsors. Isn't that nice? Isn't that special?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know, I call them all the time. I even call my representative who sent us a letter saying that, you know,  he's actually OK with what Trump's doing in every aspect of his administration. I still call them.  It's really, I don't know. I was about to say hopeless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I feel like it's Sisyphean. I feel like it's almost out of our control at this point.  And sometimes I kind of wish that, you know, they could get everything they want so they could see how crappy life would be.  That happened. But then we're stuck with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you see, you see that in, what is it, Kansas? There have been some lovely stories written about it.  Oh yeah, Kansas is a good example. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, when they get everything they want. Anyway, anyway. Hey, let's talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's talk about why I just got a Google Pixel and it won't let me choose Hangouts as my default messaging app.  Why? Why can't you use Hangouts? I don't know, because it's a Google Fi phone and Google Fi text messages come in as Hangouts,  but they apparently don't want me to use it to send out as a message. I have to use Android Messenger or Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There was a bug with that. I don't think it's a bug. I think this is the new thing.  Are you a Google Voice user? Yes. I've got a Google. And this is a Google Fi. This is a Fi phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to go on your Pixel. Hangouts on it just fine. I know, but no, no, I'm just saying go into apps, choose your default apps.  And it's you know where it says SMS app. What are your choices? Well, in my case, Facebook Messenger messages,  which is Android messages and Signal, because those are the three messaging apps I have installed, not Hangouts.  But what does making it the default do for you anyway? It means that if you send an SMS, it goes through Android messages.  And why wouldn't you send SMS from Hangouts? I can, but it's not the default. Yes, you can.  Just use Hangouts. If you send from Hangouts. No, no, on my dock, the Hangouts is the messaging app on my dock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So when you send from Hangouts, you're sending from Hangouts. So the problem is when you receive,  but if you've clicked on Google Voice, redirect anything from Google Voice to Hangouts, then it'll come into Hangouts.  It's a FIFI phone. It doesn't matter that it's a FIFI phone. That's just a SIM card. Right?  Well, I'm using Google Voice. No, I'm telling you that's how I'll fix it. That's how I fix it.  Switch from Hangouts to a new text messaging app. But you don't need to switch. You're happy with what you're doing.  I know, Google. Just use that. I don't have the little thing in front of me to show you,  but just go into Hangouts and make sure you've ticked going into Google Voice. I know, I know what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I know what you're doing. And I am and I still am. Text messages now come to both Android Messenger and Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I haven't had this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, go ahead and try it. Maybe you haven't updated the latest version of Android 7.1.2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Connect Hangouts and Google Voice, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no. Look in your phone. Look in your Pixel phone. You can no longer make Hangouts your default SMS app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess I never used it as my default. I never set it in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, all right. So you get your SMS messages in two places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know. It's confusing.  I have to go look. Google is Google's dropping SMS support from Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't go look right now. I'm on the phone. But that wasn't the same thing. But that was for Google Voice people.  And that's not for Google Voice. No, five people were exempted. I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not a Google Voice person because I lost my stand. I am and I'm not.  If I go to watch, you know this. If you go to voice.google.com, watch. Go ahead. Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You have to log out of Google Voice. It brings you to Project PHY.  It's a freak nightmare. If you have Google Voice on one account and you have Google PHY or PHY as I like to call it.  Why?  On another account, you can never be logged in. You got to totally log out of that Google PHY account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I don't want to log out. I'm using Google PHY.  What do you care on Google PHY on the web?  Because this is how I see my billing and my thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, just open it up in an incognito tab.  Or why are you going to Google Voice anyway on the web? You only need to do it once.  I have Google Hangouts on my desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You sound like you're, I think you, have you ever heard of Stockholm Syndrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I know. Oh, do not get me going on Google.  And the nightmare that it is with Google Voice and just even when they rolled out the new app, it was a piece of crap because it looks cleaner.  But do you want to send animated gifts with Goot Gboard?  No, you don't get to do that with Google. So I'm like back on Google Hangouts.  And I would abandon Google Voice and Google Handouts and all the mess that they've got out there.  No one knows what they're doing. And like you say, you try to go to Google PHY.  I'm sorry, you're going to Google Voice, but you are Google PHY on another account.  You could never, ever go. You're like, oh my God, what is wrong with you?  I guess I do get them started.  Why at this point can't I have a Google PHY account with a Google account that is like a Google Docs work, whatever Gboard, whatever they're calling the news stuff, G Suite.  Got a G Suite account? No Google PHY for you. Why? I don't know. We're Google.  We can't handle the fact that people who pay us money to have services can't actually get to use all the services we'll give everybody else for free.  So, yeah, I have some issues with Google and their big messed up thing.  But I've worked around and as best as I can because, you know, when I was in Japan, I turned on my Google PHY phone.  I had Internet and it worked and I had Google Voice so I could still get phone calls from the US and I could send out messages.  And that was very convenient. So I live with it. I endure it just for those occasional overseas trips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, Danny, that felt really cathartic.  I enjoyed that a lot. I mean, I kind of want like a T-shirt of you doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it is embarrassing though, because Google Voice is such a great service, has potential to be such a great service.  And they've just shoved it off into nowhere land. And you're just like, what is wrong?  And my only guess is because they just don't think they can make any money off of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I ask everybody this. I go down the street. I asked the guy in the 7-Eleven.  What's going on with Google's messaging strategy? Do you know, Danny? Because Stacey and I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I usually say, well, if you buy a slushie, we could talk about net neutrality.  Why don't they just launch an app, call it Messenger, because everybody else gets to call their apps generic names or call it Google Messenger and roll everything into one and make it work.  I don't need Allo over here and Hangouts over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Allo would make actually a very nice default messaging app.  I have to think there's some external force being applied here, maybe antitrust regulations or something.  Maybe they're worried about the EU or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I try to so hard though, because it's not like they have any huge stake on the messaging platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe it's carrier pushback. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know. But it's a mess. And if they launch at IO another messaging app, I'm going to lose my.  I can't wait to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google IOs coming up. It's only a few weeks out. I will be there. Jeff Jarvis will be there. Stacey, you're not going to IO this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not. I'm supposed to be here. I think I might be hosting your live chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That would be awesome. I was going to ask you to do that. That's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, Carsten's already on it.  Good. And we'll be sitting in the audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And maybe we'll call afterwards. We'll be part of TWIG.  And I think we're actually we have a room at Google.  Chris DeBona is helping us again this year.  So we can that we can after the keynote, go over to the room and do this week in Google.  Because it's Wednesday, right? The keynote's Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you going to pull on interesting Google people into the room? You should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Last year we got Matt Cutts in. I don't think he's around on campus anymore.  By the way, does anybody know? I know Matt. Where in the world is Matt Cutts?  Right. I know he is the interim director of the government data service or whatever they call it.  But U.S. data service. But what exactly is he? Is he digital services? Is he still there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is he doing anything? He can tell you, but he would have to kill you.  And by kill you, I mean metaphorically with all the Internet data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I asked Carsten and Tonya to reach out to Matt and say, are you still doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's still there. Is he still doing there? Yeah, that's got to be a thankless task.  Well, you know, I think he sees it as I'm doing good work for America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Didn't the president just announce that he's got a new technology board to advising him?  And he's asked everybody, including Google, to be on it.  No word yet about whether anybody is going to be on it.  I think Jared's going to run that board too.  Jared's in charge, man. He's the guy who can do it all.  Elon, maybe. I don't know.  There is the Business Advisory Council, but there's now a Technology Advisory Council.  There it is. To transform and modernize U.S. government.  Did nobody tell him that Matt Cutts is over in the basement with the U.S. digital service with that mission?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if it's the same kind of mission, but maybe it is. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And Code for America and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I get the impression that people over in that basement are just keeping their heads down, hoping no one notices them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just please continue our funding.  Yeah.  All right. Let's talk about Google's Alphabets, I should say, results.  The results are in. Google's growth in advertising, the ad business was what, 18%?  I have to pull it up because I'm doing this from memory. Alphabet, quarterly results.  But what's interesting is the other businesses.  So advertising is its primary business, obviously, but other businesses were also doing pretty well, including, I think, the Pixel Phone.  Let me see. Here we go. Alphabet earnings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Didn't the guy in charge of Pixel Phone leave?  Yes, he left. He was only there six months.  Okay.  He said...  That did happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Job done. Have fun. And he left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does have a new name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Pixel? Yeah, he changed the name. That was it.  Mobile Search. Big, big, big. Ongoing strength. YouTube driving ad sales higher. Sales on Google Play, hardware and cloud.  That's the other. Growing substantially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's so tiring hearing about Mobile Search at this point. It's almost as if we're in 2001 and they're going...  Mobile Search is search.  Web Search is big. We know that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Advertising revenue up from 18 billion to 21 billion year over year. Net income up to...this is in three months, kids.  $5.43 billion. That's up from 4.2 billion a year ago. Nice little bit of growth there. $1.2 billion.  They made an extra $400 million a month.  And every geography, revenues up in the US, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Pacific, Alphabet, traffic acquisition costs in the Google network.  Wow, this is interesting. What is that, Danny? Traffic acquisition costs, $4.63 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's the amount of money that they pay to AdSense people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So that's their outbound AdSense. That's a lot of money. That's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If they made more money off of it. I think one of the big charts I saw was that their percentage of income that they're generating off of their network continues to go down.  Whereas the amount of money they're making off of their owned and operated properties is going up. So they're becoming less dependent on the web as a whole.  Or they're just figuring out ways to make even more money off of their own sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Other bets. That's Google Fiber. This is all the stuff Ruth Porat cut. Google Fiber, Nest, Waymo, the Life Sciences Division, and Venture Capital Investing.  Now, I wish they'd break that out because I'm thinking it's probably Venture Capital made the most money. But revenue was up from $165 million a year ago to $244 million.  Profits? No. Revenue? Yes. Profits didn't.  Fiber's expensive.  It's expensive. They're not making any money on it. But there's money coming in. There's just more money going out.  Somebody I know, I think it's Alex Wilhelm, characterizes that as how much it cost them to generate the $224 million.  And it cost them well over a billion dollars to create that $244 million revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that makes sense because there are other bets. Yeah.  Well, not just other bets, but those are physical goods. I mean, cost of goods sold is a legitimate thing. And then in telco, your capex is huge.  I mean, so anyway, I like physical stuff. Yes. I'm like, yay. Yes. But it's a crummy business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Alphabet spends the vast majority of its money running its search business, which drives 99% of the revenue.  But they also spent four point last year, $4.4 billion on other bets. Google Ventures, Google Fiber, Calico, which is the how to live forever company, Verily, which is the glucose sensing contact lens company, NEST.  You know what NEST is. And then something I hadn't heard of, Capital G, which is... Isn't that the new name for Google Ventures? Oh, maybe Capital G.  So does Google have an additional R&D department? No, X is the R&D, right? That's the moonshots, right? Isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, because if you look at this like R&D expenditures, it's fairly in line. I mean, corporate, between five and 10% of revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You see, if I look at this graph, I think this is previous quarter, but or maybe, oh, no, this is last year. You see this graph that the red part, the little tiny red parts, that's other bets.  So it is. It's a fraction of the total revenue and costs. What Danny, is there a search engine R&D? There must be. They've got to try stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I, you know, yes, but to the degree that it's broken out from other stuff, I don't know. I really don't know.  I mean, you get things like they would have RankBrain that came out of their artificial artificial intelligence group, and that's all kind of R&D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would think AI and ML would be a big R&D expenditure. Voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, that might be an investment in product. You could look at that as an investment in product development though, easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of course you could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I mean, a lot of the techniques they're using, they're not. It's not at the research level anymore.  Even even stuff like computer vision and neural network type stuff that's actually been established for a while.  We just didn't have the compute power to actually make it widely applicable for a reasonable amount.  I don't know. I mean, I'm not an expert in like R&D and what's classified as that, but those don't feel that feels not crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nice growth, though, overall. Increase in revenues year over year, 22%.  Pretty nice. Operating margin, 27%.  Get this though, effective tax rate. It's up. It was 18%. They now pay 20% in taxes.  How much do you and I pay in taxes? A little more than that.  A lot.  A little bit more. I would love a 20% tax rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to hide more of it in Ireland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think I got to get that Irish subsidiary that Irish, Twit Ireland got to get that going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will go. I volunteer to go set up your studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, yeah. OK, we'll give you the license for all the shows and we'll send all the income over to Twit Ireland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we could hire people with Irish accents.  Oh, they all talk like that. That would be wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, you'd love that. And she likes it too.  I'll be like, you're an Irish spring country all the time.  I can't wait. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook opens up 360 degree live streaming to everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the next time you murder somebody, you could do it in 360.  That's tasteless. That was really tasteless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bad. OK. But you come on, a minute. You were thinking that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I actually wasn't. OK.  Now I am. You're right. Now you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speaking of that, Facebook is hiring another 3000 people to pull down violent and inappropriate content.  I think it's going to work. That's one of those things you feel like people can't solve the problem.  It's too far, too big. And I feel like what a horrible job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, it is. And we know people who do that.  And you can only do it for a few months.  It wears on you.  And then you and then you have to confess how terrible it is to ours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Technica. And then somebody that you told that you told the article, someone that you told you told ours.  Technica about it tells Google and then you get fired.  Yeah, exactly. You know, the story happens every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, some people enjoy it.  We know somebody who does this. And she says, I just get, you know, you get used to it.  It's just another day at the office. I like surfing Facebook, she says.  Wow. Well, you know, cops get used to seeing all kinds of crazy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it doesn't it doesn't wear on them psychically.  I don't know. I feel like some cops it does.  OK, let's see. What else do we have?  Anything else that's super exciting? That's super exciting.  I was looking at the rundown from six weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So let's let's let's let's start over.  Going back at the time. Yeah, I thought those were kind of old stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Google might start its own might start its own job search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. We've had them testing some stuff that's been showing up.  What do you think of this thing?  So Twitter did not get the NFC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What do you think of this thing? So Twitter did not get the NFL this year,  but they are now launching a Twitter Live feed that will include lots of stuff,  including some sports, some technology.  And Nili Patel is going to do a weekly gadget show.  Bloomberg will be there.  Bloomberg has appeared the past on that Twitter Live and Live Nation.  Live Nation BuzzFeed, the WNBA.  Do you go to do you go to Twitter.com to watch TV?  Is that what people are doing these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do not. I mean, the only thing I would go to Twitter maybe to watch TV  with commentary on like the Oscars or maybe but not really.  I mean, like Twitter is my second screen when I'm watching television.  If I want to do TV in Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When I want to watch TV, I go to TV, but I'm really old.  You are so old fashioned. But the young people today,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think the young people today maybe aren't against I can't for some reason play video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can see it like I didn't get the NFL thing, but then I hate football.  So who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I love football and I still wouldn't watch it on Twitter.  It's like, I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like if I've been out and there was one of the debates were going on,  I'm hitting Twitter to see what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's maybe different. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I get the live feed.  So I mean, I guess there's potential there, you know, throwing things against the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oscars. I would have paid money actually to see the Met costume.  Yeah. So that's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They need to find content that is not on your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  Because because getting my, you know, obviously I could see things happening,  but getting the commentary in real life and it needs to be bigger.  I mean, like right now I go to Twitter and I'm seeing a live a live soccer game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the CONCAF U17 knockout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, I'm really sorry, but I've got to jump off now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's right. Danny, I'm sorry. Sorry, Danny.  I'm really, really sorry.  You know, before you go, do you have a pick you want to share with us?  Anything you're excited about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, Google's got this new thing where you can get your recipes read to you through Google Home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Have you tried it yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I tried it and it wasn't working, but it wasn't showing up for me yet.  So I'm still keeping an eye on it.  And how does it pause when you pause like you'll do a search, say,  send this recipe to Google Home and then Google Home is supposedly supposed to read the recipe to you and stop.  So I don't know. I'm going to check it out.  But, you know, it might be worth checking out if you're as soon as I can get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How is it rolling out? Is it slowly rolling out or is it just not here yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, my wife cooks a lot and I told her about it.  She says, I don't want Google telling me how to cook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, no, I would love it. I would love it.  No, that would be great if it would say, OK, now use an electric mixer and combine the cream cheese, honey, milk and lemon zest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If they manage to get Delia Smith recipes, I think she'll change her mind on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See, imagine if it was Delia's voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anyway, I'm really sorry.  See you, Danny. Thank you.  Bye, Danny.  You guys have a good run to the show.  Bye bye.  OK, bye bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We also heard that Alexa will soon be able to whisper, leap out swear words and change its pitch.  Did you play the whisper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  You got to play the whisper.  It's on.  Here it is. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ready?  Alexa whispering a post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Amazon is trying to make its Alexa voice assistant sound for you.  Oh my God, it's so awful.  The female sounding voice may even even monitor cadence whenever speaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You wouldn't want it for a long time, but a little bit.  The password is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like every head in the room wouldn't turn around when it would be like, oh my God, is Satan over there in the corner speaking?  What's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We've had I mean, ever since I've seen synthesized voice, there's been markup that you could add to synthesize voice to make it sound more natural.  But it's nice that Amazon's allowing developers to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and bleeping out swear words is nice as someone who has a child who is morally.  Where would you swear words?  But they pop up.  What?  Like they pop up in like results sometimes.  Like if you're OK, so but I don't.  Yeah, but see, I don't think that that's what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is gives you a markup language for the results coming back from your query, whether you know, like, OK, I play Jeopardy.  Right. And but actually, that's not a good example because it doesn't use the echo voice.  It would be something that uses 20 questions.  It uses the echo voice and then you could simulate a bleep.  But it doesn't.  After the fact bleep content, you know what I'm saying?  It's not like you'd be listening to Wikipedia entries and it would bleep it.  It's the developer that has to put the bleeping in.  Ah, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I misunderstood that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's kind of like, you know, it's like it's like this the strikethrough markup in HTML.  It's it's you can use it as for an effect, I guess.  Got it.  All right. That's cool.  But that'd be good for recipes.  I'm going to tell you what to do next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or getting getting that murder advice when you're.  Fill the hot tub up to the highest level.  I think I just like whispers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and she was a little bit that was like a little bit.  That was a creepy whisper.  A drill in your ear.  Yeah, it hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not used to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right. Now it's just you and me.  So let's talk about Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, I was like Tesla or IOT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can do IOT. We'll do IOT.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's do Tesla first.  What's the Tesla stuff?  I didn't scroll down that far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Tesla trucks coming.  OK.  Consumer Reports Mark Tesla down because in the hardware to platform,  many of the things that you and I have.  Well, you don't have autopilot, but many of the things people with hardware,  one platform, the original hardware platform who had autopilot,  were used to things like the car would stop before it hits something automatically.  Yes.  They took that out in hardware to because they didn't have confidence in hardware to,  which I would be mad if I bought a Tesla.  I think it started in October.  I'd be kind of angry.  It didn't do a lot of the things that my older Tesla did.  Anyway, Consumer Reports lowered its rating saying this is dangerous.  And so Tesla rolled out an update.  They fixed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I was going to say auto breaking is a feature in a lot of luxury cars.  I remember a friend of my test driving my Tesla and he he actually was trying to drive into a wall before I was OK.  Hey, it doesn't have that.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, hey, hold on.  You know, it's not just luxury cars now.  I've been seeing ads for Subarus or something that does it as well.  Oh, yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there is a car.  I don't know.  I thought it was an Audi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe.  Well, Audi's my Audi had that.  No, actually, though, it was I don't think it would stop.  The test was actually stop.  Right.  I believe so.  They try to stop.  Yeah, they make the attempt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I was excited about the boring tunnels stuff.  Did you see the boring video?  I was like, yes.  This is science fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is not going to happen.  Is it any more science fiction than the Neuralink stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's pretty science fictiony too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the idea is that because because Elon got Elon got.  He was really pissed off because he drives from he drives from the Tesla headquarters in L.A. to the Tesla headquarters in L.A.  To the SpaceX headquarters and the traffic's bad.  What a shock.  So he imagined the idea.  What if we had tunnels and now so a car pull the Tesla pulls up to an elevator, which is a parking space, which, by the way.  OK, let me just pause this for a second.  The car goes down in an elevator.  Is there a big hole in the street now where that car was?  And is somebody going to drive into it and crush me?  Inquiring minds want to know.  So it goes down in the elevator.  OK, they quickly close the door on the elevator.  But quickly enough, again, inquiring minds want to know.  It goes down in the elevator and then the elevator continues onto the tunnel.  You don't get to drive in the tunnel.  You get to ride in a little carrier that you whiz through the tunnel and get where you're going at upwards of what was it?  One hundred two hundred kilometers, one hundred twenty four miles an hour.  But really, are are we going to?  Oh, and there's like there's a bus.  See that?  You could get on a bus, too.  But seriously, are we really?  Is this really?  There's no way we're drilling giant holes underneath L.A.  You can only imagine they see how they switch away before you see the hole in the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and it would have to be another platform like sliding in for delivery, too, because otherwise.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, we just got a hole in the ground.  Anyway, it doesn't matter because you know what?  It's science fiction, science fiction.  Oh, we're not there yet.  It's just like Robert Heinlein's conveyor belt sidewalks.  Oh, I remember that.  Remember that the roads must roll.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Make it so.  If you were in an airport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you were wondering, as you might have listening to this show, how we feel about the intelligence of our federal government, in particular the Senate.  Senate staffers ID cards don't have smart chips.  They have pictures of smart chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, I think that's kind of brilliant.  I'm like, I mean, it's the equivalent of sticking an ADT lawn lawnside in your yard without having any security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Money give give a little bit.  I mean, we are all about security theater.  I see that this just falls right in line with that.  So but that's just me.  I'm just cynical as all get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I printed a picture of the chip on it.  If you're a Senate employee, it's just a picture, not a chip, just a really come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And by the way, it's really not great security since everybody now knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yes, now now they're going to have to like pay up to Jamal to or whomever to get their chips.  What the what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Crazy talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hulu has launched his TV service.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Live TV service.  Forty dollars.  This is a YouTube has thirty five, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you have things who do.  Who has things other Hulu?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It has all the other Hulu stuff like Fargo.  No, what is that?  What did I pay?  Oh, handmaids, those on handmaid tail.  I had to buy a hulu for that is very good.  It's a little dark.  Well, yeah, it is.  It is very good.  I agree.  It's not fluffy.  It's not fluffy.  Here's here's the deal.  Over the top TV packages, I never heard of Fubo TV.  Maybe not the best name, but there's sling YouTube Direct TV now, which is the AT&T product Hulu live PlayStation view.  It's a little Hulu live is it's up there.  It's the same cost as PlayStation food, but you get 60 channels and I guess you get live locals.  Depends where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess, you know, if you look at this as the disaggregation of the TV or the triple play or the guess the triple play.  I mean, basically, they're taking that revenue from the cable guys, presumably.  I don't think they're actually yet.  But when we see that, I'm like, I keep wondering, do we have as consumers between one hundred and fifty and one hundred and eighty dollars a month allocated to broadband and television in our brains?  We've already split out right own and pay a lot more right for wireless.  Right. So are we going to split out TV and end up paying more for it?  And then broadband is like one hundred and twenty bucks for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Does that mean I think that's where you're headed, right?  Well, I hope not.  So Hulu does not have Viacom, which means it doesn't have AMC, The Walking Dead.  Hulu is owned by Disney, 21st Century Fox, Comcast and Time Warner.  So there's lots of sports.  Yes, PN is, of course, a Time Warner Fox Sports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it was Disney. I'm sorry, Disney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're right. Disney's in their last two.  Yeah, it's Disney. You're right. Absolutely.  But AMC Viacom and other programmers apparently talking about they're doing their own sports free version of Hulu.  Well, there you go.  And as far as local affiliates, they have some, but not every market.  They say they will have every market.  In the coming months. Most of those deals will get made in the coming months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like there's so much on and I'm again, this is just me being old and maybe not working in an office with people,  but I'm OK waiting to see the shows I'm excited about or I just I just buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the truth, though. You can, for instance, Fargo, if you can't watch it on FX now, you know it will be available for purchase soon.  FX actually often does it in the original run simultaneously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I'm watching the Americans right now.  Season five. I just I bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I kind of am willing to pay for it if it's not too expensive because it's usually like $29 for a season because there's no ads.  And. You know, you can't binge watch it till the season is over, but it would be nice if you could just binge watch it now and get it over with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this season is a little slow, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is. You've got to wait a week between shows. What are we talking?  Is this 1992? What are we talking here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like like my daughter tells me, I would hate to be one of those families who has to watch TV shows when they're on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, when I was a kid, we had to wait till Thanksgiving to see The Wizard of Oz.  You probably don't even remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't. I'm like, OK, yeah, everything.  Your childhood was rough. I was hanging around the campfire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And Danny K would have to come on every time and say, now it's going to start in black and white, but it's going to be in color every time.  Actually, I think they recorded that once and they just stuck it at the beginning every time.  All right. Your chance to talk about the Internet of Things.  What's the latest news in the IOT sphere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this actually came out, I think it was last late last week, maybe Thursday, but CloudFlare, which is that a sponsor?  Is that what that says? We love CloudFlare.  I'm like, is that what that is?  So they introduced an IOT security product called Orbit.  And I was kind of keen on this because I'm sitting here thinking about how do we secure the Internet of Things.  And I've liked CloudFlare forever.  I just think it's really interesting.  There you go. Yes.  I was like, I like them before I even worked for you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So we talked a little bit yesterday on Security Now about this.  And Steve was not completely clear what they were planning to do.  But it sounds like this CloudFlare product is for IOT providers, not end users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is. OK. So I talked to Matthew Prince because I was like, what the heck is this?  Because all the coverage was kind of not.  It didn't tell me anything.  So they're trying to basically.  OK. You know, CloudFlare works by you direct your servers to their servers and then they they absorb everything.  So the idea is you do the same thing if you're in it only works for manufacturers.  And you build this into your product where your product goes through CloudFlare's servers.  So what it prevents is things like like Matthew Prince over at CloudFlare told me that it would prevent something like Marai because the basically once it's detecting malicious activity,  it stops things from it stops it from going to your devices.  Right. So your devices aren't going to be sending stuff out.  They're not going to be downloading malicious stuff.  So this isn't an end all be all panacea.  This is just one extra layer of security.  It's very limited because right now, if if you want to secure device, you have to do it.  The manufacturer has to do it, not the users.  So like you and I who have our crappy network DVR or SOL, that's that we can't secure that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that's really always been the problem is that these these Chinese companies don't care and they don't secure their stuff.  And they're the last ones that are going to pay for CloudFlare to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we as consumers don't care.  We don't pay for it.  Well, we don't pay for it.  I mean, security has become an externality in this business.  And that just like protecting the environment, that's going to have to change or it doesn't.  And we're all screwed either way.  These are our choices.  Wow. This show got so grim.  Do we have no it's not grim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's happy news that they're doing it is fantastic.  It's fantastic.  I'm so thrilled that we have this.  And I think what's going to happen, I believe what's going to happen with IoT.  And I think you've seen this.  This is this happens with a lot of things is that people get wise to it and they will start not buying the cheap Chinese knockoffs that don't work with anything else and bill it by stuff from responsible companies like Nest.  Don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I never I never underestimate the lure of the cheap something or other.  Here's what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  At some point, Amazon or Google, maybe it'll be Microsoft.  Maybe it'll be Apple is going to say you're going to be able to control your home.  You're going to be able to do it your voice.  Well, you can already do it with the Echo.  And by the way, we're only going to support secure devices.  So, you know, make if you want to use your Echo or your Google Home with your Internet of Things devices, look for the, you know, made for Google Home badge.  And Google will have an app store.  They will say, you know, we've vetted this.  It's secure.  I almost am certain that will happen in the next year as we get more and more IoT problems.  And we've had massive IoT break ins and issues.  And we need the kind of like we're used to app stores.  We're used to that notion.  And by the way, what a great revenue opportunity for somebody to have a Google Home store with all of the approved devices in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would hate to have this business model again.  I hate the bifurcation of the mobile OS ecosystem.  I don't really want to see it.  It already is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's already happened.  And in fact, it was almost invented by home automation with Zigbee and Z-Wave.  And, you know, it's just I mean, it's endless.  It's a tower of babble.  So this would in fact maybe help consumers.  It would help.  Yeah, you are right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just maybe I don't want Amazon dictating this.  I would much rather have it be truly industry wide with all of them working together.  But, you know, I also really like, you know, clean air and water.  So let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Any other IoT stuff in the news today?  Nothing that like.  That's a big one, I think.  And that to me is the example of in a way a forerunner of what I think is going to happen is you're going to have companies like CloudFlare get involved in this and help make IoT secure because otherwise it's not it's a nonstarter.  People aren't going to use these things because they're going to see what a problem it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, wait, I didn't see this last week and I feel like an idiot.  Sirius acquired automatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You didn't see it last week because it just happened.  No, it says it happened April 27.  But I don't think they announced it because I saw the story yesterday.  Okay.  We love another sponsor, Automatic.  They make those really great OBD2 dongles that you plug into your car and pair to your phone and you get all sorts of information.  It's an interesting buy for SiriusXM.  They spent over 100 million on it.  I'm not sure why they wanted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, Sirius has maybe they want to keep their position in the automobile.  Because that's important to them.  So they're going to start doing telematics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this data would be crucial to them and it gives them I guess a dongle in the car.  So yeah, I mean, it is kind of weird, but it's not crazy weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think I can understand that strategy.  Sirius has got to find something, right?  Because it's not a great business to be in.  Right.  So do telematics, do like the OnStar stuff.  And this would be a way to get that stuff working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you've got all this data that you can then sell to people and that's independent data providers that are credible.  Right.  Will be useful going forward because the car companies are like, I don't want to give all this to Google.  They're going to just build their own cars.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a happy story.  Here's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A drunk man arrested for knocking over the Silicon Valley crime fighting robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, A, I didn't know there was a Silicon Valley crime fighting robot.  So I was like, oh, delightful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this K5 is the robot.  It patrols parking lots.  OK, it wanders around.  It's got cameras on it.  Doesn't can't really do anything.  Along comes 41 year old Jason Sylvain, allegedly slightly intoxicated, and he kicked it over and scratched it, by the way.  So he's OK.  I mean, the bot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much is the robot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, God, can you imagine?  But anything people are expensive, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  And the good news is it really sit behind this desk.  I'm sorry.  I have so many questions about this robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know if I have answers.  This is this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is the same one that rolled over the toddler's foot.  You may remember a few months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know I have not seen this.  I remember being struck in the San Jose airport when I was walking through that they had robots all around.  And then I passed by like the little robot child care center and I was just it.  That's creepy.  People there.  But I was like, what?  What is happening?  I felt like such a disconnect, like Silicon Valley was just in this weird land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In the airport now, many restaurants have little humanoid robots about three or four feet tall with holding menus that you can talk to and make reservations with.  In the airport?  What airport?  Well, SFO, for one.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  What terminal?  I think it was SFO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It might have been Oakland, but it's in the Bay Area.  And it just stands there.  Where was that?  Was that in Oakland?  It was funny because I saw a kid playing with it and the kids.  OK, so this is interesting.  Kids have no respect for robots.  Apparently, there was an experiment in Japan where a robot was let loose to wander in a busy shopping mall and asked people, you know, to get out of the way.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  And the adults were very polite in Japan.  They got out of the way.  But the kids would kick it, punch it.  You're not the boss of me.  They would say, no, they were hurting the robot, which loudly protested, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have no respect for robots.  Remember that robot that I think was a Canadian sent it down just trying to hitchhike to the zombies?  Oh, that was so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it didn't make it across the US.  That wasn't really a robot.  That was just like, you know, a mob.  A mop bucket with a hand and some feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It didn't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it had silent said, please pick me up and take me to my next destination.  And then but yeah, it got beat up.  Yeah.  Humans are just jerks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What can we say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This was a study that was called Escaping from Children's Abuse of Social Robots.  They would often get violent hitting and kicking and engaged in verbal abuse, calling the robot bad words.  They didn't say what the bad words were, but they did mention one kid called the robot idiot eight times.  It's bending the neck, hitting it with a plastic bottle, hitting it with a ball.  You know, children are angry and really they can't take it out on adults.  So they if they've got an inanimate object, they're going to hit it.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I would. You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would hit it.  Maybe I'm childlike.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't picture my child hitting a robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're blushing.  You know what?  It's in a group.  See this?  This is this is classic.  It's Lord of the Flies bullying behavior.  They don't do it when it's a kid by herself.  No problem.  I'll get out of the way.  No problem.  Yep.  Okay.  No problem.  But then you get eight or nine kids together.  Watch what happens.  They Lord of the Flies.  They gang up on the thing.  Okay.  Now watch bullies.  There's four of them.  Now some other kids are coming over saying, oh, we can beat this up.  Let's kill it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kill the robot.  Kill Piggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look at this.  The kids are harassing the robot.  Wow.  Apparently happens more often with more kids and if no adults are around.  And then here's violent.  Look at their poop.  They're banging on its head.  The kid kicked.  Hey, kid kicked it.  Do you think this is just Japanese kids or do you think this would happen in the US?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I imagine this would happen in the US.  They throw things at the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Look at the guys dragging them away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Anyway, great study.  I never saw that before.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The tonic to that is that cute little girl that saw the water heater and thought it was  a robot.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do I have that video?  Yeah, just imagine that.  I don't have that video.  That's okay.  Finally, good news.  MP3 is free.  Free at last.  It was 20 years ago on April 23rd that the Fraunhofer company in Germany invented MP3s  and trademarked it.  They own it.  They licensed it.  But as of April 23rd, 2017, that license is over.  You can use MP3 anywhere, anytime without paying a fee, which is kind of news to all  the people who've been doing that for the last 20 years.  I'm like, wait, what?  I got to pay a fee?  Crap.  Yeah, it's over.  You don't have to pay a fee anymore.  All right, let's take a break when we come back.  Will you do a pick?  Do you have a pick?  I have a pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a pick that's really good.  Good.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, should I come up with another pick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, I got one that's okay.  All right, show today.  I tell you, I got something good to get ready because you're going to get hungry.  Our show today brought to you by Blue Apron.  We love the Blue Apron.  Imagine, if you will, you're going home, a long, hard day, you're tired, you're starving,  and you would love to have a luscious home cooked meal.  But you know what?  You got to plan it.  You got to shop for it.  You got to go home and cook it.  And you just end up going to McDonald's again.  Now, alternate universe.  You're starving.  You're ready to have a delicious home cooked meal.  You go home and they're sitting on your porch waiting for you, a lovely box from Blue Apron,  containing all the fresh ingredients to make three different home cooked meals,  plus a recipe card and instructions, everything you need, pre-portioned ingredients,  never more than you need so there's no waste.  You could prepare it in 40 minutes or less.  It's healthful, less intended.  Less than $10 a person for the meal, which means, by the way, it's less expensive than shopping.  Grocery stores are 60 to 70% more expensive because they have all that overhead.  And you're getting delicious, high quality ingredients from 150 local farms, fisheries,  and ranches across the United States.  Sustainable, quality, delicious food.  The number one fresh ingredient and recipe delivery service.  They delivered 99% of the continental United States.  Sorry, Hawaii and Alaska.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  But they want to make sure it's fresh.  There's no weekly commitments.  You only get deliveries when you want them and you choose the items from the website.  But look at all the stuff on the menu.  Baked spinach and egg flatbread with sauteed asparagus and lemon aioli.  Beef teriyaki stir fry with sugar snap peas and lime rice.  Lisa and Michael, our 14-year-old, cooked the other night and I was fasting that day and it was torture.  The house smelled so good.  Crispy salmon and roast potato salad with pickled mustard seeds and creme fraiche sauce.  Here's a vegetarian one.  Three cheese and baby broccoli stromboli.  Oh, I love stromboli.  With tomato and oregano dipping sauce.  But I don't have a make it.  Now you will.  Plans for couples and families with kid-friendly ingredients.  Delicious meals.  They don't repeat more than once a year.  Is that the stromboli?  Oh, it looks so good.  Look at that.  Three cheese and broccoli stromboli.  Oh my gosh.  Now you and the thing is once you make it, you know how to make it again.  And you know what to shop for.  And so it really is a little mini cooking school among everything else.  Check out this week's menu.  You get three meals free with your first purchase.  Yes, three meals free when you go and free shipping when you go to blueapron.com slash twig.  You don't have to do it every night.  We get three meals a week.  And often, by the way, we'll keep two and we'll give one to Lisa's parents who are older and who love it.  They come over and say, any blue apron?  You got any blue apron for us?  So we'll give, you know, because it's all packaged up.  We'll give them the card and the stuff in a little bag and they go home and they make it and they love it.  Blue apron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was just going to say we just made, again, not from the blue apron, but a favorite recipe of ours that came from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's the point is you actually gives you the confidence to say, oh, I could I could do this.  It's really not hard.  And then you do it and you have some new ingredients to play with.  Creme fraiche, you know, stuff you may be not seen before.  I love it. Blueapron.com slash twig.  And yeah, if you have kids, getting them to cook is really great.  That's part of education, I think.  Michael really had fun.  He did not enjoy washing the dishes afterwards, however.  Got to work.  There are a lot of dishes.  He did not. It wasn't bad, but he just, you know, he does not.  I don't know why. That's the chore he hates the most.  I don't know why. I kind of like washing dishes.  I shouldn't have this in public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I like washing dishes, too. I hate drying them, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, right. Well, I just put them in the rack. I don't dry them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, see, I get yelled at when I do that.  Who yells at you? Andrew yells at you?  I yell at him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Tell him to get off his high horse. Air drying is the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like air drying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's my thought.  But see, I used to go, oh, honey, I'll wash them later.  They have to soak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Soak, yes. My dad does that.  These dishes need to soak.  I was like, yeah, as long as they're not soaking tomorrow morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly. So Lisa broke me that habit.  She said, I don't care as long as they're not here in the morning.  She broke me that habit because I used to soak them for several days sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not cool. Not cool.  Not cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Your pick of the week, Stacey Hagenbotham.  I'm going to talk in Irish for you now for the rest of the show to make you feel happy.  Oh, I'm so excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know it's a beautiful accent.  It is. So my choice is a book this week because I've been traveling,  so I haven't had a chance to test devices, but it's a really good book.  What is it?  It's called The Night Ocean. It's by Paul Lafarge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I bought the book that you talked about the last time, Lab Girl.  Oh, did you enjoy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bought it for my daughter who's studying bio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should read it too. It's a good book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I will. She's loving it.  Oh, good. Okay.  This sounds familiar. Paul Lafarge. Why do I know his name?  He's written other books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me tell you what other books he has written because right now I'm not looking at that.  It says it's Lovecraftian.  So, okay, this is something I think anything Lovecraftian is hilarious.  Hilarious? It's spooky.  Well, okay, if you make a cluthoo, I can never say the name joke.  I am the first person to like pop up and laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sathulu is the guy with the octopus face, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Like the knitted cap a friend gave me one of the knitted caps.  You have a Sathulu cap? Oh, man.  So, I just like that's why I got this book, but it's really good.  It's a mystery story. It's got a lot of nods to like horror and science fiction.  It's kind of inception-esque.  It's a good book. I don't want to give you too many things, but it's a really good book.  I don't want to spoil anything.  And it's on Audible.  So, there you go. It's on Audible.  I'm adding it to my list.  I'm looking at his books and I have not seen any of these other books.  But he has written other books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He wrote Moravigne. More of a giant.  Well, wait a minute.  Hausman, The Artist of the Missing, Luminous Airplanes.  I love his titles.  And apparently he works with others as well.  Apparently, maybe this is a different... No, it's the same dude.  Paul Lafarge. He's a very interesting fellow. Is he French?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, his Luminous Airplanes book looks like it's about programmers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it looks fascinating. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe this will be my next recommendation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nice. Have you ever wanted Mr. T to give you car directions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I pity the fool who tries to give you car directions.  Remember, I can't do right and left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. If you do Waze, they've added Mr. T to Waze.  So, you'll have to go in your Waze settings.  And then under Advanced Settings, there's Sound and Voice.  And you have to change the voice directions.  Now, Jane is the default.  Now, the nice thing about Jane is she does street names.  She's the only one who does street names.  But let me turn up my sound.  There's also Amy. Oops.  And then I got to go back in. Darn it. It didn't give me a sample.  I was hoping they would give me a sample.  But the newest sound and voice is Mr. T.  Mr. T. Let's see if we can hear Mr. T.  Should I get directions? Let's go somewhere.  I need directions. Let's see.  Directions to home. How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want people to know where you live?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then make a left, sucker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That sounds actually like everybody who's ever been in the car with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How do I get Mr. T to repeat that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Go back and do it again. Oh, man. Let's go home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Make a left, sucker. And then make a left, sucker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I imagine when I get home, it's going to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have arrived at your destination. I pity the fool who lives here.  Oh, excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Mr. T. on your ways. And that's free. There's no charge.  All right.  I told you I didn't have a really good pick.  I actually had a bunch of picks and I didn't save them anywhere.  Do you do this? I do this all week long.  I go, Oh, I got to pick that. I got it. And then I didn't save them.  And I have no idea. I don't. I don't remember a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the story of my life. The challenge for me is doing devices.  It means like I have this pile of gadgets and I'm like, Oh, I've got it.  And during the show, actually, one of my picks, I guess it'll be next week, arrived.  I heard my dog barking and I saw it on my doorbell.  Well, do you is your daughter or her classmates, are they into fidget spinners?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yes. I have seen there's a delay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that what it is in the fidget spinner? The Kickstarter one?  No. Well, there's a lot. Yes. The cube is now delayed, but you can go on Amazon and buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I decided that I we talked about this last week.  We did. Did we know?  OK, I just I decided to buy a new one.  I decided to buy a many different fidget spinners to see.  Did one come? Oh, this is this is the one Burke got me.  It's just a cheap 7-Eleven fidget spinner.  But the idea is kids, apparently your your daughter's age are like going crazy about these in schools and stuff.  And but there but then now see, there's a variety of them.  Didn't you tell me about the one with the moon and the Mars gravity?  No, who was that school?  There was a was that actually a sketch?  Maybe it was maybe was on Twitter.  So I've I've gone out and ordered a number of these to do some comparisons.  For instance, this one has a ceramic bearings.  And then it spins very nicely.  Yes. And they and they actually rate these via spin times.  So maybe for next week, we'll do fidget spinners.  Huh? There's a website because you can spend hundreds of dollars on it.  Because you can spend hundreds of dollars on fidget spinners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow. This has not this fad has not made it to my daughter's school.  She's super tactile and touchy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She might like it. Well, you can get this one was like a few bucks, but you can spend a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We got our little clicker thingy.  You tap it in its square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I used to have one when I was a kid. It's like a cricket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
