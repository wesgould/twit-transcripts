Joining us right now, Mr. Kevin Purdy, who's filling in for Gina Tripani.  I guess you could say that.  Gina's on vacation.  Kevin is at Lifehacker.com and is the Android expert.  In fact, your book is, is it out yet or is it coming out soon?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  No, boy, never out.  It is coming soon.  I would say the Wiki will be out in about 30 days ish and I will have something to talk  about later on the show though.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good.  Yeah.  A little special offer for those of you who listen.  It will be just like Gina's complete guide to Google Wave.  It'll be the complete guide to Google Android basically.  Yep.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Same publisher, same type of model and hopefully the same kind of community interaction too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm excited about it.  I'm a big Android.  As people who listen to the show know, I'm a big Android fan.  I've gone to the DroidX and I just love it.  What are you using right now?  Nexus One or?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  The Nexus, yes.  Mostly because to write the book, I wanted to make sure I had Android 2.2 as soon as  it came out.  So the Nexus, which is a very nice phone too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I love the Nexus One and you have the pure Google experience.  Some news about the Nexus One we'll get to in just a little bit.  Also here from his vacation in the Poconos, Jeff Jarvis.  You cannot be in the Poconos.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No champagne shaped tub for me.  We are in the Poconos.  I want to give a plug.  I'm at Skytop Lodge in the Poconos, which is an island of civility in the otherwise  trailer park, the bit of Pennsylvania here.  Four thousand acres, beautiful space.  We've been coming here for 16 years.  The kids absolutely love it.  Lakes and pools and animals and all kinds of great stuff.  So Skytop Lodge, Twitter is Skytop Lodge.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And this is kind of a special last trip with Jake, I guess, because he's off to college  in the fall.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly.  I don't want to make you cry or anything.  A glass of full family together.  Yeah, you too, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Me too.  We're flying to Manhattan next week and driving up the Hudson River Valley to drop off Abby  in New York State as well.  So and we're early.  Yeah.  They start three weeks early for the freshmen there.  They have a special course in literature and writing, which I think is a really good idea.  Glad to get Jay Rosen back on the show as well.  Jay, it's nice to have you.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Hi, Leo.  Thanks for asking me on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jay is professor of journalism at NYU and his blog PressThink.org.  Yes it is.  .org is a great place to go to find out about the new journalism.  And he's busily like Jeff, crafting new journalists as we speak.  He's modeling the clay.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Frankenstein.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Jeff, what is that room you were in there?  It looks like a conference room or something at a Holiday Inn.  What is it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're giving you a conference room here.  No, no, no, it's much nicer than that.  It's a conference room with a direct connection.  So the sales department's across the hall.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ah, good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I should have mountains behind me and deer running by and lakes and things, but I don't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll put that in with green screen later.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  You look like you're at a Marriott at the hair.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I wasn't going to say anything, Jay, bud.  That's true.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You should have put me in a room with a window, yes.  You'd see the Sylvan surroundings.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm just jealous.  That's all.  So, one of the reasons I wanted to get Jay on this week is really not having much to  do with Google, but it's certainly part of our purview to cover the internet.  And because of Jeff, we talk a lot about journalism and how it's being impacted by the internet.  And we have talked about WikiLeaks before on the show.  WikiLeaks is very big in the news right now and very and a little bit controversial in  the news right now.  Jeff, do you want to summarize what's going on?  I mean, Jay, I'm sorry.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Sure.  Well, Sunday afternoon, the New York Times, the Guardian in the UK and Der Spiegel in  went live with their respective reports on a trove of documents that WikiLeaks had received  that are intelligence reports about the Afghanistan war.  And it emerged very quickly that these three news organizations had been provided with  access to the documents about a month earlier.  They had all worked together and separately on their coverage and the stories they wrote  about them.  And then shortly after the stories went live on the internet, WikiLeaks released full  text documents themselves on their site.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Seventy-five thousand.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Yes.  And also announced that they had about fifteen thousand more that they haven't released yet,  that they are editing for reasons of safety, meaning they don't want to do harm to possible  intelligence sources and other people who might come into danger as a result of what  they're doing.  So you had, first of all, this story of here's what the documents say about the war in Afghanistan.  You had the collaboration among the three news organizations and then you had this massive  leak that WikiLeaks had received a while ago resulting in publication of tens of thousands  of intelligence reports marked not top secret, but secret, which is the second highest classification  in United States intelligence services.  And since then, there's been reaction on several fronts.  There's been, first of all, what the documents say about the war and how difficult it is  to win.  There's been this discovery by many people who didn't know much about it of WikiLeaks  as what I call a the world's first stateless news organization, which we can get into more  later.  And then, of course, there's the story of new media and old media collaborating or least  cooperating in the release of the story, which is also fascinating to people like Jeff and  myself.  And then there's the usual controversy over whether the leak harms national security and  denunciations from the White House in the name of national security, which we've pretty  much come to expect whenever something like this happens.  So that's what's been going on.  And the buzz really hasn't stopped since Sunday afternoon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Is this the Pentagon Papers for the 21st century?

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of annoying because people ask that and judge this event very commonly  in the coin of the Pentagon Papers.  And I don't think it's that.  And I don't think it will have the same power for a variety of different reasons.  The most important difference is that the Pentagon Papers were already a synthesized  narrative or story of the United States involvement in Vietnam.  They were not raw data, as these documents are, but a kind of secret history of the war  that had been written by the government and by the military.  And they don't have the same power for a number of different reasons.  So they're not the Pentagon Papers.  But what happens is that because they're not the Pentagon Papers, that becomes an excuse  for dismissing them.  Another thing that happened that I didn't mention, Leo, is that those journalists and  news organizations that weren't in on this arrangement tended to say there's nothing  new here. We knew this already.  I don't know what all the fuss is about.  This isn't the Pentagon Papers.  Or as Thomas Ricks, former military reporter for the Washington Post, said, I've learned  more interesting things over dinner with a source.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So you're saying that's a little bit of sour grapes.  Someone on Twitter asked why he didn't reveal that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's sour grapes is what you're saying, Jay.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Well, there's certainly an element of that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The White House also said there's nothing new here.  In the same breath, they said this is a huge violation of national security.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  As you pointed out.  Which was pointed out in my post.  And Julian Assange, who is the founder and key personality in WikiLeaks, said the same  thing in several media appearances that he made.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this show is not about...  We're not going to cover the story in the sense of here's what the WikiLeaks Papers  reveal, national security issues.  We do have a little bit of a connection to it.  Adrian Lamo, the hacker who turned in Specialist Manning for some of the leaks, is an old friend  of mine and of the show.  Oh yeah?  Yeah.  Kind of a surprise because he considers himself, I think, a white hacker.  Did serve house arrest because he broke into the New York Times databases.  But he says he did it to reveal the security problems for the Times.  And as a hacker, and he says a journalist, he spent times in the chat rooms talking  to different hackers and it says that Specialist Manning confessed to him and he felt like  because of the security implications, he had to go to the Pentagon and turn the guy in.  I know the hacking community is a little bit torn asunder by all of that.  But even that isn't really our beat.  I think our beat is really how this changes journalism.  Jeff, do you have something you want to add to this before we get deep in the weeds?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's a few things here.  One is the idea of transparency.  And the only sure fix to leaks is transparency.  And I think that we're going to see, whether through practical means or whether through  subversion like this, more and more and more need to be transparent.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what Assange says WikiLeaks is all about, is transparency.  That's his point.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Daniel Ellsberg did say that he was waiting 40 years for this to happen.  And if you look at a very tactical level, the difference is he had to stand on a Xerox  machine for hours and hours.  Now there's more data stored in a more accessible way that more people can get to that can be  distributed more easily.  And that's going to have an impact.  That's the cloud.  There's other clouds out there.  One is the cloud of what does the world know and what does the government know and what's  secret and what's not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's why, by the way, I feel that this is an important thing for us to discuss on  this show.  That's the particular area that I think is important for us to discuss.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Yes, I think so, exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think also there's more.  I think that's exactly what Jay focused on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, I should explain for people listening that Jeff has a bit of a lag.  And so there's going to be this little conflict where Jeff doesn't hear us talking and can  you just talk?  He's not being rude.  And nor are we being rude to him.  There's just a little lag involved.  So I'm going to let you go ahead, Jeff, and then I'll get Kevin and Jay back into the  discussion.  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'll be more sensitive to that, too.  It's wacky.  One thing that Jay concentrated on in his post that I think was an important point is  that WikiLeaks chose to involve themselves with media organizations here.  They could have just released it on their own.  They chose to for various reasons.  And I think the important thing about that is that journalists added value.  They added value in terms of the ability to promote this because it was exclusive.  They paid attention to it.  They brought more mature judgment about what was safe and unsafe.  They brought perspective.  I think there's a lot of ways that we look at this and say that it's very easy now for  news to be spread at a marginal cost of zero from whoever has it, whoever wants it.  The journalists have to ask where they add value in that transaction.  And the WikiLeaks story to me is a fascinating example of how someone came in and, A, WikiLeaks  saw value to be added and, B, that the news organizations really did add value.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought that was the most interesting part.  They released it to these three old school newspapers first to give them a chance to  turn it into the Pentagon Papers, in a sense, to analyze it and to distill it.  But that didn't mean that a month later they didn't release all the documents as well.  They did both.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  And what Jeff said is true.  It's a very good illustration of how traditional news organizations still add value.  And I think it would have had much less effect if they didn't do that.  However, there's another aspect to it also, Jeff, which is that WikiLeaks discovered  that if it simply puts documents that have great stories in them online, what will happen  is that journalists will ignore them.  And the reason that they'll ignore them is that they can't be guaranteed that if they  do the work and extract the story and figure out what it is and publish it, that somebody  else won't beat them to it.  And so this frustration that Julian Assange had that great stories buried in documents  already online were going ignored, were being ignored by journalists, is part of what was  behind his decision to give the Times, The Guardian, and Der Spiegel an exclusive, which  is a peculiarity, a quirk, if you will, of press culture, because we tend to think that  journalists will do anything for a scoop.  They'll do anything for a great story.  That's the thing that really motivates them.  That's their bread and butter.  But it's not entirely true, because there are a lot of stories still within documents  WikiLeaks has made public that are just sitting there without being reported on because they  don't fit the peculiar competitive conditions that prevail within professional journalism.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So how does this change?  Does this disintermediate consumers of information?  It sounds like not.  It sounds like it in some ways elevates traditional media.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it does.  I think that's the point that Jay brought out that's really important and that WikiLeaks  saw.  But it doesn't happen.  You know, what it said, thanks to Jay, I work in my book, I've been reading James Carey,  who was a brilliant professor at Columbia.  And as Jay explains in a preface to some of his essays, that Carey saw that there were  two ways to look at journalism.  One was as a communicator of information, a transmitter of information.  And that's the way journalists often see themselves.  But that's not where the real value is.  The question is that in Carey's view, Jay will correct me, I'm sure, if I'm wrong,  professor, because I'll get it wrong.  He knows it far better than I do.  But that there's a conversation going on in society and that journalism is there to reflect  it and to, I would say these days, to enable it and not just to inform it.  The starting point is not the journalist.  The starting point is the conversation.  The journalists think they're the starting point.  And so I think that what this does, they couldn't have gone to a better paper than The Guardian,  full disclosure, I write for them, but I think The Guardian is brilliant.  I asked Alan Rusberger in email, the editor of The Guardian, whether The Guardian should  have started WikiLeaks.  Were they jealous of this?  When The Guardian saw Huffington Post, they said, crap, we should have done that.  So they started Comment is Free, their version.  And Alan said, no, they shouldn't have started WikiLeaks because they do different things.  There are things that The Guardian does that WikiLeaks wouldn't and vice versa.  And The Guardian and The Times and Der Spiegel are far better targets for government and  companies than WikiLeaks.  So what you see automatically is what you said, Leo.  You see a new layer of a new kind of collaboration that occurs and that they're dancing around  each other and trying to figure out what this is.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Well, Leo, we want to get Kevin in here.  On your question about disintermediation, it is that in one sense, we have to realize  that there are different kinds of leakers and leakers have different motives.  And if the aim of the leaker is to influence the discussion going on among elites, which  is very often the motivation behind why people leak documents.  The whole history of leaking, which would be a fascinating tale, is maybe 50 percent  or more a result of contests for power inside institutions of government.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Most White House leaks are from people who want to assert a certain point of view within  the White House conversation itself.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Right.  So what you have, the dynamic, which is centuries old, what you have is internal contests for  power, whether it's within parliament, Congress, White House or even a corporation.  And the loser decides to go public by leaking key information and changing the battlefield,  as it were.  So if a leaker's motive is that is to get information out to affect a conversation going  among elites, then WikiLeaks is disintermediation because all they care about is that other  people who are tuned enough to this issue can read and find out what's going on.  And it's really the other kind of leaking where you're trying to affect public opinion  and public conversation that still requires in some ways the resources of journalism.  We should also recognize here that the balance of power is very different.  Bill Keller, editor of the New York Times, in reflecting on these events, made it clear  that, well, WikiLeaks was going to publish this whether we decided to join or not.  In that sense, WikiLeaks was in the driver's seat as opposed to the newspaper.  And they had to decide whether to play ball or not.  You know that Assange is smart enough to go to the Washington Post or the Los Angeles Times  or Time Magazine if he had to.  And so in that sense, even though the traditional media is still essential, they aren't  in the powerful position anymore.  One more thing is that the White House, which has absolutely no context with WikiLeaks  whatsoever, had to use the New York Times as a go-between to contact WikiLeaks and urge them  to at least redact important information.  So now you have the New York Times, which ordinarily is the one going to the White House  and saying we have these documents and we're going to publish them because we have a source.  Instead, the traditional newspaper, the New York Times, is in the position of being  the negotiator or go-between between WikiLeaks and the White House, which is something completely  new and novel in press relations with government.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is this a one-time-only situation or is this going to be the new way things are done?  Is this the beginning of a trend?

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Put yourself in the position of somebody who is a whistleblower and has documents that really  should be public.  Who would you rather deal with?  A news organization that could be subpoenaed or WikiLeaks, which has put so much effort  into being completely secure?  And stateless.  Yeah, and stateless.  And just think about the incentives and the risks for the leaker.  If you think about it from the leaker's point of view, you know that this is not the last  time this is going to happen.  Interesting.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Adding on to that too, one thing I learned from the Sunday...  Practically all...  Go ahead, Kevin.  Sorry, Jeff.  Go ahead, Kevin.  Learning from the Sunday WikiLeaks dump is that I don't know if it's a feature they have  now or if they plan to put it into the future, but people who have information, insiders of  corporate companies or government can...  I believe they'll now be able to go to WikiLeaks, release it to them, and then tell WikiLeaks,  I want you to pass this to New York Times, the Austin American Statement, if you have  a local story there.  And like I said, I don't know if that's something they're doing now or if that's a plan for the  future, but I thought that was a really interesting change in how leaks happen.  Like Jay was just saying, would you rather have WikiLeaks as your unpaid attorney in  getting information out or would you rather just take your luck with whoever your local paper is?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do any of you have any concern that there might be a backlash?  I think there's a large portion of the American public who is outraged by this and believes  the White House and now I hear that 100 names have been revealed of informants in Afghanistan  and believes that this leak was actually dangerous and that WikiLeaks is irresponsible.  I'm sure there was the same backlash over the Pentagon Papers, by the way, but  do you think there might be a backlash against this and in fact a kind of  return to trust, ironically, in the New York Times and traditional media?

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Yes. I mean, I think Julian Assange, the prime mover in WikiLeaks,  is in a very delicate situation with the legitimacy of his own organization.  And in this particular story, if he doesn't redact the right names, if he does  put people at risk, if he fails in a pledge he sometimes made to do no harm,  which I think is an important ethic for WikiLeaks to have, then the legitimacy of his organization  could really be in peril. However, what's different here is that even if  WikiLeaks is regarded as a dubious organization, even if people attack it and don't trust it,  if it's documents we're talking about and they are authentic, it could still have a lot of power  even if people don't treat it as a legitimate news organization. And that's what's so

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  compelling and so disruptive about it. Julian may not care if he's considered a rogue as long as he  continues to be able to do what he does. He doesn't care about legitimacy within the frame

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  of the nation state. He does not care about that. Right. Explicitly. Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that, and pardon me a Pollyanna moment here, but if you're sitting in any  organization, and let's not forget this is not just going to be governments, it's also companies.  At some point, as I said earlier on, and it's a glib line, but the only sure cure for leaks is  transparency. At some point, you're going to realize that you're better off releasing more  information. That the more you hold secret, the more risk you have of leaks and anything that  looks like a leak looks like an expose. Now that's going to be a very hard lesson to get across to  controlling institutions. But I think if we're looking for a long term impact here on the culture,  and I'm writing about this obviously so it's on the top of my brain, but I think that this  default of publicness versus a default of privacy and secrecy is what we're grappling with here.  And we get to a point where there is no mediator. We are all media and we can all communicate with  the world. Even if you don't go to the New York Times, you can publish something. You can put a  document up and you can say, here, here it is. And there are other means to be anonymous. And  anonymity is always going to have its place whether we like it or not in crappy little comments.  And so in the end, no secret is safe. Now some secrets should be, but here's another angle to  this. There are efforts to get obviously every single bit of communication done in the White  House to be recorded. And there are those who complain in the Bush White House and are complaining  right now that certain emails are being done on private platforms. And that sounds like a flag  to salute that and I would too that we want ultimate transparency. But there's a risk here,  which is that if everything you say in writing could come out, you're going to stop saying  some things in writing. And that's a danger too. That's a risk too. So we're trying to find a new  balance to this idea of publicness and privacy in this. And I think it's going to be a very long time

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  before we see this shake out over and out. Yeah. It's just a fascinating story and I think with  big impact. And it's what we talked about on the show last week with respect to individuals here  with respect to institutions. Are there different issues for institutions, Jeff, versus for  individuals? It's a choice any individual can make. Who makes the choice for the institution?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I think so. I think that the individual does start with default privacy. My  thoughts are my own. And I think that the organization has to shift to be profoundly,  radically public if it wants to have trust that anything it hides, anything that will not make  apparent and available and public will be seen as a reason for suspicion. That's not going to be  true in our private lives so much. So it's actually a higher standard for institutions.  It's a higher standard for institutions. It is. I think it is in the long run. They don't see it

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  yet, but I think that's where it'll go. Well, and because of the fact that institutions can  really impact us all, when it comes to the institution of government, for instance,  there's a much higher standard for government to be transparent than there is for an individual.  We demanded of government. We ought to demand it of government. And I presume that that's what's  going on. This is something that's funny that the fourth estate has always been charged with doing.  WikiLeaks really becomes a very powerful tool now for that kind of transparency.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  I think part of the challenge here is...  And it's not just WikiLeaks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sorry. Sorry. Go ahead. We'll let Jay talk and then I'll give you a chance, Jen.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Well, part of the challenge here is not just that institutions have to adjust to new rules. It's that  the whole culture of professionalism in American life and in Western societies  is deeply based on the control of information and the control of image.  And to try and reconstruct what a professional is when information is decontrolled is really a  challenge. And so it's deeper than just institutional life. And I think what happened  is that the long age of mass media, which in some ways went from 1830 to 2000,  gave professionals, people inside institutions, the illusion that they could control  information indefinitely. That was sort of the nature of the world.  It's our charge. It's our mission. It's our portfolio.  Exactly. It's our right. It's our destiny. And it's sort of hard for them to appreciate that  almost everything they know how to do is based on that. So what I've been trying to puzzle through  is the shift in terms of authority and also in the nature of trust from a world where it's possible  to control your image and to control the release of information to one where you can't do that  anymore. And you simply have to be open. As Jeff says, you have to say where you're coming from.  You have to say, here's the data. You have to assume that people are going to find out  your secrets and still try to generate trust under those conditions.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But governments will argue, and I think people are arguing now, we need some secrecy in order to  operate effectively. Let's say we want to kill Ben Laden. Don't we need to be able to operate in

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  secret in some situations? I think that is true. I think that is a good point. And in the personal  space, we need some sphere of intimacy, of privacy in order to have public selves in the first place.  But even though that's true, you may still face a disruption that technology is bringing about  anyway. And that's why it's such a challenge to institutional dominance and professional authority.  And it's far from clear how the institutions of modern life deal with this.  So it's a challenge. This is difficult. It's a challenge to know what to do. It's also a  challenge to know how to think about it, even to what language we should use for it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's really, I mean, technology is so universally disruptive. We see it in business, in content  creation, and now we see it in government. And it's the same answer each time. Yes, it's disruptive.  Yes, we don't know exactly how to talk about it, to think about it, to deal with it.  But one thing we can agree, it's happening. Jeff, go ahead.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman Well, no, I just, here's a silly example from this week where I think that this  becomes a story, as we discussed last week, about technology and change and fear. There was a Wall  Street Journal story this week about Walmart putting RFID tags on pants. And I said uncharitably  that there were privacy wing nuts. Oh, man, I got survivalists who came to me who said,  you know what people, the fear was, there was this woman in the story who thinks that honest to God,  and then the Wall Street Journal quoted her as if she were a reputable source, that RFID tags are  a evil plot, an anti-God plot. And so what the fear was that they put forward is someone would  come and scan your garbage. And so what, they find out I'm 33 now, not 32? You know, then what? What  does that do? We don't look at the implications. But technology yields change and change yields  fright and fright yields protection. And that's a very small example of what Jay just said. Whether  you're a big institution or whether you're a survivalist or whoever you are, there's two  responses to this world coming up to embrace the change or to try to fear it. I just read a book  about the war between, the Google referred to in its document, back to the FTC, about the war  between radio and newspapers back when radio came to threaten them. And they used sacred language  of saying this was a sacred cause that newspapers had. And if you disrupt it, it's bad. And now even  RFID tags are a matter of somehow sacredness and the secrets that government needs. Yes, we need  secrets. But first you have to have the trust to know that those who are holding secrets are holding

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  them for a reason. Interesting. Very well said, Jeff. Yeah. Yeah. All right, we're going to take  a break because we do have a limited amount of time to do this. And this conversation is a great  conversation. We are going to do a Government 2.0 special. Android next. Android. Yeah, we're going  to get to Android. For Kevin's left out in the cold there. But we're going to get to it in just a  bit. I do want to mention that we are doing a Government 2.0 special August 16th, 11 a.m. with  Tim O'Reilly, Carl Malamud and many members of government to talk about transparency issues within  government, how technology is being used to promote transparency in government. And I think  it is a very important conversation that's kind of an adjunct to this conversation, which is really  about how the new role of journalism and of the citizen journalists and the stateless journalist,  all of which very interesting. Jeff Jarvis is here as usual. Gina Trapani cannot be here. She's got a  little take a little time off sometimes, of course. But fortunately, we got Kevin Purdy here.  She's on her way to Supernova. I'll just let you complete the  latency is getting longer and I apologize, Jeff. Yeah, that's where she's going to Supernova. So  it's not exactly. Gina is on her way to Supernova Philadelphia. Excellent. And we will have her back  next week. Kevin Purdy is here. You know, I have to do hand signals, smoke signals. We'll figure  out a way. Kevin Purdy is here. He's from lifehacker.com and also the Android expert,  the author of a new book, which is forthcoming called The Complete Guide to Google Android,  just as Gina's done the complete guide to Google Wave. Jay Rosen, an expert and a great commentator  on journalism is also with us and professor at NYU of journalism. He's at PressThink.org.  We will be back in a moment. I'll give them all a chance to grab a bite to eat or to think a little  bit as I talk a little bit about our friends at Carbonite. Carbonite.com. Carbonite is a backup  that happens automatically without you thinking about it. Not to a local hard drive. Carbonite has  some advantages over the local hard drive. I don't think it's a bad idea to back up to the  local hard drive. As many backups as you can make, the better, happier I will be. But if you don't  have an offsite backup, you're missing an important detail in backup. What happens if the worst happens,  fire or flood and all your data is lost because it was sitting right next to the original? Actually,  just go to carbonite.com and use the offer code Twig. Let's do that. carbonite.com slash Twig  won't work. carbonite.com and then the offer code Twig will work. If you use that, you will get two  weeks free to try it out. Now, here's what's going to happen. You're going to put it on your system.  Carbonite will start backing up your personal data, your emails, your financial records, pictures,  music, the things you hold most important automatically to the cloud using 128-bit SSL.  Here's the beauty of it. Something you can't do with an external drive. You can get it back anytime  on any computer. You just log on to your Carbonite account and there's the data.  They even have a free iPhone and Blackberry app for you. Computer disasters happen. Data does get  lost. Computers get misplaced. Your laptop, I'm sorry to say, hundreds of thousands of laptops are  lost each year. Back it up, please. Do me a favor using carbonite.com. Offer code Twig and if you  like carbonite and decide to buy it, you can get it two months additional free by using Twig as the  offer code when you buy. Let me put this in the lower third so you can see how to spell Twig.  If you don't know how to spell Twig, now you know. carbonite.com offer code TWIG. We use it. We  recommend it and I encourage you to do the same. Back to our conversation, Jay Rosen, Jeff Jarvis  in the Poconos and Leo Laporte, Kevin Purdy is in here also from a lifehacker.com. Now we can talk  a little bit about Android. I hear there's a route, a one button route for the DroidX. Kevin,

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  am I crazy? Should I do it right now? Right now? I don't know. There is a one button route. I think  a week ago it was a whole process with the terminal and all that. It's just a route. It's not a

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  complete firmware. Well, that's what I was concerned about because we'd heard about the EFuse.  This will not trigger the EFuse on my Droid, right? I don't believe so. I believe it's just a route

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  that lets you in at the level so that you can remove what everyone's complaining about the DroidX  is. The junk wear, the crap wear. Loat wear, crap wear, whatever you want to call it. That stuff

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  doesn't bother me. You can't uninstall a lot of the Motorola apps. Same thing on an HTC with the  Samsung which has a lot of crap wear on it. But that's just my cons. That doesn't bother me.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I'm always amazed that the Sense phones don't let you at least go back to Google stock. That's a  major complaint of mine. Well, I have that too. For instance, it's not using the Google

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  SMS on the DroidX. So there are a few things. I wish I could use the Google stock applications.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  You're right. Yeah. Well, the DroidX I think has enough memory where it's not a big issue.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Eight gigabytes of app memory. So there's plenty of room in here.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  There you go. Yeah. But I mean, some people really don't like the feel of scrolling through  their app tray and seeing things they can't remove. So especially Android users. I mean,  I don't want to typecast, but people who like to feel like they've got an open phone and a  phone they control, a phone they can set up a portable hotspot with, they don't like seeing,  even though it seems like a really cool game, need for speed on their phone and they can't pull it

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  off or whatnot. So the this eFuse story I think is a little overblown. I don't own a DroidX. So

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  your mileage may vary, but I believe that there is now currently a route that just gets in and gives  you the access and doesn't change firmware or do anything else that would trigger what you call a  boot back to the rescue, whatever you call it. I'm sorry. According to, yeah, they go to rescue

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  mode and then you have to put a new firmware on it. They say, right. So Apple decided that they  were going to that they were maybe a little threatened, I don't know, by the DroidX. So  they put out a video, which has since disappeared, I believe, showing the DroidX antenna.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Yes. And the Blackberry and the I believe the HTC incredible too, showing that if you hold it,  I believe Google phones, it's the bottom of the phone. Like this would be a kind of death grip on  most HTC. Have you been able to get it to happen? Oh, I'm on T-Mobile. So I don't know what would be  amazing service drop down to mediocre. I like T-Mobile actually in Buffalo. It's fine. I hear  it's not too good, you know, New York or LA or whatever. But I can't get it to happen on  Verizon period. No, I've never been able to replicate it, but I wasn't looking for it. Like  a lot of iPhone owners would be iPhone owners are much more aware of their service, it seems.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. Right. How about the Poconos? Jeff, is it working up there?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My AT&T is actually working very well here. You know, the AT&T, I mean, the Apple response  with those videos seems to be rather childish rhetoric of, but Joey started it. Yeah, I know  you I am, but what are you? It doesn't really fix the problem. Right. I like how someone pointed

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  out that now attenuation has become a common word that like it's spread from like, you know,  wireless engineers to the general public like, Oh, does your phone have attenuation?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I know I could see that you're detuning your antenna when you hold the phone like that. That's  just not appropriate. Good news for Nexus One owners. We thought that the Nexus One was dead.  It looks now like the HTC folks are just going to take the AMOLED screen out of it because they're  in short supply and use super LCD in it and the incredible and still offer those phones for sale  somewhere. Google's not going to sell them. I don't know where T-Mobile stores are supposed

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  to get Nexus One. T-Mobile is not going to. Say again? T-Mobile just said if we look up that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  they're not going to sell it. Oh, so that's sad because I think this is actually a really great  Google phone experience with 2.2. It's even with the super LCD screen, which is actually still a

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  pretty good screen. Some people were saying that like the Android stock experience, the Nexus One,  I believe it was on Daring Fireball too, is that what it does is it shows you what a phone is like  without carrier or manufacturer intervention. It just shows you what your phone could be like if  they didn't want to have you using AOL, IM or whatever else they jam on your phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not the incredible, the desire. Thank you for the correction, Mastermind. I meant the desire.  Ah. Yes. Changing Google Voice directs access numbers for speedier dialing,  which eliminates unfortunately the free calling trick people have been able to use. So if you're  on Android or BlackBerry, there's an update that allows direct access number. In other words,  assigns a unique outgoing call number to everybody you dial. Which is really great for people who

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  don't have a great data connection, maybe at home or wherever they are, because previously  a Google Voice app would reach out to the server, contact it, let it know that you're trying to call  this on the number, retrieve the number roughly and then deliver it to your phone. It was funky.  Yeah, and it was five or six seconds. It's embarrassing to pull out your phone and be like,  I'm going to call and order a pizza. It calls you back. It's so weird.  It basically calls you back. But now I believe it stores the unique numbers that Google Voice  generates for every one of your contacts in your phone. So it's pretty instant now. It's  just like calling on a regular connection. Unfortunately, it'll cost you minutes now.  Yeah. The old trick that you're referring to is the plans where you have your five friends that  you can call forever. You just assign your Google Voice number as one of those friends and then  unlimited calls. I think carriers were kind of pushing away from those, have been pushing away  from those, you know, circle of friends plans anyways. Yeah. I didn't use it. I didn't use it

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  because who wanted to sit there while you make a call and wait for Google Voice to call you back?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  It just was a pain in the butt. It's pretty fast now on the Nexus One, even on T-Mobile.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yahoo Japan has chosen Google for its search engine, which is kind of bizarre. Yahoo in the US uses  Microsoft.  The pause you're hearing. I think it was a slap to both Microsoft and Yahoo US.  Yeah. They slapped everybody all around. Yahoo Japan is a different owner, at least  majority owner, I guess. We'll just cut the pauses out.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I feel so stupid.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Jay, if you have anything to add to this, please do, but don't feel like you have to stick  around either if you're not at all interested in anything we're talking about here.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  You wouldn't believe how backward my phone is. What do you use?  Jay is pathetic.  I actually have. I'm not joking. I have an AARP phone that has absolutely no  internet access at all. The only reason I have it is in case my daughter has a problem at school  or something like that. I'm not even mobile. Wow. That's very interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sorry. Could resist.

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  Right. It's my curmudgeon self coming out.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want to ask Kevin about the two things. One is that Lionel Menchaca at Dell said that they've  gotten more pre-release interest in their five-inch Android device whose name I'm suddenly forgetting.  The streak.  Time before.  The streak, yeah.  Right. The streak. Then there's this weird thing about the Augun, the $150 Android tablet that is  now in the Kmart circular and appears to be real. How could it be? $150.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's in the circular, but it's apparently not in the stores because everybody who's  tweeted me has said, I don't see any. I'm looking for them. They're sold out.  Has anybody seen one?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  No. I haven't. What is it? Engadget said that they didn't have. They called one and they said,  no, we don't have it in stock and couldn't get any information. But Android 2.1 and two gigs of  storage and I don't remember how much memory, but I can't even do the math of how that's $150.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's got to be something horrible in there. It can't be. It's got to be an atom processor  or something.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Yeah. There's shots of it. That doesn't prove anything these days, but it seems interesting.  I just got to wonder about how Kmart is going to be the avatar of Android marketing for a tablet.  How Kmart or any other similar non-electronic store is going to be the one to push  an Android tablet and get customers to know it and want it, I guess.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But Dell, on the other hand, absolutely could.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that is interesting. Sorry. Yeah, but I think somebody like Walmart could be the one  to make Android go ballistic. Over.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Yeah, that's possible. For a while, Walmart was selling $150 Linux-based computer that was  based on GLS, which was actually just a Google-obsessed Linux operating system.  I think they sold some, but I believe they eventually kind of canceled the project.  But I would be really interested to see mass market stores pushing an Android tablet and  just totally putting it in the market as the cheaper non-iPad, I guess.  I haven't played with any of those, so I can't tell you how they work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Dell Streak is a 5-inch tablet. I think they're under $500, Kevin, is that right?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Yeah, roughly something like that.  A lot of pre-orders.  It would be a direct competitor to the iPad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A lot of interest in that. I'll order one and get one in the house as soon as I can.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I would love to. I love to order that.  Is it AT&T only?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think so. Yes.  It's kind of too bad. How does AT&T get this?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I have no idea.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Can I take my iPhone SIM out and put it in the Dell device?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I don't know. You could only do that with scissors for the iPad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was a micro SIM. But I would presume the Streak is a micro SIM.  Everybody's moving to micro SIM. The Streak is unlocked, although I guess they sell two flavors,  locked and unlocked, right?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Yeah, I believe so. From what I've read.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'd have to think AT&T is doing something with the SIM in a 3G iPad to keep you from doing  exactly that. I can't imagine that they're not checking something.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Why is it there? I don't see how it's against AT&T's interest to have you use the same account on  multiple devices if you could only use one at a time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll tell you why. It's against AT&T's interest to piss off Apple in any possible way.  Apple is so anxious to get rid of AT&T that if I were AT&T, I'd be groveling. I'd be on the floor.  I'd be crawling to Steve saying, can I shine your shoes? Can I get you anything, Mr. Jobs?  Is everything okay? So they're going to be very careful, I think, to protect Apple's business  interests.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  According to that Wired story, they could do all that and it still wouldn't matter.  The Wired story from two weeks ago detailing the relationship between Google and  between Apple and AT&T. That was amazing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  To see behind the curtain there and to see what was going on.  And Steve Jobs saying, I'm going to call AT&T and yell at them.  It was amazing to see this. And talk about a shift in balance of power.  There's a big shift from the cell companies which really have dominated this market and  dominated the handset manufacturers. And here comes Apple and just becomes totally the boss of that  relationship.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  AT&T, the former ruler of all telecommunication in the United States, now has to...  It has to de-navalize.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Graveling to this hippies. These hippies at Apple.  Jeff bookmarked an interesting story. A quote from Eric Schmidt.  Google, of course, supposedly creating a Facebook social network. Everybody has confirmed it.  Kevin Rose gave it the name Google Me. Adam D'Angelo said, yeah, absolutely, he's the guy  Quora said. Now the journal, even the journal says that Google is trying to do something.  They acquired Playdom, a social gaming network. Invested $100 million in Zynga.  Somebody better tell Eric Schmidt though, because Eric said the world doesn't need,  quote, a copy of the same thing.  He says Facebook is good for Google because Facebook users use more Google products  than other users. He said, we have an announcement. You can't expect a partnership with Zynga.  But he says, he sounds like he says that we're not doing a Facebook clone.  Disinformation from Eric Schmidt?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think that they... If Eric's wrong, then count the days to his departure.  I can't imagine that he is. It would not make any sense to try to be Facebook against Facebook.  Google's too smart for that. They're going to look for that unique thing. I think that there's some  Kremlinology to be read in the fact that Rick Clow won't come on our show yet,  because he's working on profiles. I think there's big stuff coming up with profiles and big,  different opportunities with Google. We'll see where that goes.  But I don't think it's going to be a clone. I think he's right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that makes sense. It's really parsing his sentence. Yes, we're going to do a Facebook  thing, but it's not going to be a clone. It'll be green.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Even look at the fact that Amazon this week, in a deal I don't fully understand,  or in a move I don't fully understand, they're going to use your Facebook friends in terms of  purchases. And so Facebook becomes a given. And the question for... Just like Zynga, is it given?  In games now, Google is a given in the world. Could they become the next Alta Vista and be  destroyed? Yes, anybody could. But I think if you look at a world of givens and say,  all right, the smart thing to do is to figure out how do you deal with this thing that we can't get  rid of, that it's just there. And so Facebook is a thing you can't get rid of. It's there.  And Google will find clever ways, I think, to work with them. And the thing to read into what  Schmidt said was that they sell different advertisers, they sell different advertising  opportunities, and Facebook is good for Google, because Google believes that everybody who uses

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the internet is good for Google. For a moment I thought you said a world of givens, as in monkeys.  And you know, from my point of view, there is something about Facebook that reminds me of a  world of givens. Here's an interesting security and privacy story. According to Thing,  100 million Facebook user pages were scraped by a fellow from Skull Security and placed on BitTorrent.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  None of this is illegal. Ron? It was the entire directory of everybody who has not changed their  settings or have intentionally made themselves public, but they probably did not presume that  they would be combined into a 2.8 gigabit file that becomes a, I'm sorry, Jeff, a stalker's favorite

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  toy. Yeah, I mean, not just names and URLs, but some of this stuff has phone numbers,  depending on whether people were paying attention when they looked at the privacy settings. Or  maybe there are people like Jeff who just like to put their pants out in public.  It does raise it on or off. It does raise a very interesting point. 100 million out of the 500  million Facebook users apparently don't care if their stuff's public. And now it's available  for anybody who wants to download from a BitTorrent site. But at some level,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  you want to be in control of this, that's all true, but at some level, let me bring something  to you. Do you know the phone book used to put out this whole thing with all your addresses and

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  phone numbers in it? That's true. On the other hand, you couldn't really download it as a 2.8

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  gigabyte BitTorrent file. No, it was better. It was paper. We love paper. Paper's right there.  It's on your shelf. It's hard to do jokes with this with this lag. Timing is everything.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What about this proof of concept? You know, actually, I really like the new Google Maps.  So Google Maps got a big update this week, at least on Android. I don't know if it also got  updated on iPhone. I think it did not. It was just an Android thing. So they added,  I haven't even counted them all, but I think four new icons in my...

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  There are four now total. When you first Android, it was just maps. And I guess just user interface  decisions, it's now broken off into, there's the maps, and then there's the latitude has its own  separate icon. Navigation has its own separate icon. And the one they just added was places,  which is a, you know, what's near me right now. You know, instead of having to go to the map,  have it figure out where you are. This one can do restaurants, coffee, bars, hotels, attractions,  ATMs. So it's a... It's Yelp-ish. And in fact, it includes Yelp reviews in here. Yeah. And the  same kind of aggregation that Google does with maps, it shows you all the reviews that they could  scrape and then, you know, even color coded to show you that this place is generally getting four  stars, five stars and that type of thing. I actually like it, but this isn't anything

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  different that you could already get in Maps. It's just, it's got its own call out. Is that the...

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Yeah. Just now you don't have to go search for a place or click on a street near you and find this.  Now you can just directly have your GPS unit tell you what's nearby. But what in another story in  the Fred feed, what people were wondering was, well, Google's doing this. Google's taking one  application and letting it split out into, you know, four different icons. I wonder if other  applications can do it. And so someone came up with a proof of concept app. I think it was just  called like app launcher spam or something. And he managed to put 20 different icons on his phone.  If you install this application, which is the only purpose is to do this, it would just

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  spam. It spans your app drawer. Now uninstalling it removes it, but it is definitely a proof of

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  concept, isn't it? Yeah. I mean, and it relates to the general issue with the Android market. And  the other big market issue this week was the Google removing, I believe, 3000 applications,  but... A thousand? 3000? From one particular... From three particular developers and... Six thousand  spam apps, I'm sorry. Wow. From three different developers who were mostly doing the kind of  wallpaper ringtone stuff that you hate to see in there when you're just looking for something  real, full of copyright violations, full of, you know, just junk and Google, you know,  remove them unilaterally. And there's an... One of the developers contracted the Android guys blog  and the quote on the headline was, we will flood the Android market. And he revealed  in broken English that he owned three or four other development names and that he has more  than a thousand apps still on the market. So it's a great problem to have to have to be,  have an open market and deal with guys who want to do nothing but put out  usher ringtones and Twilight wallpapers and at all into infinity. I'm glad. I actually am glad

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  that Google's doing something about it. They also extended the refund time frame. This is something  the Apple Store does not have and I think is a really good feature. You have 24 hours. If you  buy an app, and by the way, most of the apps on the Android Store are free, but if you buy an app  on the Android Store, you had 24 hours to uninstall it and automatically you'd get a refund.  Now you have 48 hours. And in most cases, if you buy it from the apps, the marketplace,  anyway, you get a refund automatically. You don't have to do anything, which gives you,  which means that you can try any paid application for two days. Jeff, go ahead.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, Kevin, I feel like I'm a school teacher. Can I talk now? I talk about on the show,  occasionally saying that I think one problem for Android is that it is hard to find the good apps  and it's going to be like the whole Google verse that there's spam everywhere and there's junk in  there. What do you think about the quality of the Android marketplace and what do you think Google  is doing, can do and should do about quality? Well, the savvy folks who are the Android

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  power users, the Android geeks, usually we're going to go to a place like AppBrain,  which you guys have talked about on the show before. Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it.  AppBrain, some of the other third party search engines, whose names escape me right now, but  that have decent ranking listing and most of the apps that are recommended on those sites are by  real Android users that like good stuff. I am able to find the apps that I need or apps  that are cool, but I have an unfair advantage in that I wake up every morning and read RSS  feeds for Lifehacker. So I'm reading like 10 Android blogs every morning. You can find great  apps that way because they're doing all the curating. I think it's a pretty big problem  for Google and I like to see them taking steps like this, like wiping out the obvious install  bait, I guess is the word now. But I also wonder when they're going to have their Apple moment and  overstep, when they're going to start removing things that shouldn't be removed. And it hasn't  happened yet because the market is still very flush. If you have a favorite, is AppBrain your

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  favorite? There's AndroLib is another one. There's a number of different choices. AppBrain because

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  of that fast web install feature they have. If you don't have Froyo yet, this is the best way.  Yes, I'm sorry. But when everyone gets up to Froyo, including those Verizon users who  rumored to get it in mid-August, AppBrain has a fast web installer that is awesome. And you install  the AppBrain application and fast web and whenever you're on the AppBrain website, you can just click  and all of a sudden you look on your phone and it's downloading. And that's the future.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's also Android now has an automatic update in 2.2 has an automatic update feature. You could  check a box that says, look, I love this app. Whenever it's updated, just make sure you get the  latest version. And that just does it automatically. That is a great feature. And it is. Unless the app

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  is has some quirks to it. And the app is crap. Don't turn that on. Yeah. Oh, no, no, the Google  Voice application. Every time you update Google Voice, you need to run it again. You need to  relaunch it because otherwise it won't connect. And I, I, it'll sound like I'm the doggy at my  homework, but my, my boss at Lifehacker texted me the other day and Google Voice had automatically  updated and it hadn't relaunched. And so I, I missed a text about an article and it's whereabouts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess you want to make sure you start restart Google Voice a lot.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Or just either the apps that you know are very sensitive to you maybe don't have them

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  automatically update. Right. Either or don't exclude them from a task killer. If you use a  task killer and then kill, I kill tasks at least once a day. So that probably is another good way  to do it. Jeff, you had your, yes, go ahead, Jay. To go back to something Kevin said earlier,

Speaker: Jay Rosen
Transcript:  we might adapt Clay Shirky's Maxim and say there's no such thing as too many apps. There's only  filter failure. I think you're exactly right. And another point I wanted to add before I have to go  is that just as he said, Kevin said that I wake up for Lifehacker every morning and I read all these  RSS feeds. And so I have this advantage. I think that's one illustration of the simplest way for  journalists to add value today. It's saving the user time. And any time that you use your time  to save the user's time or any technology that does that, or any journalistic routine that's  able to accomplish that is creating value. Because that's one of the most common and most  solid ways of becoming a useful journalist is simply to save the user time. And if more young  journalists thought about that, instead of getting stories or adding to the flood or simply recycling  old forms, they thought about new and unique ways of saving users time, they would be on the

Transcript:  right road to adding value as a journalist. Jay, inspiration. Jay Rosen, thank you. I want to let  you go because thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it. Pressthink.org.  Would love to have you back. Thanks for your very astute, I think, points about WikiLeaks. And  there's a great blog post that you've got there and I'm sure more to come. Or pleasure. My pleasure.  Thanks, Jay. Take care, Jay Rosen. We're going to actually take a break. It's a good time to take  a little break and talk about Ford and Ford SYNC because we're going to Detroit tomorrow. I'm flying  out to Detroit and I'll talk about that in just a second. We will continue on though with our picks  of the week and our number of the week. And I guess because you're filling in for Gina, you're going  to have to do a, Kevin, you're going to have to do a tip of the week. Are you ready? Are you prepared?  Hmm. Actually, I can't be.  Think about it. I'll give you time. I'll give you time. You've got the entire resources of Lifehacker  at your disposal, Kevin. That is true. That is true.  But I'd probably be Android related. I would love an Android tip. I really would as a devout  Android user. One of the things I actually want to mention is that some people complain about  hands-free on Android. There is a hands-free application, but not all the Bluetooth devices  work hands-free, truly hands-free. Ford SYNC does. It is a great match for iPhone.  I use all kinds of phones with it, but a really great match for Android as well  because when you get in the car and you pair your Android device or your iPhone device with SYNC,  it downloads the address book. And from now on, when somebody calls, they call and they're  announced by name. And when you call them, you can call them by name. That's what Ford means by true  hands-free calling. You never take your hands off the wheel. You just press the button that says,  hello, SYNC. I want to talk to you. You keep your eyes on the road. You're safe, but you can say,  call Kevin Purdy on cell. And even on Android, it will dial the number and make the call for you.  It'll play songs from... The other day, I knew that it would do it via Bluetooth using A2DP over most  Android devices. I wanted to see if the USB interface worked. It did. So it'll also index  all the songs and they'll show up. And you can call for songs by name on your Ford SYNC.  You get turn-by-turn voice directions. I know you Android folks don't care much about that,  but because of A2DP, those voice directions will come through the stereo system of your car  if you're using Android. And if you're not, SYNC also has its own turn-by-turn directions.  You can have a race to see who's better. Voice-activated podcast browsing, text messages  on some phones are read aloud. I'm going to give you a little secret. I use a Blue Ant T1  and it has an Android application that's written just for the T1 to read text messages to the T1.  It also works with the Ford SYNC. So now, it's kind of funny to hear the automated voices when  people text me. My Ford SYNC goes beep. I've got a text for you. Press the SYNC button, say,  read me the message. And it reads you the message. It even gives you a choice of pre-canned responses  you can send back. I love that. Personalized traffic alerts, weather, and so much more.  All this while keeping your eyes on the road, your hands on the wheel. You can focus on what  you're doing and where you're going. That's important for safety. It even has things like  911 assist. So it'll automatically call 911 if the airbags are deployed. Learn more about it  at syncmyridepodcast.com or go to your Ford Lincoln or Mercury dealer and take a look at  Ford SYNC. In the new 2011s, it's even updated. I just drove a 2011 Fiesta and the SYNC is getting  better and better all the time. Now, we're going to be visiting the Maker Faire thanks to Ford.  Ford's all about innovation. Their new technologies like SYNC, the new EcoBoost engine. I don't know  if you've heard about that, but that's amazing. So Ford is also supporting Maker Faire. They love  makers. They're bringing the Maker Faire to the Henry Ford Museum in Detroit. I'm going to be  going. There'll be 300 inventors, creators, builders, and innovators all there. I'm flying  to Detroit tomorrow. We'll be in Detroit Friday, July 30th. We are getting an exclusive tour of  the assembly line and some of the high-tech devices Ford uses to design cars. I'm very excited about  this. We'll begin that at 11 a.m. Eastern, 8 a.m. Pacific time at live.twit.tv. We have our Live View  unit, so we're going to be able to stream this live. And I'm even thinking, I'm hoping, we'll see  if we're going to get to take the Live View on the test track and get driven around by  their most accomplished test driver. I don't know what that's going to be like, but I can't wait.  That's on Friday and then on Saturday. We're at same time, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. Pacific, 11 a.m. to 2  p.m. Eastern time. We're going to be bringing you live coverage from the Maker Faire. And I'm very  excited to meet these engineers, designers, craftspeople. We're going to start earlier on  Friday. We're starting at 7 a.m. Pacific, 10 a.m. Eastern. Thank you, Lisa, our producer, Lisa  Kensalow, who is also our CEO, has got the schedule on that. So this is very exciting. Make  sure you check it out Friday, July 30th and Saturday, July 31st, starting early in the morning  Pacific time, mid-morning East Coast time for our coverage from Detroit. And do go to a Ford dealer,  Lincoln Mercury dealer, and check out the great Ford SYNC. Now, Mr. Kevin Purdy, I have given you  as much time as you're going to get to come up with a fantastic Android tip that's just going  to blow us out of the water. Are you ready, sir? I believe I am. It's not even my tip to lifehacker,

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  but one of our one of the cool things about Android 2.1 and 2.2, I believe, is that it has a  voice-to-text feature. And you can use that to pretty much search anywhere on the phone and  enter text anywhere on the phone. So if you're writing an email in your car, and you shouldn't  be, but you can actually write the email with your voice in little sentence bursts or whatnot.  One of our readers on Lifehacker actually wrote in and suggested that it's a really great way to do  calculations and conversions without having to, if you're cooking or if you just want to quickly  convert courts to cups or anything like that, you can just hold pretty... One thing also Android  users don't know is that you can usually just hold down the search button to bring up the voice  prompt. After a couple of seconds it comes up. After a couple of seconds it comes up. Not everybody  knows that though. Everyone thinks it's only in the search. Eight liters. Now what's going to happen?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it going to convert eight liters? Well, you just said eight liters, so I don't know what it's going

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  to... It's probably just going to tell you about... It's going to search for a band in Australia.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, eight liters. I love them. They're a great pop-up. What should I have said? What would be

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  better to say? So try something like 32 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius. Oh, okay. Let me try that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it did, by the way, look up eight liters and how many gallons is eight liters on Yahoo.  So I now know that a jug... Let's see. One drink from eight to 10 liters. There's a lot of eight  liters. Let me do the one that you suggest. So what should I say? Say try something like 32 degrees  Fahrenheit to Celsius. Do I have to say the word convert? I don't believe so. Look at that. Boom.  Well, it did 332. I maybe said an extra three. It's 166 degrees Celsius.  I think I interrupted you while you were saying it. Let me try it again. 42 degrees Celsius to  Fahrenheit. This is like the Star Trek. This is fantastic. It's working. Working. Why? That is...  I don't know what it says. Wait a minute. Oh, you know what? It looked up E-Trade for me. I don't  know. Oh, good. Good. Well... You know what? It's because I'm talking while I'm doing this.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  There's a video on Lifehacker. Android's voice-activated search is an awesome  calculator and conversion tool. And one of our commenters actually has a video up of him doing  these kind of very cool calculations and conversions. I thought that was a  pretty neat tip to come up with during a Ford Sync commercial.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I see. You did good. No, I love that. And I think that's a double tip because holding down  that search button, I just recently learned about that. And I think that that's one of the things  about Android that I just love is that dictation is everywhere. It's pretty good quality.  And you can dictate text messages, emails, and so forth. And it's really great. I just think this

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  is one of the best features of Android. Plus it gives everyone a chance to try on their radio voice.  They're highly enunciated versions of things. I am going to speak... Well, as you can see,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  it doesn't work for me. A great tip. Thank you, Kevin. Pretty. Kevin's book, by the way,  is coming. It's the complete guide to Google Android. If you just not Google,  because I guess it isn't just Google. It's the open handset Alliance.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  It's the complete guide to Android. We're about 30 days-ish from official launch.  But what I want to tell folks on Twig today was that we have a Twitter account,  twitter.com slash complete Android, or just follow Complete Android. And during the run up to the  book, we're going to be doing something around five tips, five Android tips a day. So we're not  just going to be pimping the book. We're going to be grabbing tips from the book and from our own  brains, pushing out five or so tips a day. And when the book is available for presale, we will  be offering anyone who's following us on Twitter and our Facebook fans 25% off the book when it  finally launches. And through the Twitter account. Yes. Yeah. I don't know the mechanics of it right  now, but I believe that followers of Complete Android will get 25% off the book when it launches.  I'm following you now. And like Gina's book, the complete guide to Google Wave,  the book itself will be online, but we'll also have a PDF version and a print version at some point.  So yeah, we're going to launch in roughly a month or so. It's been fun to write up all the little,  tiny little things about Android that people do and don't know. It is like Jeff said, sometimes a  operating system of Easter eggs, but it's a good one. And I think I tackled a lot of people's  first out of the box questions when they get their phone. Like, how do I do this? How do I set up this?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's good because I'm meeting a lot of people these days who are buying their first  smartphone, not just first Android phone, but their first smartphone. I met somebody when I  was in line at the DroidX and she was buying this and her son was buying this. He was going to college  and they wanted both to have it. And she said, give me some tips. And I thought, well,  that's a lot. I could tell you. Where do I start? I mentioned AppBrain was kind of my fundamental  tip, but there are a whole lot of them. I can't wait to get this book. I'm really looking forward.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that we also have a CafePress store up with these cute little  shirts and coffee mugs and bags and such that it says, I complete me by the way. And it's

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  at cafepress.com slash complete guides. All right. Great. Time for our number of the week.  I'm going to say this slowly to give Jeff Jarvis time to hear me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm going to say it is one billion. One of my favorite numbers. Eric Schmidt said to the  Wall Street Journal, according to Fortune, that Google will someday in the near future make,  what was it here? $10 billion just for mobile. And Fortune found this amazing, but  Schmidt said, well, if I made only $10 from every user and we had a billion phones, there you are.  So Fortune said, well, how do you get to 10 billion phones? They're selling 160,000  a day now. And that would take 17 years to get to a billion. But cut that in,  quadruple that, which is not a crazy rate of sale to imagine for Android going across many  countries and many kinds of devices. And in four years, you're there with a billion phones,  a billion Android phones. And then Kevin, by the way, is a very rich and valuable man.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're not kidding. And Gene is going, why did I write a book about Wave? Why Wave? Why me?  Wave, I'm sure it's just going to take off any minute now. So, you know what? I'm going to take  off my tip on your tip. And I actually had planned this a while ago, but it's from a Lifehacker  article. So I guess you get credit anyway for it, Kevin Purdy. It's that not only can you do  conversions of measurements, you can also, and this is something I use all the time on Google,  you can get time zone information because I'm always trying to figure out what the hell time is  it UTC. Well, here's my dirty little secret. And now, I'm going to use the dictation.  I'm going to press the button, time in London, and see if this works. I'm shouting at my phone.  Maybe I should get that double ARP phone. I don't know where it got buzz time in London. Let me  try that again. Time in London. I forget the buzz part. There it is. It's 10.33 PM in London BST.  London, Ontario, it's 5.33 PM. And in London, Arkansas, it's 4.33 PM. All thanks to the magic  of the Google. You don't have to have a Google phone to do that. It works on your Google page.  And I do. When you see me saying, what time is that UTC? I do that search on the Google.  Thank you, Kevin Purdy, for being here. Really great to have you. I look forward to the book,  Kevin Purdy, of course, writes for Lifehacker. And his new book, The Complete Guide to Android,  will be out soon. Follow him on Twitter to get a discount. Twitter.com slash complete Android.  Thank you so much. Thank you for being here. Jeff Jarvis is the man who wrote the book.  Not The Complete Guide to Google, but what would Google do? Although you could have called it The  Complete Guide to Google. His next book is going to be called Public Parts. He's at buzzmachine.com.  That's where he blogs. And he is right now in the Poconos, where as a matter of fact, if you ask what  time it is, it's about four seconds later than it is here. Thank you, Jeff. It's great to see you.  We'll see you all next week. Gino will be back with us on This Week in Google. Take care.
