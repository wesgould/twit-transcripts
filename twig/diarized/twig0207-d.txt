Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No more. Well, occasionally, but not as much anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just read a column from you about eating frogs in the morning for breakfast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you know, somehow that came up again.  I had written that lecture a really long time ago.  No kidding.  And got some steam online, yeah, and on Twitter.  Yeah, that was a while ago.  That's so weird.  Evergreen. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm getting that a lot with these social news sources.  Like I use Prismatic, which I love.  But I'm getting sometimes two or three-year-old articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I've gotten a few people mentioning, saying like, oh, hey, thanks for this article.  And it's like, wow, I wrote that a while ago.  But hey, I'll take it.  This is annoying.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also here, Jeff Jarvis, who is birthday-ized with his Google Peacock.  Peacock. I can't, you know, forever after.  I'm going to think Peacock when people tilt their head with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and now the great thing is we now know it could have been Peacock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It totally could have been.  No, it couldn't.  I'm going to think it's a great thing because you can't say your Wi-Fi password.  Right?  Yet.  Right.  How do you like your glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Still liking it?  I'm enjoying the laughs I get when I demonstrate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about you, Gina?  I don't see you wearing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't wear it when I'm sitting at my computer, but I do wear it when I go out on the weekends.  In fact, I was just at San Diego Pride this past weekend and I had them on.  And actually, LaToya Jackson was there, random.  She was one of the parade leaders.  And I snapped a quick picture of her and she had a little entourage.  She was in a golf cart and there were all these cameras and stuff.  But I generally, like, I take it out.  We went to the county fair.  You know, if I go for a walk, if we go down to the beach, I'll take pictures.  But if I'm sitting in front of my computer, I don't have it on because I don't need it.  I don't have the nerve to wear it in New York City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you'd get punched in the face, wouldn't you?  I think so.  It's a camera, though, right, Gina?  I mean, it sounds like the way you just described sound like a camera.  Yeah, I'm using it as a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And, you know, here in San Diego, it's really sunny.  So I always have the I often wear it with the sunglass piece, which makes the camera a little less conspicuous.  Like people don't really notice it as much.  I use it mostly as a camera.  I use it for navigation.  And I do enjoy getting text messages just kind of, you know, popped up in my face without having to check my check my phone.  But that's that's basically what I use it for.  And obviously, I take tons of pictures of the baby and little short videos of the baby that that grandma grandma and grandma love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if I said this last week, but I think it's three things.  Three, three, three minutes in one.  It's a camera. You can record your life.  Number one. Number two, it gives you alerts.  And number three, it gives you instructions, including directions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, somebody was walking.  I think was it baritone or somebody walking around New York and said this is a perfect use as as a pedestrian?  Yeah, navigation as a pedestrian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Definitely.  And even driving.  I mean, I don't recommend that you have have the navigation on while you're driving.  But there are times when I'll be in the passenger seat and have it on or I'll look up, you know, look up something beforehand to get places.  So Nav is great.  And the walking Nav is particularly good because it knows which way you're facing, which is very, very useful, especially in a dense place like New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I found another fringe benefit to having it, which is up on the rundown on the bottom thing on glass is that what I'm now dubbing glass selfies.  I demonstrate them to other people and I and of course they want to put them on and what do they do?  They take pictures.  Where they have you.  So I have a whole huge.  That's kind of cool.  Twenty eight pictures there of me.  I like that.  What a handsome fellow you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kind of like it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Me again.  Me, me, me, me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Glass selfies.  That's pretty funny, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I've heard of at least two or three publications who have asked me indirectly or through friends.  How do we get a hold of a pair, you know, some glass so we can send a writer out to do kind of stunt like see, you know, record people's reactions to it or, you know, see, see how how weird they look kind of like doing the excuse me.  But the glass look at this glass hole piece basically.  Which is which means it's jumped the shark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's over.  Yeah.  Time to move on.  Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Local news is doing glass stories.  It's over.  It's all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw.  I wish I put a blame run down.  I don't think I did.  Did I?  Oh, yeah, I did.  I did.  I did.  I did.  I did.  I did.  No, no.  Well, that not an onion headline.  This is a real headline area woman exploring use of Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How it'll affect your weekend after this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, we took it down to practice one of the NFL teams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't remember what actually needs the Washington catch a ball is pretty cool.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  South Bend Tribune.  Area woman has glass.  We have a whole glass section on our rundown here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a huge section.  We have the NFL players with glass.  We have Larry Page wearing another wedding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, don't let somebody.  Is it his wedding?  No, no.  He was a groom's man.  No.  OK.  Yes.  So what's the story?  Do we are we going to see a bunch of pictures on his Google Plus of his brother's wedding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We showed you see him doing the more subtle.  We don't see Larry Page going, OK, glass.  We see him doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You always wearing.  Now, apparently, Google has patented glass, a way of making melding glass with prescription lenses, which is good news for people like me.  Most of these are pictures of Larry's attractive wife.  It seems.  Yeah, she is attractive.  Yeah.  Where is this?  I don't know about her.  Where are the pictures?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The pictures that he took.  Yeah.  I don't know if he actually shared them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God, I don't know.  I guess I would well if it were my wedding, I would welcome somebody wearing glass because he's documenting the wedding.  Right.  We gave when I got married 20 years ago, we gave insta.  You know, this is how long ago it was in disposable instamatics to everybody.  They were at every table to take pictures and then leave them on the table.  We'll get them developed.  This is kind of like that.  Yeah.  It was in Croatia.  Nice place.  I hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah.  Nice beaches and things.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.  So NFL glass.  That one's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So are these people who lent their glass to players or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ESPN reporter put them on the players.  Oh, he had him.  OK.  She put them on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She.  They had them on the floor.  That's kind of cool.  Now, I bet you I'm thinking she had to start the recording for him.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I think he's about to throw the ball.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's cool.  I guess.  The catching is even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, you see this stuff on.  You see this stuff on NFL coverage anyway, because they have helmet cams and stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's what the coach was saying.  You know, you really could see the helmet, every helmet being equipped with this kind  of thing.  And for viewers to be able to watch the game from any player's perspective.  Right.  I don't know if I'd want that, though.  It's a little like, little Blair Witch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, because when the networks use it, it's a little it's a special thing.  You see it all the time in race cars.  They'll have special, you know, cameras in their race cars.  First person is nothing.  Yeah, there's nothing there.  Turning left.  I'm turning left now.  I'm going to turn left some more.  There's nothing new to the idea of first person.  No, no, no.  Glass just maybe makes it easier.  Easy enough for an NFL player to use.  Almost.  So Jeff demoed a glass at the Guardian activate.  That's where some of those pictures came from.  You have that was where you interviewed Vint Cerf.  Vint.  Wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just put the video up this morning.  Yay.  I want to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vint is amazing.  Yeah, we talked about the fact that you did it yesterday or last week.  But yeah.  So so actually, you should just not do the show and play the interview.  20 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the demo one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, highlights.  Anything?  You're not wearing glass during the interview.  No, I have audio from Google Glass.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay, where is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's you.  I'll see you using the screen casting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you said they very kindly edited out the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It took me like 20 times.  20 times because the way the way to turn the screencast on is you've got to  photograph the barcode on the phone with the glass.  Oh, God.  And trying to get it in the right spot is nearly impossible because you can't  preview the photo.  And so I was on stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the good first impression when they put a GoPro quality camera on this thing,  then maybe I'll be impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then I did not then in my feed, it takes a while for the photos to come up.  So then three days later, I'll see 20 pictures of half a QR code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty funny.  Here's here's something.  Mr. Robert Scoble shot with glass about about a week ago.  Look at that smiling face.  And I think I know who that is in the background here.  That affable gentleman.  This is Daria Musk, the wonderful performer who made her name on Google  Plus by doing a 24 hour broadcast and singing.  She was saying a couple of songs for us at a mystery event.  And then there's a mystery guy holding a mystery device.  Not that you would say it's a phone or confirm that I can't confirm.  I think I can tell you that that is, in fact, Rick, Rick Osterloh, who is senior  vice president for product management at Motorola.  In fact, Rick's a great guy.  I had a great time talking to him.  He's the guy who created Moto Blur.  He created the first Motorola Android phone, which is the click.  It was kind of a social media phone.  I don't know if you remember that he's he left Motorola and then came back.  Don't know why he was there.  Don't know what that is.  He's holding, by the way, there's Mike Elgin, Ben Parr, really small cable box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, that's what it was.  We were looking at the new Motorola desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You figured it out, Laura Fitton, a lot of bloggers at the event.  And if I scroll a little farther, there's a guy, Kawasaki.  How was the food?  Food was very nice.  The event was very fun.  Was it just like a barbecue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this was the there were several parts portions to the event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I could say that I should explain for those who don't know.  I foolishly signed a non-disclosure agreement.  So while I was at this event and I can't deny it because there's  Robert Scoble took video and posted it of me there.  I can't talk about what the event was, what I saw at the event, but I can do this.  I realize they didn't NDA the gift the gift bag that we're all you can see in the video.  We've all got these blue bags.  That got me really excited until I saw what was in it.  A copy of Guy Kawasaki's book, Ape, How to Publish a Book, a copy of this book, which is interesting by maybe you know this book, Jeff,  Influence, the Psychology of Persuasion by Robert B. Sialdini.  I've seen it on the stands.  Yeah, as far as my I'll read it.  It looks really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a class called a classic book on persuasion, the psychology of why people say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's called a classic book on persuasion, the psychology of why people say yes to NDAs.  Oh, that's why they that's why they gave it out.  Oh, this interesting.  Oh, no.  This is a Motorola battery pack.  I think this was the product we were there to see actually.  And then a pair of headphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I want to grill you.  I want to grill you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to ask all every question that I can.  I want to.  You know what?  I won't do that to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you can you imagine that as much as you want to ask, I want to answer.  You want to tell.  That's what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's been so many leaks, though.  There's photos of Eric Schmidt using the phone.  There's galleries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of the worst kept secret.  And in fact, I think that at this point, there's really not much that I could add.  Let's get Leo sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What can we do to get Leo sued?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, thanks.  No, I'm not going to say anything.  They were very specific.  They said you may see leaks.  You cannot confirm anything you see until the embargo is lifted.  And I think even if I were to tell you the date of the embargo being lifted, it would be a giveaway of some information as well.  However, I think that Jeff said I could say this.  I was actually very excited about what I did see.  And I think for reasons that will become clear, it's a significant thing.  OK, a very significant thing.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hmm.  You're going to regret my one, aren't I?  That's what you're saying.  I'm going to regret this.  That's what he said before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, given your preferences and phones and so forth, I'm not saying it's a phone, but given what I know about you, yes, it's a non-trivial thing.  OK, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So can we talk about the leaks or do you not want to talk about the leaks?  No, we can talk about the leaks.  All I can do is say yes or no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there were quite a few leaks and most of them are fairly credible.  I have to say, especially that Rogers video.  Yeah, that Rogers video was pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it sounds like sensors are always on listening and it sounds like battery life, although you would think that those two things would go again.  I mean, the phone always listening for the hot word, the OK Google Now seems like the kind of thing that would kill your battery.  One leak said there were two different processors doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's how that limited one was just assigned to listen.  And we certainly know the notion of listening.  We can certainly see patterns of that in number one, obviously, OK, glass and number two, we saw stuff at I.O.  that was pretty amazing that you're going to be able to say to your laptop machine, OK, Google search for Jiner Japani.  And we know that they've worked on that and they had demos of that with phones.  So right. So we know that's the pipeline.  Right. And that's how glass right.  Glass works as well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that this is really interesting because we talked a little bit about this on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you live in a world where your devices are listening all the time, do you get are you does that feel intrusive?  You know, I feel a little weird, but weirded out by that people talked about with the Xbox one, the fact that that connects camera is always listening and is always on as you know, this very Orwellian device in your house.  Yeah, but Leo, I already saw I already put up some some post on Google Plus and the fifth comment down was exactly that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's predictable. We're going to see news stories about this.  But but when we asked about that and we asked about that on the somebody asked about the floor at I.O., it only listens locally.  It only turns it on. It only wakes it up.  That's all it does. And it's local.  It is not something that goes over the network.  Right. It's not something that goes over the network.  Right. It's listening for a particular word when it hears that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, I don't know how how whatever this thing is will work.  But that's this is the Rogers video.  But that's what I think people are saying is and that's certainly how the Google Chrome was working.  It's not it's not sending everything.  Well, you have to trust Google when they say this.  It's not sending everything back.  That would be a lot of data, though.  It would be.  It's just listening for a word.  And the phone has enough or the computer has enough capability to do that.  It has enough capability to say, hey, I'm not going to do anything until I hear that word.  But when I hear that word, I'm going to say hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, on the other hand, on the other hand, we hear post NSA that they can listen to you even with your phone turned off.  They can listen to you all the time.  And these days, I don't know what to think is paranoid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Yeah.  Well, I've seen phones.  I think they were more intended for husbands to plant on their wayward wives or vice versa.  But the phones that had microphones, you could turn on cameras, you could turn on without anybody's knowledge.  So now that's a specific piece of hardware that's designed to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. If the phrase is OK, Google now, that's a little obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I would I would hope that you could customize it.  But I don't know.  That would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My Jersey version, of course, is, you know, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that'd be great.  Can you do that with the glass? You can't do that.  No, no, you can't. You have to say, OK, Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, Glass. OK, Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had the story on the rundown about how the word is was was was raised and the woman who did it very it's very funny because it's so Google.  She said that, you know, I had Google, you've got to present like 10 options.  But the problem was the first idea I had was the best idea I had.  Think of any other options. What about bacon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about go go gadget? Somebody said in the chair.  Go go glass glassic us. Pew, pew, pew.  That's good. No, it's not.  I think it'd be nice if you could customize this.  One thing that is an issue with glass.  I'll say this cryptically. There is one thing that's an issue with glass that is not an issue with this device.  That doesn't help at all, does it? Let me let me let me guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to say it. I'm going to guess that it can record the problem with glass is that even if I'm standing five feet away and someone else is worried, if I say the phrase OK, glass, glass listens.  I'm going to guess they found a way to fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That Roger's video, there was a bit about it learns your voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Big, big boy. That would be great if they could attorneys.  Atonies. Leo said nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They definitely said that. So that to me meant, yes, it knows my voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I'm afraid you might have signed that NDA on behalf of the entire network.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, you guys could do anything you want.  OK, good.  You could, you could, based on the Roger's video. That was, you know, that would be a, that would be a nice thing because I actually have seen that happen.  Oh, that happens all the time. Yeah, I could.  You know, if you say OK, glass, I could say take a picture.  It takes a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm trying to tell people how to do it.  And so I have to whisper to them.  So now it's what does it say there? Right. Say that. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then that's so frustrating.  Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And if it does know your voice, there's other things you can do like unlock.  You know, when you hear my voice, that kind of thing.  I mean, not the best security in the world, of course.  And we know the issues, the face unlock.  But but it seems like that knowing your voice is useful in a few different ways.  Yeah, you're going to be able to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I heard today some some reference to be able to go to stores and buy things with your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could say this. There are features of this phone that no one has revealed yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's exciting.  Yeah. Oh, Leo, you're killing me.  Obviously, a big thing here.  And I'm really not sure if we've hit it in the leaks and.  Oh, OK. I don't.  This is killing me a little bit.  So the voice activation, we know about what else.  What else do we know?  It's supposed to be customizable.  The backplate. The front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Said only black or white.  Black. Black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The leaks at August.  So we don't have to wait that long.  Camera looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shutter. How long do you have to return the HTC one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question.  I should look that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I may look that up right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm looking at my Play Store email.  Oh, we do know that there is a Motorola event, but I think it's a droid event on the 24th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, that's next.  That's next week.  It really.  I have my old Galaxy Nexus.  I can't remember.  I have my old Galaxy Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can send to you until you get another phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I love my one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love my one, too.  You know, it's funny. I go back and forth with the Galaxy S4 and the one.  Here's my fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My big fear. Yeah.  And if I can, after I say this, Leo, I'm going to count down from 10.  And if you leave your chair before I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I can't do anything.  They're watching me like hawks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to tell you.  Here's my fear.  My fear is that this this time they're going to suck up to the carriers and not release a pure Google Experience phone and unlocked, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  And you're going to have to buy them through the carrier because when Roger said it was exclusive in Canada to Rogers,  then we've heard reports to be more than one carrier in the US.  I hope to heck I can just buy it on the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, all I would say is and I would say this, whether I knew something or not,  all I could say is this is this I really am pretty sure is the is the everything up to now for Motorola has been in the was in the pipeline before Google's acquisition.  This is the first phone after Google that they've released after Google really got in there and said this is what we're going to do.  And I would expect to see and from what the what the what you've seen in the leaks, I think kind of confirm this.  I would expect to see a lot of influence from Google on what Motorola does here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with all of that. My fear is the business model.  We have seen Google misstep. Google's misstep twice as far as I'm concerned.  Big ways, right? The devil's deal with Verizon and going into China.  And why does Google do that? Google does that because they want to make nice with some partner, whether that's the Chinese government or Verizon.  And that's what always gets them in trouble. When Google does what Google wants to do, it does the right thing so far as a rule.  Or maybe the third possibility, of course, is the NSA.  No more about that later. Right. So so if there are moments that come along when Google makes nice with phone companies, for example, I think only because they've had to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Apple was the first one to really have the clout to say to a phone company, no, we're going to do it this way.  For instance, the iPhone, one of the reasons I think people love the iPhone is there's so there's little or no crap wear on it.  It is a pure phone, no matter who you get it from.  And it's one of the reasons I was just reading an article today about you cannot legitimately buy an iPhone in Russia because the major Russia, the three, four major Russian carriers who dominate the market are just don't like Apple's  egregious requirements. Yeah. And so they just said, well, we're not going to sell it.  And there's a big black or gray market in iPhones, apparently, but nobody's selling it directly in Russia.  And I think that if they could have if the if the iPhone hadn't been as successful as it was, I think you would have seen a very different experience.  But Apple really put the screws to these guys. The question is, why hasn't Google does Google have something?  Is it possible Google has something that gives them enough clout that they could do that?  I think at this point, Android, it's very clear Android is a platform at least half of your customers want, if not more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And the T-Mobile model we talked about last week and since then the AT&T model, which lets you upgrade sooner than two years, though I think the Verge said stay away from the AT&T model, but whatever.  I wonder whether those are maybe perhaps in response to what they expect from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also think it's interesting that Google's done these two Google experience phones.  I think to some degree that this HTC One and Galaxy S4 were ways of saying to the their partners, look, yeah, we own a phone company and we're and we're about to come out with a phone.  But really, we love you guys, too. See, you're in our store, too, which tells me you don't do that.  I would guess you're about to come out with something big and you plan to sell it as well.  Well, but then the next problem is. So that seems to me my strategic thinking would be, OK, if you're Google, we want to sell this store in our we want to sell this phone in our store.  If we do that, though, if we make it, let's say a Nexus, this is going to now this is our company.  You know, we've the previous Nexuses were what LG and HTC, Samsung and Samsung.  So if we now suddenly say what Google doesn't want to do is tell those guys who are very successfully selling Android phones, we'll take it from here.  So to me, that would explain why all of a sudden you saw the HTC One and Galaxy S4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, the next nightmare scenario is they put it up there next to those two phones and those two phones are selling for six hundred bucks.  And meanwhile, the Nexus four sold for 200. Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I was distracted. Did you say something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, OK. God, I hate this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo has news to patients. I would really not be like I'd be a terrible corporate executive.  I am a terrible corporate executive.  You have Lisa. She you know, she is great at secrecy.  She can she you know, but the problem is I know it.  And so I say it, she's got no problem. She was with me.  She saw the whole thing. He saw the whole thing.  And I have to say, she did do she did a great job of negotiating some stuff.  Really? I won't say what that is either.  Ketchup. Yeah, we got great deal on ketchup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  X is for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a terrible poker player, too.  Oh, here she comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's got the goods.  I'm starting to sweat now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Starting to sweat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She says, I just want to make sure you're not saying anything you shouldn't say.  Well, I went through the bag already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, he's been good.  Tell Lisa I say that you've been good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff is a journalism professor.  I'm using him as my guide as to what I can and cannot do.  Did you did you save that thing we signed?  Did you get a copy of it? I didn't.  No, no, I mean, I think we should have a copy of it so we know what we signed.  I forgot I forgot to ask for one anyway.  Yeah, we won't talk about it.  That's what we said. She's going back into her office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something tells me we're changing the subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we let's change this out because this is killing me, too.  I'm just I want to just start yelling out things.  But let's just. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the the the rumors are that and this is another interesting one.  And by the way, I do not know anything to remain on this one.  The Google was is going to spend half a billion dollars on marketing the Moto X phone.  And I have no idea about that.  But what's interesting is that's that's more than Apple spends marketing the iPhone half a billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want something that's going to make the other manufacturers nervous.  That's going to make that's going to make them crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the other hand, that may be for Verizon Sprint, AT&T and the carriers.  Right. Co-op deals. Co-op.  That's basically if you said I'm going to give one hundred million dollars to each of them  and then I'll have one hundred million for ads, that might make sense.  Yeah, yeah. Because it's worldwide, too. It's worldwide.  Yeah, actually, that half billion is not just in the U.S.  It includes Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been announced that they're going to they're going to manufacture a phone.  This phone in the U.S. That's that's not even a leak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have said that. Yes.  Is it allowed?  And that's the thesis on that is that will allow them to customize it.  You know, and this is something Apple isn't really able to do.  Apple, in order to make the vast number of phones they have to make, has to make it in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And here's my concern there. I'm just being worryworn today.  My concern there is we're going to be hitting the button again and again and again and again.  We're going to have to wait for months before we can order the darn phone.  You know, are they going to have sufficient stock and capacity?  And I'm sure you didn't discuss that at the lunch that didn't happen.  I might have. That worries me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I might have talked about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is like how to torture.  You know, for me, you want to torture me, drop me on a bridge. Right.  Yeah.  For other people, you want to torture them, you know, have them with rats.  Yeah.  For Leo, tell him something he can't repeat.  Yeah.  Torture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish I could. I mean, there's been a lot said.  And there's and I think the most important thing is there's more to say.  That's the one thing I think that's fair to say.  There is more to say, you know, for all that's been leaked and there's been a lot leaked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Gina, what's the return policy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to have to send this back.  I mean, if Leo, I'm going to have to send this thing back, aren't I?  Not yet. Not yet. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It could be 14 days or 30. It's either 14 days or 30 days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I got. I got to find out. I'm still I'm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does the chat room, does anybody know what the return policy is on the Google 30 days in the place?  Somebody's White House 75 said 30 days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got plenty of time.  I don't trust the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got plenty of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK. OK. OK. All right. So August, early August, we're going to know.  I'm just saying.  Just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't worry. You got time to return your phone.  Somebody else said 14 days.  Oh, no. Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, I'm looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fifteen percent restocking fees, says Web 96.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fifteen days would be problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK. Oh, now we're really check order status.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, by the way, did you see that?  So T-Mobile had this, you know, plan that every six months new phone.  We talked about it last week.  AT&T and Sprinter doing the same thing, although some have said it's a really crappy deal if you do the AT&T deal.  The Verge has a rundown on the AT&T.  It's financially a bad idea, but I bet you people do it just because they want some excuse to get a new phone every six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the jump.  I find it better just to buy the darn phone open and then and then and then add it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now Google is having an event in one week on July 24th in the morning.  Sundar Pichai will be there now.  Unfortunately, used to be if it were Sundar, you'd say, oh, it's Chrome.  It would not not now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now he's Android and Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you don't know which.  Damn it.  So we don't know what that will be about.  I 4.3 sounds sounds like it might be.  Because we haven't heard much about that.  I'm getting the feeling at this point that.  There's even 4.3 Android is not going to be a big change.  Do you get that feeling?  Yeah, yeah, no, it isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It isn't all we know about it is that there's going to be some camera UI changes.  But the fact that it's a minor release, I don't think it'll be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let me ask a couple questions about that.  So so.  If always on listening is just part of the OS, is that potential or do you think that has to be built in to the hardware?  I mean, we know the impact on batteries going to be, but who knows what was built into this hardware before?  That's one question.  Second, is you have the phone stuff that the Rogers video showed some really neat camera stuff where you didn't have to hit a button.  You could hit the screen. You could do other things that I presume is just OS changes.  So we could see some of the things that were shown in that video that Leo can't confirm.  Yeah, of those things could be in the next version of the OS.  What are those things couldn't be because the hardware dependent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should also say that might not be the other thing he could be announcing his new tablets.  So they're overdue for an Exis 7 replacement.  They sure are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing he could be announcing is I don't know what this is the Chromebooks new Chromebooks.  Could it could there be an update to Chrome OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What they are they constantly updated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a constantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but I mean, like some big thing like like they're releasing.  We did a deal with Dell or something.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they could they could be doing the OK Google voice thing for machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd love to see a mid pre a $400 Chromebook that was like the HP one is out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The HP has 14 inch screen and 16 gigs for four gigs.  Memory was supposed to two, which is really good.  16 gig solid state drive.  I went into Best Buy and looked at it.  It's still pardon me.  It's still HP.  Yeah, I would have had is that is that weird bumpy thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use I mentioned on Twitter that my Chromebook pixel is my breakfast computer.  It's on the table and I it's the only time I use it is breakfast, sometimes a little bit watching TV because it isn't really a full computer.  It's a browser.  It's a browsing computer.  But I do think for students that it's not a bad idea.  And this is a breakfast event.  Apparently you're going to be breakfast.  It's a breakfast.  So I'm thinking maybe Sundar heard me.  I'll bring my I'll bring my pixel.  Are you going to recover?  I wasn't invited.  Oh, just because I know Guy Kawasaki apparently does not get me into other events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and there will be a live stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we probably should cover that.  You know, the 24th is the second anniversary of our moving into our new studio.  So we're going to be having a party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  Time flies.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never did find my break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is good timing.  This is right before the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I guess we probably will.  I hadn't really this invitation went out this morning, but I think that that's probably what we'll do.  I'm just checking to see if I have an email from Sundar, but I don't see anything.  So Jason, did you get an invitation to the Google event on Wednesday?  Did anybody here get an invitation?  No, no.  So was that before that?  It's breakfast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we'll know what it is by the time our show is on.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's good timing.  We'll be able to discuss.  So any bets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to bet a Nexus seven or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody said in the chat room, there's a rumor that it will be a two ninety nine versus one ninety nine.  I keep on picking up the note eight because I would like to have the pen, but it's just that extra inches down.  Extra inches.  Just so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, what we found with our reviewers is that in order to get it to be work with a stylus, you have to put this Wacom layer on top of it that reduces the quality of the screen.  Oh, that's what you said, Jason.  Right. You didn't like the notes as screen as much.  And we think it's because it had to do that had to do with the stylus.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wacom or Wacom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't care.  I like Wacom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You said that I was like, oh, what now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Wacom, Wacom, whatever.  I like Wacom.  I just say because I like to say Wacom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if we think Moto X is August, then we think that this event next week is I would be surprised if it was a new Nexus seven or a new Chromebook or maybe both.  This seems this seems like a pretty low key.  Join us for breakfast with Sundar.  It seems kind of maybe like just a little just a little thing.  Yeah, it could be an update to I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He does what he does Android and Chrome.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Android and Chrome.  It could be Android for four to three.  Yeah, it could be the new Nexus seven.  It could really could be either or both.  Although I don't see them announcing anything about Chrome that isn't a new Chromebook.  Right. Because Chrome constantly updates.  And we've just seen a bunch of Chrome stuff in preview at I.O.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I don't know.  So to get back to the jump plan, Eric Ravenscraft writing on Lifehacker did a breakdown of the T-Mobile, the AT&T frequent up grader plan.  You know, it's so hard to figure this out.  As across the board, he says you will pay more both over the short term and the long term.  Of course, you don't get to keep a device.  You don't finish paying off.  These are trade ins.  And it doesn't mean it.  One thing it does mean is if you owe anything on the phone, you're stuck with the carrier unless you pay off the phone.  The other thing he says is that AT&T next is a huge rip off.  Yeah.  So they did an infographic.  So with the AT&T two year contract based on 90 dollars a month for service and 200 dollars upfront for the phone, your cost of your phone is 2360 dollars.  With Next, it goes up to 2800 dollars.  And you don't, I guess you get the same ability to keep it.  That's with no upgrade.  So in other words, if you do the same thing, you keep the phone for two years, it still costs you 440 dollars more.  540, 440 dollars more over the two years.  If you do one upgrade, it goes up to 2928 dollars and your monthly cost goes up to 122 dollars.  So really, don't do it.  You're better off just to buy it.  If you do the AT&T next two years, you do one upgrade with a buyout, your monthly cost goes up to 122 dollars from 90 dollars.  Your total cost is 3184 dollars and you get to keep one one year old phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it have comparables for the T-Mobile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the T-Mobile is not as bad, but it says T-Mobile's jump plans are better, but frequent upgrades are still costly.  So yeah, you're really better off buying the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're better off to buy a phone and then sell it either on eBay or through...  Gazelle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gazelle makes this pretty straightforward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and you're going to be better off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see what your HTC One is worth.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no.  You know what?  I love the one and I don't know what I'm going to do.  I'm not saying I'm going to...  Well, you're going to buy everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You buy everything so you can use it.  There's never an or for you.  It's always an and for you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, they don't have the Google edition as an option, but I'll choose factory unlocked.  32 gigs?  Yeah, you got the 32 or the 60.  There is no 16.  32 or 64.  244 bucks.  That's not real great.  It's like half what you paid.  I can always give this to one of my developers, but I do love this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you're going to love it.  What do you like best to best?  You're not getting the thing I like best, which is the Zoe's and the highlights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's such a big upgrade from the Galaxy Nexus.  It's really fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The screen is longer, even though the handset is the same size.  In my app, you can see a whole other to-do item at the bottom of the screen.  I love that the speakers are on the front.  I listen to podcasts.  I watch YouTube's live.  Isn't that brilliant?  Yes.  I like that I can put the phone down on its back on the table, see the screen,  and hear the speakers at the same time.  That's a very simple thing, but it's a very nice thing.  I agree.  Yeah, and the screen looks amazing next to the Galaxy Nexus.  It is just a big upgrade for me.  I know, Leo, you have all the best phones.  You have the GS4 there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I go back and forth with the GS4 and the One.  I like the one.  The non-removable battery can...  What's your battery life been?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's been really quite good so far.  It hasn't crapped out on me midday.  It's been fine.  I've been able to stay on the phone all day, which is basically my requirement,  just making the day with me.  It hasn't been an issue.  As long as I plug it in at night, it's been fine.  Well, then that's fine.  Yeah.  Hopefully, it'll stay that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know enough about what the Moto X is to know whether that's going to be a good upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now he equivocates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe you'll find out soon enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The always listening thing.  I know Jeff is going to yell at me.  I don't love that idea.  I get that it's local.  You do have to trust Google about that, which I kind of do.  Also, I think, do consumers really conceptually differentiate between what happens locally  on the phone and what gets sent back over the wire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is why people like you, who are very smart about technology, need to explain  this to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I think, well, remember HAL 9000 and 2001, A Space Odyssey?  The goal of a computer that responds and interacts with you, it would have to listen, just like  your friend listens.  So to have a truly interactive computer that does what you want it to do, it has to do  a lot of the things Google's building in, like know ahead of time what you want.  I mean, the perfect servant's one that knows you want a cup of tea before you even ask  for it and has it ready the minute you want it.  I think that's what Google's trying to do.  Yeah, absolutely.  And I think that's what people, truthfully, I think that people don't care as much about  privacy as we say they do, as we do.  And I think that if it's super convenient and super cool, they're not even going to  think twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically, never say anything out loud to your phone that you wouldn't want the NSA  to know.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just, I don't think that's wiping my finger up on my phone to have it start listening.  Is that, is that?  Yeah, that's what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina's trying to convince herself she doesn't want that feature.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I mean, you know, we hooked up the Kinect in our living room.  We hooked up the Kinect.  You know, my wife was like, is this thing going to be like taking pictures of us the  whole time that we're like watching TV and, you know, living our lives?  Can you imagine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why would it?  What is more boring?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  We are pretty boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do they want with pictures of you watching TV?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who cares?  There's all this sense of like, there is this sense of surveillance and it is this sense  of like, of watching to see, you know, have I done the Kinect hand wave, which that doesn't,  it doesn't actually look for the hand wave until you go into, you have the Xbox on in  a Kinect enabled game.  Yeah, you turn it on.  Yeah.  Right.  Turn it on.  Right.  You can see it come on and scan the room.  And there's something comforting about that.  Okay.  I know I'm being super paranoid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the new one doesn't do that though.  The new one's always watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, the new one's just always kind of listening.  And always listening, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think probably folks will just get, people just get kind of used to this.  And you're right.  Sending that, all that data over the line.  I know, I know logically that that would make no sense.  And then it is the most boring thing.  Nobody cares that much.  No one cares that much.  But you know, what the NSA wants to, wants to, you know, Microsoft to broadcast all the  streams from the Kinect devices in everybody's living room.  Like, what are they going to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What they would do is they would say, okay, we, you know, we think Gina Trapani has been  doing something illegal.  Let's turn that one on.  Let's tap that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's tap that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then they would be interested in what you're doing.  And some poor schmuck would have to sit and watch you watch TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And reports have it that they can do that anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can do that anyway.  Right, but I'm helping them.  I'm like, I'm equipping my home with surveillance devices.  Yeah.  You know, it's convenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Notice how easy that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So if I buy tea from a suspected terrorist, because they're doing two, three hops now,  you know, I,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you actually don't have to buy tea from a suspected terrorist.  You have to buy tea from somebody who bought tea from somebody who bought tea from a suspected  terrorist.  Right.  So that's pretty much all of us.  But, but, but, you know, I think it's safe to assume that you're, you know, I use encryption.  So my stuff's being collected.  Just safe to assume your stuff's being collected, whether they're looking at it or, or,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's the same rule.  You never say anything in email that you wouldn't want to appear on the front page of the New  York Times.  You know, hello or,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well now you can't say anything around your phone or your connect.  That gets a little bit restrictive.  Yeah, I mean,  Do we have to get a Kona silence in the house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a thing.  I mean, this is my home.  I'm having conversations with my family.  Like, you know, it's a little different.  I'm typing email to, to friends and colleagues.  And yes, I've typed personal things in emails to friends and to my spouse.  But there's something about doing that data entry and feeling like, oh, this is a document  that I'm now sending off to the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Glass.  Glass is listening to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is.  Well, no, right?  Because you have to, you have to tap it to wake it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, right.  Maybe that tap is just for your convenience.  Let's sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina and I were having a conversation before we got on the air.  I have a reason to encrypt email.  And so I never done it.  Don't know.  And she was great.  She gave me a wonderful plugin for Chrome called MailVelope.  Easy enough for Jarvis.  That's, that's, that's the standard here.  Right.  So I put it in, but it still presumes essential knowledge about how to encrypt.  And I still don't didn't get the basic.  What do you do then?  Then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I wrote up this post.  I did point out that MailVelope has been hacked.  But other than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't know that.  Sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How has it been hacked?  It's still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When was MailVelope hacked?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if they've patched it.  It uses a strong encryption uses open PGP.  So that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  As long as you do it outside of the client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's hard to do.  Oh, yeah.  If you do it outside the client, you're fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's what you're doing.  So I asked you to write the email and encrypt it outside.  Yeah.  Then it's not hacked.  Cut and paste it in.  Okay.  I don't think.  I still couldn't figure out what's what.  So I wrote up this post.  I was all wrong.  I was completely wrong.  But nobody just said simply, oh, no Jarvis.  It's one, two, three, four, five.  No, this huge debate about is PGP good enough?  What are you doing this?  What are you doing?  It's the religion of the encryption church is obnoxious.  It is obnoxious.  And it turns everybody off to try to use this stuff because it's overcomplicated.  It's over argued about.  It just drove me baddie.  And finally, finally, you'll be glad to know Leo.  Somebody put in a link to what's the name of the how to show you did?  Yeah, know how.  Yeah.  Know how.  We talked about open PGP.  11 in the encryption show on know how.  Boom, made it easy.  Figured it out.  I had to go through three days of torture of encryption, people yelling at each other  around me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twit TV slash K H five zero.  If you want to watch that 11, if you now trust using mail, it is exactly where you learn

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  how to use mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They use the title is a little deceptive because there is PGP, which is a commercial product.  They actually use open PGP via GNU GNU Privacy Guard, which is what I recommend.  And it's very good way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But jeez, it's you're right, Leo, when you've said before, and they demonstrate mail below,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which right?  Yeah.  The problem with mail below is somebody would have to have access to your computer, which  we're presuming that you haven't given physical access to your computer to somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's open source and it was just updated five days ago.  I know it's fine patch pretty.  Yeah, it's very easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's good.  But but man, because I thought here's here's how screwy I was trying to understand just  the concept of how open key works.  I've never I've always just let it wash over my head.  So I thought I had to somehow get the password I was using to the person I was sending the  email to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, that's right.  That's a reasonable thing.  Yeah, that's a reasonable thing.  But that's what that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought that I was encrypting it with my key and then they were going to know instead  I'm encrypting something to them with their key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Well, the point of public key cryptography, which is once you get it, is brilliant is  in the old days in order, you know, like secret decoder ring days in order for somebody to  decode it, you would have to have a shared secret.  Right.  And the problem is how do I get the shared secret to you so that you know you but public  cryptography eliminates that there are two keys.  There's a public key which I can give out.  You can give out.  Anybody can have all that does is encrypts.  It doesn't decrypt it only encrypts.  And then there's a private key which you keep to yourself and you use a strong passphrase  to protect.  And that's your private key.  And that is the decryption key.  So you can give out the public key and then that solves that whole issue of shared, you  know, shared secret.  That's such a brilliant and wonderful thing that it just solves all of these problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And let me make sure I got the straight.  You send me your public key.  I don't have to send it to your public key.  Right.  Well, yeah, you said you sent it to me or I get it.  I have your public key.  I use that to encrypt something.  I send it to you and you can decrypt it because you have the key.  Because I have a private key.  Because I have a private key.  My key to encrypt my stuff to you.  No, no, no.  I use your key to write something to encrypt it to you.  Right?  Right.  That simple thing took me three days of yelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Told me baddie.  Absolutely baddie.  these encryption geeks.  And the great thing is somebody said they pointed me to the nicest encryption security  person there is, of course, is Steve.  And somebody sends me to one of his wonderful transcripts.  But I got 100 pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's hard.  You can't do it that way.  And he doesn't do much.  That was way over your head.  That was not.  He doesn't dumb it down.  That was definitely not the right direction to send you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I would absolutely baddie to get this figured out.  I'm sorry.  If I had known, I probably could have.  You solved it.  Because your show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I actually wasn't on that show.  But I as in snubs solved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's too hard.  It's too hard.  I mean, when you asked me, Jeff, I was like, oh, this malevolent.  I mean, for someone just, you know, using regular kind of Gmail, I went with malevolent  because I was like, this is web based and it works for Gmail.  And it's just too hard.  I mean, who's using, you know, not a lot of people are using Thunderbird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  It's a lot more straightforward in a client to do it on the web is both more tacky and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's mostly more difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It should become risky.  So when I talked about this with with Vint Cerf, he agrees that number one, of course,  they use SSL.  That's to start off with.  And he agrees that we should make it easier to do this.  But when I talked to him about the what we talked about the show before about the problem  of my Google Now boarding pass, in his view, is you encrypt up to their box the things  inside their box are not encrypted because you trust them to hold on to it unless, of  course, there's a warrant.  Right.  But it's not a snooping problem then.  Right.  And into the box and out of the box should be encrypted.  But in the box shouldn't be so that Google can then act on it to your benefit.  And I agree with that architectural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's in Google's interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's also in my interest as a user because I want to be able to get my boarding  pass.  I want Google now to be smart about it.  I'm upset.  I don't know enough about me.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the interesting balance because true privacy, obviously, encryption doesn't  work with Google now because you're hiding stuff from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Because what would actually be stored on Google servers would just be a jumble of letters  numbers.  Right.  So they wouldn't be able to advertise or do any personalization or any third party app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think what you got to do if you really want to do this is you use Gmail day to day.  And when you want something private, you do something else.  Or you use mail volop and you don't encrypt it until it's, you know, you don't have to.  I'll tell you one thing, the airlines never going to send you your boarding pass encrypted.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That ain't going to happen.  So you're safe there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  So personal one to one communications about sensitive topics.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, and you don't want Google now to know about that anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, didn't Snowden go to the Guardian blogger and say, hey, I need to send you something  encrypted?  And he was like, I don't know what Snowden wanted to use open PGP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And Glenn Greenwald didn't figure it out.  I think they did later.  But this is important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Part of the reason I'm doing all this, I have a very specific reason to do this.  But as a journalism instructor, you know, I had this discussion with somebody interviewing  me the other day.  What's a journalist to do now?  Try to deal with the source.  How do we know that we can communicate with the source?  We can't just the metadata alone.  Right.  The fact that, oh, this person talked to somebody at that exchange and that exchanges the New  York Times.  We're going to watch it.  So metadata alone means that journalists cannot in any way open way even contact confidential  sources.  Right.  So then how do you do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The way spies have done it for a million years, you use a dead drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  Yep.  But that's that becomes ridiculous.  And the other thing that I've long argued that ever since the original New York Times  story on the warrantless wiretaps, the part of my argument long since has been that what  the NSA actually wants to a great extent is baseline data so they can see anomalies.  And we're the baseline.  Right.  Or in the words of Alexander, we're the haystack.  And once we have the haystack, then they can see, aha, that's a very strange pattern there.  That doesn't fit the pattern of so-and-so calling somebody.  And that's things like throw away phones.  Gee, a phone that was always used only used once in a month.  Hmm.  That's a giveaway, huh?  Now we can go back and look at all the phones that were used only once in a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I'm worried about all my development phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean your burners?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My burners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So the wire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The wire taught me everything I need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's anomalous.  It's anomalous behavior.  And you don't want to be anomalous.  No.  In a world where they, in the words of General Alexander, collect it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need to develop your spy craft.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That sounds like the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that, this is your new sponsor?  Yeah.  We should, we should actually, we should take a break and talk.  This would be great.  Just teach everybody dead drops, you know.  Come on, we've all watched those, you know, those movies where you put a, you take a piece  of chalk and you put a mark on a rock and then you stick the secret code in there and  then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That'd be interesting to get Steve going because I know you just did the episode about, you  know, how much tinfoil do you put in your hat.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which was by the way a great idea.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a great idea.  But it'd be nice to challenge Steve outside of technology.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you take his security brain and then put it to those kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he does that all the time.  He's building a device to get dogs to stop barking.  You don't, you don't know Steve.  This guy's insane.  He's unbelievable.  Yeah, he's insane.  We're going to take a break and we will come back with more.  We are talking, my friends, about everything having to do with cloud and Google and all  of that stuff.  And our show today brought to you by our great friends at LegalZoom.com.  If you are in a business, if you are in a family, if you live life, you need legal documents.  But you don't need to get, and this is the cool thing, a lawyer to make them up for you.  LegalZoom is not a law firm, but it does help you create those important legal documents.  It turns out you can do it yourself with a little help from LegalZoom.  Just follow their simple step-by-step questionnaires online and you can incorporate S or C Corp.  You can make an LLC.  That's actually how I did it.  And we're still using those legal papers.  $99 to do an LLC or an incorporation.  You got a trademark, you got a brand you want to preserve?  BuzzMachine.com, SmarterWear.org.  I would suggest a trademark.  Easy to do.  $169 plus the government filing fees.  Now, if you have a family or you have assets, you really want to protect them.  Without a will, the courts decide where your kids go, where your assets go, and it's $69  to create a last will on LegalZoom.com.  LegalZoom makes it very easy, very effective.  And I think this is the ultimate democratization.  I love this.  What's interesting is they predate the internet or at least the widespread use of the internet.  LegalZoom has helped 2 million Americans over the last 12 years do all of these and many  more legal documents for affordable price.  They now have something that they didn't have when I used LegalZoom back in 2005.  They have attorneys.  They've negotiated fixed price attorneys.  The LegalZoom legal plan allows you to speak to an attorney in your state.  They have profiles and unedited reviews online so you can pick the attorney right for you  at a flat rate, fixed rate so you can get advice.  It's a perfect complement to the LegalZoom document generation stuff.  It's really, I think this is just wonderful.  This is empowering for all of us.  A lot of, you know, you want to start a little startup, you don't have necessarily the money.  I didn't for legal fees to start that LLC, but LegalZoom made it possible.  Why don't you start making your dreams come true and protect your family while you're  at it.  LegalZoom.com, if you use our offer code TWIG, you can take 10 bucks off at purchase.  That means that last rule is only $59.  That's a good deal.  LegalZoom.com, please when you buy, use the offer code TWIG.  It is time, ladies and gentlemen, for the Google Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Google Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do do do do do do do do.  And now Gina Trapani with the Google Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google's new maps redesign, which we covered back at Google I.O. during the show, is now  open to everyone.  No invite required.  You do have to opt in though to see it.  So I think you go to Google.com slash maps slash preview and you'll be able to get the  new maps.  I think we've talked about all the new features in the new maps extensively.  It's a much more full screen experience with cards for local information and results right  in map looks really good.  And we've seen a bunch of maps updates, actually.  Google Maps for I.O.S. got a new new interface, better, better navigation, looks really great  on the iPad and Google Maps for Android updated as well to match the desktop version.  That is rolling out slowly.  I did get it on my Android devices.  And we talked about this a little bit as well.  Latitude is no longer in, but really, really nice interface changes on maps across I.O.S.  and the desktop on the Web and Android.  The Play Store got a huge redesign this week.  Have you seen this, Leo?  It's complete.  Looks completely different.  Play.Google.com.  Basically, the web based version now looks like the mobile version.  It's got that sort of card based Google Now kind of card layout based design, huge app  icons, really kind of nice, nice, nice layouts, reviews, review functionalities, a little  different on individual pages.  You can view a list of your apps which are installed across your devices.  When you go to install an app, you'll see all your devices listed.  Interestingly, I saw Google Glass listed as one of those apps, kind of hints that maybe  Glass will get installations from the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've had those devices before.  I mean, that's been around for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they've had the list of compatible devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that that is a real selling point on Android.  It is.  You can install from the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am a little frustrated.  I use the Nexus 7 when I'm traveling, which I've been doing a lot lately, I use the Nexus  7 to watch huge amounts of stuff.  And so I'm watching Breaking Bad and all those kinds of great things on it.  They've changed it a little bit so it's harder to see as many shows at once and watch a buy  and it's also harder to see what shows you own.  It's all there and everything.  But they kind of mucked it up a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit.  It's otherwise very pretty.  It's very nice.  I like it all.  But I like what they have.  If anybody here from Google happens to be listening, my management of shows before was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  better.  What's working well though is the recommendations.  Is this new, the recommendation engine?  I like this.  And this is doing a good job.  Yes, it does a nice job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My recommendations are also pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine used to recommend things to me that I already had installed.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon does that too.  You bought this so maybe you'd like to buy it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then when you do buy it again it says, hey you fool, you already bought this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, it's so stupid.  It's interesting.  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm getting up for an app that I tried the trial.  It's pushing the premium version.  So I'm recording notifications.  I mean that makes sense.  I might likely.  But I looked at that, I glanced at it and thought I have it installed already and then  realized that I had installed the premium version.  Yeah, it looks really nice.  One of the nice things that it does is it's got that add to wishlist button front and  center now on the web.  That was previously only showing up devices.  I didn't realize that the Play Store had a wishlist.  I love wishlists.  I would say like, hey, I want this app.  Oh, I want that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And yeah, I wonder, I'm not sure if you can share your wishlist or like I would love to  be like, oh, you know, Jeff did a nice thing for me today.  I'd like to maybe buy him an app from the Play Store.  It would be nice if you can kind of just easily look at somebody's wishlist and give them  an app.  And it seems like they're moving in that direction.  What else do we have?  Oh, we have got some Chrome for Android updates.  The stable version updated with built-in Google Translate and full screen support on tablets.  So if you go to a page that's in a language that is not your native language, Google  Translate will prompt you to automatically translate that content.  And just like it works on the phones now on tablets, it'll go full screen.  So your Omnibox or your address bar will kind of go back up into the top of the Chrome,  like as you scroll.  So you get more room to read just content.  And that's Chrome stable for Android.  Chrome beta for Android updated to version 29 and it's got WebRTC.  Yay.  Faster page loads.  Yeah.  We'll soon be doing the show, I predict.  Yes, we will soon be doing the show via WebRTC on our Android devices.  That'd be very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're actually looking at some hardware that might help us.  We can't do it right now because of limitations with our hardware, the Blackmagic hardware,  right, Chad?  The video in card is a little finicky, but we're looking at new hardware that might work  with WebRTC better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there's a Chrome 29 beta for Windows, Mac and Linux also released.  And that's it seems like they're just kind of speeding up.  Not for the Chromebook.  Not for Chrome OS didn't get the 29.  Chrome 29 didn't come to you, Jeff?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you won't get it unless you're on the beta channel, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the beta channel.  When you are on the beta channel, it didn't come down.  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we're actually behind in that sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  29.0.1547.22 beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The version numbers are nuts.  They're totally nuts.  It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're putting the build number into the version number, I suspect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that must be it.  And then a quick item that I missed last week, the One Today charity app.  I think we talked about it a while, Google releases Android app called One Today.  It's basically like social charity that used to be invite only.  It's now open to everyone.  So I love One Today.  I use it a lot.  In fact, I just posted, I just donated to today's project and I said make it a match.  So if you look at my Google press profile, you'll see I gave a dollar to the nonprofit  project, Raspberry Pi materials.  It gives Raspberry Pi to girls in tech courses.  And I'll match your donation.  And it works really well.  You can either just give a dollar or you can say I'll match my friend's donations up to  a certain amount.  So I think in this case, I could match up to like 60 bucks.  And I said, I'll match up to 10 bucks.  So it's a really cool way to say, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've already maxed it out, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've maxed it out.  Yay.  Yay.  You should still donate.  But you can only do it once a day.  You can't do it more than once a day.  And I find that I just give more, I give more money to charity, which is kind of something  I want to do and more causes that I care about.  And it's really simple.  It's just your Google wallet.  And sometimes most days I just say, okay, yeah, a dollar.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I'm spending more than that.  Is that how it works?  Is it just a dollar or can you give more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just a dollar.  If you want to give more, you can say I'll match up to an amount, a certain amount, and  they cap it.  So it's usually, I've never seen an amount over $60 if your friends donate.  So it's a little challenge to your friends to do that.  It's a challenge to your friends.  Or I can go in and it'll say, hey, Leo donated.  Will you match his donation?  And you'll be like, yeah, I'll give a dollar in Leo's and that will count toward your  match.  I'm signing up right now.  One social pressure.  One today.  One today.  Google.com.  You know, some projects I'm not so interested in.  Others I'm like, yeah, I really believe in this cause.  So I think it's encouraged good behavior, I think, on my part.  I want to give more to charity from different causes and I definitely have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just to be clear, you don't have to have a device that Google wallet works on.  It uses your Google wallet to pay, but you don't have to have, because none of my devices,  I don't know what Google wallet works on the Nexus for, I guess, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Doesn't work on any of my devices.  It's just if you have a Google wallet account.  And you get to a place, I think you get to 10 bucks or 15 bucks and it says, hey, will  you pay your balance?  You've got a balance.  Oh, I see.  They aggregate it up.  That's good.  And yeah, they aggregate it up.  So you're not going through the whole payment process every time.  And then you just say, yeah, sure.  Pay, you know, debit my account.  And they do so.  And it's nice.  It's a good app.  Cool.  And that's it.  That's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Learn about a new project from a nonprofit every day.  Show your support by giving as little as a dollar.  Which is how little I'm going to give.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's the change.  Yeah, baby.  That was a Memorex moment.  Or something.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know what that was.  Let's see.  Gina, wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you even know what I mean when I say Memorex moment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should I?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that a commercial reference?  You're too young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're too young.  Yeah, I think you guys think I'm a lot younger than I am.  Was that a commercial thing?  I'm Googling Memorex moment.  Oh, come now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think she's from the era of recording tape, Jeff.  No, that's it.  It was a commercial thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a commercial thing for me.  But I'm not a commercial thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just a computer.  I'm not a computer.  I'm not a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not a computer.  I'm not a computer.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was better recorded Memorex and it has a guy sitting in front of a speaker and he's  blown back.  Yeah, I love that.  Memorex tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then they had Ella Fitzgerald.  Is it live or is it Memorex?  That goes even farther back, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  I recall the dude sitting in the chair getting blown back from a speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you saw that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I've seen that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you didn't see Ella breaking the glass in the Memorex ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think so.  There's the guy.  Everybody's seen that.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, see, I'm not as young as you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do not think, by the way.  Gina, I am as old as you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now that commercial, you know what?  It was from 1979.  So that's, that wasn't so long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They made a brand new tape as you can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  New MRX3 Oxide from Memorex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is that she's holding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Makes the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You get high in the highest and even lower lows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it free for me?  Nobody knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, more than ever, we can ask, is it live or is it Memorex?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  Even the name Memorex sounds like something from science fiction.  It's a Memorex device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I grew up in the 80s making mixtapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, you know what a cassette is.  You're not that young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I grew up in the 80s, early 90s even making mixtapes.  No, the CDR, that doesn't count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That doesn't count.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I shouldn't be asking.  You're right, Gina.  I should be asking Chad these questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Chad's too young to remember anything.  Except for red hair.  He remembers being born.  That's how young he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's funny when you said Memorex because I believe that the Borat DVD came in a Memorex.  It was made to look bootlegged.  So yeah, it came in a Memorex CD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what this Borat is, but anyway.  I'm too old.  U.S. government can no longer be trusted to protect the internet from international power grabs, says Jeff Jarvis at CrunchGov.  Guest log post.  This is interesting.  So tell us what you're saying here.  It's pretty straightforward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There have been attempts to take over governance of the internet.  Russia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, other wonderful bastions of free speech.  At the last ITU tried to put in a plan that demanded equal governance.  The United States gathered together Western countries and walked out.  Well, problem now is we don't have the moral high ground, do we?  We do not.  We certainly do not.  And that's going to lead to John Notten wrote a wonderful column or wonderful post.  He's an observer columnist saying just that we're going to end up with something far worse.  And thank you very much, NSA.  It's another it's another impact of the NSA story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's the I think the more important impact is our relationship with our allies all over the world.  This is always the problem when you act immorally or wrongly is it hurts your reputation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, of course.  We also just people look at us as stupid.  When I was in Europe, I was I would apologize for being a joke, but I'd get a high from America.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, I get the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't had this problem lately, but there were there were years when I would say I was Canadian.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I haven't had that problem lately.  I might now again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of cool.  It is kind of cool.  It's kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But also a little weird.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I pegged you as a medium guy.  I'll do it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a medium.  Yeah, I'm a guardian.  He does it all, man.  He does it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why I like my job.  He's a yeah.  Yeah.  I gotta learn your secrets for being prolific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Writers are the original whores.  Yes, we are.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, how do you feel about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a terrible thing to say and I take it back.  I take it all back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As opposed to TV people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, there's nothing worse than TV people or radio people.  Unless it's internet TV people, those are the worst.  Or as Aaron Sorkin would call us, the pajama people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He continues on with his vendetta against the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The list of there was a whole list of tweets of take on the rap of why we all hate the  internet, why we all hate the newsroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could not finish it this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I fell asleep.  The Guardian has asked me to write a piece about why I hate the newsroom.  So I said, oh crap, now you're going to make me watch the whole damn thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, this is good.  You're back to your old calling as a TV reviewer.  So I started writing that now.  I love Aaron Sorkin and I love the West Wing and actually was the only person in the world  love studio 60.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's the I wonder the Leo.  I wonder if we watch the West Wing today.  Would we think it's this way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I have watched it again recently.  Only the first four years.  If ironically, they're in Sorkin years.  So as he left, the thing went downhill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But actually, I like the newsroom.  I think I have enough distance from how TV is made.  I mean, I take it with a grain of salt, but I turn on closed captioning just so I can  catch every line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're really talking fast.  This new season, this new season, it's bad.  It's really bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They treat women terribly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yes, you're either a dithering fool or you don't know how to send an email.  I agree.  That is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is true.  Olivia Munn cannot act to save her life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's unfortunate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is unfortunate.  That is unfortunate.  She's a nice person, but she's not an actor.  And I think Aaron Sorkin is writing parodies of himself now.  Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  But the reason I can't stand it is it tries to put a holier-than-thou-than-thou, Patina,  on TV news, which is the absolute worst of what we call news.  I know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is no, you know, those conversations, those aren't happening.  No, no network newsman ever called the Tea Party the American Taliban.  It's not even credible.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They come in to work and say, what?  No trial?  What the hell we got to do today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right, the Zimmerman Trial's over.  We got to do news?  Anyway, I don't know how we got into that.  I was going to say our condolences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From Maborex to Ella Fitzgerald to Aaron Sorkin.  I don't know how we got into that.  Who knows how we did this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I was going to say condolences, of course, to Glee fans and Gleeks.  I know that you were, Gina, very sad to hear.  That was awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just heartbreaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that was terrible.  That was terrible.  That guy, I mean, look, I'm going to be honest.  He wasn't one of the strongest voices in the cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he was the hunkiest guy on the cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he was.  I mean, they managed to find a guy who was like red pretty straight to be the straight guy lead, which was really good.  And he was a talented guy and he had the world at his feet.  It's very sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Corey Monteith, of course, who played Finn Hudson on Glee Found Dead Saturday in Vancouver.  He was only 31 years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  31 years old.  They're now saying it was a...  He had a hellish childhood, earlier addiction problems.  I didn't know that he was dating Michelle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he is dating Rachel, who played Rachel.  So their onscreen romance was going on.  And they were supposed to move in together.  It was very, very sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The apparently lethal combination of heroin and alcohol.  But he'd been having problems with drugs pretty much his whole adult life.  It's very sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He did.  His Inside the Actors Studio interview was very...  You mentioned that in your tweet.  Yeah, he talked about his struggles with addiction.  He was very open.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was very open.  And you're always in recovery as anyone who has dealt with addiction.  It doesn't go away.  It's not a problem that you solve and then put behind you.  So very sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right, Leo.  This show of all shows needs to pay a tribute to Corey.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If the guy who invented Chipotle died, we'd say something.  It's only right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wondered how you're going to get a transition out of this moment.  There you go.  That's why you're the pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't exactly elegant or...  But that's all right.  It doesn't have to be.  It just has to get us on.  Eric Schmidt says Google's relationship with Apple has improved.  I don't know what he means by...  Steve Biden?  He says these are two proud, well-run different companies.  He's talking about the billionaire conference.  I would guess if you go to the Allen & Company...  You must have been there, Jeff.  You seem like the kind of billionaire hobnobber.  No?  No, no, no.  I think once you get to that level, it's all very collegial, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the rich guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Larry wasn't there because he was at the wedding taking pictures.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is the conference that he was seen with the Moto X, right?  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very blatantly carrying it around, using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, lots of clear photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Justin Drey, he said, you know what?  I'm going to drive Leo crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he had a phone.  I don't know what it was.  It's very attractive.  Not the phone.  You know secrets about phones.  It's a beautiful looking...  It is.  It looks like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who says on L of an Android last night?  We're saying it looks a little bit like an Apple, like a mouse.  Like the back of it looks like the Mighty...  Is it the Mighty Mouse?  I wonder what it feels like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder what kind of battery technology makes it go an entire week without ever dying.  I wonder how it's going to dress me in the morning and make my breakfast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder how attractive the screen is.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder how cheap it's going to be, what the marketing campaign is going to be like.  That's a great face.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, he's going to blow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's going to blow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's some good news.  The Pope is going to forgive sins via Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, how's that?  How about that for modern, huh?  Indulgences.  It's not the onion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't even know you could still get plenary indulgences.  I didn't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was probably going to see them printed by Gutenberg.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, God, I'm stunned.  You're a Catholic, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Explain this.  I was raised Catholic.  I went through 12 years of...  Yeah, 12 years of Catholic school.  Nuns, pleated skirts, the whole nine.  And, you know, I saw this story...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that would have been so cute to see you in the pleated skirts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was not cute.  It was not...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of hot, actually, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  The saddle shoes are old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Listen, I was in all girls Catholic school.  I can tell.  Not hot, okay?  It was lots of girls who were not around boys.  Yeah, anyway, I saw the story and there was a half of me that was like not at all surprised  and the other half of me that was like, what are they thinking?  People indulgences...  Oh, it's so ridiculous.  Okay, I'm not going to go on my anti-Catholic rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the best quote ever.  And this is from Monsignor Claudio Maria Celli,  the president of the Pontifical Council for Social Communication.  He told a journal that's actually called the Sacred Apostolic Penitentiary,  you don't obtain an indulgence like you get a coffee from a vending machine.  It is not enough just to watch a mass online or follow the pope via live streaming on your iPad  or by connecting to pope2u.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a quote.  These are just devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What really counts is the tweet that the pope will send you from Brazil.  That's what counts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That it will produce genuine spiritual fruit in the heart of the person.  That's got to be a translation problem.  The pope's tweets haven't grown any spiritual fruit in my heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The tweet from the pope has produced a spiritual fruit in my heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Frutta di Carona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your Italian accent is really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina knows it in her soul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not laughing.  Every religion has its deep, powerful spiritual meaning as well as often it's strange to the outsider traditions.  I don't know though that tweeting really...  Never mind.  Well, God tweets.  Yeah, I love God's tweets.  I read Jesus's tweets too.  Jesus H Christ.  He's the best tweeter.  Or no, he's on Google+.  Jesus H Christ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's one on Twitter that I follow.  There is one.  I do follow Jesus on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or maybe it's Almighty God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Almighty God is on Twitter.  But I think Jesus H Christ...  I think I circled him.  I have him in the prophets circle.  Let me see.  Actually, there's several Jesus H Christ.  There's two.  I'm not sure which one I follow.  He works at the Big Man.  Lived in Rome.  Attended Jew school, it says.  I don't think that's the one I'm looking for.  Let's see if I can...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Almighty God on Twitter.  I'm into creating universes, smiting people, writing holy books, and listening to prayers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go, baby.  I'm sorry about all of this.  There's quite a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, it's me, Jesus.  Exclusively on Fiverr.  You might recognize me from the Bible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not him.  Come on, Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to send us all downstairs.  Oh, good news.  Just tweet the pope and you can get a plenary indulgence and spend less time in purgatory.  By the way, that's what that's for, by the way.  Right, it's for spending less time in purgatory.  So you don't... I mean, you're going to hell anyway.  But...  Well, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you're going to purgatory, not hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The temporary stop to heaven.  Purgatory's hell-like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought it was just sort of a pit stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's limbo. You're thinking limbo, where the babies go.  Oh, so that's the New Jersey turnpike.  Babies go to limbo.  Because original sin, you can't let them off the hook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, but it's not really their fault.  The purgatory is being stuck between stations on the R-line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think purgatory is hell-light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Are you right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where's Father Robert Ballasur when we need him?  We have an actual priest in our panel, on our stable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he might be putting pins in a voodoo doll of you right now.  No, no, no, no, no. Robert...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the things...  That's one of the great things about Robert.  He's great.  He's cool. He's calm. He's probably tweeting right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Only one who dies in a state of grace can be in purgatory.  And therefore, no one who is in purgatory will remain there forever or go to hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you die in a state of grace, you're going to go to purgatory because you get a little bit of punishment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got to serve a little time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you're going to go to heaven. You're not going to hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just a stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so the pope, in this case, can say, no, you don't have to go so long.  I think that's a plenary indulgence.  Only a million years in purgatory instead of two million or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So who is the Martin Luther of the Twitter age?  The whole thing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The mixture of medieval superstition with Twitter...  It's so bizarre.  It's unique.  It's so bizarre.  Because indulgence is...  That is a medieval...  I believe that is a later addition to the culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was honored to see in the Gutenberg Museum and Mines the indulgences that were first printed on Gutenberg's presses.  And then Martin Luther's tracts against them also printed on his presses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it was one of the extremes of the Catholic Church that Luther was invading against.  But again, I am not dissing anybody's spirituality or religion.  I highly respect that.  But you've got to admit some of these things are a little strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I was in Rome at the Google event, there was a priest who was there who edited some major Catholic art culture magazine.  I don't remember the name of it.  Very, very nice guy.  So Vint Cerf is on stage and he's talking about how we have to get more people on the internet.  And he says, I want to convert four billion people.  And the priest says, me too!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's great. Love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love it.  Love it.  Microsoft is suing US Customs saying, you guys, you talked to Google, but you didn't talk to us.  Apparently, Microsoft has a ban against phones made by Motorola.  And the ITC, the International Trade Commission in Washington, issued the import ban.  May of last year, they decided that Motorola devices infringed a Microsoft patent for the way mobile phones synchronize calendar events with other computers.  But they haven't been blocking the Motorola phones.  The droids are still coming.  By the way, I wonder if this has something to do with why Google is making the new phones in the US.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Possibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting, huh?  Microsoft, in order to protect the world, had secret meetings with Google.  I think the word secret is a judgment call.  But they did talk to Google and they decided to let the Motorola phones enter the country.  Even though Google has not removed the offending technology, Microsoft said.  And Customs is ignoring its obligation based on secret discussions.  This is in the Microsoft pleading.  Google's response is, US Customs appropriately rejected Microsoft's effort to broaden its patent claims to block Americans from using a wide range of legitimate calendar functions like scheduling meetings on their mobile phones.  We're confident the court will agree.  And that's because there's now a lawsuit.  The ITC order is in effect until Microsoft's patent expires in 2018.  I think that could very well be why Google said, let's, you know, we don't know how this is going to shake out.  Let's just start making these phones in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We get goodie points anyway.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.  And it's a way to differentiate, you know, with the Apple, with the issues with Apple, you know, manufacturing overseas, say, that made in the USA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  No, I think it's a great thing.  I think they should put the American flag on the back of whatever that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's approved by the NSA too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft said that they had no idea that Google and Customs were meeting back in April until Customs in June 24th announced that they were going to allow the phones in the country.  You know, if I were Microsoft, I would be pissed.  So I think you got some explaining to do.  On the other hand, I'm not thrilled that Microsoft claims that, you know, we have to license synchronizing calendars.  Synchronizing calendars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From Microsoft.  Plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

All right, Gina Trapani, it's time for you and your tip of the week.  By the way, mail volope, great tip.  I just installed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You did install it, even though it had been hacked.  The hack has to give them physical access to your computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not worried about that.  Okay, good, good, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, my tip this week is if you didn't make it to Paris this summer or you're not going to,  you can travel up to the top of the Eiffel Tower in Google Street View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even if you didn't make it to Paris, it's hard to get to the top of the Eiffel Tower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is, and it's crowded, it's hot.  Gina, am I going to be scared of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, Jeff, sorry, don't look.  Google has added a Street View imagery of the two main floors, the Eiffel Tower, to Google Maps.  And they also set up this kind of this whole site about the history of the Eiffel Tower  with archival photos and some recordings and all the information about the Eiffel Tower  that you could ever want.  And that's actually, let me see, that addresses...  Yeah, there's some imagery there from the top of the towers.  Oh, come on.  Really, Jeff?  No.  The Google Cultural Institute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me hug that beam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you go to google.com slash cultural institute slash home,  you'll see there's a featured Eiffel Tower collection.  I love the Eiffel Tower.  It gives you all kinds of information about the Eiffel Tower and the plans and the inauguration,  its first visitors.  But if you just want to go to the top and see the view, you can do so on Maps.  It's a little bit of a cloudy day, so not a lot of sun, but some really good imagery.  You don't have to stand in the line or worry about your fear of heights, unless you're Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a long line in the summer anyway.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I've been up there and it was wonderful, but it is a process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's restaurants up there too.  You can get reservations to go to the restaurants up there.  I love where I'm going to Paris in December for Leweb.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, I'm excited about that.  One of my favorite cities.  Speak or broadcast or both?  Speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Loic just sent me an invitation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've always wanted to go to Leweb.  The timing just doesn't work out for me.  It's kind of a rotten time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's December in Paris is not ideal.  Have I showed you my picture from the Eiffel Tower?  No, let's see it.  There's something a little odd about it.  Chad picked up right away.  Oh, yeah, I did too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's real.  Regina, stay innocent, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's looking.  I just got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you saw it?  Oh, I'm so sorry.  I saw it.  That's... wow.  It's the snap pea problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not on Google Maps, so don't worry.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's why you don't want to go in the snow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay, good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, those French.  It's probably Germans that did that, though, you realize.  No French.  Yes, absolutely.  German tourists.  It's always the German tourists.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I have two because the first one I had to deliver to Gina, I looked it up.  It is a 15-day return policy.  Oh, that's a bummer.  I emailed it to you.  You have to be...  No, the one is a great phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's nothing wrong with the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now when he's holding his new whatever it is, he's going to be rubbing it in on you, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I won't do that.  I will not do that because a set top box is not a good replacement for a smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got to say, I really love the one so much.  I think I'm going to hold on to it.  And if I love the Moto X, I will find it in my development budget to purchase one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are things that the one does that you really will not want to give up, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I really like this particular phone.  I love it.  That's a great phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As long as you're getting good battery life, and that's probably the Google experience talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is your number then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Google, according to a story in ZDNet, based on a panel of HR people, tech companies,  Google gets two million applications for five to seven thousand openings a year.  Oh.  I'd like to go to work for Google.  Wow.  That depresses me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you take a job if Google offered you a job?  Certain jobs, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like if it were prestigious enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the thing about Google that fascinates me is that they actually are a company that's changing the world.  The world.  I agree.  I agree.  I agree.  Would be amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I work in my ways to try to pull up drowning newspapers and then get kicked for it and whatever I do now.  That's fine.  And try to get out there.  But the idea of working for a company that's changing the world, that would be in some way that helps.  That would be interesting.  Yeah.  So but anyway, I'm not applying yet.  We're searching for a new dean for my school.  So we can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, are you are you up for the job?  No, no, no, I didn't want to begin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's because if I were Dean, I could no longer use the F word in Twitter.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That seems so unfair.  Pope, I understand.  But Dean, yeah.  Can you give plenary indulgences?  Only to you, Leo.  You indulge a lot.  You are indulging me right now.  I know you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So some other numbers from this story.  Half of Twitter staff has been there less than half less than a year.  The median age of Twitter staff is 30.  Cisco held a training session for Generation X managers of Generation Y employees, which I found amusing.  And finally, I love this.  Google held a bring your parents to work day and 5000 showed up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's really funny.  You can see it.  Can't you see all the Googlers sort of like guiding their parents around campus?  You know, their parents are like, I want to see this free gourmet food and these like massage areas and these nap pods.  So great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is really cool, actually.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bring your parents to work day.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe one of my kids will get a job at Google and show me around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Show me the problem is, Leo, all the parents who went are younger than us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I brought for my glass fitting and I was like, it's your first visit to Google.  You might work here someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a here's a fun little one.  Ed bought gave us.  This is my tool of the week.  Ed bought gave us this when we were talking about privacy and so forth on Twitter this week.  It's privacy fix dot com.  And if nothing else, it's kind of interesting to learn how much you're worth to Google.  So you install this.  It's a chrome extension, privacy fix dot com.  You can log into your Google account.  You can see what websites are sharing data about you.  You can see what tracking cookies you have.  But the fun one, I think, and by the way, it gives me different results.  Oh, that's because I'm not logged into my Google search.  Let's log in.  If I log into my Google search real quickly here, it tells you how much based on what you information you give to Google, how much you're worth to Google.  And in my case, it was like fifty four dollars a year.  I don't know how accurate it is, but I think it's a very it's a fun thing anyway.  Well, there's about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been arguing that media companies should follow the example of Google.  And the problem for media companies is they don't know anything about you.  So you're all kind of worth the same.  And that's not very much.  Right. Right.  So the fact that you can be worth more to them because they can target the advertising better and be more relevant and have more performance for those ads as a result.  That's exactly what media companies should be doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can turn on various things.  You know, I depends on how you feel about all this stuff, but they've got a health bar which you can enable little tell you as you go to a site what that site's doing, what it knows about you, if you know how it treats government requests and things like that.  So it still thinks I'm only worth sixteen dollars and thirty seven cents a year.  But I damn it.  I know I'm worth more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sixty three bucks and twenty four cents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google makes about this much per year from ads at your level of activity.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's interesting.  Huh.  And then from there, you can turn off things if you wish.  It gives you access to the inside to the Google dashboard where you can turn features on and off.  Yeah.  Interesting.  These these pre search revenue estimates come from a site called Trefis.  T-R-E-F-I-S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What should happen is somebody in the chat room raises the third party cookies issue.  What should happen is that a media should learn to follow an example and B, they should say that if you turn on ad blocking, here's how little you're worth to us.  Oh, that's interesting.  Bring up a conversation from last week.  Here's how much that's an interesting idea.  And here's how little you're supporting journalism if you use that stuff.  Yeah, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Privacy is fix.com is the website we mentioned.  It's free to install and play with.  And it's interesting.  Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org.  That's her blog.  She also, though, works on a lot of very interesting projects like to do text.com brand new version just came out a couple of weeks ago.  Think up, which is a great Twitter analytic tool.  And and she's building a Raspberry Pi that will automatically diaper her baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, my God, that'd be so great.  I got to talk to Steve about that.  There are some diapers are no problem.  Most diapers are no big deal.  But man, once in a while you get that really bad one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, when it comes to babies, it's more pumpkin pie than Raspberry Pi.  Oh, man, you just really want a robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They care that I try to make myself scarce when I suspect one of those is coming up.  See you later.  Bye bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  I know it's so cute.

Transcript:  It is.  Abby used to go behind furniture.  I mean, she had a diaper on.  She wasn't.  Yeah, yeah.

Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, they go.  It's instinct, right?  Yeah.  To hide privacy.  Yeah.  Privacy, please.
