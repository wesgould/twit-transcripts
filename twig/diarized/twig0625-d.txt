Transcript:  By the collar, yeah, no, so we're really thank you for agreeing to do that Anna  We really appreciate it. It's gonna I think it's gonna be a lot more fun with that  He's gonna you're gonna plan some events and we're gonna do some fun things and so forth  Maybe we'll get creating new mark in there  Hope so. Yep. So bad news for you team mobile folks  We we were hoping it was just a bad dream, but no T mobile now admits  That the motherboards vice investigation was accurate and  Their data have as their data has been hacked now  Motherboard says it's a hundred million users T. Mobile's only admitted a 40 million so far

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is information is upsetting that they got away with oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you want to hear what they got?  it's  essentially it sounds like it's the  You know when you get a smartphone these days they do a credit check on you  So you have to provide information for the credit check including social data birth things like that  It's that even if you didn't sign up for a T mobile account, but you got the credit check done  It's in that database. So  Even non T mobile customers you may be bid if you've ever tried to get a T mobile account  Social security numbers phone numbers names physical addresses unique  IMEI numbers for your phone drivers license information  Motherboards has said they've seen samples of the data and they did in fact  contain accurate information a hacker selling a  small  Trunch of this 30 million of these for six Bitcoin two hundred seventy thousand dollars  He says he has 100 million from you know, and this happens a lot a database left open T mobile  Initially reacted last week saying we're investigating now they say  Yeah  Seven point eight million current users had information stolen along with 40 million records from past or prospective

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Customers who had applied for credit is it possible the T mobile didn't know this  And motherboard revealed it or the T mobile knew it and didn't say it and is thus violating I think some laws

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  Certainly GDPR has a and I think California also has a breach

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That you have a certain amount of time. I don't know how long T. Mobile's pretty quick. Okay. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, we don't know we don't know, you know, how did they know and how did when they know it?  What do they know and all of that but?  They say T mobile says the hack doesn't appear to have included credit card details of other financial information  That is in contradiction to what vice says  Hackers  Are selling it which means so T mobile's got but hey the good news is T mobiles  Offering all of you two years of identity protection services  And they're changing the pin numbers on your accounts  So T mobile has started sending out text messages to customers. I'm sorry your house got burned down, but here's a bucket

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, here's a bucket in case you need it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just that's just awful  But it's just continually happening, you know, you can almost assume it's gonna happen. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know if you want to talk about this but this ties to it's not in here  But I did write something last week about  Regulations I would like us to have for I I call it the era of IOT  But this particular story hits on at least three of the things that I think we need seven principles for regulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IOT in the IOT

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Era and scroll down you'll get there. So one is  For this one it would be in some of them. We've talked about like number two. We did a whole show on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you scroll down, I think to let me number two is rethink the Fourth Amendment for the digital era  somebody pointed out and I take this correction like  You know that I was conflating the governor the Fourth Amendment limits government's unreasonable search and seizure  But I have to say  That's the presumption is government has that power and ability to do that if somebody else does it that's just against the law  No non governmental no law enforcement agency has the right to search your house or your phone well in so

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The government is actually going through private entities to get access to this data to avoid this very issue  That's true the T-mobile thing. I was thinking fits with three which I think we need  Way  Way more like way higher penalties for things like I even say this leaving unencrypted personal data's and unlock cloud instances

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, they're negligent and they should be paying a price for that. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then yeah, and then also letting people  Yeah, we'll go with that anyway  I just wanted to put that out there because I really am getting very frustrated with this idea that most of us were like  Oh, it happened again. It's another one. It's the seventh  My seventh principle is rethink our current forms of identity and create different layers. That's important

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Security number is a bad way to identify people  It should be used that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So we need a layer. We need a couple layers  We need like my stupid New York Times password that who cares if it gets out, right?  We need things like for pretty secure things that are tied to our financial data  But could still be easily changed and then we need like an inviolate thing that no one sees except for maybe the government  Won't compare taxes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mr. Sir, I'll touch on this a little bit today on Floss Weekly  Maybe was at the end of Floss Weekly today  Sovereign identity and the guest was was saying okay when we go to a bar and they want to make sure that we're  You know of age to be able to drink alcohol people hand over to driver's license  It has to name their street address their height. Sometimes their weight their date of birth  When all they really need is are you over 21 or not? Are you of age?  I say yes, no, but we hand that information over and and Searles was saying, you know, we need some type of sovereign  Identity process to that will protect us as the consumer as well as you know  Keep all this stuff out of the hands of big tech where breaches don't really matter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ironically, it's big tech that's proposing this kind of thing. There are all sorts of proposals use your phone  Apple has something like this where they control the information when you use your Apple a  Card that the merchant gets and they offer to use a special email address so that you'll get email  But they won't know your email and I think you're right. I think it should be I don't know if you could tie it to the smartphone  But there should be this is what data years months ago Stacey  Was talking about your data blob. This is kind of like that  This is the idea the phone could hold all this information and then there needs to be a system  For saying in a trusted way. That's this is your birthdate or you know, just the stuff they need and I think you could do  that on the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but the other piece of this that I've  long wondered is if we presume that n  Amount of information is going to get out no matter what?  Then what we need to do is is is also regulate the other end of this and that you can't do certain things with certain basic  information, yeah  And that there's more security required on that end so that if they know your mother's maiden name or if they know your address  Or they know your social security number which they already do then nothing can be done with those things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, there you know, there is a credit freeze and  Thank goodness the Congress a couple of years ago passed a law saying companies cannot charge you for  Doing a credit freeze you can go to the big three credit reporting agencies TransUnion Equifax and  I  Always forget the third one and  experience  We don't like and  Ten points and  There's credit freeze and credit lock you can investigate the two but they shouldn't cost you any money  It keeps people from using that information to get credit in your name. It's a pain. You know where it's a pain if  You're younger and you're actively renting and buying houses and buying cars and getting credit  But nowadays they don't they can't charge you to freeze and unfreeze  So I think a credit freeze is something worth looking at. I honestly think you should probably freeze  Your credit with all three reporting agencies. I we keep ours frozen all the time. Yeah  It used to be you had to have a reason  But now nowadays, I know it's just a right. Yes should it's a right  Which we do too. Yeah. Yeah, you do it you do it as well. I should probably do it

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a good idea  It is this the only thing is you have to unfreeze it if you want to apply for credit  So if you're doing that a lot, it's not very convenient

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, well we had to get our mortgage. It was kind of a pain. They all have these apps, but they're terrible and you're like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they don't want to make them bad at this. They don't want to make it easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I I know but man it just drives me bonkers. Yeah  Do you remember Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Before you apply for the mortgage did you remember you had to unfreeze it or did somebody call you from the bank and say, um  Miss Higginbotham

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You have something to do. We're organized like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, thanks Andrew. Yeah, Andrew's got it all under control

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's got everything on lock. But do we think the T-Mobile hack?  Oh, no, I was gonna ask a question about the T-Mobile hack  Which is do we think this could be used for sim swapping attacks?  Is that where we think I know that was a worry people. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well T-Mobile is now going out proactively changing pins for everybody was affected  That's exactly how if they got the pin and apparently they did otherwise T-Mobile wouldn't be changing it  You could pose I could pose as Stacey and they say okay. Hello. My name is Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Higginbotham and I need a new sim

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right, you have hours of my voice you could do a better

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey  What's your pin and I go well and I know your pin date of birth  Yeah, I know that you know, I mean it lasts for the social I know that you know  Most cases that's enough of a hurdle to get to get that sim sent to a new address

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yes, it could absolutely but that you know, also identity fraud of all kinds. So not good. Not good. Thank you T-Mobile

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You were mentioning carrying the phone as part of your identity. But what about the folks that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are well, that's the problem their phone that's that or don't want to have a smartphone which is still a significant percentage of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They still have right to the identification

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know that you need your blob and you need to be given I feel like blockchain is it would be could be a solution  For this but you need some sort of digital thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe you carry a digital card like a keychain or a key card like a little Bob. Yeah. Yeah a keychain for the blockchain. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mean wrapped in foil title, you know, there's a significant portion of the population say under no circumstances  I'm I gonna carry around any federal

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's the worst thing the federal government instead. We're just gonna inject it into your bloodstream with the vaccine. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Watch it now you can get people fired up. Oh those people stop listening

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Community manager voice did you hear that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely, right. Well, I suspect aunt has family back East maybe who feel that way, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I think we need a beam that aunt can put into discord. Wait a minute. You're gonna get people fired up

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mean, please give them about 30 seconds. It'll be there. I know they will

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, okay, so there you go, that's the T-mobile I led with that just cuz I gosh it seems like  It's such a big it's not good news. It's not such a bad. Do you want to let's run this open codecs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Live demo I put a time code in there. You can go into about 1340. Okay  so so  You usually spend open codecs is better than open AI codecs is better than I am  but well, I'll just say so what this is is a demonstration of code writing code and  You guys might look at this and say it's nothing that's stupid  But I looked at it and I was I was fairly amazed because it uses as a learning set  one point in this all the API is out there and  Tons of code and so you tell it what you want it to do and then you watch it write the code to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I thought this reminds me a little bit of what github's doing, which is the github code code pilot  Program where you can ask it  Hey, I can't remember how to create a random number generator and it'll it'll paste the code in it's getting it  It's actually been controversial because it's getting its code from some of those same places, but also from public github projects and  That's a little problematic reusing that stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's say problem. This could also do things somebody wrote that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll recognize the NC public public doesn't give up your rights to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Public doesn't it doesn't necessarily mean open source, correct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it is open source, but it also does not give up your rights to it  There's all sorts of ways you can license that and if you don't license it  Then you have not given up any rights to it  So I can publish source code that I still own that you can't read you shouldn't you can't theoretically reuse

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can't yeah cut and paste and yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that a lot of people were a little upset about copilot. There was also the issue  It not being very good. Let's take a look. This is an artificial

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  First demo that is a hello world demo because you have to write and they and they have to do more things  But the second demo which I give the time code for it's gonna it's gonna write a game

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So open AI was Elon Musk and a number of other companies founded this as a nonprofit  But they've jammed so far  It's interesting because some of the most scary and interesting developments in AI are coming from open AI  I think they don't feel as constrained as a company would be  Google might be a little slower to announce some of the stuff that open AI is just going yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, what look what else we can do like like this. All right. Well, let's give that a try

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So first of all, I'm going to look up a silhouette of a person

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're gonna make a game of a boulder

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We should probably not use a real image of a person for this because they're going to get squashed by a boulder

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very wise choice and what you see here is something very similar to the previous  Where Greg is typing the instruction to the text box then he presses play so he only did was he typed add this image

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of a person and they put a link in  Right and it is now is now looks like in JavaScript been added  To you know, it's been created a var named image  And it's actually been created in code

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The model does its neural magic and produces code and now we get this oversized person on the page

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and I want to point out so the the only difference here as far as the the output is concerned is this is outputting  JavaScript as opposed to Python. It's actually the same model under the hood  So the only piece of magic we're not showing you right now is that we provide a little bit of context to the model in  The case of Python we have just one example of following an instruction in Python in the case of JavaScript  We have like two examples of doing it  And from there the model latches on and just continues and continues

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, I mean, yeah, so they're training it with a set of two instructions or much they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Know yes, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it were that easy to learn a language

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no, no, they're various instructions or they're training with various various like yeah  I mean, yeah, okay step

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what I would really like is for the person to be a lot smaller and for it to be controllable with the left

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And right arrow keys great and we also just got a report that the emails have started rolling in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he's typing into a field the English language text  Make the person a hundred pixels

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's find out. All right, let's give that a try  And actually what I'm gonna also do is I just want to show people  The full prompt that's being sent so that you can really see what's going on without any magic  So I just opened up the Chrome inspector  we have a completions endpoint and you can actually just  Scroll to this is the post message and you can look at the entire  Bit of the prompt and let me do an HTML post what that looks like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a playground and to just to just explain what you're seeing here  The way this neural network works is that it's a really really good  Pattern completion system that happens to work on patterns in code. It's like the world's best  Yes, and improv actor whose domain happens to be code rather than improv. Well that really makes it crystal clear

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're trying so hard. Yeah, I'm getting them plus this demo is really compelling so far  Okay, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We thought we provided with this context of oh, you're supposed to follow some instructions

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're typing in plain English and that's writing the JavaScript code so far. Okay, it's not been too complicated

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so far so we've got the person's hundred pixels. Well, wait good. I think so  All right  Now what do you want me to have image style that width equals?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want it to be at the reasonable position at the bottom of the space of the screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Impressive thing was it understood who this person was but set its position  Its position now it says it's it's understanding the context  Yes from the left the antecedent seems reasonable as far as I can tell these these though are fairly I mean that's not hard to  I know I know  Image that style that left equals 400 pixels top equals 500 pixels. Now. This is a pretty high-level instruction. That's hard  Yeah, this is a hard one make it controllable

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really has to infer  What's going on in here and they can't look at the screen the model only has access to all of this text over here  And so from that alone it has to infer what to do. Well, let's see if it worked. Let's see

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm curious myself the code looks reasonable  Okay  It's quite good, but this looks like something I don't quite like  I don't want it to be able to get out of the screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's just an if statement constantly check if the person looking for the key code  Left arrow 37 and put it moving at left 10 pixels. It did make some though. So again pretty high-level  Constantly check if the person is off screen put it back on the screen  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's happening there  Yeah, well that's it you see this flickering scroll

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fortunately, you can just say disable scroll bars, by the way, I actually don't know how to do this in JavaScript  That's the model now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's obviously document body that style that overflow equals  Everyone knows that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is a suggestion from twitch to see if we can make it move upwards if you could be certainly would be helpful

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's give it a try to do a  Preliminary run at something  Although anybody's ever written any kind of game code. This is in boilerplate in the head

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, so you don't have to but you think about if you're like doing your website or you want to build a table  I mean like I can remember building tables in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like, you know, this would be great for building HTML tables, you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a lot of things that I'm like, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Imagine if I could use it to make API calls for my smart home gear so I could be like right if I could like  Tie it into like the lifex API and say hey if you see that the weather is this  Turn it blue and I could just type that in just like I do with like if to anything  But if I could do that on my own and host it myself, how baller would that be? So oh, here's a Google angle

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What what if this was in place when Chrome OS was needing to be updated and someone forgot a semicolon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are programs to fix that they didn't use obviously so this is interesting it's cool and now they're adding a boulder and they're gonna  crush this guy with a boulder and  you know, this is this is a  Example of a program that you would have in the first class of your computer science, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, how's computer science?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very interesting. Yeah, and you know what? I love the actually the thing  I like the best it's taking the pros the guy types in and makes it the comment which in effect itself commenting code  Which is really great

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The next one also uses the Microsoft Word API

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's interesting see for API's this would be great to write API code  Yeah, that would be so I would I would use that every day all the time. Yeah API's are kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  everybody's got a slight difference and so they the prior one did a  thing of  Hello world, then they had to create a web page with hello world multiple times  Then they created the option of sending you getting an email Wow that plus the Bitcoin chart price  and so it used the  What's the email?  Mailchimp API

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm really the thing I'm most curious about is  When they ask it to write the code for collision between the boulder and the guy  That okay, that's something that is easy to understand and takes a lot of typing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would be really great if I could do that it would just save me a lot of typing

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, can't you do that with like I mean that's part of sometimes what game engines have, you know, they write all the  Okay. Yeah  Yes  My dad just texted me and said I don't know what you said, but Ray said to tell you thanks for the shout-out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're gonna drop a boulder on you come here  So  This is cool open AI codex a live demo of an AI writing code which has been the holy grail in computers  Small demo but it starts to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you realize that what the learning set can be and then how you can speak to it that starts to get your brain

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I'm starting to think a lot of things like I'm gonna call Kevin and tell him his masters. It's gonna be useless  In Python I

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Will say that no code there's been so much venture capital going into the no code  You know startups and the reason is because we're turning everything we have into  software addressable  Devices and things and we all have to be it's like I know people said everyone would learn to code because that's like literacy  I don't actually know if that's the case. I think not everyone will learn to write  But everyone will know how to read and I think these no code platforms are kind of like the basic literacy and maybe  Actual coding is like someone being a writer like a yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you for that link we actually have a  Little more challenging link from Jeff that we're gonna talk about in just a little bit from Harper's magazine

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who says it's not a democracy who says we need an ad before we do that because I have to finish reading it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead. You now have two minutes to finish reading it and get a waffle. Yes. I  Read it at breakfast. You'll be glad to know in the breakfast table. So thank you for the link

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Oh  Boy, oh  Little one. Yeah, I already had the galaxy fold last year and I thought I don't I don't want that  Then Ron pointed out that I could take that old one and get a pretty good  Money back for it, I think no like six or seven hundred bucks back.

Well, anyway, I'll give you a report  Jason also reviewed the pixel 5a last night on all about

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Between a 5a 5 4a 4 a bc. It's really hard. So yeah, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They so what they've been doing is introducing the flagship phone in the fall and then six months later introducing a reduced cost  Reduced feature version of that phone and that's what this 5a is  It's kind of a reduced cost feature of the five not so much different but about half the price  Yeah, I think he liked it quite a bit but the actually everybody does all the reviews are very positive it's just  You know, you got the the six coming out in two months it's all about a time maybe when I say the six

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Transcript:  Stacey was convincing me last week that there's a there's a there's a use  for that, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been going down this road of bigger and bigger phones with all everybody else and now I'm thinking yeah  Maybe a smaller phone isn't such a bad idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't mind the 4a size. I didn't mind just the size of the 4a being a little bit shorter. Yes, it's smaller  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So

Transcript:  Gold I didn't see I didn't see the Samsung colors colors aren't that good. They're not they don't look that good  I like orange and real blue. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with you something a little that pops you want something that pops. Yeah, I would even do bright red. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Like this whole Google loves pastel kind of thing all of their home gear all of you know  That even the the new pixel colors look kind of muted and pastel. Yeah, let's get some pizzazz  Yeah, yeah jewel tones baby jewel tones

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know you won't get with a pixel six or I don't think that with a flip three either is a charger  Everybody's doing what Apple did and leaving the charger out. I  Just wish they didn't change the charger that'd be okay, right? It'll always be type C now going forward  And you know part of the reason people say this is you know, there's a huge waste  Everybody's by now got a type C charger. You can buy one if you don't but considering that probably most people do it's just a waste

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's not add more plastic waste. I'm kind of behind that  And it also saves money

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well in the chip shortage some of the power components are an issue there true so true true true dead true dead

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is  we reported that Amy Klobuchar and Dick Blumenthal and  Marsha Blackburn had united to create an unholy alliance in the Senate to put propose the open app  Markets markets app last week. There is now a similar act in the house  Be interesting it would force both Apple and Google. Although I think it's a little less onerous for Google  Mostly for this is aimed at Apple to allow third-party app stores and third-party payment platforms on their phone  Google already allows third-party app stores  Samsung has one  So I'm not sure this would change how Google does business  They mentioned Google though  They say Dick Blumenthal said the legislation would break the competitive hold that Apple and Google have over the app market  While providing mobile users with more control over their devices Apple says. Oh, yeah, great  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Much of a security issue is this I think it's quite a bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's quite a bit  The thing I think about is you know  Google's always had this setting and they warn you when you check it that you could download  Side-load apps or get downloaded from another store  And the epic who didn't want to pay Google their 30% on fortnight just like they didn't want to pay Apple  When they released a new version of fortnight on Android put it, you know  Side-loaded it and said well you have to check this box and go out and get it and download it that way your phone  Vulnerable and almost instantly within a day some bad guy was putting of  Malware laced version of fortnight up and a number of people got that instead of the real fortnight. So there is a risk  I mean, it's there's clearly a risk  I'm not you know  I think Apple could find a way to make this what Apple will do is probably what Google does which is put up a bunch  Of warnings saying you really don't want to check this box  It's gonna cause all sorts of problems and I think most people won't won't do it  That's I don't do it on Android that much right do you I mean I have I mean side loading is kind of a pain

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, I've done it on occasion

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I liked rooting and ramen yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in fact if I get a pixel six I'm thinking of rooting it and putting a  Privacy forward OS on it like Calix OS just to try it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like what's the tofu did? Yeah, the tofu do it. No, he's a smart boy. He's been doing stuff like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if he's no he's using the iPhone right now. You can't root and rom the iPhone. Nope  cannot  It's not an option

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, we could talk about it Jeff you you put this article in our email that to us all gave us homework

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz I thought it was so interesting like a professor momentarily, but that's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Joseph Bernstein who was at BuzzFeed writing and Harper's magazine. What do you what do you think of Harper's these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I used to love it tries a little too hard to be weird yeah, yeah, I used to love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure I like the new Harper's that much, but this is an article about thanks the cover story  Disinformed how we get fake news  wrong and  In it Bernstein disinfo as he calls it fake disinfo big disinfo big disinfo if it's kind of an industry under itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's one of his points which I have to say is absolutely true  He says only five years ago. Mark Zuckerberg said it was a pretty crazy idea  That's a quote that bad content on his website had persuaded enough voters to swing the 2016 election of Donald Trump  Voters make decisions based on their lived experience  He said quote  There's a profound lack of empathy and asserting that the only reason someone would have voted the way they did is because they saw  fake news a  Year, which by the way, I think Jeff you agree with right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's too simplistic to argue that someone was perfectly normal walking down the street and they saw a Facebook post

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nuts a year later suddenly chase and Zuckerberg apologized for being so glib and  Pledged to do his part to thwart those who spread  misinformation  He'll he also says that this the kind of denial  That we didn't influence anybody is frankly not consonant with their business  Facebook's basic business pitch made denial impossible Zuckerberg's company profits by convincing advertisers  It can standardize its audience for commercial persuasion  Right, this is the key to the piece right how could it simultaneously claim that people aren't persuaded by its content  But they are persuaded by the ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, that's what's fascinating about this. Yeah, and it shows kind of an unholy alliance. He says among  journalists and researchers and technology and all of them, but but that's the primary argument is that that if if you  If you say that advertising doesn't have impact then you have to say the propaganda doesn't have impact and  Facebook can't do that right and so they kind of allow it's almost good  If people argue that this info is good for Facebook's business, which I think is crap because it's a bad experience  But in this sense Bernstein has it right?  I think because they're saying that that if you deny as Leo just said that disinfo is influential  Then you deny that advertising is influential and that's bad for your business

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He also points out that since time immemorial or at least the turn of the last century  It's it's been kind of hip to talk I mean it's not this is not new to talk about how  Propaganda can you know change people's minds and so forth going back even to Vance Packard and the hidden  Persuaders and he says in almost every case. This was overstated but advertisers eat it up  Advertisers love it and I know this from our own experience at twit  advertisers  really  It's  It goes along with the fact that advertisers want to know all this information about the audience that they want to do targeting  They they really want to believe that this stuff is persuasive

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The podcast advertising is absolutely influential on a million people  No doubt it's all the other stuff that isn't just to be clear here

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What if it's not  What if it's not persuasive?  But what if it's what I felt this was missing was what if it's not persuasive, but what if it's not normalize  Yeah, because I do think the challenge here isn't that I will suddenly see one anti-vaxxer post and be like  Oh my gosh, they're right. I should never get a vaccine again  What it does is it makes me start thinking about something and I would we had you know  Journalism professors people come in and they'll you know, they'll tell you  Something demonstrably untrue, but then you'll start thinking about it and you'll be like, well, could that be true?  I don't I don't actually know it calls into question like what you believe  And I do think there's something to the fact that you're normalizing  By bringing people of a like mind together in normalizing the things they say to each other  It does make it easier to go out and have a belief that I'll call it an anti-social or an anti-society kind of belief  Whereas prior to this a lot of our goals were about fitting in does that make sense and we had  Yeah, but also Stacy I think I think but it also ties into the media piece here, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That that once it's what you're saying that once it's out there in the conversation sphere  Then it can go lots of places, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, and it not only can it go lots of places but it will influence people who thought oh do I want to believe that  I guess these people believe okay  I guess that's not crazy to believe that sure toothpaste causes cancer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I honestly we have plenty of an admittedly anecdotal but plenty of in our own lives. I'm sure you do too Jeff  Examples of people who have gone down a rabbit hole whether it's on YouTube or Facebook  You know it followed that rabbit  To the craziest of conclusions  Maybe they would have done that anyway  Maybe they would have done that anyway, maybe but it certainly facilitated it right  What that's why it says do the research. Where do you think that research is happening?  The halls of disinformation

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you and you search their terms like incel and you and you and you go down their rabbit hole  Yeah, that's their desire. But but what in what impact does that actually have? We don't have enough research. We don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you on the face of it? Doesn't it seem obvious that it does? No, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it does. I mean, I think it changes enough people's minds  And brings them to places that they otherwise never would have considered  I mean think about the idea of sheeple the whole goal there is like hey  You're gonna think for yourself by adopting this whacked out worldview that you always that you never questioned before  And the reason you never questioned it was because you know, yeah, we know the earth is round, right? But sheeple now  They think the earth is round but really if you do the research it's flat

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what you just said stacey a minute ago though is that it's a permission system for a belief you already have  It doesn't suddenly make you believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um that they don't like like nobody nobody in their mind a lot of people have that and they found  You know, no, wait a minute jeff permission system from the top down, but but think about qanon  Nobody in their mind just independently comes up with you know, I think the democrats are  Uh have a petter petter asty ring and they're sucking the blood of children to stay young. I think that's what's happening. Let me check  That comes from an external input. You cannot say that that's internal

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's not that's not the the the uh  Driving belief. That's the device. That's the macguffin  It's meaningless you don't think qanon people believe that no, I actually  Well, I know qanon people who believe it so, uh, no, they well they want you to believe they believe it and they've succeeded

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think there's a mix of people that probably fit into both of those camps  Unless so qanon but think about things that have an actual impact like vaccines  I mean, let's let's take out the lizard people and let's just talk about vaccine misinformation  Which you know, I think we all have a vested interest in getting the right information to the right people. It's not black and white

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not as if  Somebody is persuaded to change their views 180 degrees. I agree with you most cases  It's not but they're but I also don't think they're not  Not influenced by it, but this is third person effect

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh, you know, how am I?  Immune when everybody else is a mess and the quote from the piece is the question is why do  Disinformation workers think they're the only ones who've noticed that facebook stinks  Why should we suppose that the rest of the world has been hypnotized by it?  Why have we been so eager to accept it?  It has three and a half billion because it has three and a half billion. I'll eat a story. No, see I put this I that that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that line how easy we are to manipulate that line to me was bull because  Three and a half billion active users somebody likes facebook. You think they all hate it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, it's not that it's just we think that that facebook has manipulated them and changed them and it's miserable and  And and and and and that somehow they're they're no they're not there for that  In fact, we'll have another story up soon about facebook's new numbers about what people see and and we're doing this without data  To know both what do people actually see because there's presumptions because it's on facebook  Everyone has seen it as an old media presumption and then what impact that has and what impact it has separate from the other ecosystem  Separate from the other ecosystem last week's story we did about the uh, the study about youtube videos not not  Radicalizing the way it's thought but it fits into a radical larger ecosystem

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I do agree with you and him  where he says  That the establishment needs the theater of social media persuasion  Because the current political world doesn't make sense to them  They need they needed to explain brexit and trump and the loss of faith and the decaying institutions of the west  because otherwise  They'd have to look deeper at a deeper cause for all of that. It's a lot easier just to say  Well, it's they're being you know, these these otherwise normal people are being persuaded  by uh, you know disinformation in the in the media, but I but  It's not it's not an either or  I I think that's true, but it's not an either or and I feel like you and he are  unwilling to recognize the  the certainly the role  that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The disinformation if we can get the data to get the research  Well, you don't I don't think see how you can say it doesn't have a role. It's patent  I don't see how you can say it does because I don't think you there's this presumption that goes on and I I repeat again  Axel brunson's book our filter bubble is real. We all presume filter bubbles were there we had to create  Uh, um  Interventions because filter bubbles are awful and the research says not so much youtube is radicalizing everybody the research last week said maybe not  Um, we would and by the way, what holds us up from this research?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The fact that the platforms aren't giving us data. I feel like it's you you're you're saying what are you going to believe the research?  Or your lion eyes  We're surrounded in a world by people who are influenced by this and you say oh what the research says they're not  But they obviously are I don't maybe jeff. I don't maybe you don't know these people  I know these people and I know they they were already effed up

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here I am and this becomes a way to sorry, and here I am. I'm going to step in and oversimplify this it's  There those people are out there you how many times have I walked outside and heard someone say I saw on facebook  I saw on facebook that blah blah blah blah blah blah and I just shake my head thinking. Oh my gosh  Just just people are believing anything. It's everywhere you go in  Three billion users out there. That's a large percentage of people in that three billion that just believe  Whatever the hell is put on that service. I say that's why I give people more respect than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think they have more agency. Wait, hold on. I think they have more history than that  I don't think that they can be influenced that quickly by that and this is what the story says that that fits into the vance  Packard view that advertising can hypnotize them and get them to change their world  That's a myth. I think to a great extent and it's a myth

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if we adopt we know advertising works people buy tide because they've seen a lot of tide ads  They're not they're not objectively deciding that pepsi is better than coke or coke is better than pepsi

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those ads are very effective. We know that let alone someone sitting in a big chair that buys from instagram at least

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they ads those ads work  No, that's really true. I mean, I know it from my own experience  Those ads work

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What if we what if we look at it not just as ads but what if we add the nuance here that politics has become for a lot  of people  not  Actually a way to govern but kind of a form of entertainment  And if you think about us arguing about politics  You can embrace jeff's vision of the person who's kind of trolling us with their belief in qanon  Although I don't think everyone does that  But in the arguments there then become more akin to like a sports rivalry  And I see this actually in some of my own family members who are like stick it to the libs  But when you meet them as people  They are compassionate people and it's like they have a blind spot  Where their politics actually impact people that they're compassionate to and about  so  there's  I mean, obviously i'm always going to argue for more nuance, but I think that's something to think about here is  our understanding but also sorry  I thought you stopped. No, just our understanding of politics has become divorced from what politics from policies, I guess maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, stacy, isn't it just not not entertainment?  But also identity. Yeah, it's a way to signal. I agree. It's a way to say i'm with this person  I also say I don't care what they say. I also you know, i'll say yeah, I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's not it's not performative for everybody i've seen marriages several of them break up over this it's not performative for everybody  and uh, you know and  By the way, I take bernstein's point  Absolutely, and we'll agree to it  That  The big tech it's in big tech's interest it's in big media's interest to buy into this narrative  So you should I think my takeaway from this is you should take with a grain of salt  any uh account from big tech or big media  That all these problems are called by social media. I wouldn't say that at all  But I think you at this on the same time you cannot deny the impact of social media on this  Yeah, and we just don't know what we don't know just as fox news has an intact and msnpc has an impact  Yes. Yes, there is for sure an impact. I don't think there is one culprit  Uh, and and I think that he makes a good it's worth reading it because the point that he makes  um  He says in a way this is this world is a kind of comfort  Easy to explain easy to tweak easy to sell. It's a worthy successor  To the unified vision of american life produced by 20th century television  Uh, yeah, we all want to oversimplify. That's a natural human tendency. It's hard to understand complexities. It's hard to understand gray areas  Yep, but I think this is another way of oversimplifying. He's going in the other direction of what he's trying. He's trying to he's trying to counterbalance

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's a good what I thought about this good antidote to it the oversimplification. Yeah, that's that's what it's there for  That's what it's there as face. He would say we need discussion and this and this sparks discussion in interesting ways  And and as I said when I sent it to all of you in the morning  It has something for everybody because he's critical of facebook and of facebook's critics  Yeah, and and then and then puts them together in an interesting way to say what are they really believing in saying now?  I know somebody  Uh, who doesn't just disinfo work got got insulted by this and I don't think that was the point  I don't think there's a lot of good disinfo work that goes on but there's also a lot of stupid

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, bernstein kind of implies that there it's all with a hidden agenda  Uh, you know, he was he mocks the disinfo people

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Quite a bit in this art in this piece. Yeah, but I but I think in a way it was it was part of his effort to  Um show a different end of the prism so I I don't take that terribly seriously. Yeah, don't take it personally

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a cover story on harpers  Uh, I think it is perhaps a little one-sided but it's a it's a good  Harper's is like these days. Yeah. Yeah, it's provocative. He mocks the aspen institutes  uh  He says exquisitely non-partisan commission on information disorder co-chaired by katie kurick  Featuring yasmin green from google's jigsaw gary casparov the chess champion and kremlin critic alex stamos  I mean, this is a pretty  You know glittering yeah glittering alex. Yes, the very prince harry alex stamos from facebook and  Katherine murdoch rupert murdoch's estranged daughter-in-law important to put that word estranged in there  um  Yeah, I could see if I were somebody on this commission I might be insulted by how he's mocking it wasn't too happy about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  um, but I I don't think that should be taken too seriously, I think it's um  um  It's a way to counterbalance and it's rhetorical

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think you went a little over there. That's fine among the commission's goals to determine quote how government private industry and civil society can work together  to engage  Disaffected populations who have lost faith in evidence-based reality  Seems like a a lofty goal a reasonable goal and and and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It I hope will spark the kind of research that I want and so i'm i'm dandy with that. Yeah, that's yeah  So it's important as long as it comes out of evidence

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says this commission is the latest and most creepily named addition to a new field of knowledge production  That was a little funny called big disinfo. Yeah, it's funny. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, and but I would like I would like a coffee cup that says member of the big disinfo big disinfo that's us

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I just think it's so obvious that this stuff has an impact  but I don't think it's the villain in the in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Play it's just one of many well, but if we're going to win this policy  To use stacy's proper word and and interventions to use mine  Um around presumptions rather than around research  It's a problem because it may be the wrong ones right the one i've used on the show a million times  Is the kids are all right. They're not spreading the disinformation. It's grandpa who's messing up the world  But we've invented all these media literacy interventions for the kids who are actually much more savvy than we give them credit for  And grandpa is grandpa's the one on facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, I think grandpa has been people have been trying to get to grandpa in a while  And I feel like we can see a lot of studies a lot of studies have come out recently showing the correlation between  People's  Lack of trust in government and all of that with like the prevalence of fox news  So I think there's a growing awareness the the challenge with research though. Jeff is when you're looking for data  Especially with social sciences you can find it and you can make these correlations

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That you also can't find some of it stacy because the platforms are the ones who have it and they won't give it to you  Yeah, we talked we've talked about that as well. That's key. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, i'm with you stacy. I have a little bit of  I don't have a lot of faith in quote research as being the definitive answer to any of these questions

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  um evidence then call it evidence

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I I also think that I mean  I mean, let's just get on the soapbox about america  I feel like if people were a little bit more secure in their livelihoods  I feel like if people were a bit more secure in their neighborliness. I feel like we could be better

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, but that's just not happening right now. So I think the latest census is the basis of so much of it  That for the first time white population in this country went down  Relatively and that is scaring some people who are losing the hegemony they enjoyed for  four centuries  and  I think we can't not  Look at deeper roots like that in this discussion and to think that it's some new thing that came along that made us worse as a country  Yeah, I mean i'm the first one to yell about fox news and I think it's done terrible things  But it started before fox news. It started before  um  talkradio

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, so there's many causes there you and I will agree there's many cause it's complicated and I also would point out that yes  That might be a white white terror over changing demographics might be part of it  But let's not forget how unpredictable hispanic vote was and is  Uh, it is not necessarily the case that uh that hispanics or people of color vote as a block either  So I don't you know, I don't I think it's I think what's going on is a little more complicated  I think it's very complicated. I don't think we really can understand it  And I certainly agree that we shouldn't blame big tech or social media for our woes  Whether you know contributory or not, they're not to blame for our woes  If they if they're successful those ads are successful  It's because they fall on fertile ground, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John john, can you can you take that as a snippet that I can I can refer to back in the future?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I've always thought that this is nothing new

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, what is it? Jesus said you cast your seeds upon the ground  Sometimes it lands in fertile ground sometimes not on good ground. Yep. Yep  Unfortunately in this case the good ground is bad ground

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's that's the really interesting thing because what happens is the bad guys use our own  Beliefs against us, right? We believe in open information. Well, that's very easy to manipulate  um, and and so that's what's happening is is a lot of the um  Virtues we saw in an open media ecosystem are now being used  Badly and we don't know what to do about it. That's part of his point. I think  But thank you. That was enough. I don't mean to take over. It's a good good topic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a provocative piece. I felt there was a little facile personally, but yeah a little glib. Yeah  Uh, but not but but point well taken  Uh, let's see here. What else would jeff like to talk about?  Oh, it's time. Uh, we hear from another quarter  Ces 2022 is on baby. Just bring your covet card. He's going  I'd go what are you're on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to go you had such a good time at ces when we went on january 2020 the last  conference I feel like  I said I really i'm fascinated  By what covet has done  In this country and then the return of covet is done and how quickly people were willing to go pull back  Some people and other people said no no  Forward i'm fascinated by this and i'm mostly fascinated by the drastic changes that are going to occur in our society  People not coming to work because they can work from home and I have a feeling that conferences  Just like malls  Are going to be one of the casualties of yes. Yes. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes  Well wppi is still happening. Uh, that's the photography  These are vestigial. I think these are vestigial

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  CD is still happening. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  CD. Yeah adobe max, uh kick they announced their dates for october, but I believe it's all virtual and it's 100 free again  so that's after

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  after  2020 when you guys went come  March 1st, did you look back and say what were we thinking going somewhere? We all did. In fact, everybody was very nervous

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was nervous. Yeah, yeah larry maggot, uh  So larry put up a post on uh, uh facebook I think or somewhere I saw it somehow  uh saying I  There was somebody at ces with covet. I met with him and I met with all of you who are getting this message  Did anybody get sick and none of I think none of us got sick, but that wasn't the delta variant

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, yeah, yeah, but he looked bad that day when we saw him. He looked bad. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he was he got really sick lisa got really sick. But uh, yeah, she did lisa  Did not get covet as far as I know we did the antibody test and it said it was negative

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We had a pretty terrible faculty meeting today to speak out of school  Um  Where the students are supposedly required to be vaccinated but now it turns out they're not all vaccinated faculty and staff are not required to be vaccinated  Uh, a lot of my colleagues have kids at home who can't be vaccinated. Yeah recently  a lot of  Anger and nerves about this including from yours truly. Yeah, but what do you do? That's the thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand absolutely the anxiety. This is provoking

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I don't know what you do. So uh, you mandate vaccinations for one thing and you take care of your own people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is one thing that see the consumer technology association is doing they're going to you're not good for them require  Require vaccination vaccination. It's not one of those tests not vaccination tests masks  Uh will probably be required in all the public indoor spaces  The organization said it's assessing whether to accept proof of a positive antibody test as an alternative requirement  But they're going to defer that until closer to the date  That's part of the problem is we're in terra incognita. No one knows what's going to happen next month. You know, there's a lambda variant  No one knows  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm supposed to fly to michigan to give a speech at the end of october that was it's  It was cancelled from april of 2020  And I don't know if they're going to cancel I was like look y'all can have your money back  I mean, i'm i'm happy to do something virtually for you. Like I I just don't know, you know, they don't know no one knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the problem and you know the people who are saying we have to get back to normal like like I totally agree that I don't think  I don't want to live like this. I would hate for my daughter to grow up in a world that has this kind of like  Abject fear about being in public with people but I  We we can't do it unless we have  I don't know vaccines more people vaccinated. I just I feel like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We  Were briefly seduced by the notion that vaccines could fix this  And now we're getting disabused of that notion

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think vaccines could have done a lot more to help if we had got I mean  But we always knew that you had to get to a certain level with them  We always knew that if half the people were vaccinated it wasn't going to work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did we also underestimated the strength of breakthrough of delta and breakthrough infections

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean normal people did I felt like we were

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We knew delta looks we knew that was going to happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I think people are willing to now pull back a little bit more than they were  I think there's a lot of trepidation kids are going back to school today

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In California, I mean kids are already back in school in jessica yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and  There's a lot of trepidation  And I just feel like if I were nobody knows what's going to happen, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If I had a kid under the age of 12 who couldn't be vaccinated. I mean I look at this and i'm like man what?  What do you do in?  This is where I feel like we're entering into this level like we talk about distrust in the government  I think what we're seeing right here is  visceral  Reaction to a failure of public policy that it's going to hurt us for a long time  And not just in the q anon way, but in an actual way that affects real people and uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some of this was misguided just as it was misguided trust in the new york times and cbs  misguided trust in public health officials

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh that we're now learning that's unfair. I think because I think it was it's science. The science was changing the knowledge

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what i'm saying. That's what i'm saying. We've all learned that it isn't as certain as they might have pretended in past  Uh, and and uh, we've seen the sausage being made  And and I think once you've seen the sausage being made you never enjoyed those bangers. It's pretty damn impressive sausage

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's very impressive. What the heck are you tweeting? Oh, what did he tweet now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You jeff, how are you talking about this and tweeting about snakes in the spice aisle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was as simple I saw I could have brought it up on the show and you're I spared you  You

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't understand you you did this 49 seconds ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, while he was arguing with us about other things my boy. Are you adhd a little or

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, i'm just online man  Wow, that's impressive. I am internet man

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I will say the snake in the spice aisle is very compelling the fact that it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't know I could have done it for for a closer. Yeah, but it's australia. That's what always amuses me australia  You don't want to go there things will kill you they will kill you in the spice aisle  A nine-foot python in the spiced aisle

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well python, you know, it's gonna take a while if it's gonna kill you because it's got a squeeze

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, so don't stress. I don't move very fast anymore stacey. So, you know it could happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, uh, I just saw some statistics about uh death by reptiles in australia. It's actually much better than you'd think

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's not bad you just need the data just need the data the data to understand we all live with these uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  biases  Spiders and snakes as bad as they are don't seem to kill very many people in australia. Maybe they just know better. I don't know  Hey good news  Spence we're talking about vaccines modena is about to begin trials for an mrna vaccine for hiv

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is incredibly good. It's awesome. This is just based on

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How many friends yeah, it gets to that idea of the m h nr. Okay. Mrna  Mrna messenger RNA software. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if they were such success in sequencing the the covet 19 genome and then creating  Literally, it only took them a weekend to sequence it and create a vaccine within a week  It all the time was wasted and not wasted spent in trials trials to make sure it wasn't going to kill anybody  But they had a vaccine last spring  And so the same technology now is being used  On on something a virus has been intractable for 40 years  all of a sudden  They're also reportedly working on an influenza vaccine based on mrna  That makes sense. Yeah  Science we kind of we kind of knew this would happen actually was uh, I was talking with andy weir the author of the martian  interviewing about his new book and he he was  Saying you I don't think we understand what a massive breakthrough on our mrna vaccines are this is the he said this is the last  pandemic

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the last pan well knock some wood, please andy. Yeah knock wood  um question well  Go ahead stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was going to ask his m i oh god. I can't messenger RNA vaccines. Are they?  Are they only good against viruses? Would they also work against bacteria?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, I think they're particularly tuned to viruses because of the way viruses work, which is to invade the cell  right and so um, but  That's a good question because of course you're just creating any  Ultimately, you're creating t cells and antibodies to fight the virus. I suppose you could do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  With uh, i'm just saying malaria now. That's a parasite disease that you've got, you know, yeah, there's no vaccine for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, but for measles mumps and all the viruses cancer

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I think that the real frontier is is to do this kind of work around cancer. Yeah  Very very interesting very very curiousity question because I think this will be a debate that comes up  So i'm I would be due in eight months in i knock late october for a booster under the cda the the uh,  The government's the hss rules today  um  If  So the debate is do you get the booster do you get do I get the third moderna?  Or do you wait a little longer hoping that there's a version of moderna that's specific to the delta or the lambda  Ask your doctor jeff. Yes. I'm going to you're my doctor. We're not the people who know

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is like going on facebook and asking your friends these questions  Lisa and I was curious and I have this conversation all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lisa I have this conversation all the time. She said what can I get the booster i'm getting the booster  I just say  Wait, your doctor will tell you  Your doctor will let you know you have a good doctor. What i'm curious about is the emotions of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  right is what's the what's the  the um  I'm going up a wrong tree here  But but i'm curious how people will be asking about this and reacting to it and playing the odds of the science  It's just find it interesting. That's all  That's my doctor

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's no that's a good question. I mean i'll get I guess now the latest  Is the cdc is expected to announce that?  Boosters will be suggested after eight months after you get the initial biden said it this afternoon. He said it today  Okay, good. Yeah, so that was the speculation now. It's confirmed  Which is fine with me and it's the same one  It's just another one of the same one and that really the what I saw was a significant improvement in effectiveness  like on the order of 200 percent  Yeah, nice. So it's worth it sounds like it's worth doing  Uh, let's see congratulations to amazon now  officially  The world's biggest e-commerce company outside of china  Uh, there's a lot this article in the times was fascinating because it goes back in time  In the  1940s  The number one retailer in america was quite guesses anybody sears roebuck sears roebuck and co before sears it was  a and p  A and p was so big that that the government was considering antitrust regulations against it in the 40s  unbelievable, wow  uh, you know and this kind of maybe is informing maybe you don't need to do these antitrust regulations because  times change and companies are on top now and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So a and p gave me that I there's a book I've got to mention here quickly leo  I think I mentioned the show before but if you're interested in this, I highly recommend it  Uh the great a and p and the struggle for small business in america. Oh you mentioned this before  Last year the year before yeah, really good by mark levenson  and and I recommend because because what it shows is the parallelogram here to  um  A and p could chain stores came in and ruined the ma and pa  Neighborhood store right a preview of walmart, but but but the a and p was the first  Villain in this they were seen as the amazon of the day and they were seen as awful  There was tons of protective legislation against them. They were seen as terrible  It was awful the fact that they lowered prices was unfair and there was laws passed to make them raise the prices on consumers  um, and it's just amazing how similar this is because it's once  Mass media was made possible to advertise something like the a and p  And made it possible with that in transportation and it created the exact same kind of structure we see in the transition today

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's a wonderful parallel. So it wasn't until the 60s  That a and p was superseded by sears  Sears overtook a and p as the largest retailer in the early  1960s by targeting middle-class shoppers in the suburbs and expanding the department store model  then  The uh, the five and dime the walton five and dime in bentonville, arkansas  That's the original one  turned into  A behemoth this was founded in 1962 right when sears kind of took over from a and p by the 90s  Walmart had surpassed sears opening thousands of stores  buying up competitors  And uh just this seems to be kind of where they overlap just as walmart  beat sears  This guy named jeff bazo says hedge fund manager drives out to seattle with his wife and starts amazon  And the reason this is all coming up is because today amazon became  bigger than  walmart over the last 12 months amazon's  Revenue was 610 retail only  610 billion dollars beating walmart's sales posted yesterday of 566  billion dollars so amazon  except for china now  You know who's bigger than amazon? Of course alibaba alibaba, right in china. Yeah. Yeah, they sell to a lot more people  Yeah, they got a billion and a half customers and they have some advantages

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they might say disadvantages now. I don't know. Well, that's that's an interesting thing jack ma may not be very interesting. Yeah. Yeah  So amazon huge  Uh, and but I think it's really important to understand how these companies without any governmental intervention  Have superseded each other every few decades  As technology changes, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's interesting to see how technology is making it  possible for amazon because I can just think back to a decade or two ago being in  Small town north kaki laki and having a discussion with with people wanting to buy products and  refusing to figure out amazon.com  They'd rather just go to the walmart, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, obviously that demographics shifting but that's why sears became so big right because the catalog I thought sears

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, the mail order was kind of sears's big thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that was the internet of that was the tech that was the tech of that time, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was the internet of that time. Well, also also the creation of the department store  Was a phenomenon not unlike another one. Um, and and what you had was you didn't have the consolidation of federated  You had every every city had its own family-owned department stores and they were huge newspaper advertisers  um, but they too  Agglomerated, you know, there's the mrs. Jones's dress store dead. Mr. Smith's tie store dead  So all these bigger things kept eating up the smaller things that came before  Surprising how many years it took for home depot to kill the neighborhood hardware store

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's actually shocking that a&p was the number one retailer in america  Until 1965 when it was beat by sears. I mean, I would have thought that happened a long time sooner earlier than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But well people didn't buy as much stuff back then. No, that's true. So groceries. Yeah, probably  Yeah  And food costs have gone down so much compared to like what a family of four used to spend on like percentage of their income  Spent on food back then right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, the great atlantic and pacific tea company  I like it. Is that that's I wish they kept they make sodas don't they a&p?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not against it. I'm pro it because he's growling. I just don't think that twitter is gonna do it. I think this is  lip service  Right, but maybe maybe if they could find a way  to  Monetize it but then that kind of is about a value added layer on top of the commodity

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The the speaking becomes a commodity the finding the recommending becomes the value  That's my that's my view of what this means, but that's like jack. Look graber

Transcript:  um  I think it's interesting to talk about if you don't mind. Yeah  the  facebook widely viewed content report

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay  Here it is. This is from transparency.fb.com. It's there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Widely viewed content report what people see so this is this is out of some controversy here because facebook had a um  A tool called has a tool called crowd tangle  And kevin roose of the new york times used it to say well, here's the top things that crowd tangle facebook's  I remember that they bought right says are the most  um  Popular most seen things on facebook  And there were others. I think maznik might be one of them who who uh, maybe it wasn't maznik  Some other smart people said whoa  We really don't know how big is big and this doesn't make a lot of sense and crowd tech kept going and it was useful  For journalists and they kind of made kevin roose in this and then there was an internal debate in facebook about this  That this is not making us look good and we shouldn't be doing this and they pulled apart the team  And then facebook now came out with another report which as usual gives you part of the story  Not the whole story, which is the issue here, but it says the thing that i've i've said all along is  Because no two people see the same facebook  How if you say something is number one in facebook, how big is that? It's not very big. It's 0.1 of all content views

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they say that's because given the customized nature of newsfeed most of what people see on facebook is personalized for them specifically

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So so this does go back to the earlier discussion too about well this turned out in facebook and influenced the whole world  Well part of the data I want pardon me for wanting it  Is to say well how many people actually saw it it could have been number one, but it could have been number one among  25 million things and it's the long tail of long tails of long tails, right?  And so it's it's it's important to have data like this though. I'd rather have it done independently  So that we can say how big is big how influential is influential. This is important the vast majority

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is from facebook's transparency report the vast majority of content viewed in newsfeed during the second quarter of this year  87.1 percent did not include a link to a source outside of facebook  Most of these links are in posts shared by pages that people follow  This means the majority of newsfeed content views in the u.s were in posts without links and were from content viewers  friends or from groups they were connected to  Content that did not come from friends pages people followed or groups that they were part of also referred to as  Unconnected posts made up a relatively minor percentage of content views  I don't know if that's meaningful though because there's a lot of people who follow, you know, anti-vax

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's an issue too, that's why we need more data but yes, but it's still interesting how big is big on facebook  Oh, this is trending on facebook. It may be trending among very few people. It's very dilute

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, well wait one percent of like 3.5 billion people like  Oh point one I was like that's still a lot. I mean that's 10

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's still large. Yeah  And a lot of the stuff that is that is among that list at that level most popular is anodyne is obvious  Right and that's partly facebook's doing right if you I went into facebook the other day  And I just if you search for vaccination last time I did it  It's all news because I think facebook's trying to do that now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am just very happy not being on facebook. That's all I can say. I just don't miss I have a story

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it has google in it good  You want a google story? Yeah  y'all matter  Google affiliated smart home protocol interoperability. Woo. Woo  Um, it's google amazon  Facebook not facebook. Sorry google amazon apple and samsung samsung all got together and were like hey  Let's make your smart home stuff interoperable. They called it project chip for a while now it became matter or it became matter earlier this year  And it was supposed to be out this fall, but they're going to delay it until the first half of next year and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  While I am sad, sorry stacy. I'm sorry. I know  It's very disappointing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's contributing to the delay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A couple things one. I think they're doing this a little differently. They are releasing a full software development kit  so the full sdk is going to come out and they realize that oh  they I think they took a look at their code and they were like  We should work on this a little bit longer  Um, I think the co the covet coming back the delta variant has kind of pushed them tests back a little bit some of the testing  events  but also  I mean i'm really sad they say also that more companies join but I think that's just a bit of yes kind of just  You know if you can't handle 20 more companies joining your standards organizations at the last minute, that's a problem  So i'm going to hope that's not the real issue  Um  But I think it's actually okay because i'd rather have a good standard coming out  It's really disappointing for people like me who are waiting to buy new smart home stuff. That's matter certified  We should still see people releasing their plans at ces or in that time frame, but um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it is kind of let down. Is it still worth waiting for a matter certified device? You think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, I i'm getting a lot of people who are a little unsure about what matter is going to do  So people are like, oh I need a new doorbell. I i'm gonna wait and buy a matter one  I was like don't do that because doorbells aren't part of the certification  If you're waiting to buy new locks new light bulbs, maybe a new hvac those kind of things then yes, sure wait, but  don't wait and  I would also say  Realistically, the soonest you're going to buy a matter certified device is going to be the latter half of next year  Right, so you're  So, I mean you can buy things that are likely to be upgraded like philips says hey  We're going to upgrade everything. So if you want to invest in new philips light bulbs great  um  The nano leaf bulbs things some of these things people already if people come out go ahead and buy it  But like I would not buy door locks right now because none of the lock makers are like this is what we're doing  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually you say in your article that it's going to be first half of next year for the sdk  And the start of a certification program which means probably it's going to be following you later that you'll actually be able to get devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Uh, it'll be towards the holiday season of next year. I think yes  I mean there's some like google and amazon. They're going to have their stuff ready and a lot of the companies who are participating  They're already working with this stuff. Yeah. Yeah, so it will be pretty they're working on the sdk and development  So but if you if you are part of the membership  And you you don't have access to any of this then yeah, it's going to be a little bit longer for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So i'm gonna i'm gonna not home automate until next year  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, that's fine. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't missed it so far  I do actually know I have few lights  And I was like, you know, I know you have home automation. I have some home automation. I have doorbells. I have  You know voice assistants, but I can say, you know turn off the lights turn on the lights  And there's lights in the living room and lights in my office

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How is it possible that these lights can be upgraded? I would assume there's some hardware limitations

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So a lot of the lights that will be upgraded so philips has two brands they have their fancy hue ones  And they have their cheaper whiz ones  Cheaper whiz ones will not be upgraded the hues will be because they're running through a hub  So the hub will get a software update that talks to the lights. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Some lights that run things well, no  Yeah, no, we'll just go with no some of the lights like nanoleaf put out light bulbs with thread enabled and they did that to make it  eventually  Compatible with matter

I'm looking at right looking at it right now  Okay, this is how they tell me the world ends the cyber weapons armors race by nicole perloth  And I i'm a little late to this because I didn't want to read it because I was like dude  I know all about our crappy cyber security practices, right?  Okay  Just stop what you're doing  Go get it because you do not know and this is a wonderful book for two reasons  One it lays out a lot of risk factors in common people's language, but is respectful of the tech side  to  The sorry two  As a journalist it was awesome because she nicole talks a lot about her reporting on this issue  So as as a journalist it was really interesting to read how she was like trying to find like this is a hard community to crack  and  Write about and so that was kind of cool and at the end she offers some really good  Takeaways and advice and also includes kind of some bits of hope that I wished I would love to see her write more about  She talks about like japan and norway  Having kind of solved a lot of the cyber security problems  um  because  They've they've implemented practices, but I don't know what they were so but that would be another whole book. Anyway, the point is  That book is great. And even if you think you know that we're screwed you should really read it. She's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think she's she writes from the she's the new york times cyber security reporter. She's very good  This is how they tell me the world ends  Nicole perl

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not mr. A&T and no, mr. Mr. A&P mr. A&P  Mr. So some unrelated. I'm I don't know why i'm fascinated by these things, but i'm fascinated by ghost kitchens  Me too during to um covid and i've never known the order anymore ghost kitchen  But the business just fascinating we can hear you chewing leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it's I at least mute when I eat my waffles  Thick and fluffy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wendy's is to open 700 ghost kitchens with reef technology  what  I'm making leo hungry talking about wendy's he's gonna go get a double. Uh, so what fascinates me about this is that the um  The fast food business like the department store business used to be in great measure a real estate business, right?  McDonald's was was being right. They owned the land real estate, right? You franchised the restaurant, but they kept the land  And and they knew the science of where to put it and so on and so on and so on  So it just strikes me that the ghost kitchen thing which what do they think that they're going to make between  500,000 and 1 million per unit of sales. That is it's just it's just a little truck. So what is what is the reef?  It's a warehouse. Oh, it's a where?  You know, it can be anywhere it could because there's no need to be public

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just need people to drive the food. So the uber the uber guy comes and gets it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, and and so the value of real estate in this business just kind of went nowhere  It's it's like the opposite of we work or something like that. I just find it interesting. That's all  um  I wanted to spend enough time here so leo could get his whole waffle down

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's interesting. It's so they can expand in areas where they don't have stores, I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah  Well, it's also to deliver like if people they're making a bet that people have changed the way they're going to get in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh good point. Yeah, right. They they want to deliver. I like this is exactly what i was talking about earlier  I just find it's fascinating how the pandemic has changed  Culture in a kind of somewhat permanent way. I'm sorry stacy. Go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, I was just going to jump on the fact that jeff's comment about real estate is really  That's very smart. Oh, I wonder like like if you think about mcdonald's being optimized for highways  How would you optimize delivery for?  Like delivery drivers, right? Because you see some neighborhoods are actually fighting back against like localized highly localized amazon  Warehouses because they don't want the traffic running through their streets  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huh? If you haven't seen the founder yet, which is a bio pic about ray crock the founder mcdonald's  In that movie he has the insight. Oh  I'm not selling hamburgers. It's a real estate business

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep, and they they dramatize it very effectively they show and did you know that ray crock also sent me a hate letter  No  He called me a nickel millionaire  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What was rick sennacher called him a bum and the founder of mcdonald's called him a nickel millionaire. Does that mean you have a million nickels?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that means he means you're kind of with heirs  So there was a new mcdonald's on vaness in san francisco a very fancy one in the day  I remember that I reviewed it from my column.

Croc. You don't understand. I  I sometimes eat at mcdonald's five times a week, which was sad and true  And I said, I love mcdonald's. I believe in quality control sir  And this store was not up to your standards and quality control. We hit it off brilliantly then and everything was wonderful

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That vaness mcdonald's has been closed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, oh, yeah long long ago. Yeah cross from the uh cross from the opera house, right?
