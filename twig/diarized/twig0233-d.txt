Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of actual users and customers who are demanding to know what we're giving them for their money.  Yes.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They got the credit card charges week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yes, that was the real test.  Good to be here as I have you also with us from Davos, Switzerland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we with a little bit of a wonky connection, but we love him so much.  We're just going to put up with a Jeff Jarvis.  Hi, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm in a world seven seconds behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So where are you?  Are you in some special Davos World Economic Forum?  It's mission control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm in the media center.  Oh, it looks like with desks of empty now because they're all at parties.  Is Bono there?  He's here this year.  I'm supposed to see him for dinner tomorrow night.  Not not an on team dinner, but you know, a large dinner.  How fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  It's exciting.  So we have Danny Sullivan's here from Search Engine Land and Marketing Engine Land.  Always the one of the most astute astute observers of the Google verse.  And it's always great to have you on, Danny.  Thanks for joining us.  Yeah.  I'm just looking at my think up.  Gina, to cow me key followed me.  Do geekery, geek business and tech sound like good descriptions?  Oh, yes.  Oh, they do.  Oh, my.  This week's key stats.  This is nice.  So as time's gone by, this has gotten deeper and deeper, more and more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, that's the point.  That is the point.  Actually, I saw that three years ago you signed the lease.  I signed the lease for the Brickhouse.  Really cool.  Hard to believe.  Yeah, we did it on the air.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  My special pen.  That's kind of neat.  That's kind of neat.  This also is, by the way, the anniversary, the.  30th anniversary of the 1984 commercial, the Super Bowl in 1984.  Really?  Apple's 1984 commercial was aired on this day for the first time and the last time in  most areas.  I think they aired it in some other places just so they could win a Clio award.  The ad that announced the Macintosh to the world.  All you have to do is Google 1984 ad and you'll find plenty of copies of it.  Should I play it, Chad?  You think we just.  Here we are.  And, you know.  Oh, I have to skip the ad.  There's an ad on the ad.  That seems a little much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ad recursion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's inception.  Everybody's seen this so many times.  It's it almost.  We were talking about Star Wars before the show began.  And it's like it's of that.  It's of that kind of.  Cultural.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Phenomena.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's funny.  The soundtrack sounds exactly like the new iPad ad soundtrack with Robin Williams reading  Walt Whitman poetry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's amazing is that they managed to capture 30 years ago what it looks like inside an  Apple Store today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's going to be a big event Saturday at the Flint Center where the Macintosh was unveiled  on January 24th, 1984.  January 25th, 1984.  And a lot of the original Apple team will be there.  It's going to be a big event at the Flint Center Cupertino.  And they're selling tickets online.  Mac thirtieth.  Dot com.  So there you go.  A bit of a little bit of history.  Tell us about Davos.  What are you doing there?  What is the World Economic Forum, Jeff?  I was just trying to switch headsets to see if I could get rid of the lag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The World Economic Forum is 1500 machers from all fields, business, government, NGOs, journalism  who come together every year.  And stuff happens here.  It really does.  So tomorrow I get, today I got to go to a session listening to Japanese Prime Minister Abe.  I wish it were fascinating.  I'm going to go to a session with him.  I'm going to go to a session with him.  I'm going to go to a session listening to Japanese Prime Minister Abe.  I wish it were fascinating and exciting.  If I cared more about Japan versus China, I might have been fascinated.  But it was a hot room and I was sleepy.  Tomorrow we get to see the President of Iran.  And Mexico.  The next day the President of Brazil.  Our little media group.  So it's fun.  What is the idea?  I get to see all kinds of people I don't see year around.  And talk to people.  So I'm going to a session this morning on Big Brother with Senator Leahy.  Wow.  10 feet away from me.  We'll talk about that.  It's kind of a hoot.  But if they ask you to come, you don't say no.  Who does this and why?  Who does?  Comes to Davos and why?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who is the World Economic Forum?  I mean, is this a government that throws this event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  It's a guy named Klaus Schwab.  Professor Klaus Schwab, who's German and now Swiss.  And he put together this organization 30 some years ago.  And it's really quite phenomenal because he brings together all these world leaders.  Companies pay upwards of $500,000 a year for the privilege to come.  Plus plenty of other fees.  They can make a fortune on this stuff, but it's a not-for-profit.  And it does bring together world leaders.  And major things have happened here.  And so it's a pretty amazing thing.  It's neat.  Yeah, it is.  It is.  It's also one percent-ish.  But you know, so is most of the world.  There was a study out this week that said that there are 83 people whose wealth equals half the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think a few of them may be here.  That is depressing, isn't it?  Those inequality statistics.  So Matt Cutts a couple of days ago blogged at mattcutts.com.  Okay, I'm calling it.  If you're using guest blogging as a way to gain links in 2014, you should probably stop.  Because over time it's more and more of a spammy practice.  And if you're doing a lot of guest blogging, you're hanging out with really bad company.  Danny, he kind of backed down a little bit saying, that doesn't mean don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His original post said, you know, it's like the decline and fall of guest blogging.  And that was the headline.  Right.  And when you read the article, he said, look, if you're doing guest blog to try to build links and all this sort of stuff, you should stop.  And it's just really spammy.  It's not really a helpful thing.  And that's sort of his warning shot that, you know, if Google were to take a close look at somebody's website and think that you're just running a lot of blog posts that have no real purpose other than to try to help somebody else rank better, then you might be deemed as spamming.  But what happened was you had a lot of people who have guest contributors and guest blog posts that are written not because they're trying to help someone rank better in Google or that the person trying to rank better than Google, but they just, you know, they're contributors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an established practice.  Oh, Malik does it on Giga Ohm.  Forbes does it.  It's an established practice.  Not everybody who posts on a blog works for that blog.  What's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so and so the issue really was that in this case, Matt is probably too close to it when he thinks of guest posts and guest blogging, you know, in his mind.  And I think of people in the SEO space, you tend to think that crummy guest blogging stuff, right, where you get these requests from people like, Hi, comma, I've been visiting your site that I love.  I would like to give you content.  Here is my content.  All I ask is for three do follow links back and all that stuff.  So he had to walk it back and say, Look, I'm not saying don't do guest blog posts.  I'm saying don't do guest blog posts for SEO purposes where, you know, you think that because you can just get this post running in a bunch of different places and you manage to get a nice link in there that says best used cars, you know, somewhere hidden in the text of whatever that's going to rank you well.  That that's one of the things that they're going to be going after.  But it did.  It caused the most notable example I thought was Charles Strauss, who's like, you know, this award winning science fiction author is out on Hacker News going.  But I have, you know, Hollywood directors and everybody about to do guest blog posts.  And now I'm kind of worried.  How's Google going to automatically figure this stuff out?  So it it caused some panic.  And importantly, there is no automatic method on how this works anyway.  It's really kind of like how Google deals with advertorials.  It can't look at a web page and think, you know, that's an advertorial where someone has paid to have an article placed and they have a link in it.  Therefore, that violates our guidelines.  We're going to, you know, knock it down.  What happens is they go into a website because something suspicious has been raised.  It's almost like going through customs or whatever.  And like, right, you come over here, we're going to flip through your bag now and see what you got.  And then they go through and they say, right, well, I'm seeing all these sorts of things.  That's not kosher with us.  Now you're getting a penalty.  So really, if you've been doing blog posts because you have guests and you think that that's really good content, there's nothing for you to panic about.  But if you've been running blog posts because people out of the blue have been coming to you saying, hey, I've got some great content.  Why don't you run it for me?  This would be a great thing for both of us and we'll rank better on search engines.  Yeah, don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we get that email all the time.  I'm sure you do, too.  It's search. I get that a lot.  Yeah, yeah, I get that all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And I'm not even really actively blogging anymore.  It's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It strikes me that it's a little bit like porn.  You know, the famous comment by Justice.  I can't remember his name.  I don't know what porn is, but I know when I see it.  Of course, we all know spammy blog posts, but I don't know how it might be difficult to algorithmically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but Leo, that's what that's what Matt's saying is that at some point he's going to have to trust quality bloggers that are really put in there for a good reason.  And it's more of a human thing.  He's saying to the bloggers, it's got to be a computer.  A computer can't do it.  If you do it all the time, you have nothing but guest blogs.  This goes back to this idea that I've mentioned a lot of times that came up today.  You're a Davos, actually, is that I still think that Google has to have appeal of practices.  And I also think a jury of peers, if there were a jury of bloggers who said who helped Google and said, yeah, that's spam.  That's OK. Listen to us, Google.  It takes the heat off Google for having the power of God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but isn't this exactly what Google doesn't want to do?  They want to if they could, they do everything algorithmically because the last thing they want to be like, first of all, the first my first reaction to this is, wow, Google wheels a lot of power.  And that power could be well wielded unfairly and perhaps is wielded from just ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just ask Expedia, which has I think a six percent drop in its stock because it was penalized by Google yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twenty five percent of their search visibility has disappeared, according to Barry Schwartz writing in your search engine land.  So, yeah, Google does. This is where Google. Google is vulnerable for antitrust here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they've got to be careful and they've got to come up with better procedures and they got to come up with more transparency about this.  It was brought up today here at Davos.  The head of Bain brought up the rap genius case and made it very clear that rap genius messed up.  They messed up, came back. But it's this idea that Google has the power of God in these instances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did Expedia break any rules? I mean, this is a severe penalty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we don't know for certain. We we don't know for certain.  We know that Expedia in December had been spotted and outed by a post that was saying, look, they look like they have all these unnatural links and they're in weird places like the footers of WordPress blogs and stuff like that.  And then nothing happened. And then they took this hit. Expedia is saying nothing on the record.  Google saying nothing on the record. But it has all the look and feel like, yeah, Google saw something that Expedia was doing and decided to hit them with it.  I mean, when Google rarely actually goes through and confirms that they penalize somebody.  So when you want to know if someone's in Google jail, you search for them.  And if you can't find them in ways that you'd expect to them, then you kind of have a pretty good idea that they were in.  But in terms of the antitrust thing, you know, it's it's hard.  First of all, Google has First Amendment protections in the United States to do whatever the heck it wants pretty much with the search results.  That's already been tested. I mean, it's been tested years ago.  So if the New York Times decides that it does not want to run an article about some company that it thinks has been doing bad PR to drum up stuff, nobody says, well, you're so powerful.  The New York Times and it is powerful. We're going to, you know, control your whatever.  And also, Rap Genius doesn't compete with Google. Right.  So it sucks if you're Rap Genius that you can't go there.  But it's hard to make a case that Google on an antitrust purpose decided and we kept Rap Genius down.  But the whole reason that Google is an antitrust issues right now in in Europe actually came out of the exact same thing where there was a shopping search engine that Google felt like was doing some sort of  spammy stuff, penalized them because it felt like it was protecting its search quality.  And then the shopping search engine, this was found and decided that, no, this was Google trying to prevent competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they're in the same business. Right. Just as they are with ITA in the same business as Expedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure. And in fact, Expedia, I think, is part of the same group that kind of glommed on to this whole big antitrust thing.  And Google's got to be stopped or whatever.  Now, the interesting thing, though, is Google has already cleared of all that stuff in the US.  The FTC has said, no, you're fine. We're still staying to see what happens in the EU.  But it is a weird case where, you know, somebody it's a weird anti it's a weird fight back against spam to then seize the antitrust aspect.  There's relatively few companies that can use that to say Google went after me on, you know, because they're trying to be a monopoly.  Most companies that are hit are either hit because there's a good reason that they should be hit or they get hit and they just, you know, are upset because they don't think Google's being fair.  But they don't tend to think and Google's not being fair from an antitrust perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is how Google muddies the waters with their acquisitions, because they it's tough if you want to be a search engine and you're in the same business as somebody that you're posting links to.  It seems like they have real antitrust, maybe not, but conflict of interest for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, the more that the more the Google is doing stuff.  I did this thing about a year ago. I talked about how Google changed from a search engine to destination.  The more Google has its own destination content or its own stake and where it can send you to, the more that it gets susceptible to these accusations that always trying to be abusive or whatever.  So, you know, and it's tough because there are some cases where you're looking at these types of things and you're like, well, this is cruddy.  But my perspective is the bigger issue isn't what Google's wielding all this power, whatever the bigger issue is that most of these things happen because Google is desperately, desperately trying to protect the sanctity of the link as a way that we they count both to figure out what pages should rank better.  And I always go back to trying to liken it as if, you know, Google is stuck on this fossil fuel fuel.  You know, the links are like this fossil fuel that are really heavily polluted at this point that people buy them, sell them, barter them, trade them.  They don't give them when they should. They do give them for reasons that they shouldn't do or whatever.  And Google keeps coming up with all these reasons why you should be able to use a link in this case, but not that like, well, press release links.  We're not going to count anymore. Well, guest blog posts, we won't count.  We will count them, but only if it's like a real guest post thing or no, you don't want to have your links being an infographic because now those infographics, we don't know that everybody's vouching for that.  And it's like a laundry list to think to the degree that it's like, I don't really know what's left that they're supposed to count.  And I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everything you just said, you're right.  And I think you just said, but here's one, one yes, but yes, but is that Google is trying to be transparent and let people know without giving the algorithm off, let people know what works and what doesn't.  And I think we got to give them some points for that. I know I get to be Mr. Pro Google here, but I think that that's that's a factor and where Matt cuts as an open part of Google is trying to explain to people the rationale behind what he does to make that algorithm.  That's not maybe confusing. His job is the world is. Is that really an awful thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love Danny's rant, by the way. And actually, Danny, what I want to hear from you is what you think if links, if links from web pages aren't a good indicator of quality anymore.  Right. So what's the new page rank is is social the new page rank? Are we basically going full circle back to Yahoo when Yahoo used to have editors compile search results to good websites?  Like if Leo Google Plus is a link and he's legit, does that mean that that link should get high page rank? Like what's what else can Google do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think social should be a much bigger part of the equation than it is now. And again, about two years ago now, I think I did an article and it was like when when everyone gets the vote, social shares at the new signal or something like that.  And what I was trying to explain was when Google started, they used the idea of links is votes and that's the democracy of the web. And another metaphor I use that it's like saying, well, if links are votes and that's democracy of the web, then that's democracy in the United States.  When you had to be like 35 and white and a landowner and a man in order to vote, that's not democracy.  Only a small number of people voted. And if you think how many times you have liked a page or content or business or whatever, you've been really happy about something had a great experience that you've then turned around and said, you know, I'm going to write a blog post about this company that I had a great experience with.  I'm going to make sure I link to them because I want to make sure Google understands that they're valuable. I'm going to make sure that the anchor text of that link is very descriptive so that hopefully they'll rank well for, you know, your custom surfboards because that's really good.  And I'm going to make sure I do it on a platform that doesn't automatically somehow put a no follow in there. People don't do that.  But when people are happy with a business, they want to recommend something, they actually like it on Facebook or they tweet it on Twitter or they go to Google+.  So to me, social signals are far more democratic than the link signal.  And when I get that, but when I bring this up with the with Google and with Bing as well, the response comes back is we don't find them that useful.  We don't feel like they're that valuable. They could be gamed. And there's like a litany of excuses they have as to why they can't use social.  And I come back to but I come back to thinking, well, I'm sorry that you're finding that social doesn't seem to work because you've spent all of maybe two years kind of poking at it.  That's like saying solar doesn't work very well because we put all this energy into building a gasoline engine and we don't want to leave that aside as well.  Yeah, social is not going to be perfect at all. You know, there's going to be issues with it.  But I just find it hard to believe that links are somehow so much more better.  And today I'll leave off of this, you know, Matt Cutch has did a post today where he's being asked about it's a video.  You know, does Google use Twitter and Facebook to rank things?  And he's going through and he's at pain saying, no, we don't use Twitter data, social data, Facebook data.  Those are just ordinary pages. We don't count up the followers and all this sort of stuff.  And if you really understand some of the back history, one of the things you're hearing in there that Google especially has a problem with is he will make mention of Facebook.  He will make mention about how they were blocked. He doesn't name it, but he's talking about Twitter from getting Twitter data.  And one of the issues that I think Google has is that back when they had a deal with Twitter, they built a lot of their infrastructure around Twitter's data to an unprecedented degree.  The deal fell apart and then Twitter had to stop. Google had to stop having things like real time search.  And I think they looked at that and they said never again, never again will we be so dependent on a third party for data that we use in our search results,  which is why they don't want to use it. And that's why you also have, by the way, Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, but Danny, there's another thing going on here, which is that, you know, things like Upworthy, which they have good motive behind them, are cynical acts to get you to click on things.  Buzzfeed. Chartbeat said recently they found out that people share before they read.  That the notion that you shared something, you linked to it, is not necessarily a signal at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just like the picture in the headline and I'm going to share that on my Facebook.  And I'm going to be before everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry, I was watching something.  Upworthy comes in and cynically says she turned the page and it changed her life and you don't believe how it will change yours.  And I hate this stuff, how it tells me what I'm going to think, how good the motive is.  So what they're doing there is they're manipulating, instead of the algorithm, they're manipulating us to manipulate the algorithm.  And so once again, I've got to be a little sympathetic to cutsville for saying how do you cut through that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree with you. That's true.  That's why you don't just rely on one signal so heavily.  But it's true. It's like it's like saying I could do that qualification with links and more.  And then there's this whole extreme number of things they do to try to still get value out of link signal.  It's like they're digging up the tar sands of links now and they're extracting whatever left that they can get out of it after they filter it through all this stuff.  And so, no, the social signal is impure, but you also can take that and align it with other things.  So you can take a social signal and you can also then go through and look at things like we have other data that tells us how much time people spend on a website.  Okay. Oh, and this video is actually on YouTube.  Maybe we can tell how long that's played or maybe we can tell the kind of clicks that are happening or there may be data that they have in aggregate that they associate with it.  And that's what the algorithm is all about.  You take all these signals together and try to help them kind of check and balance each other to figure out what works and what doesn't work.  It's just that the link signal has become much more degraded over time.  That's why you get posts from that. I agree. I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's definitely true.  I mean, when you think about it, Google Analytics is on sites across the web.  So Google has all that data. Google has the Knowledge Graph, right?  So we know that Mark Hamill is 62 years old, but in Google knows that right.  So they can look at a web page that says he's 40 and know that that's incorrect.  Like Google can know a lot about the quality of a website based on lots of different signals be beyond just links.  And yet SEO is this is this thing is this game that's still going up being played on a game.  But it's I mean, I mean, content publishers kind of, you know, work the SEO angle like it's their job because so many publishers or content creators depend upon Google traffic to make their money, right?  Because to drive eyeballs to their dads, right.  And I mean, yeah, I think to what you said earlier, Jeff, I do give Google credit for for having Matt cuts in front of a video camera explaining, you know, how they they view certain things.  Of course, Matt is very close to the guest blogging situation.  You know, of course, people shouldn't stop guest blogging.  If you if you know, if there's a blog that that has an audience that you want to reach, of course you would do it.  Forget the SEO. Right.  I mean, you know, he that's why he had to dial it back and say, I mean, for SEO purposes.  But that's just you know, that's just a natural that you'd want to do that.  So I do give them credit for sharing.  I mean, I think that's a good thing.  But I think that Danny's absolutely right that the page rank is a is is it's you know, like the link value should should be small and relative and mixed in with a bunch of other signals, social, you know, other data, knowledge graph data, etc.  Do you think Larry Page has an emotional tie to page?  Right.  Because it's his name, you mean?  Well, everything is impression that I don't get the impression Larry Page is paying much attention to search engines and he's not paying attention to search engines.  I mean, I think he's paying attention to search engines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think he's paying attention to search engines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that's what he's doing.  I think it's just that he's paying attention to search engines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't get the impression that I don't get the impression Larry Page is paying much attention to search these days.  It's not the most open business at Google.  He seems to be off of the end and PageRank, by the way, it's you know, it is it itself is one aspect of it.  In particular, it was we will count links and give each link a score, you know, and they're far more sophisticated.  So I don't think he'd be like, you know, I need to have PageRank 4.0 out there.  I'm not going to let it go with it.  I do I do get depressed more and more each day because as you know, Google is buying and companies that put thermostats here and I'm going to get smart contact lenses and all this stuff.  I keep joking.  And and all that's paid by Mesothelioma and payday loan ads.  Right.  Because the underpinnings to all these great things that Google is doing, you know, the bulk of their income still comes from search and still comes from those search ads that are out there, a lot of which are, you know, not from very savory type of things.  And sometimes I feel like Google just kind of wants to pretend like, well, you know, all that stuff.  Yeah, it's like I'm going to do with us.  You know, we're Google Glass and we're great and we're wonderful.  And for someone who has to deal with the search space day to day, it is a tough job.  I would not want to run a search engine.  And yet you see terrible results.  You see things that don't make sense.  I watched last week.  I wrote a story that we had a thousand, you know, thousands of hotel listings got hijacked in Google Local and Google's response to that was we're aware of it.  What do you mean?  They got people like Hilton and Sheraton.  They have Google Local Plus listings, verified listings, which means that those listings you had to use the PIN number that was sent to your address at the location.  It's like a postcard.  Yeah.  So they these are all verified listings.  A lot of them were verified.  And what happened was the official URLs for those things that would have led you to the Hilton or the Sheraton or the Holiday Inn or whatever got changed to some third party web booking site.  Thousands of listings.  How did that happen?  How would that happen?  That would be a good thing to know, wouldn't it?  And I would think that Google would like to explain it so that we would not have it happen again.  But Google's response initially was nothing at all.  Then they came back after the article ran and said, we're aware of it and we're correcting it.  We don't know how it happened.  But what I do know is if you had thousands of Google Plus accounts that got hijacked and got treated that way, it would have been a user privacy nightmare.  And Google wouldn't have been able to crawl back into their no comment type of reaction.  We don't need to deal with it or whatever.  And the security for those businesses is just as important.  But when it gets into these unsavory things, more and more I feel like Google just is like, well, we won't say anything.  We'll pretend it goes away.  And that's the kind of transparency to me that counts.  That when something goes wrong, you actually step up and explain it clearly so it doesn't happen again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's only going to get worse because the waters are more and more muddied.  You probably saw the article in Ars Technica this week.  We talked about it on Windows Weekly about Machinima paying $3 per thousand impressions to its YouTube video producers to include positive content about Xbox one money that apparently was given to the Machinima from Microsoft.  Although the question about is whether Microsoft knew anything about it.  And they say they did not.  Machinima specifically told these YouTube video makers that it had to be positive content about Xbox one.  They couldn't say anything negative about Machinima and they couldn't say it was a sponsored mention, which is, of course, a violation of FTC guidelines, which I would get really upset about if it weren't for the fact that every time I watch Modern Family, apparently everybody just uses Windows phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to be under the dome.  It's everywhere.  You cannot get away from it anymore.  It is everywhere.  And at this point, I have had it with let's get worried about it when it happens online where the FTC have to give you guidelines say, oh, that was a sponsor tweet.  You better mention it's a sponsor tweet.  And yet I can watch a half an hour show with so much product placement in it.  And the idea disclosure was at the very end of the credits, which have been shoved up into little things so they can do promos and everything else.  There's a little thing telling me that promotional, you know what?  Modern Family is going to Australia this week.  I love Modern Family, by the way, but they're going to Australia on some big thing or whatever.  They're going to Australia because, hey, we just thought it was a good idea for everybody to go off to Australia.  The Australian Tourism Board is bringing them down there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Danny, you are on a red rant spectacular night.  I know.  You're all wound up like a marching doll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can we talk about Gina's Think Up, which is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it.  All right. Let's do that in a second.  We're going to take a break, talk about something nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love it, Danny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Think Up and we're going to talk about the change log and a lot more you're watching this week in Google with Gina Trapani, Danny Sullivan from Search Engine Land.  He's always been, you know, you've always been the guy who is keeping Google honest.  And I'm just thrilled that you're here as always.  And of course, from Davos, Switzerland and the World Economic Forum, Machar Jeff Jarvis.  Machar. I like that word.  We have a great Saturday brought to you by Shutterstock.com.  If you do publications, if you do PowerPoint presentations, if you're doing advertising, if you're doing any project that you need royalty free images for, you've got to check out Shutterstock.com.  It is our royalty free clip art.  I don't want to use the word clip art.  It's so much more than clip art.  It's our royalty free photo site of choice.  We have the 25 image a day subscription.  It's very useful, partly because the amount of stuff on Shutterstock is so incredibly huge.  Thirty two, almost 33 million royalty free stock images, illustrations, vectors and videos.  But then, you know, that would be nothing if you didn't have a good search tool.  And they have probably one of the best.  You can not only search for objects, for nouns like bulldozer, but you can search for you can modify it with adjectives.  You can put I wonder if we can find I wonder if there's a lonely bulldozer in picture anywhere in here.  Yes, there's a lonely bulldozer.  Oh, oh, he's a lonely bulldozer looking out at the Vista.  That's I mean, that is a great search engine.  So when I say 32 million images, people might go, well, I can't you going to find what you want?  You can.  Absolutely.  Not only that, they had 20,000 plus images every single day.  So every time you visit, you're going to find something new.  The images are for the most part from professional photographers and artists.  Of course, they're all curated individually for content and quality.  They're just fabulous.  Just fabulous.  I want you to visit Shutterstock.com.  Try the search engine.  Sign up for a free account.  That's a good idea, because then you can create a light box where you can save images to your light box access.  Many times share them with other team members.  It's a great way to get inspiration.  They have a wonderful iPad app, a Webby award winning iPad app, which lets you search on the go and find inspiration on the go as well.  Shutterstock.com.  Truly international as is Twitter.  If you go to Shutterstock.com and you buy something, they have multilingual customer support in more than a dozen countries, full time customer support throughout the week.  They speak your language.  No credit card needed to set up an account.  But if you do decide you want to buy, I invite you to use our offer code TWIG114, TWIG114, and you'll get 25% off any package.  Shutterstock.com.  Try it for free, but TWIG114 if you want to save 25% off.  Don't forget to check, when you go there, there's a, you're normally on the photos page, but then there's the footage page, which has a whole bunch of stuff, clips and stuff, things you can save for free.  See, that would be useful right there for a PowerPoint.  A battery filling up in my dreams that fast.  Shutterstock.com.  Now play the drums, blow the horns.  It's time for the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think this is? A morning show? Here she is, Gina Trippani with the latest from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've been waiting for this. We have talked about this. We talked about this coming up, but now it's finally happening. We're seeing Google now integrated into Chrome on the desktop.  Before you get too excited, these are the Chrome Canary builds. These are the really, really early builds.  And it's for Windows and Mac. It's Canary build 34.0.1788. Google and their crazy version numbers.  So you have to install the Chrome Canary build and then you got to go into Chrome, Flags, Enable Google Now, change it to Enable, Restart, Sign In, Stand on your Head.  And then when it's all done, you'll see a little card that says Google Now on your desktop. Stay connected to what you need to know across all devices.  This is basically the Google Now that you get on your Android phone. But you see weather, scores, traffic and reminder cards in Google Now.  Where does it show up though? I mean, how does it show up? Is it a...  It shows up. It looks like a browser notification window basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so it's in the menu bar on a Mac anyway. Yeah, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. Okay. Exactly. Exactly. So I want this upgraded to a stable build ASAP because I love Chrome Now.  You don't use Canary?  I just installed it today because I wanted to try this out. I don't use Canary. I'm usually on beta. So I don't know. Maybe I'm just not cutting edge a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did Canary for a while. I didn't see any more problems with it or anything like that. I'm using beta right now. But I got to think it's almost here if it's in Canary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it's a good sign. I use Push Bullet, which is this extension that pushes notifications from your Android phone to your desktop.  So I often do see Google Now cards, but that's kind of a hacky roundabout way to do it. I love that this is built in.  And you know, the warnings around Canary is like it can break at any time. And even when you enable Google Now, it's in the experiment section.  And there's this giant disclaimer across the top that says like, hey, any of these could break at any time. Your privacy could be compromised.  You know, we take no responsibility. I mean, yeah, they really kind of disclaim the whole thing.  So, you know, I think I'm going to stick with beta. But this actually did get me to install Canary because I wanted to check it out.  Google Alerts, Google.com slash alerts, which I haven't looked at in a long time, but I did.  I went back to it today because I wanted to put in an alert for ThinkUp. Got a redesign.  So it looks like Google's paying a little more attention to one of these lesser known but super useful features.  The Google Alerts emails. Basically, you put in a keyword, you say, send me send me email with new news stories with this keyword in them.  And the email got a redesign. It brings kind of it brings it closer to Google's latest look and feel.  There's the card style layout that you'll see in Google search results or Google Now and Google's mobile apps.  And the new alerts will tell you what kind of alert you're getting hourly or daily or weekly.  And they have larger headlines, social sharing buttons, including Twitter and Facebook.  So if you haven't checked out Google, Google Alerts in a while, if there's a story or keyword you want to keep on top of, even if it's your own your own name or your company's name, I'll admit that I have total ego searches set up there.  Check it out. And finally, Google, Google's research division put together a really neat visualization of music that's been uploaded to Google Play Music.  So if you go to research.google.com slash big picture slash music, you'll see the Google Play Music timeline and it shows kind of I'm actually not sure what it shows, but it's sure pretty in place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Popularity of genres over time, I guess. Right. I love that over time. Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you mouse over the different genres, you can see the most popular albums.  So this is based on play music data or rather songs that play music users have uploaded to play music based on the album release date and genre.  And it's just a beautiful visualization and a really neat sort of discovery mechanism really for music lovers over time from 1950 through 2010.  Yeah, I love graphs. Yeah, I do too. Yeah. Even if I'm like, I don't know what this means. I still want to click on it.  I don't know what it means, but I like it. Yeah, exactly. Yep. And that's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's your change log. Thank you, Gina. Sure.  You know what I mostly got out of this is push bullet. So push bullets great. So that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have I not talked about push bullet? Oh, I love. Oh, man. I love push bullet. I talked about it all about Android, right? Yeah, all about Android. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you put an app on your phone and then you have to have a Chrome extension on Chrome. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then any notifications that go to your phone show up on your desktop. That's so cool.  So if you get a text Google Now card and Google now for a while, it would be crazy because I use Hangouts.  And so when someone chatted me on Hangouts, I would get the notification on Hangouts on my desktop and then I would get the push bullet notification.  But you can still let you can disable by app so you can say, hey, don't mirror my notifications here.  But it's a really nice. It's really nice when the phone's ringing. You can see who's calling right on the on the desktop or any any app fires notification.  You can see it without having to pick up your phone. Push bullet push to. So I put it on my.  This is neat. And I could push stuff to the phone, too. You can push stuff to the phone. You can push stuff to your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really it's really cool. Cool. Independent app. Love it. And it's free. Yep. Wow. Thank you, Gina. Very nice. Push bullet.  I just installed. Nice. You got to listen carefully to every inch of this change log. There's all sorts of stuff in there.  You never know Easter eggs. I like to throw in there. By the way, I just I was looking at Google now to see because somebody said, oh, I only get sports, but I get lots of good stuff.  I get birthdays on my Google now. I get my calendar updates, my stocks and oh, look, in Petaluma, it's 72 degrees right now.  That's mean of me. That's just mean. That is wrong. Did you get 14 inches and 18 degrees in New York? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you get 14 inches last night? That's what I heard. Yep. Yep. It took me four hours to get from JFK to Manhattan yesterday.  Yeah, it was it was one of those days walking. No, slower. I was on a bus. Wow. Yeah.  Did you fly in? No, Uber's. Even Uber couldn't save me yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. What's it like in Davos? I'm sure it's cold and snowy, but you expect that. No, no. Today was it was last I knew it was 50 degrees. OK, we're all screwed up.  And Danny, you're in San Diego. Where are you? I'm in Orange County, Newport Beach, where it's beautiful and warm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I don't know what my temperature is. It's probably not. Actually, you're a bit warmer, I think, in Petaluma than you are because we got some coastal fog. I can't believe it's 72 degrees.  That's crazy. I've been feeling a little bad, but she's in the weekend. Yeah, it's just not super bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This weather report brought to you by Google Now. I dread looking at now in the morning, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have to decide whether or not I put thermal underwear on. OK, you chose it. Young lady, you wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. Although I was just interviewing a camera. Maybe it was Larry Downs for triangulation.  But there's a general consensus that Brooklyn is is a hotbed of innovation right now. Oh, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is the time and place to be. I yeah, I think it is. That's why I'm here. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he was. That's what he was saying. He also. How often do you come into Manhattan, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm in the office every day now. So it's all your. OK. You're based out in Manhattan now.  Well, my think up's office is in Manhattan, but I'm living in Brooklyn.  I'm actually still waiting to close on my new place, so I've been kind of air being crashing in my mom's house.  Yeah. Long story. I will not regale you harder to get a loan than ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks to those bankers down there on Wall Street. Yeah. I practically give them blood type stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tell me about it. Tell me about it. I blame the bankers and the lawyers. Crazy now. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're close. We're close. Speaking of crazy, a man and his wife in Columbus, Ohio,  subjected to hour long interrogation by the FBI because employees at the AMC movie theaters saw him wearing Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I didn't believe this story at first, but it's been confirmed since it's it's just ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This poor guy, this poor guy. He he's so he's been in this theater before.  This is Columbus, Ohio. He's been in this theater before.  He's an hour into watching the movie with his I think with his wife or his partner.  He's got glass on these guys come and grab him and grab glass off of his face and take him into an interrogation room.  I'm laughing. It's not funny, but I just can't imagine getting like he blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He blogs on the gadgets here is quite embarrassing. Outside of the theater, there were five to ten cops and mall cops.  It was like major bust. First of all, of course, because it's glass, he could have been recording the movie, right?  Yes, he could have been. So I could have been recording it on his phone. Right.  I mean, well, but people do that and you will get I mean, that is a crime.  But I think that world's worst video. That's what's so absurd about it.  Oh, but they do. I mean, they do. I mean, there's camcorders.  People are getting up and down. The net sounds terrible, but people do it and people sell it.  But is this really a commensurate response?  Somebody who's horrors, Google, taping a movie, even if he was taping the movie, it takes five to ten police officers to take this man down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This theater had trouble with bootleg, with people recording movies in the past.  So I guess when they were interrogating him, they were saying, like, hey, man, just give up your body, like who you working for?  Just give up the guy up the chain and we'll let you go.  And he was saying, hey, just plug in my glass to a computer and you'll see like there's pictures of my wife and my dog on there.  I didn't record the movie and it was an hour or like quite a bit of time passed before they actually looked at glass  and tried to see whether or not ascertain whether or not he was actually recording.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says, he writes, I insisted they connect to the glass and see that there was nothing on it.  I also insisted they look at my phone and clear things out.  But they wanted to talk first. They want to know who I am, where I live, where I work, how much I'm making, how many computers I have at home,  why I'm recording the movie, who I'm going to give the recording to.  Why don't I just give the guy up, up the chain? Because they're not interested in me over and over.  You know, there is something really wrong when federal law enforcement officials are doing the bidding of the Motion Picture Association of America like this  when there's real crimes going on. This is ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, if you're going to question him, what was I think there's so much I found disturbing about it.  Like, are you going to be ripped out of your seat? OK.  But you're going to be questioned, you know, without being ridden your rights, but you're not actually under arrest, but you're clearly being detained.  And technically he should have been able to walk out at any time he wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said that. They said you're not under arrest. But if you choose not to cooperate, bad things may happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And really, at that point, you can say, well, then bring on the bad things because I'm leaving unless you want to arrest me or whatever.  But so there are all these things. But what was disturbing to me was that there's no technical expertise.  If you're going to go after somebody and these people, some of them when they seem to have some knowledge of the bootlegging, how it's going on or whatever,  and you see that someone has these Google Glass, you think you would at least Google a little bit of information about them or at least order.  And in short order, you'd understand things like, well, you're going to get maybe 45 minutes of the movie recorded, you know,  or if he is telling you, well, you can take a look at the one or whatever with it from there, then then do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. He said they released him five minutes after they checked.  Once they they went through my phone and five minutes later, they concluded I had nothing wrong and offered him four passes to another movie at the theater.  There is a lesson to be learned here, though. Don't wear your glass into a movie theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, there's a lesson to be learned for not for that guy, but for stupid movie theater owners and stupid cops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I disagree, because I think that if you did the same thing, if you held up your phone and did this, or if you had a even camcorder,  they would go in and arrest you and they would be within their rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's against the law. His his he had prescription lintges attached to his class.  Those are his classes. Ah, yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's he wears glasses. Yeah. You know, it's funny, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't get that. It's even the recording device. It's like the battery.  The battery. It's a recording device. It is also your phone.  If I'm wearing my smartwatch to the thing, I don't get arrested because it has a recording.  No, but you would if you held it pointed at it. And the problem with glass is it.  If I hold my watch, you get shot. If you go to look at it, my things up or whatever.  I could be having glass on because I want to sit in the movie theater for whatever reason.  I want to get a notification on email. I want to get a text message showing up so that I know if I'm having a problem with my babysitter.  Whatever. Just because it has a recording device doesn't mean that it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think this is the fundamental problem with glass is that it does have a recording device that is pointed at you.  And you don't always know if it's recording. It's the same societal problem of going into a bathroom with glass.  And people, if you want to have glass take off, you better be very sensitive to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Leo, I I felt the same way that you did before last night's episode of all about Android, which I'm going to plug right now,  because we had a guest on Cecilia body, who was the woman who was pulled out, was stopped and given a speeding ticket on the road in the San Diego area.  But she had glass on while she was driving. And the the cop also find her or tried to find her for all her wearing glass.  And, you know, to me, and one, by the way, she had to fight in court and she won.  Right. Because they couldn't prove that she was watching a video on glass.  Right. Which is what what the law prohibits is that you're looking at the second screen.  And, you know, my attitude was like, why would you wear glass while driving or why would you wear glass to the movie theater?  That's just dumb. And, you know, especially driving.  Right. Because when you open the package, the first things it says is like, hey, this is not lawful to wear while you drive.  Like, don't wear. I mean, Google basically says don't wear it while you're driving.  But, you know, Cecilia, explain like she first of all, she's a CTO of a company that develops glassware.  She she she wears glass all day long. She puts she wakes up in the morning, puts them on and she's she's a very dedicated explorer.  They're just her glasses. She doesn't think about it anymore.  She puts them on and wears them. And it sounds like this is the situation with this guy in the movie theater.  And it didn't occur to her to take them off while she was driving.  And she wasn't, you know, she she wasn't watching Netflix on her glass or whatever.  She was just driving and particularly with driving.  It's like navigation is a is a totally legitimate use case for wearing glass while driving.  So, I mean, look, I think that the Explorer program and I said this on the show last night,  the Explorer program is very much the sort of like canary in the coal mine thing.  I mean, I think that Google is figuring out like where's glass, where's glass, you know, create these these issues or these problems.  And I think that, you know, movie theater officials and cops on the on the highway are figuring out what are what is glass.  What is, you know, when they're on, does that mean that they're recording or not?  I mean, I think it's just a misunderstanding of the technology.  But unfortunately, you have people like Cecilia and this guy in Ohio who have to, you know, be the ones to deal with these sort of legal.  I think there's some onus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's some onus, though, on glass owners to be aware of the sensitive nature of this.  And while I don't care if he's in a movie theater, I do think that the glass owners need to put the glass up in their head when they're in a men's room.  I mean, I just I feel like it's it's kind of a little tone deaf on the part of glass owners to say, hey, man, these are my prescription glasses.  What's your problem? You're wearing a recording device in your head.  So you be aware of that. And some people are going to take umbrage.  Some of them will be federal law officials.  So it might be behoove you just to avoid the problem.  Like, if that's his only pair of glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he explained quite a bit, actually, some other things I was reading on how he has a spare pair, but he's actually been using them as his ordinary pair of glasses.  Well, he needs to kind of wise up.  Yeah, but you know, he'd also said that he's been to the theater before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so we got away with it before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That doesn't mean it's not cutting away with anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, hold on, hold on, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You and I know wearing a recording device in your head carries a higher responsibility than not wearing a recording device in your head.  Will you not agree to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to repeat this recording device that has like five minutes battery.  No, I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're wearing a recording device in your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would agree with you in general.  For example, I if I go into a restroom and I am actually wearing glass, I will put them on my head when I walk in.  OK, but I need to slide them up.  It's no big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just living in the world, Jeff.  You got people.  Let's go to that.  They don't have to worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to go and then they're going to go.  And then, you know, but it's not that big a deal.  It's like a it's like a consideration to do for anybody.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me write back.  Let me write back.  If you really think that is that every man on earth wants to shoot other men's junk.  The only thing stopping them is they don't have a camera on their head.  That's not what we're saying.  That's what we're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to be where you're saying.  If you know, if you go around with a tape recorder like this, people are going to take umbrage and write it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, glasses that have technology on it.  Jesus, I mean, is this this week in Ludditeism?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What happened?  I'm just saying that, yeah, I can see Leo's point that you might want to think about a bit more when you're using technology that people are not as familiar with and might be a bit freaked about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I'm asking you to give credit to people that they're not going to suddenly be bad because they have technology attached to their head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand that.  I'm not saying that they are.  I'm not even saying this.  I'm not saying this guy did anything wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm saying you shouldn't have to act.  You're saying he should act as if people should assume that he does.  He should be sensitive to the fact that people act as if he is virtuous until he does something wrong.  You are making him guilty before he proven guilty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like if I'm like if I'm wearing glass on occasions and I'm sitting at a table with someone or I'm talking with somebody or interacting with somebody, I may move it to the top of my head just so they don't think I'm going to be suddenly being distracted.  It's the same way that if I'm talking to somebody and I look at my phone while I'm talking to them, that can be interpreted as rude.  Jeff, are there are there any the let me ask you this, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are there no places you can envision where it would be inappropriate to wear glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the issue of wearing it.  I don't think it's a matter of inappropriateness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think I don't know where you could you could imagine somebody wearing glass where it would be appropriate to put them away or to take it off.  That that's because appropriate.  I think it's appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In every circumstance, I think it's appropriate to say to someone, are you recording?  It's appropriate to say I'm not recording.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I'm going into a locker room, if I'm going to a locker room where there are children changing and I'm wearing glass, it's there.  I should say, hey, I have a right to wear this.  I say this about right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm saying that you are presuming that because someone is using a technology, the use of it is bad.  Yeah, you are.  And that's an issue because the because the knee jerk of the techno panic crowd is that any use of technology, if it could be done bad, it will be done bad by everyone.  And we none of us should use it.  And I'm objecting to that logic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, if I carry an axe around and I have no intent to chop anybody, this is for wood.  If I carry a gun around, I have no intent to shoot anybody.  I use this to shoot deer.  Are there not things that are just I mean, maybe legal, but society, Lee, it might be nice if people showed some consideration for other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, it ain't far away from you that people drive around with gun racks in the back of their pickups.  And if you went up to them and said, I object to you doing that, you shouldn't do that.  I want to I want to dash cam on that scene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I can assure you if they came in here carrying weapons, in fact, you know, you go to Texas, every bar has a sign that says, please don't bring your gun in here.  Yeah. Is that wrong?  But are they are they in some way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Glass is not a gun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just saying there are there are behaviors.  There are things you can have, whether you intend to do anything wrong or not, that would just be polite to take them all.  Same discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Same discussion.  No, the guys, the guys glasses when I get glass, when I get the new glasses and I get prescription lenses on them, I'm not carrying around an extra pair of glasses and change them all the time.  That's my glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that I just think this is this is going to be an issue going forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's going to be very it was the same argument when when when cameras went on to cell phones and it was oh, my God, we can't allow them anywhere.  How many stories have you seen of sicko's taking pictures of gyms?  We didn't see it because we're not sicko as a society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I have to say, if I go in a locker room, I don't go I don't go in a locker room like this.  Hey, everybody.  But if you're wearing it on your head, it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, Leo, they got their phone out there, texting like this and the camera could be pointed at your junk, but they're doing this.  Well, I think that's rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think you should do that.  I think that's extraordinarily rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess at CES, I was in a restroom.  And like I said, if I had had glass, I when I walk in, I probably would have moved to the top of my head just not because I'm worried that some guy standing next to me thinks I'm taking a picture of him, but just because the entire bathroom area tends to have some degree of privacy expected into it.  So I'm like, you know, for whatever reason, I'll put it there.  But as I was in this restroom, the urinals in this restroom started to get too graphic.  Last week, we talked about this particular hotel thought it was funny that above all the urinals was pictures of women making funny faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, looking at your junk.  Yeah.  You know, I didn't that's in Vegas.  Yeah, I've seen that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How did you buy?  Wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I want to share that picture of it with my regular phone.  But before I did that, I was really, really careful to make sure nobody's around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If somebody's standing at the urinal, you do not take that picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not saying you would take a picture then.  And I'm not saying that just because I have a camera with me.  But Jeff, we can't tell with glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me just say as somebody who's.  Yes, you can.  I can tell you're taking a picture.  OK, glass.  But you don't have to do OK glass.  You can wink.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You can't.  You can go like this and wink.  You can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you're playing a techno panic.  And so there was no justification for the treatment of this guy in this theater for  wearing his glasses that happened to have a camera attached that he was not using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the right thing for the theater to do was to say, I'm sorry, you can't wear your  glass into the theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the right thing to do was to say, remember, sir, please don't use that camera.  Oh, yeah, that'll work.  Once again, what faith you have in mankind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the reality is if he had actually been recording the movie with glass, it would  have been a worse recording if he had been had a giant camcorder on his shoulder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That doesn't stop people from doing it and selling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But then he also would have had 45 minutes of the movie.  OK.  I mean, it's not it's just it can't you can't do two hours of video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's like saying, well, you know, you know, I have this camera phone and I'm holding  it like this, but you don't have to worry because it only can record, you know, 720p.  I mean, I don't think that that's really germane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think part of the issue again, this is this is a precursor of what's going to  come.  We I think we are going to have glasses that have recording device.  I agree.  Because they make a lot of sense.  So the issue is not going to go away.  And it's going to become even more complicated because, yeah, if you are having glasses where  everything can fit into an ordinary frame, those would be your main glasses.  The reason I don't wear glass to when I go to the movie theater, by the way, is because  aside from the fact I don't need them, I like to wear my regular glasses to let me see at  distance.  Right.  So I'm you know, I'm not going to double stack them or whatever.  I don't need them for most things.  But, you know, if I had a pair of glasses or especially around here, sunglasses, I'm  desperate for a pair of sunglasses.  I use glass here in Newport as my sunglasses.  You know, if I'm going out on the power board or something like that, the sunglasses are  great.  I can take pictures of stuff and I don't really give it a second thought because, you know,  there's a great use case.  And so when they become just this ordinary device you're wearing, it's going to be everywhere.  And so then, you know, I don't know what you're going to do at that point.  Do you stop everybody who walks into a theater?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm telling you, this is a rerun.  This is a rerun of 1890 and the co-ed camera.  You're not allowed to carry a camcorder into a theater either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't think that that's so that's an unreasonable restriction.  Admittedly, they overreacted and what they did was wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think to go both ways, I think to what Jeff is saying, when you eventually get to  everybody has these recording devices, you get to the point where people start to relax  about them and freak and not check out.  And we have our norms.  You'll probably become pretty clear that a movie recorded from someone's head is not going  to be as great, you know, even as things improve.  But I think do you think that we have a legal right to wear glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, right to wear glass.  I have a legal right to carry around a pencil and paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When Glenn Greenwald's husband was prevented from writing down the name of the agents interrogating

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  him at the border of the UK, I was offended by that, that you couldn't record something  by a mean.  What if I go to a theater with a GoPro step trapped to my chest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean, a restaurant that says like shirts and shoes, you know, I'm not going

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to be able to record that.  A restaurant that says like shirts and shoes, please.  You know, you can't.  I mean, that's that's a different thing.  I mean, I think the bar said, you know, no, if I don't use the GoPro to see the movie

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for the private business has that.  So do you have a legal right to go into a private business wearing glass?  Probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The theater has every right to say you may not wear glass in the theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Prove some maybe there's like an American handicapped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ADA says I can wear glasses.  Yeah, I actually had the right to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know, in most cases, no, a private business probably could prevent you to do  it.  I know you have the right to be detained because you're wearing something by law  enforcement without being arrested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, that's but that's recent law that says you cannot record a movie.  And that that is a law.  I mean, I mean, I think they overreacted, but they have the right to do that.  They did not act illegally.  Otherwise, there would be a lawsuit going on right now.  They did not act illegally.

Danny Sullivan, Search Engine Land in Newport Beach.  There is actually, I thought this was kind of interesting, it's a Google moonshot.  They want to make a contact lens for diabetes patients that would diagnose glucose in your tears.  So cool.  Isn't that neat?  It is.  But here too, I immediately heard, auto privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google will know about your diabetes.  Well, that's true.  I then heard diabetics say, if they can invent this and make me healthier, God bless them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think any diabetic minds, and anybody, you know, if you go to a drug store and you buy a, you know, a penprick kit, then you're on CVS's list.  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I heard a great story today at Davos.  Mark Benioff was on stage at an event, and he uses Fitbit religiously.  In fact, here at Davos they're giving us all ups.  Oh, that's neat.  In a health challenge.  But Benioff has a Fitbit, and he's tied into a community of people, and he said he got an email one day, not long ago, from Michael Dell saying, Mark, are you okay?  Benioff said, well, what do you mean?  And Dell came back and said, you haven't been exercising for three days.  And it's just kind of a great story, but then Benioff said, you know, it made him realize.  That's a little creepy.  Well, it's in his close group of friends, the trusts, right?  He wouldn't let Leo L in.  He leads Michael Dell, and he knows him.  But he also said, I'm the CEO of a public company, and maybe somebody's going to know something about my health.  He said, something I realized.  I've got to think about this.  I've got to be careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Interesting.  Yeah, it really was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So like, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So his business, yeah.  So the hell of his company tied to his own health, in a way.  Exactly.  He's broadcasting that or broadcasting.  He's publishing it to at least a small number of people or a number of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw Dell later on the floor, and I said, you and Benioff should compete to become the most connected executive.  And he said, I'll let Mark have that.  Mark also talked about his connected Wi-Fi toothbrush and how he loved that.  What does it do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What does the toothbrush do?  Or his idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  His idea.  I don't know if this is a prototype.  I couldn't tell the difference.  But he really wants it.  Because he wants it to track him, and he wants it to go directly to his dentist.  And his dentist can give him tips.  And he wants there to be a button on it that says, help, and it will connect through his phone to the manufacturer, and he can get help.  Does it do all that now?  I don't think so yet.  I don't think it does anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's made up.  I don't think there is a Wi-Fi toothbrush.  I mean, it's just a matter of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It kept track of how long you were brushing though.  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what you really wanted to do.  Tell you not brushing long enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was one that was going to be connected.  Oh, it's not here yet.  Well, here's a story about it.  ZDNet, Salesforce's Benioff says your toothbrush will be a marketing tool.  Oh, that's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, Mark, shut up.  Because that's just going to make people.  That's exactly what's causing people to worry about this stuff.  You need toothpaste.  You need mouthwash.  You're breath smelling.  Apparently this is a spiel.  We're disgusting.  Yeah.  See, I think what you really want to be careful about is promoting these as a way to get you  better advertising.  I think we've established people don't care about better advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What about a toothbrush that can detect your glucose levels through your saliva as well  as tell you whether or not you've brushed enough?  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I have to say, if they could find glucose levels in tears, they probably could  do blood alcohol level and other things.  Here it is, by the way, the Wi-Fi toothbrush.  Beambrush.com.  Thank you, chat room.  Beamtoothbrush.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Get prizes for brushing your teeth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get prizes for brushing your teeth.

Transcript:  This is the thing about quantified self that just like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gina, you have a daughter.  You're going to be trying to convince her to brush her teeth pretty soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is the thing is like you have these apps treating you like your mom, like giving  you like rewards for doing your chores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But wait a minute.  Look at this brush.  OK, doesn't that look like an electric toothbrush?  It's not.  It's a manual toothbrush.  All of the all of the size and the charging is dedicated just so they can talk to your  phone.  Wi-Fi.  That's so stupid.  Install the free Beam app and connect your brush with a user profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I don't want to start another hour discussion because I'm tired.  But the CEO of Palantir Palantir is the big data secretive big data company.  It's kind of coming out.  He was a DLD where I was this last week and he was in Davos.  He was talking today and he's he uses an example of fascinating data thing that that that that  payments to doctors and pharmacies are and are incredibly indicative of addiction and  overdose.  He said imagine.  So so he said it's not at all implausible in the state of New Hampshire where there's  a huge problem with heroin right now that and the governor did in his entire state of  the state speech about this.  If it's it's it's Tom Cruise you could predict that someone is going to overdose with a good  probability of of being right.  Pre-cry.  You intervene.  Do you intervene?  Well how do you know?  Because the orders on your basis to your doctor and the pharmacy are highly indicative in  ways that I don't know.  But everybody nodded in the room and said yes this is true.  Wow.  It is there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does who intervene?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The the health officials or law enforcement.  I would say not police.  I mean there's no question if you knew that you know in fact this happens all the time.  You had some indication that a child was being abused at home that you would intervene.  Yes.  Yep.  But that's defending an innocent person.  I mean I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well let's say there's no police.  Let's say let's say that you you had a N percent eighty five percent while you're picking  up the number of the high percentage odds that someone was going to overdose.  They had these signs these signals that said they were going to overdose.  And if you don't intervene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you can't.  I don't think you can intervene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you don't think that someone's doctor is beholden to I mean given those indications.  I mean what's the difference between the doctor should say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The doctor should say something.  That's what the intervention is.  The doctor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it across various.  And the doctor should say so the doctor shouldn't go to the person's house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No there's there's hippo stuff.  I was talking to a doctor tonight at a session I was at tonight.  This is the wonders of Davos.  And she said that you know years ago if she were in a hospital and she saw someone she  could pick up the chart and read it.  Now that's it's all electronic.  It's no no no.  And two people in her hospital were fired.  Wow.  Because they looked at data for Boston bombing victims.  Well that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's appropriate.  Because that was late.  That was pure prurient.  That wasn't for health purposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was in that case.  But with the same principle applies.  What if a doctor says you know this person look a little yellow to me.  We're going to walk by.  I don't know.  Maybe I should take a look at them.  You don't have the right authority.  You can't even just look because it's presumed to be evil intent.  What a world.  But I didn't want to get into an hour discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Watch out for your Chrome extensions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It turns out that there is a quick market in a good market in Chrome extensions.  Spammers come along buy a small Chrome extension.  You know has a few hundred thousand users give them a few bucks.  Take it over.  And then there's no mechanism in Chrome to vet updates to that extension.  Google's removed to add to feed Lee and tweet this page after one was sold.  The other was paid to show adware.  Buy a simple update.  And this seems to be a real flaw in the way Chrome extensions are handled.  Google vets the Chrome extension to get it on the marketplace.  But after that anything goes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So there's a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should check updates.  It should.  It should check updates.  And you know how Google found out about this.  The Wall Street Journal.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that true.  Oh no.  No no no.  Well presumably what happens is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People who installed this extension went what the hell I'm seeing ads and complain in some way.  The journal posted ran an article about it.  Google noted the article so we better do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well the other the other problem with extensions and I'm going to talk about this generally because I haven't I haven't done a whole lot of extension development I've dabbled is that you permissions for extensions are very broad.  Almost every Chrome extension that you install asks you for permission to see all your browsing activity on every tab.  I don't know if you've noticed this when you install it freaks me out every time.  But most extensions can't work without those permissions because they do certain things on certain pages and so they have to be able to see you're sort of trusting them to only do what they need to do on the on the you know the pages that they apply to.  But those are overly broad permissions allow for this kind of thing to happen for someone to buy the extension or take it over with malware or whatever.  So I think there's two issues there's like the there's the permissions model which I think Google could do better with a lot and droids permission model which also could use a little improvement but is definitely better than what they have for Chrome.  But also the the update vetting process.  I mean all they have to do is parse that code that source code on every update and check for.  Pretty easy to see wouldn't it.  Check for URLs and see and run it against their malware database you know their their ad or malware database and and and flag it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the way it happened.  Amit Argro Agrawal who created ad defeatly described on his website how he had sold the extension to an unknown buyer for a small sum.  He said the new owner added code that injected of invasive advertising on users.  Meanwhile ours technical report of the other extension Google removed tweet this page also had been purchased and altered to insert ads.  And then this is the Wall Street Journal Google removed the two extensions after being contacted by the Wall Street Journal.  Maybe I'm assuming causation maybe Google was already planning to do that I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a it's a big business I had a very popular Firefox extension back in the day years ago but I got tons of all you know of inquiries partnerships and about ads.  Revenue partnerships and I always turn them down but it was really it was interesting and now you know it's I don't hear about it.  It was Firefox a while ago but um.  But now you know why they were contacting you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically you've got it you've got a Trojan horse in the user's computer that's been given all these permissions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can rewrite links on any website so wherever you want them to go.  Terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is really bad because it's extensions the browser I mean the browser is really the vector.  For getting it for bad guys getting into your computer and extensions have all these permissions and they're sitting right there.  I think we're going to have to really I think Google needs to really look at how extensions are vetted.  Yahoo you probably knew this as the publisher of search engine land dot com.  Yahoo tops the most traffic website list for desktops in the US beating Google Microsoft and Facebook according to com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Only old farts still have desktop.  That's that's that's really that's not mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've been on top for four months now.  So you know I mean that that that was like several months ago when they finally flipped up over to the top.  So the I think the reason you're hearing so much about desktop is because they're having to really qualify that this is desktop.  When it was first that they were up nobody kind of really paid much attention to that.  So that seemed to be the twist that were we're stressing even more that that's what's happening in the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In December Yahoo had more than one hundred and ninety five million uniques.  That's a that's a good number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yes you know the hard thing is we don't know why.  Because when they when they first when they first shot up I did a whole thing on this.  I did charts and everything and I showed that how it was a great post.  Marissa came in they went they did this spike.  I think it was like Yahoo's Yahoo's traffic is up but no one knows why it was something like that.  I'll try to find out later but he you know you have this little spike and then a big spike and then another big spike and spikes like that are unusual slash suspicious.  They don't just happen overnight.  Sometimes they happen because like a publisher suddenly decides that they're going to do slideshows on every page right.  Yeah the same page is now counting twice.  So I went back to Yahoo when all this first came and I said well what what you do.  What's the secret sauce and it's like well we just did a good thing all over all Yahoo.  So you know and then what's also interesting was you know one of our assumptions was well maybe this was because they bought Tumblr but no they weren't counting.  They would be even higher than they are now if Tumblr were wrapped up into it.  The last time I looked at the stats they're still not wrapping up Tumblr into Yahoo's Yahoo's overall properties which is odd.  I think you were on when we talked about this actually you talked about this on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah they're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Yahoo.  So Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think they think it's legit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really don't. I mean I don't I don't like spikes like that without explanation.  Right. I think Yahoo knows why they would spike up on that and they should explain it.  They have they have the details.  Yeah when they don't explain it.  And there was another thing there was a whole series of articles recently that were going out about.  I can't remember who had it but it was like Yahoo's in trouble Tumblr is not growing.  And then there was like a chart and he's going on with Tumblr and then Yahoo's like well you know we don't we only trust numbers that you get from com score.  But then they were like citing the com score numbers and Yahoo's all like quiet.  And so you know well also it's hard to measure mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if they were measuring mobile for those numbers and on and on and on.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There was something I wanted to talk about and I forgot what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh golly.  There wasn't a whole lot of news this week relative to most shows I will say.  That's why we went on forever about that glass story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I also think that there was a lot of passionate feelings about that.  Yes there were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There were a few things that were passionate about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that was the biggest thing.  I also think that there was a lot of passionate feelings about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes there were.  There were a few feelings apparently little did I know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Little did I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of my thrills of Davos was getting to sit across from Tony Fidel of Ness last night.  Oh was he there? What did he say?  He's here. He's just a really charming charming nice guy.  I asked him about whether he was in the Google Hotel and he said oh no it's not closed yet.  We can't do any of that stuff.  But really fascinating to hear him talk about Ness and about the Protect thing and how they spread bit by bit.  And why it made sense to be bought by Google.  Oh can you share that?  Yeah I don't think anything was secretive about it.  I think that you go for more money and then you've got to meet this really high barrier.  And he talked in Munich about how he talked to a lot of companies over time.  It just took a long time.  But when he sat down with Larry Page it was just obviously Kismet.  He said I go into meetings and I think I'm going to teach somebody something to get somewhere in this meeting.  You know how you spell Kismet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $3.2 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amen. Well he worked the hell out of it.  Kismet!  He learned a lot out of Larry.  Yeah yeah yeah.  $3.2 billion.  Yeah but what he told the employees is, you know it's a line you hear all the time in these purchases.  What they really did was invest in Nest.  But it's true they have the resources.  They're going to be able to do amazing things.  I went up to Matt Ford because he talked about this in one of the stories in the rundown.  He has said we're not going to change our privacy policy if we do.  Once you know blah blah blah.  Listen I want Wave to tell Nest on my way home, oh he's in traffic.  Wait an hour before you put the heat up.  I want those connections.  And he said yeah yeah yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First is we're not going to ever ever change our privacy policies which is a stupid thing to say.  He didn't say that.  Well no they said we weren't going to change.  We're not going to share data.  I mean I recall it as being pretty clear.  The first day was we aren't changing anything.  We're just sharing our data.  Which is a stupid thing to say because you are not the CEO founder whatever of your company forever.  And Google has made similar promises how they will never do anything and they do 180 degree turns.  Then the next day is well if we make some changes you know we'd give you lots of notice.  So yeah they're going to make changes.  They probably will share stuff with it.  There'll be some benefits to doing it.  It's just it always makes you laugh when you have a founder act like they've sold their company but the company is never going to change.  Yeah.  Because it changes.  You don't have any choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's called I gave you three point two billion dollars now shut up and go away.  That's OK.  I would take the money and run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I installed the nest up by the way.  I never I didn't have so I ordered the thermostat.  I was away.  Well I thought it was like for me I don't get it right because I don't.  I'm in Southern California.  You never leave the house.  So it's not hot and it's not cold and it's like 10 times a year I turn on to maybe get a little bit more heat.  And then it was like OK you know it's kind of cool that it I thought I was going to constantly try and adjust stuff and no I could see why people would want it.  And it was pretty smart and it was cool to flip the fan on when I was wait just to freak the kids out.  The smoke detector though I'm like wow that's an expensive smoke detector.  And when you get the instructions like and we really recommend smoke detectors be placed inside and outside every room in the house.  It's like $250.  Why are my house with smart smoke detectors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That may be why I didn't really get much out of the nest because I live in California.  Maybe it makes more sense if you live in the frigid tundra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh rub it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was turning on the heat at random times.  It was too smart for its own good.  And frankly Jeff I don't you know if I'm on the way home and I have to get home and the house is cold and I have to turn on the heat.  It's not the end of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You see what here's what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true.  But you but on the other hand if you're in New England or New York you don't let the house get down to 52 degrees.  You're always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Another example.  We have the heated floor in the bathroom.  It's cold where we live.  I want my alarm to be tied to the floor so the floor goes on 15 minutes before the alarm goes off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is such a first world problem.  Oh that's yes.  You could wear slippers Jeff.  And I say that wait a minute and I say that as a guy who has a toilet seat that heats up.  I understand I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Toilet seats.  Those are awesome when I've had them.  Yeah no I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am not immune to the pleasures.  Backlash tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just.  I'm with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm saying I have a toilet seat that washes my butt.  However it's hard to justify a two hundred fifty dollars smoke alarm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh I'm not arguing with that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just usually all this stuff and maybe it'll just be kind of it's just the way it is.  Everything's talking to everything else and it's all I just see all sorts of difficulty.  In having you know I mean this is a lot where we're a little ways off.  It's one hundred twenty nine bucks for the smoke detector.  OK so it's it's only four times more expensive than a first alert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No I think the first alert runs.  Twelve dollars.  They're cheap.  Oh you're not not the wired one was forty five.  The wired ones are more expensive.  I think it's seventy five or eighty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. So it's not so far off.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't remember what it was I wanted to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They auditioned huge numbers of people to be the voice of the Nest alarm.  Because the Nest alarm will say I'll do it'll stop to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I'll do it.  Get out of the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he also said that they picked a woman's voice because children of a certain age you know listen to mothers voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes they do that for pilots.  So the heads up the heads up a voice when you're you're blacking out in a plane is always a female.  Yeah because pilots listen to female voices but that's well that's been known for years.  I didn't know that.  Pull up pull up pull up.  It's always a female voice.  I hate it when they're testing that.  It's very depressing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pull up pull up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just confess my first world problem that I sit in first in business class to hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes I just need a Nest light switch that when the kids leave the room goes hey turn off the light.  Hey I'm not made of money.  I would call it dad's.  Yeah I'm not made of money. Turn off the lights.  Although we had to have one room redone and then they put in these automatic switches that are apparently not very expensive and I was like but you've just made me redundant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way men and the chairman's give me a hard time.  Not just men listen to female voices women listen to female voices too.  It works for both genders.  Humans listen to female voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes but I can add something to this.  I remember reading an article about BMW or somebody in Germany discovering that they couldn't use a woman's voice for the auto navigation in the car.  That was Italy.  Because they did not like a woman telling them what to do.  Oh my gosh.  Oh my gosh.  In that case they had to go to Italy.  And in particular with a man using a co-pilot style intonation because they reacted better.  It was more like the co-pilot with them.  Oh wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's OK the co-pilot is telling us to turn.  But if my wife is telling me to turn I'm not going to turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean I've heard that children particularly babies respond to higher.  I mean that's why this is why babies love Elmo right.  Because the voice is just so high.  But I didn't know that.  Yeah right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can get wood now in your Moto X.  They got four kinds and it's cheap it's 25 bucks to add a wooden back.  They started with a bamboo but as of yesterday ebony.  I know Mike Elgin just ordered his ebony.  Teak and walnut.  God that's gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So are you doing it Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I already have a Moto X but I actually am thinking of buying a new Moto X just so I can have walnut.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Doesn't that look cute?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh so you can't do just the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No no you have to buy a whole new Moto X.  But look at the price by the way.  When I bought the Moto X it wasn't 75 bucks.  They've really dropped the price.  I mean they're not going to substitute but still they've really dropped the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well that's interesting.  You're right Leo.  Absolutely it is.  Yeah right. Interesting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sigh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No off contract it's now $3.99.  That's almost half what I paid.  Trading your old phone and get a credit.  I wonder if they take a Moto X as the old phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really want walnut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so beautiful.  The only reason I wouldn't do that is I just have a strong suspicion there must be a next generation coming any minute now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Any minute now.  Yeah with the price drops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let us take a break when we come back.  Tips, tools, numbers.  Danny if you want to throw in a pick of the week we'd love it.

Transcript:  Wow. Where was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry. That was me. There's sirens going by. I'm trying to mute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I forgot Manhattan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Constant sirens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It kind of makes you feel like it's vital.  You're living somewhere where people are living and dying even as we speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It feels like you're run over the minute you step outside the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mostly dying.  Mostly.  All right. Let's start you off here with the tip of the week, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Drive added a cool new feature, which I really like.  It's an activity stream to the upper right hand side of your drive.  So I really like this. I spent a lot of time in Google Drive.  My business partner and I do a lot of our business documents in Drive.  And so they've added a little, it's a little eye icon.  I don't know what eye stands for. Info? I'm not sure.  At the top right corner, and this is just rolling out now over the past week.  So I saw it in my Google Apps account, but not my Vanilla Gmail account.  So you might have to wait for it to see this.  But you click on it and it's an activity stream of updates to your Google Drive documents.  So what document and who updated it last.  Really, really handy if you share documents, particularly if you share documents with other people a lot.  Kind of to see what's going on and what's happening.  So new Google Drive activity stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I figure the eye is info. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got to be info. That's the universal logo.  Universal. Yeah, there's a circle in the eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff's got quite the number of the week this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's, well, my first number is actually 12.  It's midnight here. So I went to the last number I could.  So I want to preface this by saying it's utter BS.  I don't believe it. But what the heck?  It's just like BuzzFeed. I'm going to give it to you anyway.  Some Princeton researchers say that Facebook will lose 80 percent of its users by 2017.  Well, how do they say that?  Well, they compare Facebook in terms of Google searches to a virus.  Wow.  Now, how you could justify this, I do not know.  They say that it's growing at the rate of the virus, thus it will die at the rate of a virus.  It's BS, but it's a number and it's midnight. So I wanted a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're exactly right. And I think they even got it.  I think it's going to happen sooner than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like bubonic plague Facebook will eventually die out.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I just I feel like I think you can call it.  I think Facebook's dead right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm feeling a case of zucitis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I find myself really not using it as much as I did.  There's a lot of up worthy crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they definitely change the news algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just I feel I feel I don't and I don't think I'm alone.  I think I think even people who use it and the people who use it use it because that's how that like Lisa, that's how you stay in touch with family and friends.  But they don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. They do it because that's where the people are.  How long can something survive that people use but don't like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All it takes is somebody to come along to a better job and it's over.  Although there is that there's the network effect. I understand.  But it just is the network effect. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean someone can make a social network that's way better than Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But we've seen how fast the people can move.  That's true. And I don't think people under 25 use Facebook at all. Do they?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think people under 25 do all have accounts.  I don't think my daughter does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's how she stays in touch with people because OK, so she graduated from high school a couple of years ago.  So it's a diaspora. Everybody she knows went somewhere and that and it's a really good way to stay in touch with everyone nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a tool. It's a utility to tell it to make parties happen and to share your photos.  It's not what it used to be which was a place to go and kill 30 hours while you looked at everyone's pages and streams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So speaking of VYRI, we did this last year. We do it every year.  The Google Flu Trends charts up. Google.org slash Flu Trends.  This is a bad one this year. H1N1. It's everywhere.  Look at the heat map. You see that red?  That's where the redder it is, the more flu activity.  And there's only a few places. Like if you wanted to avoid the flu, go to North Dakota, Utah, Arizona, not New Mexico, Indiana or Maine.  The rest of us, we're toast.  Google does this with the help from the CDC.  It's actually really an interesting thing they do every year.  Google Flu Trends.  And you could just see each year the activity spikes but you see this is a bad one.  See how that peak is higher than anything in the last 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah. That's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So bad one this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I've become a Purell maniac now that I work in an office with other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the thing you don't want to do. Never go around other people ever.  I got my shot last Thursday. So, you know, they say it takes two weeks for it to get to full strength.  So I have a little countdown on my desk.  Okay, only four more days or whatever. Yeah.  The ocean quarantine.  I can't, don't talk to anybody.  Anyway, that's always fun. It's Google.org slash Flu Trends.  If you want to follow the flu.  Nice.  And then there was another, and I don't take credit for this. This came from Alex Lindsay.  Google Maps Engine now has, is this new or not? It has a nice interface.  So mapsengine.google.com. If you have data, there's a free and there's a paid version that you can use that data to import comma separated values, CSVs and other formats and you can import the data.  He showed me, he was needed a survey. You can use Google Apps to do a survey, right? Using, I don't know if it's a spreadsheet and then automatically imported the data into the map and was able to really do some neat stuff.  Have you seen this before? He wasn't sure when did this start? And I didn't know either. It's mapsengine.google.com. You know, they've always had an API, but it's always been a little challenging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've had a couple of things like this, but I don't think I've seen this specifically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is neat. It makes me want to play with it, you know. See what we can do.  Gina Trapani, you've got the data. You've got it all at thinkup.com. Is it two? Now, when are you going to let people sign up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Next couple weeks. We're working on that right now. We're just kind of looking at our, you know, crowdfunding backers data and seeing.  How's it going? Is the servers, servers survive?  Servers are doing great. Everything's juggling along. Response has been pretty good. We're fixing bugs left and right.  We're working on opening up signups and we're just looking to see, you know, what are the insights that are useful? You know, what are people sharing? What aren't? That kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So can I control what insights I get or is it just whatever you've got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's whatever we have right now, but we would like to add more controls to say, hey, don't show me, you know, something like this again or show me more of this, that kind of thing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. By the way, one of the great ones, Leo Laporte mentioned think up once last week.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It probably shouldn't surface one that where you just mentioned once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll mention it more. I'll talk about it more. I'm loving it. I'm really loving it. All the stats and so forth. It's really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you. It's early days, but we're just, we just really, we want to get something out that was working to our backers and, and give them kind of first dibs to kind of hear, hear feedback.  And then we'll open up to the public, which I, but I hopefully that's going to happen in the next next couple of weeks, February.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not mine, by the way. That's Chad's OMG. Chad's tweets contain the word. I mean, my mind or myself 11 times in the last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the reaction. That's the but enough about me stat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, my number one tweet of the week, according to your graph here was it should be cleared to everyone by now.  The twit life is, I think it's on, is an online soap opera or something like that reality show.  I think the reality show 32 retweets and 77 favorites. That's kind of fun to know that stuff. Really handy. Yeah. Yeah.  All right. Well, soon it'll be open to the public, but right now you can go to Jeff Jarvis, think up.com. It's public, right? People can see my stats.  Leo Laporte, I think I'm Chad. What's yours? OMG. Chad. Correct. Think up.com. Gina. I think I think I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now I just mentioned think up.com like 18 times. I should get it. You did. You did. I know we didn't do it in social media. See,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina is also a blogger, although I bet she's not doing a lot of blogging right now at smarterware.org and is a new resident of Brooklyn just in time for the worst winter storm in years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So exactly. I'll work on that. Jeff Jarvis still hates Verizon at buzzmachine.com. He's up late. Thank you for staying up late for us. Jeff. We really appreciate it.
