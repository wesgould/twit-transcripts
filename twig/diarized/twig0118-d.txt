Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's our wrap session.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is.  It's really fun.  We actually invited Dan Patterson from CBS to join us.  He couldn't CBS radio news.  He couldn't join us.  Then we asked Matt Cutts.  He's giving Larry Lessig a tour of Google.  It's just the three of us.  Just the cadre today.  But have you guys, have you been reading?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been sucked into that book for the past three days.  It's a long book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Over 600 pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm about 400 pages in.  Apparently I didn't get to the juiciest stuff yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well the Android stuff.  That's why I brought it in today to talk about this.  Some of this you've already seen but then there's stuff that wasn't quoted in the newspaper.  Jobs had tried to dissuade Google from developing Android.  He'd gone to Google's headquarters near Palo Alto in 2008 and got into a shouting match.  This is Walter Isaacson writing, with Paige, Brynn and the head of the Android development  team, Andy Rubin.  Because Schmidt, Eric Schmidt, the CEO, was on the board of Apple, he recused himself  from discussions involving iPhone.  It says Jobs felt personally betrayed by Eric Schmidt because he'd been on the Apple board  during the development of the iPhone and iPad and he felt that perhaps Android's touch screen  interface was adopting more and more of the features, multi-touch, swiping, a grid of  app icons that Apple, he says, had created.  I said, this is quoting Steve Jobs now.  Remember he had 40 interviews with Steve Jobs and these are all coming from those tapes.  I said if we had good relations, guarantee Google access to the iPhone, guarantee it  one or two icons on the home screen, Jobs recalled.  But he also threatened that if Google continued to develop, this is what Jobs does throughout  this book, carrot and stick.  He says I'll give you something or I'm going to threaten you.  But he also threatened if Google continued to develop Android and used any iPhone features  such as multi-touch, he would sue.  Apple has a patent on multi-touch which was thrown out later.  At first Google avoided copying certain features but in January 2010 HTC introduced an Android  phone that boasted multi-touch.  Remember that?  In the first iteration of the G1, no multi-touch.  Wasn't that weird?  That's why.  Now we know why.  That's what's great about this.  It fills in the gaps to the stuff that we knew was happening we didn't know why it was  happening.  Many other aspects of the iPhone's look and feel.  This was the context for Jobs' pronouncement that Google's don't be evil slogan was BS.  Remember he said that to an all hands meeting at Apple.  Apple sues HTC and by extension Android, alleging infringement of 20 of its patents.  Among them were patents covering various multi-touch gestures, swipe to open, double tap to zoom,  pinch and expand and the senses that determine how a device was being held.  As he sat in his house in Palo Alto the week the lawsuit was filed he became angrier than  I had ever seen them.  The quote.  Our lawsuit is saying Google you effing ripped off the iPhone.  Wholesale ripped us off.  Grand theft.  I will spend my last dying breath if I need to and I will spend every penny of Apple's  $40 billion in the bank to right this wrong.  I am going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product.  I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this.  They are scared to death because they know they are guilty.  Outside of search Google's products Android, Google Docs are and he uses another strong  word I'll just say crap.  A few days after this rant Jobs got a call from Schmidt who had resigned from the Apple  board the previous summer.  He suggested they get together for coffee and they met at a cafe in a Palo Alto shopping  center.  Again that was the meeting.  We saw these pictures.  It was an important meeting.  We speculated what could they be talking about.  We thought it was funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We thought they were just gaming the press.  No baby.  They were doing it in a public place to be safe from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they wouldn't beat each other up.  I don't know.  Here's the quote from Jobs.  We spent half the time talking about personal matters.  Then actually this is Eric Schmidt.  I have to say this book is very even handed.  It is not hagiography.  He really is warts and all.  He talked to a hundred other people besides Jobs including Eric Schmidt.  Schmidt says we spent half the time talking about personal matters and half the time on  his perception that Google had stolen Apple's user interface designs.  When it came to the latter subject Jobs did most of the talking.  Google had ripped him off he said in colorful language.  We got you red handed he told Schmidt.  I'm not interested in settling.  I don't want your money.  If you offer me five billion dollars I won't want it.  I've got plenty of money.  I want you to stop using our ideas in Android.  That's all I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so ironic given the beginning of the book where you get the whole story about how  the Apple team have visited Xerox PARC and seen the GUI interface that they were developing  there and kind of you know went straight back to Apple and built their operating system  to work that way.  Yeah.  When you think about it the touch screen interface is very much an extension of the point and  click GUI interface.  You just use your fingers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well and Apple does not own multi-touch.  We saw a demo remember that Ted demo from Carnegie Mellon years before this.  Apple doesn't own multi-touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  So I just find this so amusing.  The shouting matches and the tears there's many of them throughout the book and it makes  for a great read because he was such an intense character but it just seems so crazy that  he was that you know and on one hand he would just say everything else is crap.  You know Apple makes beautiful products and everything else is crap but on the other he's  so threatened by Google doing Android that he you know kind of freaks out and has this  total meltdown about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He and you know very famously is quoted in this book as well told the Macintosh team  he quoted Picasso he said good artists copy great artists steal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great artists steal.  Exactly.  He said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know what this is Steve Jobs consistency is not his middle name.  He made no attempt to be consistent.  This is part of the reality distortion field.  He whatever he felt like that's what he said.  This is how it is.  And you know you can't even be surprised by it really.  I mean it's just Steve.  This is what made him what he was.  Schmidt continues Steve has a particular way he wants to run Apple and it's the same as  it was 20 years ago which is that Apple is a brilliant innovator of closed systems.  Gates said the same thing about him early on.  They don't want people to be on their platform without permission.  In fact there's an anecdote at the beginning Gina you've read this already where Wozniak  wants in the Apple II to have slots eight slots.  Yes.  Jobs says no.  Can't have slots.  People will modify it.  And what says well but that's what we do.  That's what hackers do.  We want to modify it.  Jobs says there will not there will be two slots one for video one for a keyboard or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  something like it was like a printer and something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And a monitor.  And that's it.  And they had a fight.  Woz won this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Woz is such a great character through the book.  He's just you know he's like he's honest and he's straightforward and he's an engineer  and he has such a deep conscience and you know and he forgives Jobs for being a jerk  so in so many different ways because he admires his leadership and Woz recognizes that Jobs  has skills that he doesn't have which is interesting because Jobs isn't so great at giving credit  right.  I mean throughout the book you know every great idea you know he talks about as if it  were his own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even Johnny Ive the great designer complains about that and he's very comfortable.  Yeah.  credit for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what do you each think of him as a person?  Oh wait a minute let me finish this and then we'll get to that and then we'll talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that.  So Schmidt says they don't want people to be on their platform without permission.  The benefits of a closed platform is control but Google has a specific belief that open  is the better approach because it leaves to more options and competition than consumer  choice.  Bill Gates responding to this battle against Google as Jobs had battled Microsoft remember  Jobs sold, Apple sued Microsoft for the trash can.  Bill Gates says there's some benefits to being more closed in terms of how much you control  the experience and certainly at times he's had the benefit of that but refusing to license  the Apple OS gave competitors like Android the chance to gain greater volume.  This is Jobs.  Google says we exert more control than they do that we are closed and they are open.  This is Jobs talking to Isaacson when Isaacson told him what Schmidt just read that quote  that I just gave you.  Well look at the results.  Android is a mess.  It has different screen sizes and versions over a hundred permutations even if Google's  approach might eventually win in the marketplace Jobs found it repellent.  I like being responsible for the whole user experience.  We do it not to make money.  We do it because we want to make great products not crap like Android.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is one of those tell all biographies.  Every page is like oh that's what was going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah it was really interesting for me to read.  That emphasis on having that you call it the whole widget experience, owning everything,  the hardware, the software, the device and everything.  It always annoyed me.  I mean you know Jobs sort of infuriated me in life and I but now in death I'm sort of  it's interesting you know hearing about how that came about.  The book makes the point that iTunes or the digital music couldn't have changed the way  that it did if Apple hadn't had control of the entire experience you know from the Mac  to iTunes to the iPod.  And so you really kind of see the advantage there right.  I remember I had a PC when I got my first iPod and I was using the crappy music match  software before iTunes imported to Windows.  It was horrible, horrible, horrible.  And it was definitely you know the iPod was sort of my Mac gateway.  I was like oh you know I would maybe like to get a Mac and this iTunes is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Richard Stallman in a very well controversial statement right at the day that Jobs died  says iPhone made jail cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah well I'm Stalin.  He just doesn't know how to.  What about lack of social skills?  He's not a typical geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He just no social space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If Jobs did believe that copying was the art and understood that then it strikes me that  maybe he wasn't mad about Android copying him.  It was that he was mad that Android really would one up him.  But he made this space.  He made this thing.  His ego was invested in this.  And Android's model is a better model for growth.  He's not saying the product is better but for growth and for taking over much of the  market he was going to make this thing happen and then lose a chunk of it right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I mean I wonder if he worried about what happened with Windows happening again.  Right.  It did.  It is.  So like the Mac has sort of stagnated and Windows ran on all these different computers  and it took over while Apple was sleeping.  And you know this is happening during a time and Steve knew he didn't have much time left.  And you know I just I wonder about that.  If that's the concern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jobs for all of his.  So now to answer your question Jeff.  For all of his introspection and his and his Buddhist beliefs and you know in fact one  one of his early girlfriends said Steve was both enlightened and the biggest jerk ever  you know.  I'm paraphrasing.  But I don't think he was actually very introspective.  I think he maybe he knew that he was a character but he but he didn't really look at these  inconsistencies at all.  It didn't bother him.  He didn't even examine them.  It was just hey this is what I want.  This is how I feel.  I'm going to do it.  He believed in intuition not rationality.  He says it says that in the book many times.  And this is just an example of that where he doesn't have to be consistent.  I can steal from them but they better not steal from me.  You know he doesn't see it as being a problem.  And it's perhaps part of why he was great.  They asked the Guardian asked Hugo Barra.  Hugo hadn't read the book so they quoted this this statement that Jobs said Android was  stolen.  I'm going to kill it.  Barra said he said that.  And then the Guardian said well.  Isn't iOS 5 I mean isn't Android Ice Cream Sandwich stealing from iOS 5 Mr. Barra said  I'm not going to get into this.  He didn't want to go there.  So there's been no direct Google response to this.  I think it's just what we always knew.  I mean it just in some ways this kind of confirms everything we've said all along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But he what he really he and there's another sentence in here I'm not going to try to find  it but in which he he talks about how horrible companies like IBM are these companies that  want to chain you up.  You know he believed himself to be the counterculture hero the rebel right.  The square peg in the round hole.  And of course he's making the most closed system of all.  It's my round hole.  Yeah.  And he and he put Google in there with the with the evil companies with he said Microsoft  IBM and Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see if I can find the ball but also the story on the rundown is Larry Page going to  jobs for advice when he got the CEO role and friendly enough to give it to him.  And I loved in that that what jobs basically warned against by having too much stuff going  on you're going to turn into Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Well that's good advice.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was very good advice.  And I think it's why we're seeing that he really did have a role jobs did and even Google's  reorganization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he was he was beloved and respected in Silicon Valley.  There's no question about that.  He was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a similar story not in the book but the Nike new CEO of Nike had had had a chance  to talk to jobs and said do you have any advice for me.  And Jobs said something like you know Nike makes a lot of beautiful products and it makes  a lot of crap.  Stop making the crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish that were I wish it were that easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah exactly.  It sounds like that was sort of his advice to.  Yeah.  To pay it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just do the good stuff.  Here's the quote.  Once IBM gains control of a market sector they almost always stop innovation.  Even 30 years later reflecting back on the competition Jobs cast it as a holy crusade.  IBM was essentially Microsoft at its worst.  They were not a force for innovation they were forced for evil.  They were like AT&T or Microsoft or Google.  A force for evil.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no gray right.  Like you're either a hero or a bozo.  There's this very like dualistic view of the world right.  Like you're either awesome or you're horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What companies did he were there any companies he thought were awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They one of his heroes was Edwin Land of Polaroid.  But land like Jobs is forced out of his company.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And he and he looked Packard early on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He built Hewlett a lot.  In fact he there's a story of him calling Bill Hewlett at home saying can I get some  chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And getting a job doing a job on the line and pissing off the employees there because  he was this kid with a hot spa.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of what's the body odor apparently.  Yes.  He believed because he was on a fruitatarian diet.  He didn't he only ate fruit.  He believed that he needed bath only once a week and that he you know he would smell  like a an apple.  And apparently nobody else felt that way.  In fact when he worked at Atari they made him work the overnight because nobody could  stand next to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You really had to you know when they talked about his charisma you really had to believe  that the charisma was really strong or else you know no one will put up with them otherwise.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was something wasn't there.  You're right.  And I think that that's I think that's true.  He he mesmerized.  Yeah.  And I don't I guess I didn't mean to get in a Steve Jobs conversation.  I just wanted to quote the stuff from Google here but I think it is interesting.  And I have to say this one of my one of my sources of sadness is that I won't get to  ever see a Steve Jobs product intro ever again because they from day one they were  the best.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you name a nice genius besides Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not a genius.  If I were a bit more of a dick I'd be a genius.  I can't bring myself to that that not the nth degree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think it's a requirement Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well that's what I don't you know.  No I in theory I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Einstein there's a there's a nice genius.  He was a very nice little guy although his personal life was a wreck.  Yeah.  Was was a genius but nice but but I don't think you mean genius.  I think you mean great man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the great success.  Right.  You know it's the Wagner problem.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean there are nice people who are geniuses but they don't necessarily.  Go down in history so great men or women.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the thing I've been thinking about this but reading this book it's been interesting  it's like I realize that I just value kindness or people too much and objects not enough.  And I realize it's not kind.  I don't value just kindness.  I don't think people should be polite just for the sake of being polite.  I think I just value diplomacy and it just seemed like jobs use people.  He did.  You know to get to get what he wanted.  He was a salesman.  He was a brilliant salesman.  And that just sort of left a little bit of a.  Yeah.  It's like you know I don't know I'd rather be John Lasseter or be Steve Wozniak.  You know both these guys are geniuses right creative geniuses engineering for Woz and  art for Lasseter but neither one of them had the I mean both of them have done amazing  things right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it was because Steve Jobs was there to take their work and say push it forward.  Lasseter needed jobs.  Was needed jobs.  Both in college.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  You know one point in the book they talk about how the tone at Pixar that Jobs would would  go to Pixar to kind of relax because at Apple things were always tense and people were scrambling  around and it was just a lot of stress and that was sort of because of jobs.  And that Lasseter is just kind of like this joyful art.  I know John.  I know John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He is.  He's jolly.  He's sweet.  He's funny.  He has the world's best train set which is actually a full size train.  He's got he built a water park and a train in his new house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh that that doesn't surprise me at all.  He's a kid.  It doesn't surprise me that Pixar things were you know they make great products.  Pixar makes amazing movies but the tone wasn't the stress and that kind of meanness and cutting  that was going on at Apple.  And you know the leader sets the tone for what happens at a company.  Well you'll get to.  I admire Lasseter for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'll get to the Toy Story story which is very interesting because they did it with  Disney and Jeffrey Katzenberg apparently was exactly like Jobs micromanaging an evil  creepy and demanding you know excellence.  So apparently Lasseter kept bringing the Toy Story story to Katzenberg who said give it  more edge.  Woody's too nice.  And they made the first half of the movie and the toys were like you hated them.  You know Woody would push people off the bed.  They ruined Toy Story right.  He told the slinky he said the slinky said you're just a spring wiener.  Get out of here.  And he pushed him off.  And so and what's interesting is Jobs did not in any way intervene in Toy Story.  He just sat back like Katzenberg screw it up and finally Katzenberg backed off and they  made the real Toy Story not the one that they were going to make.  Thank God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because he saw Lasseter's genius and gave him the reins to make those those decisions.  He trusted him right to get out of his way.  And that was a good that was you know that was smart.  Edison was a dick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Famous.  Famously.  He killed an elephant.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait I thought that was the Go Daddy guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Go Daddy guy is also a dick.  So there we go.  I rest my case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And shot an elephant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And shot an elephant.  You know what?  Richard Feynman was nice.  He was good on the bongos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true.  After watching the 60 Minutes last week it really struck me that I wish they would release  the Jobs tapes.  I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And maybe they will.  There's some hope.  The fact it was clear that Isaacson was able to get those played.  Yes.  It was really great to hear those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It really was because it really adds in a lot.  There's that strength to his voice.  Even when he's sick right.  There's this determination that you hear in him.  This sense that I'm right and I know it and here's what I'm saying.  And honesty.  You know a bluntness too in his distortion field within that.  That just was really something to hear.  You can hear emphasis that you can't necessarily hear in the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like I watched that 60 minutes and then I read the book and certain quotes I had heard  differently because I had watched 60 minutes.  So I hope they release those tapes.  That's really a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff do what you can.  I'll tweet it right now.  You have an in assignment.  Don't you have a tweet?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh well.  I'm nothing.  I'm nothing.  Come on.  You got people there don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true though.  They didn't get you a 60 minutes interview did they?  They sure as hell did.  By the way, everybody's frozen.  Public parts.  So I'll just do this.  I'm doing commercial.  You are too.  Everybody's frozen.  Except me.  I'm still animated and we're going to take a break as we get everybody back on the line  and talk a little bit about the folks at GoToMeeting, the world's finest meeting software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was thinking about, you know, I use a dev version.  I don't know if it's the full dev version.  It's kind of the middle one.  So I get these things sooner than the stable version release.  So I don't really talk about them because not everybody has them.  But then it comes out in the stable release and you don't realize because you've had it forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Usually it just happens without you doing anything.  I've just opened my About Chrome box.  You can see here.  And I'm at 15.874102.  But it does say a new version is available.  So you can force the update when you do About Chrome.  I'm going to do that right now.  What's new in 15?  Have you noticed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the main thing is that the new tab page is new.  If you it actually can you can switch between apps and most visited sites.  And in the app section, it's actually kind of iOS like.  You can click on it.  Yeah, I know I shouldn't say that.  You can click and hold on an app and you can drag it to the bottom right and remove it from Chrome.  You can rearrange your apps.  So apparently the web store has gotten some updates.  So let me do this here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what do I do?  I click and hold?  Click and hold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not going to jiggle, is it?  No, it's not going to jiggle.  But that didn't work for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm not maybe at the latest Chrome 15.  I downloaded right before the show and there's already a new version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what's going on with me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a new version out here.  So here's the web store.  So what's different?  It's a store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a store.  Remove the shelves.  I think we can go overboard with the it's new stuff.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's infinite scrolling.  So you don't have to page and it's got the organization emphasizes these kind of banners,  these app banners to kind of advertise them a little better.  So it's just a little bit of a redesign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It matches the app store on the phone now more.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Because we have these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Android.  Yeah, because we have these on the phone on the Android phone, the marketplace on the phone.  Yeah, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does look more similar to the Android market.  It's true.  I like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Android phones would update the way Chrome updates.  If only that's a good segue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, wouldn't that be nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what it should be.  Wouldn't that be nice?  Holy cow.  Dream on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My Nexus One is now obsolete and it's not even two years old yet.  So it's still in contract.  Is that true Nexus?  They're not going to do ice cream sandwich on Nexus One.  That stinks.  That stinks really badly.  Of course, what's wrong here is the two year contract.  But when they sell you a two year contract for a phone, it should be and the promise is updateable and updated.  It should be updated that whole damned time.  18 months is not enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we actually have to throw a 15-year party for Chrome.  Nobody got that.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quinceañera.  Quinceañera.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The party that they throw for 15 year olds.  It's 15 now.  All right.  I shouldn't have gone there.  Let me see now.  I've got the update.  Let me hold it and I can.  It does get bigger.  You can drag and drop and read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Look.  I just like the iPhone.  And then if you drag and drop it to the bottom right, you can remove it.  That's how you want to install.  I mean, it's a lot like iOS.  So, Zolio, how often do you use Chrome apps?  Like how often do you use it?  Rarely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You see, I have a bunch installed, but the whole point of installing them was to show them off on the show.  I hardly ever use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get into some habits.  If I don't want it, when I want movie listings, my Flixter is there.  I like to use that.  Right.  And that's the only one I'm really in the habit of using.  If I got in the habit of using others, I would use them.  I'm like, I have Hulu there.  I go to the web for using Hulu.  I don't go there.  I don't know why.  There needs to be some better linkage.  Here's what's gonna happen.  If I just put it in my times in the address bar, it will edit because I haven't installed.  It will give me the app and what app store and my times rather than in white times.com.  Oh, or search and white times.  Either of those.  It will say, Oh, this is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just drag it up there and you get a little icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  No.  I start typing in and white times.  I see.  It says you want the app.  Oh, yeah.  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Got it.  Huh.  Not doing that for me for some reason.  Oh, slash Chrome.  Yeah, I did.  I see the app.  If you go to slash Chrome, it's the app.  Yep.  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually don't want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want the New York Times.  See, my issue is I don't see the really, I mean, an app is just a fancy web page.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So you go to the address bar for a web page.  I'm unclear on the distinction, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not gonna steal my numbers for later, but later on, I can also talk about the use  of news apps too.  But yeah, I think that I've seen a lot of research that just says people go to the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And as web pages become more HTML5.  Exactly.  In fact, Amazon just announced they're going to use HTML5 for Kindle format books.  Oh, they are?  Yeah.  So this is good news.  I mean, this is really, we're really moving to a standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That means that we could do things like put videos in books.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If, well, if the hardware supports it, you know, I mean, it's a little challenging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  Right.  That's true.  But that's pretty cool.  Megan Garber at the Nieman Lab, who's brilliant and who else, I'm not going to get into a  I have going on right now attacking me for my book.  But out of his...  Now I'm searching.  Attacks.  Don't even come there.  It's just a pain in the butt.  But she wrote a great post about how books aren't a very good way.  There's Megan's post.  Oh, the Jarvis Morozov spat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That sounds like something out of the Cold War.  Oh, the Jarvis Morozov spit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's nukes aimed at my house.  How can you find...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's philosophy.  He wants to have a world war again.  He said he wants a world war against me.  That's another matter.  I dare...  It's me and Shirky and all these guys.  We dare to be optimists.  Anyway, Megan finds chicken salad in this chicken poop and writes a really great post  about how books aren't viral and can a book be viral.  Oh, interesting.  And she gives me more credit than I deserve for having talked about the ideas in the book  before the book.  And I said that I haven't done nearly enough of that.  We have to rethink what it is.  So I wrote a long post coming back on the kind of the business that I want to see started  that would enable people to use Kickstarter-like functions to have events,  to support themselves while they do that.  And the book might be a byproduct.  The process is the product.  And the book is, you know, maybe there's reasons to do it, but it's not really there.  But finally, to the point, it takes me a while, I know.  If you did get there, there's some point you have a book.  And if print really does start to truly go away, then why?  What's a book look like?  Right.  The book should include videos from these events.  It should include graphics and slideshows and whatever the hell you want.  So if the Kindle fire finally presents books as HTML5, that to me is a key moment for changing  our notion of the book.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting.  I was reading, I'm reading the Steve Jobs book on my iPad in the Kindle app.  And there's a bunch of parts where they're talking about the different iPod campaigns  and different commercials.  And I found myself flipping to YouTube and looking up the commercials,  watching the videos while I was...  And then what you just said earlier about the source interviews,  you know, I would love to have been able to tap play and listen to Steve say the words, you know, the quoted.  And I was thinking like, I wish that he had embedded these YouTube videos, you know,  the 1984 commercial and the different iPod, the YouTube iPod that they did and the YouTube commercial.  I would love to have seen that.  Yeah, I mean, that would be...  And you can do a lot of that manually, you know, reading on an iPad or a Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That starts to rethink. Exactly.  I got to point out, though, that you need a fire.  You couldn't do that on an E Ink Kindle.  I agree.  Or I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But like Nexus One, they'll be obsolete.  And but where are we headed here?  You know, get your drinking glasses ready, folks.  I'm about to say Gutenberg.  Habermas.  No, I'm staying away from him this week.  So, you know, as I think I've said on the show before,  Elizabeth Eisenstein, Gutenberg scholar, says the book did not begin to take on its full form until 50 years after its invention.  I've been saying that for years.  And I wrote a piece just looking about this for Google's Think Quarterly.  I ended up writing a piece for them about speed.  And, you know, it occurred to me that we all think that the change we're undergoing is so fast.  What if it's slow?  What if we're actually just barely at the beginning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's heresy.  Oh, you mean you don't mean it's slow.  You mean it's going to get faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's we're just we're just we've barely seen it.  So if you start to see then the book, I think it's my specialty to read too much into things, you know, but but if you start to see HTML5,  backed by Amazon for books, then you start to see the beginning of changing the form.  I think that's I think that's wildly important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I do think that that was part of the intent of the fire.  It's certainly the intent of the iPad is to is to.  And remember, one of the things Steve Jobs said that one of the last goals he had was to redefine textbooks.  And I have to think it had to do very much with that.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, my my my daughter has a has an eye convergence thing.  And so she's in training for it.  It's fine.  But we've been getting, you know, electronic books for her and audio books for her and all these things.  And they aren't textbooks don't work in PDF.  They don't work online because you've got to go all around the page and move stuff around.  And there's no you know, it's it's they need to be utterly completely absolutely rethought.  Well, there are two. It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are two big companies doing electronic textbooks.  And one is trying to make it as true to the textbook as possible down to the pagination.  The theory being well in the class, the professors go to page 269.  It needs to be on your tablet 269.  And the other one I can't remember.  There's one KNO is one of them.  And I can't remember what the other one is, is saying, no, let's reinvent textbooks.  Let's put multimedia. Let's put audio.  Let's make it all new and different and exciting.  Anyway, so let me the story is not that they will they're going to have a format kindle fire eight,  which allows publishers to create books in genres that require rich formatting,  such as children's picture books, comic books, graphic novels,  using HTML five markup multi and they say multimedia.  That's interesting.  And it's a little controversial, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because EPUB is actually based on on HTML.  And this is a non this is a nonstandard.  This is an Amazon.  By the way, Gina, what is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See that? Yeah, I have seen that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What the hell is that?  Yeah, it's back.  Is this a Mac or Chrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I've never seen this before.  I have seen that and I'm not sure what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you doing? You're like sliding back and forth with my fingers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think this is a new Chrome back button.  Is this is this Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, is that the is that the new back button?  Oh, this is the new swiping back button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not getting that.  I said, what is this in the chat room said, Leo, that's an arrow pointing to your left.  Oh, thank you.  It is.  If you're listening, it's hard to describe.  This is a lion thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How are you getting it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, let me see. I'm going to go to something not Chrome.  No, it's not doing it in the chat room program.  It only does it when I'm in Chrome.  But it is it is a gesture.  I have to now. Yeah, I have to use two fingers on my track.  I'm not getting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's confusing as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  You see, this is where two fingers.  Software attacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Two finger swipe.  So it just brings you back in the current tab.  Google in their back button backswipe.  They don't want the back button, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't they want to Android has been pretty pretty loyal to the back button.  It's like a weird game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't always happen, though.  It's so strange.  Maybe because I've gone back.  Or is it?  No, there it is.  You got to get just the right.  Oh, it's so strange.  And I don't know what it's doing.  So it's just it's an opaque gesture that's doing something that I don't know about.  I'm Google.  So answering Mr. McGrumpy.  Oh, no, don't.  I can't say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't give him the credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To get back to this viral thing, I think, though, the fact that there's a going back and forth on Twitter, then you create a Google Doc that takes his text and responds to it.  This is wonderful.  This is I know for you, this is probably a lot of spilkes and a lot of angst.  But it's but it but for the rest of us, what it is, is it's a dialogue and it brings the book to life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree as long as it were civil and not personal vindictive and debt.  I wish you weren't the form.  The form.  I agree.  That's what I want.  That's what I crave is a discussion.  I crave a discussion about ideas, not about people.  But, yeah, that's what that's what that's what Megan's point is.  That's what books should be.  And they're bad at.  She said what books do is contain ideas.  They're meant economically to contain an idea.  And that's true.  And I confess my hypocrisy for doing it.  And a book about public this, especially, you know, she said books are bad for sharing.  And I said, well, yeah, that's the best criticism I've heard of my book is I wrote a book about sharing in a form bad for sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She says the system has also been generally designed to advance books within the marketplace to sell them rather than the marketplace of ideas.  Now, your book is all about ideas.  It aims at publicity rather than publicness at selling objects rather than propelling the arguments they contain.  Most idea driven books like yours tread a well-worn path.  Book pitched, book bought, book written, book published, book shelved, book reviewed, book ranked, book removed from the shelves so as to make room for more copies of books.  And I'm looking for more copies of Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother.  So but but you've done something different, Jeff.  Of course, naturally, you would.  And I think we should celebrate the fact that Mr. McGrumpy attacked you because it gave us this whole dialogue around it, which would normally not have happened.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could imagine others attacking me.  That's fine.  But then what she did was inspire me to talk about something I've been contemplating for a while, which I write about on my blog, a second or third post down,  which is that I wish there were a company that allow let's let's say that that you know, I'm not I'm not Seth Godin.  I can't say step my fingers and say a thousand people come see me and pay to see me in Atlanta.  But what if I got together with some really good authors, you know, maybe some fellow utopians like Clay Shirky, if I were honored, I haven't discussed this with him.  And we said, hey, folks, want to hear what we're talking about next and help us do it and one help us, you know, support that.  You know, we're not going to lose money on taking an auditorium to do that or a space to do that.  Well, you could go to a Kickstarter and you could say you want to hear us.  And if enough people say yes, fine.  If not, people don't then you know, risk and then you come together in an event that could be led by the problem now is this is the authors are going to do more and more performance and speaking to make their living.  They should do more of it before they write, I think, to have a big impact on what they do.  But they are in no control of events.  They wait for speakers, agencies who don't do junk.  They wait for conferences that rip you off and rip off the people who come.  So what if there were means by which authors and thinkers and talkers could could not unlike you starting a network could create their own events and you can record those events.  You can stream those events.  You can you can use those events to pay for things.  You can use those events to advance ideas.  You can use those events for whatever you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you say the book is actually in your post a byproduct.  It's not actually, you know, and I think that really is gets to the fundamental thing I wanted to ask you is maybe the book is just a dead form.  It doesn't have to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, there are reasons to have a book and maybe it's still because I'm still back in the in the in the in the good and bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A dead form for ideas as opposed to say a novel.  I mean, obviously the book is a novel makes sense.  The book biography makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The book is a forum for ideas is you're experiencing it constrained those as Gina just said the book is biography would be so much richer.  If we could see and hear Steve Jobs in it and see and hear those who talk about him in it and and and see people link to it and add to it in neat ways after it's out to say I remember this story.  I remember that story or to fact check it or whatever.  But this is what we're doing right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You hit the nail on the head.  It's silly to say I'm an author.  So I am I am enclosed in the 600 pages of dead tree.  You are a persona and you you.  Well, I don't mean in an in an in a statistical sense.  We want to talk about it.  Somebody who is an idea person.  And yeah, see, this is the problem, by the way.  And I think this is what holds it back.  Not with everybody, but some is and it's the same problem people have with blogging.  It's like, oh, my God, it's all about me.  I'm all it's just talking about me.  And so there's some feeling that if you do this, you become now personality.  You are no longer, you know, William Shakespeare, George Plimpton.  But I don't think that that's really in the future.  I don't think that's sensible.  It doesn't have to be that way.  This the whole reason that we do this as we do it with a live chat room and live is because we want to create dialogue and conversation, not a monologue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, Gina, to me, is a great example.  But if you look at if you look at the ideas and service and things like that, right, the book.  Well, you Leo to you, your books is set down.  They make permanent some bit of advice.  But what's the essence of you?  Well, that's why I stopped writing books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems you want to show.  Right.  And people say, why don't you blog more?  I finally came to I felt bad.  And finally, he goes, Oh, I'm not a writer.  I'm a talker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got nothing to write.  I'm a talker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think?  There's disadvantages to this format, by the way, because it's completely impermanent.  Yes.  Yes.  Right.  It's not searchable.  It's not indexable.  It's not referable back in time.  It just it kind of goes out there and evanesces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we could fix parts of that.  But Gina, what's your best form for what you do best and love to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting.  I thought about this a lot.  The Lifehacker book is a product that came from five years or actually more than five  years now because Adam, Adam, continue with it of blogging.  Right.  So I can't if someone asked me what's lifehacker about, I'm not going to say you need to read  five years of 20 posts a day.  Right.  I'm like, here's this book.  Right.  This book was what came from conversations and posts that we you know, conversations  that we had hours and hours and hours and thousands of people over years.  And it kind of encapsulates the main ideas.  It's edited.  It's pretty.  It's good.  But like you said, it is dead.  And I struggle with this with the Wave book, too.  You know, it's like Google's creating this platform for conversations and collaborative,  you know, living documents.  And I was writing a dead document about this platform, but I was kind of doing it in public  and wanted to do it in that platform.  I tend to do much better on the Web.  I'm much better writer and kind of tweeter, Google Plus or whatever you want to want to  say.  I'm much better at conversations online with permalinks.  So conversations with permalinks are really are important to me.  Like, I love doing the show, but I hate that it's not permalinkable or you don't have a  full transcript.  It's not easy to, you know, it's not as easy to skip to a certain part of the conversation.  So I love the permalink.  I like I like writing on the Web.  But I think that the the book is a product as a nicely packaged, edited, fully thought  out, fully peer reviewed and collaborated piece of work is really important too, because  ten years from now, I'm going to say, Jeff talked about this idea in his book, Public  Parts, and here it is.  And it's on this page.  And it is that that permanence and that archiving.  And this this book is going to inform ideas that I definitely, you know, I'm definitely  going to inform ideas that I have ten years from now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that makes me sad because I can't I don't do that.  I should do that.  I'd love to do that.  I just don't.  That's not my medium.  And but what this medium is good for is emotion.  Yes.  And and I just kept that's what I kind of like.  I mean, I think it's just more communicative if if it is more evanescent and the dialogue  ends when, you know, an hour later, it's it's fish rap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But, you know, Buzz Machine means so much more to me now that I've gotten to know  Jeff and get to talk to him in person every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They go hand in hand, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. They do.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's what you're saying, Jeff, I guess, with this idea of author.  It's part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, exactly.  I think that, you know, the other thing you could do if you have a platform like this,  you have a platform for people to create their own events, whether that's the author  or speaker or idea person do it or whether that's the group.  Don't we all hate conferences?  Don't we just want to get together?  What if you had a structure where you said a little bit different from Meetup,  you had a structure like this that said, listen, I wonder if there's a critical mass of people  to get together to talk about new strategies for net neutrality.  We cannot.  And and could we get enough people who would come in and support such an event and pay  just enough to pay for the space and we could do what we want to and we can all meet each other  and yada yada yada yada yada.  I think you could turn around this whole conference business and make it run by the people  in the room rather than by the people behind or the stage.  That's an unconference.  You just reinvented the unconference.  Right. But you need a business platform for this.  What I want is a business platform.  I want the Kickstarter piece that says...  Isn't that always the problem?  I think you can do Kickstarter.  And you can say, are there enough people who'll pay and do we have somebody who will come in?  We know what their fee is to rent the venue and set up the mics and take the tickets and do all that stuff.  And so we know exactly what the cost of such a gathering would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We make it or we don't make it.  It's such a shame that that you have to put so much creativity into monetization.  It just which is merely to make it possible.  Right. It doesn't really add anything to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But once you but if you do look at all the things that can happen.  I agree. You need to.  Kickstarter is an amazing thing.  I mean, you know, maybe the next wave, so to speak, and go away.  But I think there's something really important there.  The watch band company getting a million dollars in pre-orders.  Yeah.  Means that he builds this product and company on his customers capital.  He didn't have to go beg money from anybody.  His customers gave him the capital.  It's just syncopated the timing.  Right. Right.  And and it's a pop up manufacturing company with no infrastructure.  He can close it six months later and the world's no worse for it.  That's new.  And so a platform has such an incredible power.  The risk, I think, in this new world, if you're Google or your Facebook,  is the wealth is now going to be ill distributed to go to the platforms.  I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I too.  And it makes me want to write more, though, Gina, because I do need to you need to have it be indexable and searchable and permanent.  Listen, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I tell you, I haven't been blogging very much either.  It's just too easy to throw a post on Twitter or to do the show with you two.  I mean, there are so many times when I'm like, I should really write a post about that discussion we had on the show.  I do it all the time.  We've had it and and I just don't take the time to do it.  I'm the same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I've used my blog.  So can it OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's the question is, should we just posit that if somebody is really going to succeed in this space that they have to be able to do these multimedia capabilities?  They need to do use the right medium for the right expression, but need to use them all because no one medium suffices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why we teach our journalism students to do the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And some complain about having to have eight arms and they're right to complain because it's hard.  But if they don't have the full power to do it all, then we leave them.  The true the true stars will do it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  The really successful appropriately, appropriately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yes, they won't make a video for the sake of making the video.  They won't make a podcast because they have to make a podcast.  They'll say, you know, the best way to express this is black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like when in the old days of of theater, you had to be able to sing, dance and act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I dare you to start dancing right now.  I think I think a little or uniform around the officer.  I'm a crop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gee, officer, crop, crop, you're going to take a break.  We'll come back.  It's so much fun.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I leave flying out to be Fred Norris, and she looks like it, too.  But, you know, it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This conversation is great because it's something that's been going around and around and around for me is that we created a platform for just one.  And I keep thinking we need text.  We need a website that has to we need to find a way to make all those forms live.  Well, Leo, one thing you could do not to delay our sponsor messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going to bring it back to money.  But but the question is, can video be formed differently so that it has promo links within it?  Right.  We've talked a lot about that.  In fact, Alex Lindsay has you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sad QuickTime had that capability and Apple took it out.  No.  Yeah.  Apple decided that nobody's using it.  So it had hyperlinking.  And actually, you see that on YouTube frequently.  Yes.  You can do it.  I don't think it's being done well, but you could do it.  See, I think it crowdsourced it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll ask the chat room, chat room, would you go to the effort of annotating?  That's what I'd hoped.  I hope we could crowdsource it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why we have a wiki and the show notes are on the wikis.  And I had really hoped that we could create a cadre of people who would do that.  Hasn't happened yet.  Might maybe that's the way to do it.  Is lazy chat room.  Get to work.  Geez.  Get to work.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  This is as always brilliant.  When you get great people together like Gina and Jeff, you just get great conversations.  So thank you guys.  We're going to take a break.  Come back in a second.  Talk more about.  Yes, Google.  But first, let's talk about Ford.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We're having barbecues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think November 13th is our first one.  There's going to be one in December.  Yes, we fun.  We're going to sit.  We've got a permit from the Petaluma Police.  And we're going to wear this outfit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm going to stand out here and say, you can't go here.  We've got to we've got a barbecue.  Bring in the Ford escapes the edges.  The Ford Focus.  Bring that over there.  Put that over there.  We're going to have all the 2012 Ford so you can see the Ford Sink and the my Ford Touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you know these new 2012 Ford Focuses, you could put a USB 3G key in there and it turns the whole thing.  It's a it's a it's a it's a cute Wi-Fi access spot with wheels.  So you're driving along and people in the car have Wi-Fi.  I mean, it's just doing so many amazing things.  And it's not just sink in my Ford Touch.  I mean, the great engines, they have all electric now hybrids.  Even the gasoline engines are more fuel efficient.  They just incredible torque fuel economy and their diesel and these things like this like there were safety belts with with airbags built in to protect the kids.  I could go on and on the adaptive cruise control active park assist.  I my key if you've got kids, Jeff and I'll know this one.  My key gives them a special key that places limits on speed, the maximum volume of the audio system and the low fuel like comes on sooner because as we know kids will drive to zero.  So instead of coming on at 50 miles, it goes on when you got 75 miles left.  Just to remind them, I just it's things like this.  I just love it.  If you want to find out more, go to your Ford dealer.  Take a look at the 2012 Ford Focus.  That's my next car.  I want to I'm waiting for the electric, the all electric Ford Focus.  But you can also go to Ford dot com slash technology.  Unbelievable.  This is a 21st century company that's rethinking autos in the same thing.  Same way that we're kind of rethinking media here.  So, yeah, I think a multimedia I mean, that's where the it's interesting.  I think Jeff Bezos is thinking along these lines.  Otherwise, why make this jump from E Ink to, you know, a tablet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and what's Google Plus doing is trying to intuit the content, right?  You know, I just heard me that what you could the way you could harness the chat room.  I love you.  Chat room is that if they just put hashtags in the discussion while we're talking.  They associate that with the time codes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, we're way ahead of you, although we're not doing it yet.  If you go to twit dot tv, you'll notice there's a scroll bar underneath the video.  And that we I've called for several years called the river.  I wrote a blog post on this one.  Thank God I can refer back to it.  And the idea was exactly that, that it's a curated stream of textual content related to what you're watching,  created by the chat room, the hosts and others, curated by our chat mods and other people.  You have tags in it so that you can sort it or filter it as needed.  There's hot links and so forth.  So the whole idea of this was it's not happening yet because, well, there's always technical issues.  In fact, there's nothing going across the ticker right now.  But that's what this black bar is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At a very simple level, if you just point to if somebody, you know, one more thing for Eileen to do,  you point to one of the stories in the run now that we're talking about right now.  Bingo. That says that that's what this part of the show is about.  Exactly.  Until I go off on a tangent.  Exactly. No, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then what we need to do is have people doing this instead of the wiki.  And of course it would be captured and then indexed, but could annotate it.  So they could say, you know, as Jeff's talking, here's an interesting article related and so forth and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or we have a standing glee button.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Greg, you could have a filter. No glee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got at least a few photos of people's burritos saying, hey, you know, I listen to Twig and look what happens.  Yeah.  I'm Mr. Chipotle now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So take down notices.  This is from Search Engine Land.  Who do you think has issued this year the most take down notices from YouTube?  Would it be Viacom? Would it be NBC? Would it be CBS? No, it'd be the U.S. government.  Scary.  Five thousand nine. This isn't your number, is it, Jeff?  No.  Five thousand nine hundred fifty content removal requests.  Now, this isn't just YouTube. This is from what? From removal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The quarter, I think. Up seventy percent from the last reporting period.  Number two is India.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a this is a transparency report that Google does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish we had more transparency on what's being made opaque.  I mean, they say that they got requests from local law enforcement agency to remove YouTube videos police brutality, which they didn't do.  Requests to remove from local law enforcement to remove videos allegedly defaming law enforcement officials.  They didn't do it. So we know that they didn't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what about so these removals are mostly like take accounts down, things like that.  They're not YouTube videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Definition even email. I can't figure out if you look at the full chart, there are things they took down from email.  Now, how the hell do you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We removed ads that violated AdWords with YouTube was inaccessible during China, so we didn't have to do anything there.  This is the first time they've received one or more content removal requests from the Cook Islands.  A single court order from France removed 180 items from Google Groups.  German data user requests increased 38 percent.  India state and local law enforcement to remove YouTube videos that displayed protests against social leaders or use defensive language in reference to religious leaders.  We declined the majority of these requests. I love the transparency here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it wonderful? If you click on United States as you get to it, you'll see the chart of the kinds of things that are done.  But again, without much transparency from that point on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and probably they can't, right? I know that they can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But even if they could describe it more, you want to know.  Well, here's the scary thing today.  Justice Department today, Mika Sifri tweeted on this, put out a new proposed regulation that says that the government can lie to you in FOIA requests and deny that in a document that exists, even if it exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that's for our security, Jeff.  And you should. In fact, the very fact that you mentioned that now has to be expunged from the record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so as Mika says, you know, Mika was a big supporter of Obama take away his rewards for transparency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  YouTube defamation, privacy and security, government criticism.  The US has removed or requested that a video that criticizes the federal government be removed.  It was a police police executive, et cetera, not a court.  They don't but they don't say whether it was removed or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there was when I ran local sites, police were the worst at coming and an issue in speed is because they know how to do it.  And it was always somebody in the force who's criticizing the chief and the chief goes after the online service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just happened like crazy. Google images, Web search, Google groups, privacy, impersonation, government criticism.  I sure would like to know what that video is. Exactly. Yeah.  How dare they pull down a video that criticizes the government? Is that the essence of free speech?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just I'm shocked, to be honest. Well, some great journalists should be going and getting more stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is that video? What could that video be?  Isn't it part of our absolutely part of our constitution that we should be allowed to criticize the government?  I mean, I'm not saying threaten the government, but they've got violence, hate speech, national security.  They have categories for that. This is government criticism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's one item listed there. I don't like the government.  Yeah, I hope somebody digs into that. I'd like to know what that is. That shouldn't be showing up in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting. And then user data requests. So let's go look at that.  The government requests for disclosure of user data from Google accounts or services, 93 percent of which were fully or partially complied with.  Five thousand nine hundred fifty. Well, it's you know, it's obvious that Google's publishing this with a little bit of agenda.  We hope this tool will shine some light on the appropriate scope and authority of government requests to obtain user data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. Yeah, I mean, they pretty much outright said in the blog post that their goal is to be transparent about this so that we can start revisiting the policy.  That was enacted about this 25 years ago before before 9-11 email was right.  And let's hope that more and more companies do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google is planning to closely link an upcoming music download store with its Google Plus social network.  We've heard this before and again and again. In fact, I thought by now we'd have heard of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is this is the the the extra that they were talking about.  One more thing. What is the twist? Oh, the twist. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what they called it. But they haven't done it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The twist appears to be that you can buy a song and then you can share it for one free listen with your friends.  One. Well, but it's like radio play, right?  It's it's not it's it's not bad. It's it's so then your friends can say, I want to listen to this more.  Well, then you can buy it. It's it's it's individual radio play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, if I share a song, can each friend hear it once?  So like I share it with 10000 friends and each of them gets it once.  I think so. That's all right.  That's a good question. That's got to work like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One friend would be crazy. Oh, be crazy. One play, one friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it. You can only it's all just reports anyway.  It's not fully confirmed. So but that would be a neat model.  I don't know if it's revolutionary or anything, but it's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is kind of neat and it ties into the Google Plus emphasis on things.  Yes. Share. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Plus is going to integrate with Blogger.  Maybe I will start writing more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the first thing they're doing is just integrating the profiles.  So those horrible blogger profiles that no one ever fills in can now be your Google Plus page, which only makes sense.  But you're absolutely right, Leo. The thing that I want to log from Google Plus.  And they said they asked me when I was out there, why do you put up things on different platforms?  And I said, I can't write on Google Plus because I can't do links.  I can't do what's responsible. And they know that they'll do that.  They'll do that. This is obvious.  They've got Blogger. They've got every tool they need is right there to publish rich posts on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, Mike Elgin does that. He posts.  You know, he does a newsletter, which is a great newsletter, free newsletter.  And the way he does it is he writes it on Google Plus. He posts them and then it aggregates them into a newsletter.  We just we need more little of those pieces so that I can create a blog, which you can subscribe to or you can go read and maybe tie that to YouTube.  I mean, Google's the only one that can do all of this, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should have media throughout.  Everywhere.  And be able to use spreadsheets and slideshows and videos and links throughout.  And it should be the richest content publishing platform, the easiest and richest you could imagine.  They went to the easy by making it thin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anything else you want to talk to before we go to our tip?  Are we there already?  Well, I'm doing a new thing.  I'm trying to make the shows a little bit shorter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to tell me this, Leo.  So I shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  That should it should not in any way impact how you perform.  I'm just going to kind of keep an eye on the time and kind of keep things moving along.  I've got this little button.  You thought I was joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have this little I did think you were joking.  Really an orange button.  Yeah, there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, it's green.  So I push my staff.  They love me.  They say, OK, Leo, just tap this and it will start a timer.  And I'm looking at a timer.  We're one minute, one hour, two minutes and 25 seconds of the show.  It is two fifteen.  So I think if I start wrapping now, we'll get out of here in time for TNT.  We'll have an hour and fifteen minutes show, which is kind of my goal.  You know, it was always our goal to make the show in the earliest days in 2005 when we did this.  People kept saying, oh, don't make it longer than 70 minutes because we want to burn it to a CD.  We don't get that request anymore.  We don't get anymore.  But I think that's a that's a nice time.  Of course, on the other hand, there are plenty of people who say, no, no, I want it to be longer.  Mostly what people want I've discovered is they want to be exactly the length of their commute, no shorter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's that's how people want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're going to quickly mention our friends at VAST and then I will get our tip tool and number of the week.  I was going to make a video and I forgot to do this of that of that IonDrive because I got a clamp in the car and everything and show me running into a car.  You can hear the screams of alarm from my Android phone, but I forgot to do that.  I'll do that next week. That was my tip.  My tool last week.  VAST conference.  Actually, this is a very good tool that we've started to use a lot.  VAST conference dot com.  I'll log in.  Don't show the screen yet.  Tell me when because I don't know.  You know what happened.  I do this last time.  It shows phone numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Can I show it now?  You show this now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is this is the dashboard.  You can manage your calls.  I think I'm hiding the numbers.  You can in a conference call record each participant individually.  You can add their name.  There's this great account administration center.  If you are doing conference calls, you have a they call it technical term as a conference bridge, right?  Where you're setting up these conference calls.  VAST is absolutely the best conference bridge I've ever used.  Not free, but very affordable.  And in fact, you can use it for free right now for two conference calls.  No commitment.  Just use our promo code twig.  You get a toll free dial in number or a regular dial in number.  You get, you know, the conference code and so forth.  Don't show it.  Hide it. OK, because I'm now going to click on this is the most recent call that I did.  Yeah, that shows phone numbers.  So let me zoom in a little bit.  So I hide the numbers.  There we go.  So hosts, attendees, where they called from, the time, the length of the call.  It's just really, really there's more on this page that you're not seeing.  It's really great.  And what's great is you have recordings of it all.  It doesn't use VoIP.  It uses the actual phone system.  So you don't get any weird latency or sound.  It's very it's if you want to do professional calls where you're not embarrassed.  This is the way to do it.  Vast conference dot com.  Use the offer code twig when you sign up and you'll get two free calls.  Actually, it's more complicated than that, but basically it's 300 minutes of calling at vast conference dot com.  They support up to 300 callers at once, which is very slick.  And all the calls are recorded as MP3 files, which you can listen to or download later.  Pricing is very affordable.  It really is the way to do it.  If you're using a conference bridge, do the pro thing.  Vast conference dot com.  We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  Jean Trapani has a tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina, my tip this week is a little bit a little bit sad for old school power users search.  Google search has dropped the use of the plus operator, which you'd use to say do it and search.  You know, this word plus another word.  Very strange.  Not really sure why.  I mean, most likely the reason why is because Google Plus, which uses plus as a as another kind of operator, will probably be integrated into search somehow.  But this has literally been the plus operator and the minus operator and a few other advanced operators have been in the Google search since the very beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They always said you don't need them.  They always said, oh, you don't need to use Boolean's.  It just will just do it for you.  We'll just do it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Right. Exactly.  But, you know, there are certain like especially journalists and coders and kind of the real super web savvy say, no, no, I really do want this crazy sounding word in my search results.  And that's when you add the plus sign.  So if you're if you're used to using the plus, if you do a search using a plus sign, you'll actually get a message from Google now that says, hey, you want to do the search, use quotes.  So that's my tip of the week.  Embrace the quotation marks.  If you want to do a search where you absolutely want all the words in your search query to appear in the results, you only want results with the exact words you've typed.  Use quotations and that will that will do it for you.  I'm really interested to see how the plus sign will be used in the future because no doubt they're reserving it for something related to to Google Plus.  I would imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Huh? Yeah, that makes sense.  That's why I like show me all the posts to that mentioned Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And I would use the plus sign with your name or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can they come up with another character then?  If that's what they're going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, yeah, I guess when they made the decision to use the plus sign and said they at sign, which is, you know, a Twitter Twitter thing and an email thing, they kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you could have a different sign for the Boolean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Oh, I see what you mean.  Right. Right.  You know, quotations are always, you know, exact phrase searches like I use it for like song lyrics.  I use that all the time.  Yeah, I use that a lot, too.  But this is actually have to put quotes around each word.  So it's a little bit of a pain.  Is the plus operator.  I'll admit I use the use the plus operator less and less in the past few years.  But every once in a while, I busted out if I'm looking for something very specific and I'm like, no, I didn't mean that Google.  I meant what I typed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that would be good.  Jake Calhoun says one uppercase A and D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some I think some search engines did use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  Capital or a capital.  We need more characters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody. I think what they probably found is in their metrics.  Nobody used it.  Right. That's probably true.  Oh, yeah. I'm sure the metrics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I learned this week.  I didn't. This is not my number because it's not a number.  It's a character.  Not an alphanumeric.  I learned this week that that what's it called?  The mark or any I can't do any French, but the mark of irony is a backwards question mark.  Oh, yes.  And it was intended originally to be to note snark or irony.  Right.  The irony mark.  I love that. Right.  And and someone that would be in Twitter that there was an effort to do a left leaning italic to note irony.  Couldn't we all use that in Twitter for the for the irony starved?  I think we need this on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a it was first used in the 1580s and then furthered by French poet Alcanté de Bram in the 19th century.  So apparently there's been a confusion about irony for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People get in trouble for irony all the time.  I know somebody who got fired for irony.  He said something he shouldn't have said.  He's not saying that I'm British.  You Americans don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You needed the the rhetorical question mark or percontation point invented in the 1580s.  And it was used at the end of a question that did not require an answer rhetorical question.  It's used. This is according to Wikipedia.  It's used out in the 17th century.  But we want it back.  Yeah, we want it back.  And then there's also the intero bang, which is a exclamation mark and a question mark.  The irony.  Plant the irony.  Plant the irony.  Thank you.  Wow, that's really great.  But where do you how can you make it happen?  Is there a it's an ASCII.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's in the ASCII.  Yeah, you can you can cut and paste that.  But the problem is some of some of the places won't see it depends on whether the font supports it in the display.  It's in Unicode 2e2e.  2e2e.  To be or not to be.  Just remember that for the year.  To be or not to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Huh.  The percontation point.  I love it.  Speaking of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  I'm wasting.  Where would you learn that?  Anywhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you have a number, Jeff?  I have a number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Pew Internet in American Life people who do just incredible, incredible work.  I mean, I think we're going to look back in history and be so grateful for the work they do on our usage of things.  They did work on news and tablets and there's good news and bad news.  Matthew Ingram did a good summary of this work on GigaOM.  Seventy seven percent of of tablet users get some kind of new or get fifty four percent get news daily.  Thirty percent say they get more news than they did before because of the tablet.  But the bad news.  Fourteen percent pay only twenty one percent say they would pay.  And here's the interesting thing to me.  Forty percent of users get news not through applications but through browser.  Only twenty one percent get news through brand specific browser apps.  I mean, I mean, iPod apps.  Otherwise they use the browser.  So the whole notion that you're going to get this controlled world of news around the apps, which I keep on decrying.  Well, probably not going to work.  It's probably the browser.  Interesting.  Those are my numbers.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, there are other exclamation alternative exclamation or punctuation marks suggested.  We got to get Leo off this Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By Hervé Bazin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He wanted also a doubt point, a certitude point, an acclamation point, an authority point, an indignation point and a love point.  Oh, that's too good.  That's got to be a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Only in the French would they have a love point.  I would like to put the love point on this show right now.  I hearted this show.  Yes.  My tool of the week is not something probably that you want to use.  I think there's some Android users who are a little jealous of Siri and wish they had some Siri like capability.  I still think the dictation in Android is pretty good.  It's not as good as Siri, though.  I have done head to head comparisons and really Siri is pretty remarkable.  But there is an app in very extreme alpha right now called Iris that you can download for free from the Android marketplace.  Just talk to Iris about anything and listen.  She's mean.  She's kind of mean?  She's mean.  Well, like what?  She yells at you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just the opposite.  She's very sarcastic.  Yeah.  So if you ask a question, she just has attitude.  Iris has attitude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Attitude.  Some people like that, don't you think?  Should we have a little Iris irony?  By the way, that was Eileen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you hate everything Macintosh, then I've got an app for you.  I'm Sassy Bob and you're watching XTA TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You afraid that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  These things, look, it's no question.  This is going to be in all phones soon.  But right now, Siri really owns this market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Siri should do a lot more, but at least we Android users have some time to do that.  Did you break down yet, Gina?  No, but I'm close.  I think between the camera and Siri, it's probably a good idea.  It's worth it.  I hate to say it.  I need to get through.  Well, Elgin went after it.  He did.  Did you see Elgin's post?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  No, I really, it was so much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're never screaming in order against me now, but that's why he's wearing the cop uniform.  To remind me that I've got to stay in line or he's armed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
