Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  122, I wish. Great to have you back, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice to see you, Gina. I missed you guys. I missed you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I missed you too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I need my Glee and Chipotle and Gutenberg fix.  Jeff Jarvis is also here speaking of Gutenberg and Habermas at BuzzMachine.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lassie, you're back.  I used to cry at the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lassie, come back, Lassie.  Anyway, I'm sorry, I'm like lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me do a tribute to the guest you're about to announce.  Yes!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me think, who could that be? Oh, it must be Lamar. Lamar Wilson's here from Wilson Tech One,  the famous YouTuber, the funniest man in tech, self-build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Self-build. I'm the funniest man ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ever? Hey, that's cool. That's cool. That's really good.  I'm the funniest looking man in tech. Does that count?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does. I screen-cap that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't have to screen-cap it. There'll be more, let me tell you.  Hey, boy, there's a lot to talk about. I guess, you know, I'm going to have to apologize if I repeat,  because I was in Norway for a while.  Do you have any hearing?  No, but you know what I had? We were in a little town called Kristiansund,  not Kristiansand, but Kristiansund, which is on the west coast of Norway,  right at the bend and the spoon.  And they're famous, the whole town is founded on the clipfisk industry.  My mouth is watering talking about clipfisk, which is short for cliff fish.  Fish, which is a cod that is dried on the rocks of the cliff.  And you may know it better as bakalao, or bakala.  It's dried salted cod, and it's fabulous.  So I had a lot of cod.  And one of the photographers there, celebrity photographer Greg Gorman,  went out and he caught a, was it a cod, a fresh cod or a halibut?  No, it was a mackerel.  And we had that one night, it was delicious as well.  So we ate a lot of fish, fish soup, fish, fish, fish fritters, fried fish.  It's a kind of a fishy cuisine there in Norway.  And I loved every minute of it.  So thank you.  And we had such great hosts who were there,  the folks at the Nordic Light Festival, and Adinga I'm sure is watching.  He has a little cottage he goes to, and he's got a whole twit man cave  dedicated to the twit there.  And anyway, it was a blast.  Well, we're going to do two special twit photos from Norway.  Not next week, but the two weeks after,  because it's going to give us a little time to edit this down,  where we interviewed some of the most interesting best photographers in the world.  I mean, just real, Bruce Davidson and Greg,  I mean, just Greg Gorman, the cast and crew are incredible.  Morten Korgwald, I think I'm saying that right, Korgwald.  Anyway, really fun.  So thanks to our hosts at the Nordic Light Festival in Kristiansund  and everybody in Norway.  We did a boat.  So there's a boat, the Høtegrøte boat,  which goes from Kristiansund to Bergen.  And it's a really wonderful, beautiful through the fjords,  to kind of go in and out like this, through the fjords going down.  It's incredible.  And then we're in Bergen, which is this beautiful old city.  It's one of the historic cities of the world.  And then we took a train from Bergen through the spoon,  through the middle of the spoon, all the way to Oslo.  Like an eight-hour train trip that was just like snow.  Like we're in the...  Well, in fact, we went through the town that they shot  The Empire Strikes Back, the ice planet Hoth is this town.  And it looks like you're going through Hoth.  It's wild, beautiful.  Anyway, loved it.  I have lots of pictures.  We'll show them enough.  Meanwhile, Will Wheaton's pissed.  Lamar, you wanted to talk about this.  But Lamar, I got to point out, I've been complaining about this.  The Google-plusification of everything YouTube,  everything Google does for some time.  It's just gotten worse and worse.  And now Will's complaining that in order to plus one,  to like a video on YouTube,  you have to have a Google Plus account sign in.  Are you surprised?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not surprised at all by this.  I read his rant, which is a short one, and I was like...  I don't like Will, but it seemed a little ridiculous  that he went off and ranted about this,  because YouTube is like the last thing that Google owns  that isn't Google-fied.  It's been sitting on its own island for a while,  so it makes sense that it starts getting integrated  with their products.  And you think about YouTube, even with their messaging system,  all of it is still kind of crappy code that they bought,  and they've never really made a brand new YouTube.  They're now starting to kind of integrate  those things together.  I think it's a positive thing, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says, for a producer like me,  I'm going to lose a crap-ton, that's a Wheatonism,  of potential upvotes for Tabletop.  That's his show about Tabletop gaming  on Felicia Day's new channel.  Because the core of my audience is tech savvy  and may not want to quote upgrade  to yet another effing social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's just snot on snot. That's a snot sandwich.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree with him, but here's my problem with this.  Well, I mean, look, I understand this is inevitable.  We're too cool for school.  I just don't like it that Google is forcing Google Plus  down everybody's throat. That kind of bugs me.  But it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, Jeff, why are we wrong?  I felt the same way about Yahoo forcing its registration  on us when it got Flickr.  I agree that I have said that.  However, the problem I have is the same  with the privacy settings and other things.  If all of this had started as Google in day one,  it would all be Google Plus now.  And no one would complain.  It's only because they're moving on to legacy things  and people say, oh, I don't like change, I hate change,  which is an awful thing for tech people to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what about this channel conflict  that we've talked about before?  Shouldn't Google either be a search engine  or a YouTube video site?  It's a search engine. It's not a search engine.  Right. So can they get out of the search business now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, YouTube is the second biggest search engine  that is out there.  It's the biggest one. There's nothing bigger than Google.  Oh, you say YouTube.  YouTube itself, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By itself, well, that's interesting.  By itself, the number two search is on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  People go there specifically to search for videos.  That makes sense.  At some point, Leo, I think they need to combine  YouTube and Google Plus accounts.  If you already have a YouTube account,  then what they should do...  Well, they've done that, Lamar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have been encouraged for some time now  to merge your Google account and your YouTube account.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  However, you still... and that's true,  but you still need to do the extra step  of signing up for Google Plus.  And so they need to simplify that and say,  if you already have a YouTube account  and you're already signing in,  you automatically have Google Plus.  Just kind of like they do if you sign up for a Gmail now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's going to happen anyway.  Although, that's what I mean  by forcing Google Plus down your throat.  I guess we just have to live with Google Plus.  You're a member.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Willis has said about the  thumbs up, thumbs down being replaced  by a plus one.  And really,  isn't everyone doing the plus one  or likes Facebook is doing?  There is no negative button.  If people don't like it, they move on.  I think it helps with search results  because it'll go throughout Google.  Whereas the thumbs up and thumbs down on YouTube right now  only stay on YouTube.  I think that's the only metadata for Google  and ranking the video site.  I'm all for the thumbs up, thumbs down  being gone if it helps our videos be searched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's still there on my page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're testing it with a few users.  I've seen some of my subscribers say they have a new screen.  So we still have thumbs up, thumbs down,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but at some point that's going to be replaced by plus one.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've been testing it and it's going to happen.  It has to happen because they want to make this all unified.  All right, Gina, your vote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought that Will's rant was a little heavy handed,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but I also am not as active in the YouTube community  as he is and as his viewers are.  I think that there's a whole separate culture  inside YouTube, a separate community culture.  It's all about views and likes.  When you mess with one of those mechanisms,  I can see why people would be upset.  I felt similarly when Yahoo  inserted itself into my Flickr experience,  for example, and I was like,  I'm not going to insert myself into my Flickr experience,  for example.  I understand being upset when things change  at the same time.  It seems like this unification is actually a good thing  because plus ones on videos will make them rank higher  and just plain vanilla Google search results.  It'll mean that videos show up in the Google Plus stream  more often.  You can see videos that your friends liked inside your search results  and inside Google Plus.  I think in the end it's actually good for videos.  Will's concern is that it's going to mean that his videos  will get fewer likes or plus ones  and get less audience.  I think that actually  the opposite in the long term will happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My concern is a little different.  Let's say as a producer of video,  I don't want to use YouTube  because I keep getting pulled down  for all sorts of stupid reasons  by companies that have nothing to do  with the content of my shows  but somehow have gotten into the Google.  Do you think that would happen?  I know.  Unless I say that we're having.  I say, really, I'm just going to use Vimeo  because I really like Vimeo.  It's going to be a great experience.  I want my viewers to watch my shows on Vimeo.  Vimeo does not show up very well on Google  because of Google Plus and YouTube and the integration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also because it simply just has a lot less traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just saying that  I can't make that choice  because I need to be on YouTube.  Regardless of all the other things,  because that's what shows up best in search.  It's the new cable MSO.  That's the channel conflict I'm talking about.  It forces independent producers  to participate in YouTube  even though YouTube is not, by any means,  the best solution.  Quality, the content pulldowns,  and the community, the comment community,  all are negatives.  I'm still required to  because of the fact that  I'm still in search.  I'm still required to  because of the fact that Google is using  its search as leverage.  That's my issue.  I've said it before.  That's a valid point.  Hell yeah, it's a valid point. I made it.  It's his show.  That's all I'm concerned about.  It's that channel conflict.  I don't agree so much with  what Will is saying in the sense that  it's the Google Plusification of everything.  But you're right. This is Google.  If they made that, and they already said they were going to do this,  their Google Plus is everywhere. It's everywhere.  Done.  But I just worry that  because Google is also in the content business  as well as the search business  that that's church and state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's why they've been keeping YouTube separate  for so long because of that reason.  It's kind of inevitable now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Page has made it really clear that this unification  is going to happen. These buttons are an experiment.  I'm not seeing them yet.  It would really surprise me if they didn't go ahead with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've got YouTube in the black Google bar.  It's all going to be all mushed together eventually anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's so many ways to like and dislike and flag.  Even Google Reader is another.  You can share, you can star.  There's all different ways to indicate that you like something.  In the long term, I like that there's  one universal way to say  I like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and if it helps my search results,  that's good, which it will.  But see, that's my issue.  Google is leveraging YouTube up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've got to get somebody at YouTube who likes you, Leo,  to take care of your issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's part of the problem is that I'm not well taken care of by YouTube.  That's not right.  We're not on YouTube Live.  There's all these things that we don't get.  This is not helping, by the way.  You can't tell me that they're not aware of  my increasing negativity towards it.  As a result,  I'm going to be even further deprecated.  The smart thing to do would be to embrace you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the smart thing for me to do would be to kiss their ass,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but I ain't going to do it.  So Vic Gundotra is all excited  because Tim O'Reilly is now Mr. Google Plus  instead of Mr. Twitter, which he's been for a long time.  Scoble's response is,  for the last month I've been ignoring Google Plus  and Twitter and spending a lot of time on Facebook.  That's just so Scoble.  That's so Scoble.  That means the name of a sitcom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's so Scoble.  I was wondering where Robert was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He hasn't been around on Google Plus much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was Google Plus king.  Yeah, I'm kind of with him that if all you're looking for  is the most response...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook.  It may not be the highest quality response  because it's everybody, but it's the most response.  And I put a ton of stuff on Facebook all the time.  Mostly because all my tools do it.  Now, it's not that I like Facebook Facebook,  but I do like Facebook Facebook.  I like Facebook Facebook.  I like Facebook Facebook.  Now, it's not that I like Facebook.  Facebook's a silo. It's a walled garden.  It's the worst of the internet.  What I want, what we all want, I think, is that  we want a free and open internet  where all web pages are created equal.  That's kind of what I want.  I would like an independent search engine that isn't in the content business  that is ecumenical and searches everything.  But obviously that's not going to happen.  One of the things that was interesting  that we talked about at this Nordic Light Festival  is that we talked about the internet.  One of the people there is  a really interesting fella who's at Nokia.  He's a start-up guy.  Hans-Peter Brandmo.  And he was talking about, and everybody was a little concerned about,  the notion that the internet is about  to become corporatized, to be changed,  to not be free and open anymore.  Do you guys think that that's an issue, that that might be happening,  that we may be moving towards silos like Facebook, Twitter,  and ultimately Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Didn't that already start with AOL, with their walled garden back in...  Well, that was my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AOL did it and failed.  But maybe it's time to come back to it.  Certainly that's what Tim Wu says in the Master Switch.  He says, it's just a matter of time before big corporate interests  assert their control and dominance on the internet.  And that's it for the free and open internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I think it's really important to create  peer-to-peer networks.  I definitely think this is a problem.  This is a problem that I'm working on  and I'm trying to make some sort of dent in.  I definitely think it's an issue.  And you know, Scoble's piece about Facebook  and even Tim's piece about Google+,  Google+, is great and Facebook has its uses and all that.  But the reality is, though,  if you've got something important to say,  if you're a content producer and you want to put it somewhere  that you want to keep,  like books on a shelf in a library  versus just kind of like pieces of garbage going down the stream,  you've got to blog it  and then link it in all your different social screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to have twit.tv.  Lamar, do you post your content anywhere besides YouTube?  Do you have your own Lamar page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, we talked about this on the last twit  and I have yet to do it because I feel like...  YouTube is free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very seductive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I feel like I even just have my own website  and I do own wilsontechone.com or lamarwilson.com.  But you don't put stuff there?  I don't because I've done sites before  and they sit on an island by themselves  and have no social connection  and people don't go, whereas when I make Google Plus  my primary place or YouTube,  then I get all the traffic that I could want.  Listen to that.  It's a tough situation.  I haven't figured out whether I should blog or not  because I already do video blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So on the one hand, Leo,  you're talking about Facebook being an island and isolated.  Lamar just said that his site on the open web is an island  because it doesn't have all those connections  that the social site brings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's possible to do that with Disqus  or other tools that can bring social into your...  What's the link, really?  Yeah, but Lamar is an example of the modern content creator.  It's so seductive.  YouTube is free.  Everybody sees it. Google promotes it in search.  So why not just use YouTube?  But I agree with Gina.  We want to have our own place that's ours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who's going to store all of my videos for free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Video is a little bit of a different animal.  It doesn't make sense for Lamar to stream video from his own website.  It's going to be costly having it on his own blog.  Well, you do.  But Lamar is a one-man show.  I think more in terms of photos and essays.  If I'm going to write an essay about something  that I feel strongly about,  that I spent a lot of time working on,  I've researched,  putting that on Facebook or Google Plus  and it's not giving it the place on my shelf,  the permanent place on the shelf that I want it to have.  I want it to have a permalink that I've picked,  that I've chosen, that I can maintain, that I own,  regardless of where these networks go in the future.  And then I'll share a link to it on those places  with excerpts and whatnot.  That works.  So I feel that way about written works and photos to some point.  Video is kind of a different thing.  Only because it's so big and rich, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's so expensive to store and deliver.  Right, it's costly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lamar, you have your videos on DVD  or the original files stored on your hard drive, right?  You just don't post them to YouTube  and let them just, that's it, right?  That would be insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do keep a backup.  Actually, two double backups of them.  In case anything ever happens, I can always put it somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to take a break.  You said something, Gina, that's very provocative.  There's Wilson Tech one for those of you watching.  He is very handsome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good-looking fella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a different person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's called insane Wilson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You said something, Gina, very provocative.  You basically are advocating a dark net.  You talked about peer-to-peer, a secondary internet.  Let's talk about that when we come back.  Because I think that's exactly what's going to happen  and I'm a little concerned about that too.  But we're going to talk about that when we come back.  You're watching This Week in Google.  Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis, Lamar Wilson.  Great panel. I'm so glad to be back.  I missed you guys.  I missed the deep intellectual whining  that we've become so well-known for.  And more whining to come.  But first, a word about Stamps.  Did you know that Stamps.com,  did you know that 2 billion letters and packages  have been sent using Stamps.com?  That's how we send all of our mail.  Because you don't have to go to the post office.  That is just fantastic.  We've got the USB scale.  Plug that into the computer, Mac or PC.  Plop your letter or your package down on the computer.  You know exactly what it costs with always up-to-date pricing.  Even though the postage went up.  Don't worry. Stamps.com handles that.  You never pay more.  Have you ever put more Stamps on a package  because you want to make sure it went through?  You're wasting money, in effect.  Never again. Stamps.com.  Exactly the right postage all the time.  Discounts you can't get at the post office  on Priority Mail and Express Mail.  Up to 21% discounts on Express Mail.  15% on Priority Mail.  Thank you.  15% on Priority Mail.  Thanks to Stamps.com.  And you never have to get up from your desk.  Which for many of us is a goal.  You never have to leave your desk  because the postal carrier comes to you.  Picks up the stuff. You can even schedule free pickups anytime.  I just love it.  For international mailing, it's great.  They fill out the forms for you. Priority Mail, Express Mail.  Same thing. They'll pull your addresses  for invoices, sales orders,  or any transaction right from QuickBooks.  If you're an eBay or Amazon seller,  it is great. You get the data automatically  back from eBay. You don't have to copy and paste.  It does it automatically.  I can go on and on.  What I want you to do is visit the site Stamps.com.  Now wait a minute. I see a special offer.  $80 value. That seems pretty provocative.  I would suggest click that  little radio microphone  in the upper right hand corner.  I want you to use the offer code TWIG  and watch what happens.  Magically, Impress Go.  The $80 offer turns into a $110 bonus offer.  And you get a creepy picture of me.  I don't know which is more appealing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to sign up just for that picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really old.  That's from the screen savers.  Leo's going, why don't you use Stamps.com?  $110 value.  $55 in postage coupons.  A free digital scale.  A $5 supply kit and a 4 week trial.  All for shipping and handling on the scale.  That's it.  I'm going to just love this. I want you to try it right now.  Stamps.com. Use the offer code TWIG.  Don't forget to click that microphone to increase  the free postage to $55.  Making it a $110 value in all.  Stamps.com.  It's well named.  Because that's it. That's where you go.  Not just Stamps. Postage. Everything.  So Gina, you say you want to start  a peer to peer internet.  Is that not a dark net?  Is that not a second, like a tiered internet?  What are you talking about here?  So I think that a few years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the idea that every single one of us would have  a little computer in our pocket where we can install apps  that's almost as powerful as the computer on our desk  seemed insane.  That'll never happen.  It seemed insane.  So I think we're moving toward a place  where everyone is going to have their own little cloud space.  Their own little kind of web server.  We're seeing things like  Google Drive and Dropbox  and those kind of cloud hosting things.  Even Carbonite and Mozi get toward it.  And then we see things like Amazon EC2.  So the Dropbox, Google Drive is for consumers, right?  Then we see services like Amazon EC2  and AppFog,  these kind of virtual machines  that you can just spin up and run a web application on.  Those are mostly for developers.  I think that those two classes  of product are going to merge  and it's going to be really easy  for people to spin up apps  or kind of their own websites  on hosting providers  but it's going to be very easy.  As easy as it is to install  an app on your phone right now.  And then everyone is going to have their own  kind of little personal cloud  where they can serve content  where they can stream that content out to different silos  like Facebook and Twitter  and Google Plus and wherever else.  And little clouds that can talk to one another as well.  So we own and control our data  in a space that we pay for  that we can choose a provider for.  But we're also not just  pumping data into  corporate owned social networks  like Facebook and even Google Plus  who kind of own our content  and make decisions about what our profile picture  can look like and what our URLs look like  and all that stuff.  So that's the kind of thing that I want to see happen  and that's part of why I'm trying to work on the think up.  I think that's admirable.  But don't you worry that it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So usually I have to understand  that when you're working on a product  I have to understand  if you were running an app  let's say a video editing app  is that something that you think you run on your server  in the cloud or that you use somebody else's  but your data is constantly going back to your  space and so you can use apps here and there  but...or is that  an app that you run locally again?  I mean I like the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  idea of being able to run apps from everywhere  but I like the idea of kind of hosting  controlling my own data.  So it's the data you want to control?  Yes.  So having that data store  being able to export it  get to it in different ways, slice and dice it in different ways  and the ability for different cloud apps  to work on it  and for me to apply filters to it  or this gets into kind of what think up wants to do  at some point.  So the apps, it doesn't matter where the apps are hosted  but it's the  owning your data and being able to stream it out  to other places in a way...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who's the closest to doing that now?  I mean not consumer ready yet  but who could  jump into that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's nothing quite consumer ready yet.  With think up we're working with PHPFog  who I really like. They're getting really  close to making it easy to kind of have this  one click install of  an app like WordPress or think up  or Drupal. We've had these one click  installers on hosting providers.  We've had these for years but  I want to get to a place where it's like  it's so easy, it's just like I said  as easy as installing an app kind of on your phone  or in your browser.  I can see the... I'm sorry.  We still have a lot of work to do.  Go ahead Lamar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can see the geeks definitely  being into this. I know you're saying  this is going to be easy but  the idea of even  hosting your own stuff, I mean even the idea  of Google Drive and Dropbox scares the pants  of most average consumers.  They don't want to deal with that.  They just like it where...  They're going to use their own ISP email  versus getting a Gmail.  It's going to take a... What do you think it will take  to get people to realize  this is a one button press  and you have your own servers  and it's not complicated like  it could be now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think as Gina said, apps  on the phone  you might have said before, oh nobody's going to carry  something with all those apps on it.  I think that's penetrated consumer consciousness.  I mean it has to be an

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  absolutely compelling experience.  That's what gets people to try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's the other way around.  I think it will be transparent.  I don't think it will be an experience at all.  I think it's just going to happen  and people won't know they're doing it almost.  Intel inside. Cloud inside.  Yeah. I mean that's why Apple  is doing iCloud.  That's why Skybox, Skyfire...  I don't freaking know the name.  SkyDrive on Windows.  SkyDrive on Windows.  That's why the OS companies are doing it  because they want it to be internal, transparent  and I think you're exactly right.  I think the idea of apps,  software as a service  will become as common place  as apps are today  and I don't think you'll know you're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I mean like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the magic I anticipate  three or four years from now.  Maybe even sooner.  This is a thin client.  You log into a computer, whatever you're using  and you log into a  state that is out there.  Everything is out there.  There's nothing on here.  And all your apps and everything are  out there running off servers.  The advantage of that is  you don't care what device you're using.  It's a similar experience across all platforms.  Is that what you're talking about, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. That's part of what I'm talking about.  My app is a to-do app.  It writes to Dropbox.  It's just everywhere because it just syncs magically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem with the Chromebook or Chrome OS  is it looks like a browser. It can't do that.  They made a mistake by making it look too much like a browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who's running the servers?  That's what I'm still trying to understand.  Who's running the servers? Is it going to be a big company like Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody evil like Google, Facebook,  Apple, Microsoft.  What are the big choices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gina's point is you have a choice of where to host.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. You get a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or you could, truthfully,  but this is where Lamar,  you're right, this is way too sophisticated.  There's no reason you couldn't have  a Pogo plug or similar device  and be doing exactly the same thing out of your house.  And then you're not using Google.  And Gina will be the person who's just like now  saying, you ought to have your own web page.  We'll be saying, you ought to have your own cloud.  But you'll be in the minority  as I will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wrote this in What Would Google Do?  where I think  this is really dreamy.  This is really going beyond the pale of optimism.  But your cable company, your ISP  should have been thinking this way for years  saying, here's your space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember, you used to get a website  when you got internet access.  Which was hilarious.  The space they gave you is crazy.  But they should go back to that. I think you're absolutely right.  I think they should go back to that.  Now, of course, Comcast has caps  which is going to make all of, you know,  this is part of the issue. Net neutrality has to be preserved  and caps have to be overturned.  And that means there has to be competition.  Caps do not survive in the face of true competition.  The only reason they can exist at all  is because who are you going to go to?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we go the opposite way.  There's a story on the rundown  talking about the arrival of the Schmitternet.  Coined on this very show.  Schmitt happens.  What is the Schmitternet?  Let's use that now that you have Comcast.  I think we've talked about this glancingly.  If you have Comcast going through a game console  and saying, oh, that doesn't count toward your cap.  Bingo. That's the end of wired net neutrality right there.  Because it says that that traffic that goes through that device  where they have a special deal is privileged.  Absolutely. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So...  So it's your customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  So, Gina, I'm trying to...  So the two ways to think about your vision  is one, to look for the opportunity  and who should do it and who could do it, where's the business?  The other is to look at the danger and say,  how will the big boys stop this?  Well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll start with the latter.  You know one way they're going to stop it.  Apple is already rejecting any app that has Dropbox in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't even get me started.  Or these big companies will buy the ISPs

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and then they have the control.  So this goes back to a discussion of principles.  We have to have the...  This is a discussion that you missed the rant last week, Leo.  Having a much better time eating dried fish.  But I talked about this event that  Union Square Ventures held on Hacking Society.  And, you know, a discussion of principles around this.  I keep on saying is vital.  So that you can look at  any of these players and say,  no, no, no, that defines evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tim Whoop totally predicted this in the Master Switch.  He said, look, they're not going to sit back  on their haunches for much longer  and allow a free and open internet.  As soon as you guys work out all the technical details,  AT&T, Comcast, Verizon,  whoever the stakeholders are,  just say, hey, thanks, see ya.  We got it. We'll take it from here.  That's why, Gina,  everybody has to learn how to program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, everybody doesn't have to.  Yes!  Right now, I pay for a backup service  like Carbonite.  I pay for web hosting.  I don't pay for it, but I might upgrade my Google Drive  or my Dropbox for more storage.  So I'm already paying for  kind of web space, cloud space.  I want all those things to just kind of merge.  And I want companies to compete,  to provide that to me.  I mean, Amazon is absolutely equipped to provide that.  Right now, you can spin up a virtual machine on Amazon  and run what you want, store what you want.  Google is absolutely in a position to do this.  Companies like Carbonite, Mozi,  companies like Dropbox.  I mean, everybody's sort of coming at this  from a different angle.  But the reality is that we're moving toward a place  where everyone has kind of their own personal cloud.  And I just want to see those things merge.  I want to see it become really easy.  I want to see it get to a place where it's really easy  for anyone to spin up a web app  anywhere and make it as easy as it is  to install an app on your phone.  I think that this can happen.  I don't know. Most people think I'm crazy  when I talk about this because they're like,  that's just never going to happen.  No one wants to host their own website. It's too much of a pain.  No one wants hosted service where they don't have to think about it.  That might be true, but I think there are a lot of interesting advantages  that you get when you own your own cloud  and you can do your own calculations on your own data  when you own your own data and when you can do peer-to-peer communications.  And I think there's a lot of business opportunity here  even for these companies.  So that's what you should be building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The key to that,  you are building, I know,  but the key to that becomes the first consumer  prospect you can give of adding value through being together.  Only because this data and that data are in the same place  and you control it,  can you get, because X and Y are in the same place,  can you get Z.  So you become the provider of Z.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  So instead of going to a party that Facebook is hosting,  having a party in a public space,  but getting value from that space,  meaning like, if my cloud can talk to your cloud, Jeff,  and what can we get from that that we can't necessarily get from,  you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, it doesn't obviate Facebook existing.  It just demands that Facebook be portable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, I mean, Facebook doesn't,  Facebook can still exist and we can be pumping content into Facebook.  Facebook actually does benefit from this.  Facebook can get more interesting data from us  because we've got computing power on our side  and we can get insights and analytics from our own stuff  and our own social graph  that maybe, you know, Facebook doesn't surface.  The problem is that Facebook then no longer has a monopoly on that information

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and that means a competitor can come along  and that's not what Facebook's going to want to have happen.  Right?  They want to protect their monopoly on that information.  That's why Facebook right now is a silo.  Facebook has no read API, right?  No, and the funny thing is you have...  They have a graph, social graph.  But what was the deal?  Well, I guess they changed this,  but for one, they changed it.  So, you know,  what was the deal?  Well, I guess they changed this, but for a while it was only 24 hours.  They changed that though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, they have all kinds of crazy terms of service  about how you can access the API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They really want to control that. They do not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They absolutely do.  All the more reason why you should want to host your data  in your own space where you can decide  what people can do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, okay, I'll get a website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but you know,  Lamar's case is actually really a good one.  Hosting your own video files  does not make sense for an indie creator.  It just absolutely doesn't.  But Lamar, you should have backups of all your videos.  The website, yes.  Streaming video, I mean hosting video is just huge files.  It's very costly.  But as server space and bandwidth and CPU cycles  and virtual machines and all the cost of those things go down,  that will become, I think,  maybe easier in the future.  But you do have a backup of everything  because if YouTube goes away  or if there's a new video distribution channel,  you want to be able to get your stuff there too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.  But the other thing you have to say that YouTube did right  in its original model is by making  the content that you do put there embeddable,  it allows you to put it on your blog,  it allows you to put it on  Google+, which of course they do.  How easy is it to put it on  from YouTube on Facebook or YouTube on...  It's a button click away.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They really made it super easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what they're doing is they're hiding the fact that they  have the content and you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes it look like you have the content.  Well, that's the cynical, conspiratorial way to look at it.  Yes.  But I would also say  that it also lets you put the content  wherever you want. The problem is the opposite.  Until they pull it down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because of content violations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree. Stipulated, Your Honor.  Yes. But I would also say that  Google Plus should allow you to  easily embed Vimeo videos and you can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you know how screwed we would be  if our only source of video were YouTube?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Google Plus allows you to...  Google Plus embeds Vimeo. I'm pretty sure.  If you put a Vimeo link in Google Plus, it will embed it.  I'm pretty sure. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, because when you go in  and embed a video, it asks you for a YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  URL. I think if you just drop  a link in the compose box, it  should. Assuming videos do...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'd have to actively block Vimeo  because there's a standard, right, for what  happens when you put a link in.  And if you have the right metadata in there,  it's supposed to just do it. So they would  have to do something highly anti-competitive that would get  them in a lot of trouble. Vimeo would have cried foul

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  long ago if that happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm trying it right now, but I'm pretty  sure that... Oh, yeah, I'm sure it does. And that's really up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to Vimeo, including the metadata  that will tell YouTube how to  display it and stuff. Now, what I'm curious about  is, do they display the video as big?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They do. The video is big  with a big play button. If you just  drop a link in... Never mind. Never mind.  They'd get in too much trouble if they didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  do that. They have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, unlike Apple, that just starts blocking  apps because they talk to Dropbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's... And what is the excuse?  That there is an in-app purchase  involved?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. When you log in to Dropbox  from your iOS account, it says...  It brings you to the Dropbox website  and says, sign in to Dropbox to grant  access. And there's a link that says,  if you don't have a Dropbox account, you can create  a dropbox account down here. If you click on the  create link, you can register for a Dropbox  account. And then on the confirmation  page, Dropbox says, oh, by the way,  you can buy more storage if you'd like.  And that is what Apple is  objecting to, that three or four  clicks into the interaction with  Dropbox and Mobile Safari, you can  purchase  storage from Dropbox.  It's truly a restraint of trade.  I mean, it really crosses the line  from protecting your business interests  to being just a big old unreasonable  bully.  And they're working with Dropbox right now.  It seemed like a really unreasonable  reason to reject  Dropbox apps.  I mean, it's not like Dropbox has a big  buy more space link  on the first screen. It's several screens in  and it's not required.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway. Sorry. Here's the Vimeo  embedding. You just paste in a link  and you get a nice...  Okay, I was wrong!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love that Google  does that the right way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because all you have to have,  and Vimeo of course knows how to do this, is the right metadata  associated with whatever  that link points to and  Google will display it appropriately  with big pictures. And so what that means is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the two-way portability would be this.  Coming in, I should be able  to similarly embed  an article, a blog post, a slide  show, or whatever I want from anywhere.  You can, including your own

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  page, if you have the right metadata.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, so you need that, right?  Now the other problem is that you...  It's fine and wonderful that they have the  data liberation front, but it's only batch.  What I should be able to do is take anything  I wrote on Google+, and not  only embed it elsewhere, but now to Gina's point,  allow it to mingle  with my own data elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, like, you know, plus ones  right now. So I plus  ones stuff all the time. Where do they go?  What happens to them? Can I see a list  of all the things that I plus one?  Where does it go? It just goes away  into the ether. I just press this button.  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Gina, on your  Google Plus page, you can actually  go to your profile, and then  the last link should be  plus ones, and you can actually see a list of all your  plus ones. See, there we go again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's not everything I've ever  plus one. It's not  easy to find. It's not easy to find,  and it's not everything. Like, if I plus one just  post on Google Plus, like, those aren't listed here.  These are only things I plus one in the  search results, or like on page.  So, there's a bunch  of plus ones that just sort of get lost in the  ether. So if I do plus one something  on YouTube, I don't, you know,  where does that go? That is not useful  to me. That is only useful to Google right  now. Right now. But that annoys  me. Why am I going to the trouble of plus oneing stuff  to help Google with the search results if I can't  you know, export my plus ones,  if I can't publish them to a stream, you know,  if I can't do stuff with that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And analyze them and find the trends  in them and find. Exactly. See what other

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  things my friends have plus oneed and  cross-reference, which ones, I mean, there's all kinds  of cool stuff that you can do with that. And I have no  doubt that Google is going to release the ability,  you know, or is going to release all kinds of interesting  ways to do stuff with your plus one.  But right now, it's just  kind of like I press a button and  I do it for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you're right. I think those kind of  trends, if you're able to see exactly  where your traffic is coming from, I mean, that's  so, such value. It encourages you  to make better posts or make different kind of posts  knowing exactly where that's coming from.  So I 100% agree with you.  I never look at the plus one list.  It's my first time looking at mine in about two months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems kind of old. This is stuff I plus one.  Like the number one plus one  is Twitter and then my blog, then your blog,  Jeff.  It seems like it's kind of, I don't understand  the order of this even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These are like just plus things  that I've plus one on other sites or in search results.  That's what it looks like.  But it's not like posts that I plus one inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess what they would say is that  these plus ones will show up, in fact they do say  will show up when your friends  search for something that  you've plus one. It will  say to you, hey, Leo plus one to this.  It gives it a higher ranking or gives it  that's where it shows up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But where are all the Google plus  posts that I've plus one? Like these are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just links. Yeah, you're right. These are not Google plus  posts. Those don't show up here, huh?  They don't show up at all. Where do they go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, what happens to them?  What am I doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't understand.  I guess it's the same as if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook like someone's post,  where does that go? It just kind of  disappears into nothingness. I think that's what's happening  with the Google plus post,  which is unfortunate. Because  I like to be able to save some of those to go back to.  Like I told Vic, I talked to him  in a private chat, like I would love  to have the ability to star posts like you do  on Google reader. So I can refer back  to them. And I thought plus one, it would give me  that ability, but it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All it does is give  the search engine. It's for Google.  It's to give the search engine another single.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think people would be more likely to use it if it had  more impact than just helping  Google. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, hey, now they give us free stuff.  Well, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And sometimes  the Google giveth and sometimes  the Google taketh away. As in the case  of Java, we're going to talk about  the debate over whether Google  screwed  Sun or as  James Gosling, the creator of Java,  says slimed Sun  or hey,  we didn't copy anything. The Oracle  Google update coming up also.  Galaxy Nexus  information. And  I'm just going to stick the word  ham in here. I don't know why.  John Ham.  I guess he's there's a Google  bogus Google scandal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He sounds delicious. I'm hungry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  John Ham's John Ham. He is delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me tell you.  He's the best looking man on television.  I assume it's the same John. Yes, it is. Good.  I'm just checking.  Good looking guy.  I'm going to put him next to Rupert Murdoch.  It really is Beauty and the Beast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It truly is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of like the picture of  Dorian Gray. This is what he would look like  if he didn't have that picture in the attic.  We're going to talk about that in just a bit.  But first a word. Since we're talking about  disintermediation, disruption,  subversion,  let's talk about a company that wants to  completely disrupt the  mobile phone industry.  Ting and their  Dump Your Contract Contest  for the month of May.  Oh, I love this.  They will buy out  one winner's mobile service contract  every day this month.  Every day this month.  Go to ting.com slash d-y-c  to dump your contract.  First, you find out how much you would  save with Ting.  And by the way,  I have to say I love Ting. So what is Ting?  Oh, I should explain probably.  Elliot Noss at Two Cows  came to us last fall and said, I want to do this new thing.  I want you guys to be in on this.  He says, we're going to be an MVNO.  That is a mobile virtual network operator.  We're going to take Sprint Service, resell it.  We're going to create a whole new way  of doing cell phone service.  No contracts.  You pay for just what you use.  No more.  And we're going to change  the mobile phone industry.  And I think they are one user at a time.  Take a look at the plans.  If you go to ting.com, and this is  the getting started thing. You purchase your device.  They have actually a really nice  list of devices now.  Activate your device.  Then choose your plan.  Let's go to choose your plan because this is kind of fun.  Now you don't even have to choose a plan.  I should mention, you can just ignore this  process and just pay for what you want.  But if you want to kind of have an idea,  you get to buy minutes, text messages, and data  separately. Completely not  combined.  You can buy 000 across the board and just pay  for what you use. And there's no premium  if you go over.  You pay a certain amount per device.  $6 per device per month.  And nothing more.  And then you just pay for what you use.  Or you can take a look  if you had 3000 minutes. That's $52 a month.  If you had 6000  text messages, that's $14 a month.  But the thing is, get zero.  Go across the board with zero.  And just pay as you go.  But if you want a plan, you can do more.  Go to their calculator, see how much you save.  It's amazing. Let's take a look at the  devices because every time I go here,  they add their own devices. You can bring your own  device. But they add  some devices right now.  This is Sanyo ZO for $100.  Up to the Motorola Photon, which is kind of the  hot new top of the line phone.  And I want to give you a new URL.  This is another one. Ting.com  And if you have a new watch twig, you'll save $50 off of that device.  Now the reason these are a little more  expensive is they're not subsidized because  there's no early termination fee.  There's no two year deal.  This is it. Month to month.  You are under no obligation.  They also have great customer support.  No wait.  8am to 8pm Eastern Standard Time. They will not put you on hold.  They have  great email support and an active discussion forum.  Blog, tweet.  It's really run by a bunch of geeks who wanted  to transform the way cell phone service works.  And it is fantastic.  And for the month of May, don't forget  to enter the contest.  No purchase necessary.  Ting.com slash  d-y-c to dump your contract.  They'll buy you out.  One person a month.  For the next, for the next month.  And I think  that's it. There's no purchase necessary.  Open to all US residents  age 18 plus who are  in a mobile phone service contract.  They can't do this overseas. I apologize for our international  listeners because it's  much more complicated.  But for those of you in the US suffering  under the tyranny  of AT&T, T-Mobile,  Sprinter, Verizon, this is an opportunity  to dump your contract.  Ting.com slash d-y-c.  Great for businesses too  because you know, as many handsets  as you want, six bucks a month handset.  A big pool of data or minutes  that you get really nice  as you're using it. I should pull this up.  I can't though. I don't want to show the phone number.  But you get usage  by device, easy to access, billing information,  control over what features so it's good for business.  Help content.  It's great for families, great for businesses, great for  individuals. Ting.  T-I-N-G dot com. Save 50 bucks on your  device at ting.com slash twig.  And don't forget to enter the dump your contract contest  at ting.com slash d-y-c.  They pay the ETF.  That's a good idea I think.  Once you're out of your mobile contract,  stay contract free with ting.com.  Google says there was  no copying.  Closing statements for the Google trial.  Google employed Java  APIs in a fair use  manner for Android,  transforming them into a full smartphone  stack.  Meanwhile James Gosling says  Google slimed  son.  Gina, you're the programmer here.  What do you think of all this?  I'm sure you've been following this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know the Gosling post  or his statements about it.  He's the creator so I tend to...  He wrote it?  Yeah, he wrote it. So I'm like okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I doubt he has any loyalty to  Oracle at this point.  He wrote it for son.  Most of those son guys left when Oracle  took over.  He says Oracle is doing the right thing suing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh right. But he left Oracle  a few months after they acquired son.  He's basically saying that no one here  is clearly  in the right. That everyone is  being sort of slimy.  But he's saying that it wasn't in son's DNA  to sue Google over what they were doing  with Java. They were not happy  about it. But they kind of  grit their teeth and put on a happy face  and said hey we're glad to see that Java is being  utilized across...  in such a huge ecosystem that Android is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the interesting thing. He says  while I have differences with Oracle, in this case  they are in the right. Google totally slimes  son. We were all really disturbed.  Even Jonathan, Jonathan Schwartz who was  the CEO of Son Until the Sale.  He just decided to put on a happy face  and tried to turn lemons into lemonade  which annoyed a lot of folks at son.  So Gosling's saying Schwartz knew that  there was copyright  violation or patent violation  and decided  we're going to live with it. Oracle  didn't feel the same way. They decided that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google was making this  huge thing. They were putting Java  to great use  and was going to get it into a lot of people's hands.  They decided to just go along with it and say hey yeah  we're a part of this. Instead of suing  them over it.  But Google says it was fair  use. Although Google tried to win  this trial on a technicality.  They pulled the disk that Oracle filed and there was no data on them.  I mean this has just been  a circus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're blank. What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They needed a cloud backup. That's what they needed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh we forgot to  put anything on those disks. Just take  as written. There's something there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the fact that they're trying to win  on that technicality is a little bit like  I mean this whole time I've been  feeling that  it was fair use  and that as a developer I would assume  that those APIs that they're  arguing about would be just part of it.  I would make the same assumptions.  At the same time you have an email from Andy Ruman  saying hey we should get a license for this.  And they tried to get the technicality.  But now you have the creator saying hey you know what?  Google did slime us.  It wasn't in son's DNA to sue them  but Oracle's  in the right doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oracle's lawyer's eyes sparkled  during the acquisition talks.  He said that this is an ego, money, and power play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean  which isn't surprising.  But now I was kind of delighted by this whole thing  in the beginning. Now I'm just kind of like ugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Gina I wanted to ask you  what do you feel about the  what's his name? Nest?  Basically saying that  well you know son approved  this publicly. He said  he likes Android. He likes what  Google is doing knowing full well.  Is that a mission  on a blog post or somewhere public?  Does that make it a legal  case? I mean does that  strengthen Google in that case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean in my eyes it did. I'm not a lawyer.  But in my eyes that son  and Oracle were thrilled with  the adoption of Java.  Android got Java in the hands  of millions of people. And they did.  They created a whole new brand new smartphone stack  and a complete new ecosystem. It's kind of  amazing. I love Android.  I love what Google has done with Android.  And so yeah in the beginning I said well they weren't  full support of this and now they're suing what's going on.  But you know there's always a story  behind the scenes. Now hearing Gosling say  hey you know we weren't thrilled  that they didn't quite comply with  you know the whole  Java's the whole base of Java was the idea of  write once run anywhere.  You write the same code and it could run on every single device  everywhere.  And so apparently you know Android  breaks that a little bit. That bothers  me a little bit as a developer especially as a Java developer.  So you  know I mean I think you make public statements  because you say hey you know this thing that we made  is part of a huge new thing. That's sweeping  the tech world. But you know in the background  if they were feeling slighted if they felt like hey you didn't  use this in the spirit  with which we put it out  into the world. You know I get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He says Gosling says  something funny. I just want to say this quote because I  laugh so hard. He kind of slammed Android a little bit.  He says basically what's going  on in the Android world is that there is no  kind of a dolt in charge.  All these handset manufacturers are doing what  they damn well please. Which means  there's just going to be randomness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's called open source though James.  You support that I thought.  Exactly. Maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah but you know there's also  standards and there's you know you buy a license  and that makes sure that you sort of  comply by a certain you know  number of rules and standards  that Java enforces. I mean that's a good thing.  Having at least a standard to work  toward. Google does this too with their  hardware specs. You know the Google name  doesn't go on handsets that don't comply  with all of Google's specs. Now Android  does not use the Java brand.  You know it doesn't say Java anywhere. It doesn't use  the coffee cup logo. It doesn't you know  so they can argue hey yeah we changed things  a little bit. We never got the license but we're not using  your branding anywhere. We're not saying this is Java.  Kind of like what Amazon is doing  with with with Google with Android  with the Kindle Fire. I mean  this is how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the chat room  downclimbs says write once sue everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I just threw this in so we can look at a picture of John Ham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He is a beautiful man.  Especially in this  season of Bad Men. My goodness he actually smiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just watched the acid trip episode.  I'm one behind but my god.  My god.  Roger's having a good season.  He's executive.  Slattery is an executive producer.  I think he's writing himself in stuff now.  And I want an acid trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh and it only gets better in this past week's episode.  Oh good I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was such a weird.  You felt like you were on acid watching  the week before because it was all out of order.  It's like wait a minute didn't they already go  to Howard Johnson? I don't.  Anyway.  I don't want to.  Only a million people watch Mad Men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a tiny show.  I had no idea what you were talking about until you said Mad Men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just Gina and me.  This is sub glee.  I can't believe you don't watch Mad Men Jeff.  It's so you.  I tried the first episodes and it seemed so sledge hammer unsubtle.  Really?  Yeah the racism and the sexism was just without the slightest subtlety.  And I just.  I tried to watch the first couple of episodes multiple times and I just gave up.  I know it's unpopular.  I know I'm in the minority but I couldn't do it.  And then once I was lost I was lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd force yourself to go back and watch all five seasons right now Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's it Jeff you're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Watch all five and then talk to me about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In my old days as a TV critic.  I would have watched it.  You would have had to.  See that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to watch more so you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah unless I want to exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Freedom!  Yeah because he had to watch.  He had to watch crappy shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The worst week.  I did it in the days of the really long mini series.  I had a policy I never fast forwarded.  14 hours of AD was the worst torture of my career.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you didn't have an iPad or anything else.  I mean you had to watch.  People watched television.  There was nothing else to look at.  It's mama's family or nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I missed it.  I missed a cultural phenomenon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's okay.  It's okay. We forgive you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is better than moonlighting.  I'm telling you it's better than moonlighting.  It's that good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was there anything better than that show?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe Rupert Murdoch and Jon Hamm together last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rupert Murdoch unfit to lead.  A large company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently SOS Racisme, which is a French NGO,  has accused Google of reinforcing the notion of an international Jewish conspiracy to control the media.  Because when you search for Rupert Murdoch Jewish or Jon Hamm Jewish,  those queries are more likely to show up in autocomplete.  See it proves it!  They are not Jewish.  But Google is anti-semitic.  I think somebody has to explain how autocomplete works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they have to explain how the whole damn internet works.  Apparently.  The Google Street View thing is just driving me completely batty.  It's gotten so conspiratorial now.  And it was legal!  Schmucky, but it was legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this autocomplete thing is if you type in Jon Hamm or Rupert Murdoch's name,  one of the suggested options is Jewish?  It's Jewish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's because people are searching it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're saying, is he Jewish?  Maybe they're looking for a nice Jewish boy with chiseled features or who looks like a Sharpay.  Either way...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The name Jon Hamm just isn't kosher.  There are so many...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's obvious.  There are so many racist, sexist, homophobic things out in the world, which were intentionally so,  that getting wound up about something like this seems crazy.  Also, Jon Hamm's wife's name is Jennifer.  So if you type in JE, one of the suggestions is her name and then it's Jewish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So instead of having Gadar in this case, you need Goidar.  Sorry, I'll just keep it a little bit longer until you cut me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did we talk about the Google Nexus thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mentioned it in passing.  Apple wants the Nexus Source Code.  Google says, what the hell?  We already gave you all that stuff.  Apple says, no, we want it all.  Google says, yeah, it's protected just like the iPhone OS is protected.  No.  And then there was another judge, Judge Posner.  Did you see his slap against Apple?  Saying Apple was frivolous.  Better cut it out, knock it off.  No.  I don't think it was in the Google case.  Maybe it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It might have been in Samsung.  Apple says they're tired of litigation anyway.  Then Sam Cooke says he never liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good. Stop it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hopefully they put Apple and Samsung in a room together, lock it,  and they can either kiss and make up or do worse things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's what companies do when they can't compete.  Look what Nokia just did.  27% market loss last quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How long until Apple sues the New York Times?  Man.  All out war.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Wall Street Journal and Facebook.  Did you see the Wall Street Journal article saying,  Facebook's ads don't work.  It's just like, come on.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I just want to cover a few more before we go into our picks of the week.  Google Cube.  That was addictive.  This is not an April Fool's joke.  If you go to playmapscube.com,  you probably have to do it in Chrome, right?  I'm trying it now in Safari, which means it's going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a Chrome experiment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing happens.  Your browser's unsupported.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your browser is not worthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a video on YouTube of what you're missing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Schmock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you weren't Jewish, you'd probably enjoy this.  I'm sorry.  Now I'm going to get in trouble.  So what is this?  It's a cube.  It's like, oh, it's that marble game with maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's kind of neat.  Yeah, you just travel around the city either biking  or going to a bowling alley or walking or driving.  I was trying to prepare for this show  and I spent 30 minutes playing that game.  That was unacceptable.  I liked it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got caught up in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not allowed.  You may not play the games we refer to in the show notes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I want to play it.  I have to launch Chrome first.  I don't have Chrome.  Oh yeah, I do. Here it is.  I'll save it for after the show.  It's worth playing, it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds like it's a good thing.  The cloud is going to be huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I guess when you get a big,  what was it, how much money do they get  from Facebook?  40 million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How much is it going to be?  Do they get it in equity or cash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's equity, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't seen that calculation.  How much are they going to be worth at a $104 billion valuation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you could tell because now they become venture capitals.  Capitalists.  And I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't these guys just live for staying in the news?  Like every few months they pop up with something crazy.  These two are like,  they're just ass going to be made fun of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I hate to be insensitive, but God,  that quote is horrible.  And it's just.  We think the cloud is going to be huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, thank you guys.  And it was our idea and they stole it from us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They stole it.  We had an idea for a website.  If you were the inventors of Facebook,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you would have invented Facebook.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Mark Zuckerberg.  As embodied by Aaron Sorkin.  They can easily make Winkle Book if they want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Winkle Book.  The funny thing is that at the end,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the CNBC reporter asks for their autograph.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there's two of them.  Okay, sorry.  I'll start off.  I'm going to start off with the one that's going to be the most popular.  I'm going to start off with the one that's going to be the most popular.  I'm going to start off with the one that's going to be the most popular.  Okay, sorry. I'll start off.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And they're twins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alright.  Let's take a break and come back.  We're going to do your picks, your tips, your numero.  And I'm going to let...  Talk about the Facebook Organ Donor app.  Facebook Organ Donor app.  Oh yeah, we didn't talk about that.  Huge success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  800% dude.  That's really awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's great. And just in California.  100,000 signed up on the first day.  Peer pressure via social network.  They added an organ donation tool to Facebook, which I haven't seen yet.  They added an organ donation tool to Facebook, which I haven't seen yet.  So how did you see it?  Did they show up in your stream?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think they'll recommend it to you.  You have to go to your health settings and then you can say that you are an organ donor and if you're not one, you can sign up to be one and you can share it with friends, family or the world.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Facebook has health settings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never knew that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you mean?  Mostly it was I have a zit today.  Heart condition?  You see how long mine are.  They go on forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not joking. Facebook actually has health settings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know where to find them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Alright.  So maybe it shows up in my app requests?  The video that shows you how to do it shows you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The video that shows you how to do it shows you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey Jeff, have you seen it?  Is there a place where I can donate all of my extra fat that I have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get in line.  Get in line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see you lose a little bit of hair.  I want to donate my ear hair for transplant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's disgusting.  I do not want ear hair.  If I search for organ...  It's better than nose hair.  Facebook help organ donor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you just go up there and look for organ donor.  Here's how to share that you're an organ donor with your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's how to share that you're an organ donor with your friends.  You do it on your timeline.  Oh, it's a life event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what it is.  Yes, under life event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me go back.  I have to go to my timeline.  I'm just going to show it so everybody knows how to do it.  Here we are.  We're in Leo Laporte's timeline.  Hey, we brought Facebook down.  Everybody's doing it.  Sorry.  Then it would be in here somewhere in my health life event.  Where do I add a life event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a bad person so I didn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here it is.  Life event.  Work and education, family, health and wellness.  You're right, Jeff.  New eating habits, organ donor, weight loss, glasses, broken bones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can actually enter as a life event what body part you broke, where you broke it, who you were with, when you did it, the story, and then upload photos of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who knew?  I'm going to add a life event.  I'm going to add a life event.  I'm going to add a life event.  I'm going to add a life event.  Who knew?  Overcoming illness, quit a habit.  This is big news.  I registered as an organ donor many moons ago.  I'm going to say 97.  If you're not officially registered, it's easy to sign up here.  This is the key with the appropriate registry.  Go to Facebook.com.  Donate life.  Donate life America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This also means if you don't have a card on you, there's now a place to chat.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  California, it's on the back of our driver's license.  This would be good.  So I can go register.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wrote a post just fascinated by the norms this causes.  When Super Amit needed his bone marrow transplant and it was a great campaign to do it, I have to admit in the back of my mind was, oh, what if I did that and then I kind of win the match?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what you don't want because I have a feeling it's not much fun.  But that's a horrible thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I felt pressure.  I didn't do a damn thing about it because I'm schmuck.  But I felt pressure to do it.  So I asked whether one could be shunned if you don't join in.  And then Seth Godin came in and said, you damn well should be shunned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should be shunned, you son of a gun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Drowning child.  Which I see the point.  I don't know what to think.  But it's a really interesting use of social pressure.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I signed up for bone marrow transplant many moons ago and have not been called.  You do it and you kind of hope that you don't get called, I think.  You don't want to win that lottery.  But on the other hand, if you get called, here's what I've been told.  Yeah, it's a little painful.  But you're literally, this is one of the few things that literally can save a guy's life.  If it's a match, you put it in, you put in the new marrow, it grows, he's done.  He's fixed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you get yours back.  The harder example would be a kidney or a lung transplant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which is a lot worse than getting marrow sucked out of your bone.  That's true too.  So I'll take that any time.  So I'm filling this out right now.  Just so I'll be in the database even though I'm also, you can't hurt to do it twice.  And this is for your eyes, your ears, your nose, your anything.  Tissues.  Nobody wants my nose.  Too big.  This is good.  And so 100,000 in one day.  This just shows the power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is definitely an example of using power for good.  I was really impressed with Facebook for doing this.  And I'm grateful.  I'm glad that they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I went on the Takeaway this morning on NPR on public radio.  And John...  Takeaway guy.  Yeah, takeaway guy.  Hockaberry.  Hockaberry, thank you.  So it's like it's out of a script.  Well, could Facebook use this for bad purposes to like target ads to you?  I said, what's the demographic?  Generous people?  Yeah, actually maybe.  How can we always be so cynical about everything?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the good news is this information is not going through Facebook.  Well, maybe it is, but it's from Donate Life.  In my case, Donate Life California.  I'm not giving this information to Facebook.  Well, you are.  You're also telling Facebook that you're an owner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am?  Well, in the sense that you just said you were.  Yeah, you just said yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but that I'm a donor.  Oh, but not like the personal information I give here.  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but the fact that you are a donor or that someone else isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does it show up in your news stream when you do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, probably.  You could decide, yes, if you choose to do that.  Depends on who you choose to share that with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did something wrong with my driver's license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it when they all get to the weeds.  I just want to do it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to do this in case I died.  You know, I could go out the door and get a drink.  I could go out the door and get hit by a bus.  I want to make sure that if I do, that my guts will go to somebody who needs them.  There, now I'm signed up.  And I can have, oh, notify friends and family.  I probably should.  I'm going to notify you and you and you and all of you.  You sound like Oprah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've all got an organ of your choice under the seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good.  So now I'm in the registry.  Guaranteeing under the California Uniform Anatomical Gift Act that your wishes to save lives will be honored and you will not require the consent of any other person.  Print this page.  Keep it in your wallet.  Now, I'm curious.  Now, this is a good question.  I'm curious.  Is this going to show up in my Facebook?  Leo, just...  Yes, because you said to share it.  I did.  That's where all this pressure is coming from, isn't it?  Your friends are already doing this.  Right.  Yeah, what's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is Jeff's living in public.  I mean, this is one of the baddies, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I mean, to be cynical about it.  It may not be about targeting ads, but it is about, it seems like it could be about attracting health-related advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, so you opted to be an organ donor.  You were probably very likely to want to donate blood.  Ah, so the Red Cross might contact them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But even then, that's not it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't spend money on that.  I think the cynical...  If you insist on being cynical, the chat room said you were on a tear today, Gina.  I love you being on a tear.  If you insist upon it, then I would say that what Son Jake said was that it's a PR point.  Well, it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're about to go to IPO, so it just kind of makes sense.  Yeah, you know what?  I don't think it did show up in my stream, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't see it showing up anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't see it in your stream either. It's weird.  So there you go.  God, maybe this is purely altruistic.  Maybe Facebook just wants to save lives.  What?  No!  This is ruining my whole worldview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then you remember longer, and then if they extend lives, then they actually have the lifetime value of a user.  Thus, if they have 800 million users and 1% of them live one year longer, then...  Oh, that's it.  Now look who's being cynical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook cures cancer so it can make more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I post everything on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They know everything about me.  It's like I gave up.  If you were like the CIA and wanted to know where Leo was at any given moment, just go to my public Facebook page.  Like 91,000 other people.  You're carumba.  That's me and Tom Anderson, by the way.  There's a certain...  I think there's a certain, I don't know, poignancy, piquant flavor to have Tom Anderson on my Facebook page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I still wish he'd be on the show.  And he's looking at me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks like a cop drama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does look like a cop drama.  Streets of Petaluma.  Hey, hey, who killed the chickens?  Trey Radcliffe took that great picture.  I just love that.  And I just think it's kind of an in-joke that I have Tom Anderson as picture on my timeline.  That's MySpace Tom for those people who don't know the name.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Come back with your tips and your numbers.  And you know, if Lamar, you'd like to come up with, I don't know, an app or a tool that you like a lot, maybe the Cube, anything, we'll let you do that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you for the pressure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you don't have to.  And you've got three minutes to figure something out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No pressure at all. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This portion of This Week at Google brought to you by the good folks at Citrix.  We love them.  They do so many great products, including the best remote access product ever that's going to change the world because it's going to take cars off the road.  Gas prices going up.  Commute.  Length of time getting longer.  Wouldn't you like to stay home?  Work from home every once in a while.  Do it one day a week.  20% savings in gas alone, not to mention stress.  And you can have that sandwich you like so much for lunch because it's right there.  That's what GoToMyPC allows.  It allows you to access your work computer wherever you are, not just home, on the road at the airport in Norway.  Even in Christiansund, in the middle of nowhere, I was able to get online and check my computer, not just, by the way, on my PC or Mac, but on my iPhone and my iPad.  Now, that is cool.  I can go to my Android tablet.  It sets up in minutes.  No IT help is required.  It's secure, 128-bit SSL.  It's actually a secure way to surf.  If you're in an open Wi-Fi access point, pull out your iPad, launch the free GoToMyPC app.  You're now connected to your office computer.  Use that to surf.  It's completely secure all the way to your office computer.  And that's cool.  In fact, if I'm in Norway and I want to watch a US-only site or like that, that's how you do it.  It's like VPN.  It's better than VPN.  It's easy to use.  Nat traversal.  You don't have to open ports on firewalls or anything like that.  It's really a slick solution.  You could try it free right now.  Just go to the website.  Go to MyPC.com.  Click the orange Try It Free button and use our offer code TWIG, T-W-I-G, right there what  says promo code, TWIG.  It's case insensitive.  And then you got it for 30 days free.  The iPad app is free.  The iPhone app is free.  The Android tablet app is free.  So download the app of your choice.  Download it for all three and access anytime, anywhere, your office computer.  Go to MyPC.com.  Use the offer code TWIG, if you will.  Triangulation is coming up later today.  Bill Harris will be joining us.  He is an interesting fellow.  He's got a product that competes with Mint, with Intuit.  Oh, yeah.  It's what it's called.  Personal capital.  It's more for business.  Same word, business.  But a multi-time startup guy.  Very interesting fellow.  Former CEO of Intuit and PayPal.  Kind of competing with his old company with personal capital.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  At 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern Time.  2300UTC at twit.tv.  Now it's time for Gina Trapani's tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've got a silly little Easter egg as my tip of the week.  I like silly little Easter eggs.  It's really fun, though.  Type Zerg Rush into Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Zerg are from Starcraft.  Z-E-R-G-R-U-S-H.  Wait a minute.  Oh my God.  Here they come.  They're taking over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So now if you point at them with your mouse, you can try to get them  They're eating the page.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've lost the Zerg.  Oh, you might get that last one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I get him before he eats up the...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But apparently there's quite a few left.  Way down here.  Oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you can follow them down the page.  Oh, no.  It's a little game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there must be a Starcraft fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There has to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is somebody's 20% time wasted.  I had to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So for the people listening to the audio stream, the little O's from Google are flying down  the screen and Zerg Rush in Starcraft is an attack of insect-like creatures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Insect-like aliens.  Yeah, they're horrible.  The Zerg are horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so the little O's come down and kind of eat everything on the page.  And then when you inevitably lose, as Leo has done, they all sort of gather into two...  Well, maybe I shouldn't give this part away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I suspect they're going to spell Google, right?  I'm just guessing.  Look at this.  This is so cool, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The best letter in the alphabet is about to show up twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is about to make me itch.  It is a little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, we used to drop quarters to play a game this good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And GG stands for good game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it does.  This is a person who has a 20% life.  It's not Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't spell Google.  They could have spelled Google.  That's terrible.  But they spelled good game.  That's funny.  Or GG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then you can share your score on Google Plus, shockingly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, unfortunately, my score sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's just see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I defended a Zerg Rush on Google search.  I took down three Zerglings with 41 APM.  That's probably like the worst score ever.  But I'm going to share it because I'm an idiot.  There you go, Google Plus.  Don't tell me I don't use Google Plus on a regular basis.  Let's see.  We're going to get a number of the week from Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't decide, so I'm going to go through a whole bunch of them.  Seven and a half, which is how many years Dig lived before its staff  now moves to the Washington Post and poor Dig is...  How many?  Did they all move?  Basically, there's no staff left.  You know, it's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin Rose essentially dissolved all three companies he started within a month.  Yeah.  Sold Milk to Google is now at Google, by the way.  I don't know what he's doing.  I asked him and he says, I can't tell you, but let me know when you want Google  glasses because I'll get them for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The rumor is that he's doing Google Plus.  His team is working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that rumor is wrong.  But he says they won't let me talk.  He says, just consider me your inside source at Google.  Maybe that's just because we're friends.  And then Dig, everybody leaves.  Dig is like, anybody know a programmer?  We kind of need a programmer.  And then the latest rumor is that Revision 3, which is the media startup he started,  Dig Nation, and they did a lot of shows.  He and David Prager put that together, is about to be sold to Discovery for something  like 20 to 40 million.  So that'll be it.  Kevin will be out.  He'll be like an employee.  And he'll have millions of millions of dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Kevin.  Well, he won't have as many as, of course, the other number we have by Kevin is 60 million,  which is how much Businessweek said famously that he was worth.  So that's one set of numbers.  Then we have 6.25 million, which is the amount that Facebookers invested in Jim Gilliam's  company, Nation Builder, which is kind of cool.  He's the guy who did the great video, The Internet is My Religion, from PDF.  Good for him.  I like that.  And then we have 70% in an American Express survey say that they use social media to get  customer service.  Now, the irony of this to me is I went on social media to complain about American Express,  and they ignored me.  And I don't use my green card anymore.  I've been a member since I don't know when.  I don't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you are still in the AARP, right?  Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the camera that makes the hair look gray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not complaining.  The grocery store across the street every Thursday, 10% off if you're over 55.  I tell you, taking a senior discount for the first time, which I did last week or a couple  weeks ago, is both simultaneously delightful and depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Depends on what you get.  Did you get the X-Lax or the Metamucil?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Depends.  Depends.  Lamar, did you, in this, we gave you some time now, did you come up with a tool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't, but I do have like a mini rant.  Okay.  Oh, let's hear it.  We like that.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to do it in full Lamarism here, Lamar.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you want to talk about the Twitter story where they were considering buying the App  Camera Plus.  And so I had like a rant prepared for that.  I don't understand all these different tools that we have for pictures.  Like Instagram is a social network just for pictures and Camera Plus and you have all  these other ones.  What happened to just using the good old fashioned apps that are built into the phone, the regular  camera, like when I take a picture of my iPhone, it goes to Google Plus, which is where I want  to store all of my pictures.  And I just, and if I want to send it to Twitter, it goes to Twitter's, which uses a photo bucket.  So Facebook has their own.  So I just never like got into Instagram or all these extra features when the phones or  these services that we use have their own features.  So my rant is use Google Plus.  Use the photos.  It's free.  It stores it.  Why are we using, why are we creating other networks when we have stuff that's already  available?  And that's my, that's my right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That segue so nicely to my tool of the week.  Does it?  Pinstagram.  Oh no.  Combine Instagram.  I'm leaving.  With your Pinterest account.  The two together.  No Lamar, it's really great.  Look at this.  Pinstagram.  It's even got skeuomorphic leather stitching like we all love.  So now I don't have to go to Instagram or Pinterest.  I get both in a single page.  Pinstagram.co.  Hey, you got Pinterest in my Instagram.  You got Instagram in my Pinterest.  Two great tastes in one.  All right, ladies and gentlemen, on that note, that was the rant and the anti-rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was a, that was a really a perfect segue.  It was.  It really was.  I had no idea what was going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did that to you on purpose.  I set you up and then I knocked you down.  Go to Wilson Tech One.  He's at Wilson Tech One on Twitter.  He's also, of course, youtube.com slash Wilson Tech One and making silly faces.  Look at that.  Oh, hey baby.  Oh baby.  Oh baby.  Is this the new, is this the Barry White Lamar Wilson that we've been waiting for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was based on that stupid hot problems video.  I was trying to be a hot tech guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah baby.  What a guy like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, that is chest hair.  That is not a disease.  Everybody, everybody in the comments.  What do you got, measles?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I second that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, Barry White never dressed in white, according to Logan 5.  Really?  Just so you know.  I don't know why.  If that's true or not, it's just a great, it's good.  It's like one of those false facts.  I have to answer Reddit about that.
