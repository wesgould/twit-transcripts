It's time for Twig This Week in Google, the show where we cover the latest news from anything we want to talk about.  Ron Amadio is joining us from Ars Technica. Great to see you, Ron.  I just want you to have permission to talk about anything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, cool.  But we're gonna talk...  Lotus is not going to give me that permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no. Jeff Jarvis does not have permission to talk about anything.  No, I don't.  No, of course you do.  It's BuzzMachine dot com Jarvis. That's his blog.  He's also, of course, a great writer and professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  In the graduate school there. Nice to see you, Jeff.  Always good to see you, boss.  And from Austin, Texas. We missed her last week.  Stacy Higginbotham.  I was here last week.  You were here, but you weren't in the room with us.  If you had only been in the room with us, I would have remembered you.  Wow.  No, no, I remember you. It was just, you know, it was so nice because we had Jason and we had Jeff and I just felt like, oh, gosh.  He's saying we missed having you there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Keep taking, keep taking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get away with nothing with Stacy. She knows exactly what I'm thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, none of us does. None of us does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you want to buy a $5,000 jam board?  And oh, by the way, you need to buy a $1,600 stand.  And if you want to use it, you have to pay $600 a year for service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, but that's the CTO's problem. That's fine.  I want one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want one for the school.  Yeah, so this is a this is a new whiteboard from Google that they announced some time ago, but it is now available as of today available.  It is competing directly with Microsoft Surface Hub, which is also a giant screen whiteboard.  But there are also a lot of, you know, lesser known devices. Schools use these and others.  The difference here is this is really tightly integrated with Google services.  In fact, you have to have a G Suite subscription just to use it.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Jeff will be so thrilled.  Something you can do with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Finally, if I spend $7,500, I get some privilege for having a G Suite account.  Yeah. Thank you very much, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So who wants it? I like the big, by the way, the big crayon pencils it comes with.  And that thing on the right is an eraser. It's very Fisher Price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, yes, yes. That's what I was thinking.  I'm like, oh, it's like that's like my daughter's easel from when she was like three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think this is Google trying to make this friendly, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's also accessible design. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The cool thing about it is it's like fully like Google doxified where like you can have mirrors of it open and everyone can see what everyone else is doing in real time.  So like if you don't want to walk up to the board and draw on it, you will have a copy of the board on your tablet and you can like draw on it with your finger.  And everybody everywhere gets like a mirrored version of of the jam board, whether you're in the room or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. If you're sitting there with a Chromebook, you can throw stuff up on the board. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. It looks like, you know, it's because it's like totally vertically integrated because Google hardware and Google software, you can get all sorts of fun little tricks like that.  That that actually work, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, we were playing this video earlier and Paul Therotte said, you know, there's something about video when you draw on something that Microsoft said the same problem with their surface stuff.  There seems to be more latency than there is.  So I don't know how much latency there is.  But Google says, oh, no, it's very direct drive when you're when you're writing on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I finger racing finger finger drawing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or big fat pencil drive. Oh, look, it turned into a circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I wonder. Use that auto. I wonder if it's autodoodle. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if they're going to use autodraw. I bet it is. Yeah. Yeah. Here we're going to see it. Yeah.  No. Is that a baseball mitt? It's a turkey. I don't know what it is.  It's a shell. Cover that bad drawing with a real shell.  OK. And yeah, I mean, I suppose for a corporate device, this is your boardroom device that that's probably a good price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Five thousand dollars. Yes. These are real boardroom looking people.  It actually looks more like SMB kind of thing. You would you would still pay for this.  I mean, it's cheap for corporate boards. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So designers, too, right. These people are hip.  I think we should make Trish truly media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cond√© Nast headquarters. Yeah. Yes. They love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This boardroom stuff. Yeah. All boardrooms have this stuff.  Now, somebody was telling me that one of the things Microsoft's surface hub does that this doesn't that should do there.  Microsoft's a little bit more cognizant of what corporations need.  For instance, when you walk out of the room, the surface hub erases itself immediately so that you can steal your brilliant ideas.  Things like that. I don't know.  So it's you can get in Carmine Red, Cobalt Blue or Graphite Gray.  Of course, everybody's going to buy the red.  Blue. Blue is the best color. Blue is the best color.  What are you in grade school? Blue is the best color.  Red. Everybody knows red is the best color. Anyway, I was going to go with boring executive gray.  Yeah. Well, you can. You can have your own five thousand dollars wall mount included.  But if you want that rolling stand and really, I think that's the fun thing is you roll it around.  That's another twelve hundred bucks. They are giving out deals.  What they don't mention here, I wish they would.  Maybe I have to click through is that there is a yearly fee.  They're given a deal on the yearly fee. It's only three hundred dollars.  So you get a management support fee if you buy it right now.  But eventually it'll be six hundred dollars. Fifty bucks a month.  What do you get for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you get the Google G Suite apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's a management and support fee. I don't know. They're not clear about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe they're concerned about them breaking down and they want to make sure the overheads in place for a long period of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At the World Trade Center, they have TVs in every meeting room and they're pretty much useless.  If they ran some kind of software and were touchscreen, that would be at least a little bit better than these giant screens they mount on the wall because they look good.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like a smart board. It's like any other kind of board. You draw on it. You can save it. You can print it. Other people can share it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can show video and things on it, right? You do video conferencing.  Video conferencing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, they show video conferencing so you can do that. But I don't think you can just play YouTube videos. I don't think it's like a real operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really? But you said you could throw things up in your Chromebook. You throw up a video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can Chromecast.  Googlecast.  Is that a classroom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you can Googlecast. You're right. Built-in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, HDMI and Googlecast.  So you could, but I don't know if you could, I don't know. I guess I have to buy one and find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can always donate it when you're done to a great school.  To a school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  University like mine.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, use it as one of the TVs next to you and then you can draw rabbit ears on people and mustaches.  Oh my gosh! Yes!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can kind of do that now because I've got a Surface Studio so I can, you know, I have the ability to telestrate on my screen, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh nice.  Brons on to something here. You can start drawing on our screen.  I would like to draw on your face though, yeah.  I already have a mustache.  No, I put devil horns.  It could be colorful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but I'm not, I mean this is similar really. It's a little smaller but this is kind of the same idea. I can guess full windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It would jamboard your desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think it's designed to be your desk.  It's designed to be on the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the surface table. That'll be your desk.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  We've probably spent more time than this deserves but I just...  That's true.  I'm gadget freaks. We want it. We want it.  It's pretty cool. I kind of would like to have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I applied for beta on it and never heard back.  I did too, yeah.  Yeah, same here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so there you go.  Did you guys hear back?  No.  And now you can all buy it.  That's pretty rude, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do have an apps account after all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We use a chalkboard. In fact, I've always on TV use a chalkboard because I like it because it's so low tech that I like the idea of having a green chalkboard in chalk and I make all our hosts draw on it.  This is more like, oh, obviously you're going to have a smart board. No, I want to be low tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a whiteboard so...  Whiteboard's good.  I'll check with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whiteboard's not great for TV because it's so bright and that's why I don't know if we could actually use the jam board on TV.  We always had trouble shooting smart boards.  But that was a long time.  And Jeff.  And Jeff. Yeah, he's too white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, that's right. I am a human whiteboard draw on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube's virtual reality platform is adding shared rooms that will let people view 360 degree video together.  This is part of Daydream VR.  Actually, you know, this is like Spaceys.  Spaceys, Facebook showed this at their developer conference.  Google has now and they didn't.  I don't know if they showed this at the VR talk at Google I.O.  I don't think so.  No, they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that reminds me of turntable FM.  Those little people. Do you remember being there?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you'd go in and you'd play your music and then people would applaud in the audience.  It looks just like that, doesn't it?  Share a three-dimensional.  I'm not sure I get this.  You can also you can customize your human looking avatar.  They'll speak out loud in real time.  So it's kind of like avatar chat, which we used to use back in 1998 on tech TV.  Voice will be the way people express themselves in VR, says YouTube product lead Aaron Teague.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of people feel really alone.  Go ahead.  You know, you go these 360 video things are like the worst because they're they take away all of like the directors cinematography and everything like you have no idea where to look.  So I just sit there and like spin constantly when I'm in these things because I'm always worried about like what am I missing?  What's happening behind me?  It's way nicer to to just have like a real regular video in front of you.  I don't I never get it.  And they always need to be like ridiculously high resolution.  And it's just they're just weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that FOMO for VR, VR 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, basically, we're sometime around now.  I remember Second Life was supposed to release a 360 degree VR version of Second Life called Sansar.  Second Life needs a Second Life.  It would be Third Life, but it's not out yet.  But it was supposed to come out right around now.  Do you know any?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tell me, Leo, you're not stolen Second Life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I have by the way, though, I love my name in Second Life.  Prune Face spatula.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they when if you remember, you couldn't just pick your name like be Leo Laporte.  You had to pick from like a menu of first and last names.  And I think that was the auto generated one.  And I liked it so much.  I just said, well, I'll keep that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can call you spoon faith or prune face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Prune face. Call me prune face.  Well, wasn't he a Batman villain?  Dick Tracy.  Or it was it was a Dick Tracy villain.  Yeah, it was. All right.  Yeah.  You really are old.  I was like, wow.  Back in the big war and the Great War, we used to read Dick Tracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was one of my first EW covers.  Dick Tracy movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, with Warren Beatty and Madonna.  Madonna.  That's where they kind of that little thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everyone had a thing with Warren Beatty.  That was his thing.  Oh, with Madonna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There wasn't anything special about that either.  Let's talk about I know what you want to talk about, Ron Amatio.  One of the things that was big at Google I.O.  or many new things, but all incremental improvements.  But self-driving cars.  In fact, there is some self-driving car news.  Ford has fired its three year CEO, Mark Hurd, and replaced.  Field.  Field.  Mark Hurd was the H.P.  CEO.  I confused it to and replaced him with the head of Jim Hackett, the head of their Ford's  autonomous car vehicle project.  Although even though he's the head of the autonomous vehicle project, he came from steel case.  He's a Mr.  Fix it.  Which was an office.  It doesn't.  Don't they make those big file cabinets in the offices?  Steel case and metal.  Chairs on wheels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chairs and cubicles.  So it wasn't exactly a high tech company.  Steel case is actually very high tech.  Believe it or so.  Steel case has been very forward looking in how to embed technology into its products for  productivity and workers.  They have a really smart lab group.  So I know it's a surprise.  Because we are doing one of our things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey, those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're doing our I.O.T.  conference.  We're doing one from steel case.  Oh, OK.  Slated to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Smart.  He's also a turnaround guy, though, right?  Yeah.  It's interesting because, you know, we got to spend a lot of time with Ford's previous  CEO, Alan Mullally, who I had huge respect for and who really took Ford from a struggling  company.  They never took money from the federal government.  The other big other members of the big three did.  Ford really improved quality.  Yeah.  And then this guy comes along in three years and Ford's, you know, moving back to Mexico  and it's all sorts of troubles.  Where did Mullally go?  Well, he was I think he just retired.  There were I think there was a rumor that he was going to serve in Trump's cabinet.  I don't I don't know if he pulled himself out of consideration, but I only heard the  rumor briefly.  I don't know what he does right now.  Former president and CEO of Ford, he retired in 2014.  He was at Boeing where he had really done some amazing things at Boeing.  They're really smart guy.  I guess, you know, I guess he's just living life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Google board of directors.  That sounds.  Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's on the Google board.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Very smart guy.  And who and who did a great job.  And I guess his successor, not so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you think it pays to be on the Google board of directors?  Oh, it should be in their 14.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what they said.  Is it the 14 a 14?  What is your it's in your definitive proxy statement issued once a year.  Yeah, they're K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let me just see.  I want to know what the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ninety thousand to three hundred seventy nine thousand.  That's what I would have guessed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a big range.  I want to get six figures, but yeah, it's good money if you can get it.  You don't work, you know, you don't work, but, you know, a few times a year.  I would I would believe me.  Google, Google.  I'll take it.  They send you a plane.  You can get a ride.  I'll I'll just business class is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll just do a regular.  I'll fly commercial.  I'll do it tomorrow.  Let's see.  Here we go.  We'll work on getting this accounts thing fixed.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, Jeff, I was wondering if maybe it's because a lot of the services Google  provides to free people and to the free customers, involves them.  OK, but you pay for your accounts.  I know. I'm sorry.  It could be that they can't they scan all those emails.  But if you pay for it, they don't actually look inside your emails because  corporations would be obviously mad.  So I wonder if that's one of the challenges they face when trying to divvy that up.  This is just pure speculation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're making excuses for them, Stacey.  I'm not making excuses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just, you know, I mean, I'm sure.  Stacey, let me be angry.  I am also angry.  I have I have accounts and I'm also like, oh, I can't put you together.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Anyway, anyway.  Anywho, Google's.  Google's self-driving unit Waymo is worth, it turns out, Waymo than any of the  other big three.  More than GM, more than Uber, more than Tesla.  How this is this is a story from a couple of days ago based on an analyst from  Morgan Stanley, who said that its value should be around seventy billion dollars.  That's all that's more than a tenth of Alphabet's overall market value.  Do you agree with that, Ronamante?  That seems like a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This does seem like Alphabet's next like good business venture, because this really is  something. Yeah, this really is something that like could change the world.  And Google's been doing it for longer than anyone else.  So, you know, just kind of naturally, they're ahead of everybody else.  I think even who's the turncoat that went to Uber and whatever his name is.  Yeah. He recently admitted that Waymo was like five years ahead of Uber in terms of  technology. And I mean, that that probably lines up with when they started to.  Waymo's just the furthest ahead from everybody and they want to license it to car manufacturers.  And they have a ride sharing trial going on in Arizona now, I think.  And it's it's just something where there's a I think there's a huge market for it.  If you can get it right and plenty of companies will like pay for the technology or you can  start your own ride sharing service.  They just partnered with Lyft, I think, for ride sharing service.  I'm not sure what Lyft is going to contribute to that partnership, but but OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at look at these numbers. This is from Forbes in February.  This is the number of autonomous miles driven.  Waymo has driven 97 percent of all autonomous miles, beating everybody.  Tesla, GM, BMW, Mercedes, Benz, Ford, Nissan, Delphi, Bosch by a long shot.  This is in 2016. And when Uber comes along and thinks, oh, we can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And look how hard it's been.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What this number doesn't include is what they call disengagements, which is when a human  driver has had to take over for the autonomous vehicle.  And Google also leads Waymo also leads in that regard.  By far the fewest disengagements.  Waymo's test drivers have to disengage about once every five thousand miles.  BMW, six hundred thirty eight, Tesla, one hundred and eighty two.  Mercedes Benz once every six hundred.  Oh, I'm sorry. Mercedes Benz had three hundred thirty six disengagements over six hundred seventy three miles.  That's like once every two miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I wonder if my cruise control could could match that.  Just see how straight down the road the car will go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This doesn't include, however, autopilot miles on Teslas, which are two hundred million.  I mean, Teslas have a lot of do have a lot.  Tesla has a lot of data about self-driving cars, but their autopilot isn't really full autonomy.  So it's not under California law. It's not it's not autonomous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, in fact, yeah, lots lots of cars have similar features.  I feel they're pretty close and that gets that gets really hyped up because it's Tesla.  But Waymo has the largest self-driving fleet on earth, or at least they will when they get their Arizona thing up and running.  But I think the big deal about Waymo is that they make their own hardware now.  So it's pretty easy. Well, it's relatively easy to kind of get like a self-driving car project up and running just by going to Velodyne is the company and buying their like out of the box.  Lidar solutions. You see these on Ford cars a lot.  They kind of look like little Coke cans. The new one looks like a hockey puck.  That's like if you if you look at the the Prius, the like first Google self-driving Prius, it had like a big fat like trash can on the roof.  That was a that was another Velodyne sensor where Waymo makes like all their own hardware now.  And as a result pays, it costs them about a tenth what it costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody else who's here's a here's some video.  Spotted by a Mac rumors reader of the Apple Lexus self-driving car.  Apple has a fleet of five or six of these.  And yeah, see that big coffee can on the roof. That's the off the shelf Lidar that you were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't get why they identified this as a as an Apple car.  Yeah, it doesn't say Apple on it. Right.  Right. And why would it and how would you ever know?  And like unless you talk to the people or maybe they saw that leave, maybe they saw leave Apple headquarters.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because this driver was particularly well dressed and on an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they confirmed it with Apple. Oh, that would be called report.  Oh, right. Report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Say anything. Well, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. But you know, it's using the Velodyne 64 channel Lidar as you said, Ron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Seventy five thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. And and but Waymo is making it for what? A tenth, they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's what Google does. I mean, Google builds its own heart.  It figures out how something works, figures out how it can optimize it.  And then boom. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The trash can model is really old, like like a couple of years old.  So it's it's pretty expensive.  Velodyne has smaller, cheaper ones.  But the the channel is what's important.  When they say 64 channels. Yeah.  Like, you know, they show you the self-driving car thing.  They have rings around the car that's like a three scan of the what it's seen is how many rings you get.  And you can make it cheaper by having less channels because like they have robots that they have vacuum cleaners that work on Lidar because they're one channel.  And you can get those for five hundred bucks.  So what really matters is how many channels are you doing per like a dollar?  Because anybody can make them cheaper. It's can you make it cheap and good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Uber has pissed off Pittsburgh, which was this pilot city for its self-driving vehicles.  This article from the Cecilia, Cecilia Kang in the New York Times says Uber has reneged.  They promised free rides in the driverless vehicle.  Well, they're not really driverless. There's a driver.  But in the self-driving cars, no, they started charging for them.  It withdrew support from Pittsburgh's Uber.  Uber is just like it's just a nonstop junk show crap show.  It also withdrew support from Pittsburgh's application for a 50 million dollar federal grant.  It hasn't created the jobs it proposed in the neighborhood that houses its autonomous car testing track.  Pittsburgh's pissed.  In fact, it's an issue in the mayoral primary, which is going on right now.  The one of the one of the candidates, the guy one actually called Uber a stain on the city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, Lord.  Has Uber done anything right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say, did we talk about its oh, my gosh, my brain just oh, it's right.  Route based pricing, route based pricing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, drivers real happy about that now.  No, we haven't. Let's talk about it.  This was a was this discovered or announced?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it was discovered and then and then we were admitted to it and talked about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're basically charging what what it thinks you're willing to pay.  They have a lot of data, right?  And they're not afraid to use it.  This is a story from Bloomberg.  Uber drivers have been complaining that the gap between the fair rider pays and what the driver gets paid is getting wider.  Uber has finally provided an explanation.  According to Bloomberg, it's charging some passengers more because it needs the money.  Yeah.  Didn't you know?  Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's a big money loser.  They're worth almost 70 billion dollars, but they lose money at an almost stunning clip.  The route based pricing charges customers based on what their data model predicts they're willing to pay.  Not like a cab company, which calculates it on mileage and time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And how historically Uber had done it.  What's I think what's really interesting here is we don't know what data factors in.  Uber gave us some examples.  But what about like I think about this in the context of IOT and privacy and how much data we're really giving about ourselves and all sorts of crazy ways.  And I am freaked out by the idea of discriminatory pricing.  Maybe it's just it's reverse.  You'll never get a deal anymore, basically.  And so I'm like, oh, this is exciting and fun.  Amazon does the same thing based on on some of its products based on Amazon has surge pricing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think people know that.  But pricing will change from day to day on stuff, depending on Amazon doesn't even put prices on books in the store, the physical stores they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really? How do you know you're going to because because because you either check on an app on your app or you take it up and scan it.  But because prices change all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't. Paul Thuratt's daughter was at the Amazon store.  Apparently there's one near him in Massachusetts and they won't take cash.  And she's too young to have a credit card, so she couldn't buy anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One day she'll get a chip implanted in her wrist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. What scares me about the Uber pricing thing is that like I mix personal and business on my Uber account because, you know, it's part of my job.  I was in Iowa last weekend and you pretty much have to Uber all around San Francisco.  So because I use it at work and I'm just like, yeah, it's a business expense.  Sure. Whatever. Now when I have to use like Uber back home, it's going to cost me more money.  Yeah, that's thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the examples, Uber's head of product gave Daniel Graff gave Bloomberg.  Somebody traveling from a wealthy neighborhood to another Tony spot might be asked to pay more than a person heading to a poorer part of town.  What? I guess, hey, it's capitalism, right?  They've got the data. The reason cab companies never did it, they just didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is why I'm like, imagine now if they get more data about you.  So let's say they see your data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, he's a doctor. Yeah, he's a doctor. Charge him twice as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Or this person really isn't going to walk or, God help you, this person.  So what's wrong with that?  You know, in a capitalistic society, nothing, but it does signal the end of and this is something that's important for everyone to realize.  Even businesses should have will end up having this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's this is how tax works.  You pay more tax if you're rich. Well, actually you don't.  But in theory, you pay more tax if you're rich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the idea that you'll never get a deal.  The other issue, because people love deals.  They really do. But the other issue is there's a definite power imbalance over who has access and control of your data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He who has the data wins.  We're rapidly approaching that world.  And by the way, who has the most data? Google. Google. Yep. More than anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Followed by Amazon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Amazon has a lot of data, but certainly a commerce data.  But as we've learned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook Facebook Facebook have more data than Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? I think Google gets more data than anybody because they own the phone platform as well as the desktop platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All your curiosities, all your email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They know every day they got you everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Facebook is limited to what you share on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is Amazon. They see no one in Amazon.  I think I'd go with Facebook.  Amazon knows everything you buy if you buy everything at Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you buy everything at Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google will soon know more about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look what Google just announced at their ad conference.  And this is kind of the Holy Grail for advertisers.  Advertisers buy ads on Twitter, for instance.  But what they don't know is, well, we know we give you a tracking code.  So we know if you immediately bought something because you heard an ad on Twitter, that's why we always say, you know, use our offer code twig.  But that doesn't. But if we know Ford used to advertise here, what Ford would love to know is that those ads on Twitter help sell cars at the dealership.  Google says now they will help advertisers by tracking offline credit card use to show that online ads work.  Now, they do say they're anonymizing. They're double anonymizing it.  That's really good. Twice as good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does that mean it takes eight pieces of data or does it take 16?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do. I feel like Google's pretty good at data science.  They understand the problem with anonymizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  However, that doesn't mean they don't necessarily know that we understand it.  And so they can say it's double anonymized.  And to them, that means something. And they're like, that's not very effective.  But to us, we're like, ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They say, quote, Google ad interactions will be done in a secure and privacy safe way and only report on aggregated and anonymized store sales to protect your customer data.  So so this is because they have Android Pay.  Look, they have Android, they have Android Pay.  They have all they have sales receipts that you get emailed.  And by the way, that's more and more the case.  They really. Amazon's not even close.  And Facebook's even farther afield because if people start an Apple, by the way, with Apple Pay might have more information, but they don't have anywhere near the other stuff.  Google's the winner in this one, it seems to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is this is, as you said, it's the Holy Grail.  They've been wanting accountability.  It's still not going to be perfect because you might have seen five ads for cars.  How many how many things did I look at my cars before I finally bought mine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's where cars do you buy with a credit card?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I put five thousand bucks for the for the down payment.  You bet. So I got Niles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, OK. No, I'm just like, wait a second.  Who buys a car? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So bank data, probably privacy there is probably more protected.  Right. But it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In the end, in the end, what you're going back to is you're simply saying that person X who saw this ad bought this thing.  We're not telling you who person X is. We're not telling you what they bought.  We're just saying hello, advertiser. You get extra credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The company says advertisers have measured some five billion store visits through AdWords in the past three years.  Deep learning is helping it predict store visits and historically difficult to measure densely packed places like multi-story malls.  Oh, Tango could help here, couldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you also just have the phone telling you you're there.  Right. You have the location, then you have the payoff of the action made a purchase and you have what ad they saw on what media they say they can track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get this about 70 percent of all credit and debit card transactions in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jesus. Oh, the Germans are just completely freak out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A machine learning is powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It should also freak out Facebook and Amazon, everybody else, because it freaks me out because I can't sell an ad that can give you that kind of information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, exactly. It freaks out media.  That's who is going to mostly freak out is because we can't promise that.  That's a that's a cost per sale ad. Yeah.  And you can sell that. Oh, you can sell that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although a savvy advertiser, I would be quick to point out, will value the unique relationship that a podcaster could bring with its audience.  And you could never get from an AdWord banner ad and the trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. Yes. Yes. Right. That's true.  Well, they could hear it about this so they could hear about something from you. Right.  Oh, Leo said this. Let me Google it and see.  And then, boom, Google claims it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's OK. That's OK. The advertisers know.  You know what I love? My favorite thing is when an advertiser comes to us after a long ad campaign and says, and this happens all the time, you know, it didn't work.  We cancel. And then they come crawling back three months later when they realize their sales have plummeted because it was working.  And then the advertisers just didn't were unable to measure the accountability. Right.  Someday that'll happen.  No, it has happened once or twice.  Google attribution is what they call this.  This is a big deal in the industry. Is it? Big deal.  I thought it was when I read it.  And only Google can do this.  Nobody else can do this.  I mean, Amazon could do it.  Apple has a small. Yeah.  The other companies could do it in a small universe that they operate in.  But can Apple claim to be able to seed 70 percent of all credit card transactions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't want also how many ads does Google see?  So if you just simply are using the Google ad ecosystem, they see most ads.  They know who clicked on that ad, who saw that or who saw that.  Here's the interesting part is it's no longer pay per click.  Right. Paper sales.  So whether you clicked or not doesn't matter so much.  That could change the essence of what ads look like, how they operate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So remember, Google announced this in a forum where the audience was very receptive to advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, this was not in the I.O. keynote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was not at I.O. This was later.  But some of us are looking at this.  This is the slide they put up, Google attribution.  Google attribution takes in data across AdWords, Google Analytics and double click search without any additional tagging.  They don't have to. They know all about you.  Now we're starting. This is what people have been telling me for a long time about Google.  Now we're seeing the fruits of all of this. Right.  For instance, the robots, you know, the capture thing.  I am not a robot. That's disappearing now because they started with just the checkbox.  Now it's completely disappearing because Google knows who you are.  If you're using your computer and your browser, they know exactly who you are and that you're not a robot.  They have enough. They've been collecting enough signals for long enough to know exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you're right. I get it. Sometimes I get a different experience.  I'll turn on incognito. You'll see it.  There I get it. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so that's that's again why I thought I.O. was actually a really good keynote and everyone else was like blah, blah, blah.  Google is mastering context because it's applying machine learning.  So it's applying. Notice one of the things it's looking at is nearby location data to get data about people visiting stores.  Yes. That's contextual information just being thrown from your phone.  I mean, that's it's what we always thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we always thought that the data smog is coming off of you all the time would become more and more valuable with with modeling and artificial intelligence and in deep data.  And now it's just not valuable to you.  We're entering that world. Yeah. Well, but you're giving it off and somebody's make capitalizing on it.  Right. Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, so before we move to another topic. Yeah, I'll do an ad, but go ahead.  I need I need to do a correction first.  Please. So I stupidly Googled, you know, director compensation.  That means people if you're at the director level at Google.  So Alan Mulally, when he was appointed to the board in 2014, he will receive an annual initial initial grant initial grant of one million dollars in Google stock, an annual equity award of three hundred fifty thousand dollars with a seventy five thousand dollar cash retainer and reimbursement of expenses.  Yeah. Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll do it for less. Yeah, really.  Cut it in half.  I'm a bargain.  I know a number of people who serve on boards.  That's a fair, you know, because nobody does just one board.  You do four or five.  You're making a couple of million a year.  It's hardly working.  It's a great gig.  Unfortunately, you have to be a successful CEO first.  I know.  But don't they need more professors and podcasts on boards to represent the real people, the people, the people, the people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think I don't think the professors and media professors represent the people at this moment in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do, Stacey, a lot more than IOT podcasters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am I am not putting myself out there and as a board, although as a woman, I would argue that I could do I could do fairly well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I would actually put you on a board because yes, you represent the distaff side.  Awesome.  All right.  I don't know. Is that I bet you I should probably look up the etymology of that because it's probably incredibly insulting.  You know what, Leo?  It doesn't matter, right?  You just know that I'm going to be that way no matter what.  Is that what you're saying?  Basically, I mean, I'm like, oh, oh, it is incredibly insulting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. I'm like, oh, I'm not going to tell him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a stick or spindle onto which Wooler flax is wound for spinning or of or concerning women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can call me hysterical later and we'll call it it.  We'll call it a draw.  Lord above.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am such an old school fart now.  I didn't I didn't used to be this way.  I used to be liberated and woke.  No, no.  I'm using words like distaff.  Oh, OK.  I didn't mean to refer to you as a stick or spindle into which Wooler flax is wound for spinning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can add it to your list of things you shouldn't call Stacey.  Not say distaff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stacey.  Distaff.  Yes, honey.  Distaff.  And never never refer to opening your kimono.  That is wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or blowing smoke up your skirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's that's very wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about the camel's nose under the tent?  Can you say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's OK.  Ron is like, hey, can we talk about Google now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just teasing you.  I'm just teasing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  Ron Amadeo is here.  Great to have him from ours.  Technically literally the place I go first every day for the best tech reporting out there.  Ron does a great job covering Android.  But all of the ours team is fantastic.  Just hike.  You're the New York Times of tech of tech sites.  Really?  Seriously?  Great stuff.  Yeah, I've always loved ours.  And also with us, it's of course, Jeff Jarvis.  He's not what is the opposite of distaff?  He's the opposite of distaff.  He's on staff.  And Stacey Higginbotham, who is just great and puts up with me.  Forgiving.  And forgiving.  Thank you.  Gracious.  Very gracious.  You're very gracious.  So I learned the other day that I'm a man.  And I have wet earwax.  But it's just a few of the things I learned from 23andMe.  I love 23andMe, an online genetic analysis company that helps you understand your 23 pairs of chromosomes.  That's where the name comes from.  It's your DNA.  You know, I should log in.  Let me log into my 23andMe because I can show you some of the things that I know about myself, my ethnicity.  I found relatives, which is super cool.  I found a second cousin.  Because what they do is they, among other things, they will match you up with other 23andMe.  And you have to give them permission, of course.  You have total control of your privacy.  But they'll match you up with other 23andMe customers who have genes similar enough that they must be related.  And they will say, oh, this person, this is mine.  See, DNA relatives.  This person is probably related to you.  So cool.  So Anthony Jacoby is a second cousin.  And you know what?  I know he is because that's my grandmother's maiden name.  Is that not awesome?  And it's based on.  So all you do, it's very simple.  They can send you a little vial and you spit into it.  I mean, there's no, it's not a blood draw or anything like that.  It's very, very easy to do.  They will give you reports like your ancestry reports.  A lot of people love these.  Yeah.  See, order, spit and discover.  That's the three steps.  Expectorate.  Expectorate.  And by the way, the other thing is I did this a long time ago, maybe a couple of years ago.  But there's always new stuff in here.  For instance, I just am learning now about my maternal, my maternal haplogroup group, which is U5A1B1.  So I can see.  Look at this is so cool.  Migrations of my maternal line.  This is my mom.  You know, this is my mother's side.  I can go back to 180,000 years ago.  We came from central East Africa, migrated up to into into the Middle East and then up and into Europe.  47,000 years ago.  That's from my haplogroup.  That is fascinating.  You can learn more.  It's one of the oldest haplogroups in Europe.  The common ancestor of U5A1 was a woman who likely lived in Europe during the Ice Age, 17,000 years ago.  That's my great, great, great something.  Grandma.  It's not completely uncommon.  About one in 169, 23 and me customers are in the same group.  So is the cheddar man.  I'm very proud to be related to the cheddar man.  This is England's oldest skeleton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, you're you're related to a cheese monger.  This is hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  His maternal haplogroup.  Also U5A1B1.  What?  Anyway, we've got to do this with your kids because the educational part of this is fantastic.  You also get traits.  Things like facial features.  You know, which based, you know, I have a cleft chin, cheap dimples, a unit brow and a widow's peak.  That's right.  Nailed it.  And you can see what earlobe type you have.  All of this from spitting into a little vial.  It's 23 and me.  Seventy five online genetic reports, categories like ancestry, wellness, traits, even health.  You can learn more about who you are.  Oh, you want to know if I have any Neanderthal?  Sure you do.  Do you have any Neanderthal in you?  Would you know that?  Where do I find the Neanderthal?  It's probably in the ancestry report.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The ancestry report is even better now.  Oh, yeah.  The ancestry, the ethnicity of the numbers, how many relatives I have in here.  And then it's breaking down the numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I'm actually a little less Neanderthal than most 23 and me customers.  I'm a little bit more polished and refined.  However, I'm in seventh place out of my family and friends, which is funny.  Yeah, that's what I love about this.  You constantly get new information all the time as we learn more and more about what this means.  There's a carrier status.  23 means carrier status reports meet FDA requirements.  This is what we were talking about.  So you can find out if you're a carrier for certain inherited conditions, things like cystic fibrosis, hereditary hearing loss.  Oh, I don't want to look at that one.  I know I'm losing my hearing.  Understand what makes you you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get over 75 genetic reports and start exploring your DNA today.  23andme.com slash twit.  That's the number 23 and me.  23andme.com slash twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't there a Google connection with 23 and me?  Isn't it?  It's familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's it's it's and just key and what you see.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Ex-wife founded.  No, sister.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ex-wife, ex-wife of Larry and Esther's daughter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Esther's daughter and Susan's sister.  Yes.  The was just all 23 and me report in and of itself because Susan was just he runs YouTube.  Esther's their mom who rented and this is where the connection comes from.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but she rented her garage to Larry and Sergey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  She was the journalism, amazing journalism program at Palo Alto High.  Oh, neat.  She's Esther is just the greatest.  Esther is just wonderful.  I love I love that whole family.  They're amazing.  So I so I also on on 23 me in the research area know now that it has my genes right.  It asked me all these questions like what the latest is when a mosquito bites me.  How big is the oh, that's right.  So I spent like I got I got fascinated with this and I spent like two hours just answering questions.  How often do you wear earplugs to help you get to sleep?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's neat.  No.  Yeah.  By the way, I've just been handed this.  This staff is female Agnet.  A G N A T E Agnet is male, the male version of this staff.  Thank you very much to our research team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And what does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like this stuff means I know spindle spindle and Agnet means some does it have another word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A person descended from the same male ancestors, another specified or implied person, especially through the male line.  See, as usual, guys, we get the great.  Yeah, because we own the world.  You might as well just get used to it.  It's all about us.  Beyonce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but she makes a difference.  But the women can slap our hands away when we get off Air Force One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody perfect.  Oh, wow.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody knows that men are along for the ride.  That is that is women who are in charge and we and we acknowledge that.  Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Let's not let's not go here.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was trying to know what you buy in it.  Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  I know a genetic marker that's going to get Stacy going.  Forty five teraplops tensor flow processors TPU.  Come on, you know, you're you know, you're excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am with this is what this was.  I thought this was super exciting from from Google I.O.  So I was like, everyone's like, no hardware.  I was like, what are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They introduced the awesome thing.  And so can we talk about machine learning and the AlphaGo game?  Because yes, it's going on right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The AlphaGo is currently beating the best Go player in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And for those of you who are like, wait, didn't it already do this?  The cool thing about this version of AlphaGo is they rearchitected it.  So it learned without humans.  So it taught itself using only machine, machine played games.  So that's why this is pretty freaking cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have only the first round went to AlphaGo by the smallest possible margin, half a point.  Although you can't conclude much from that because AlphaGo is designed to just win.  It can win by this.  It doesn't need to win big.  It just wins.  Ke Jie is the considered 19 years old.  He's considered the best.  I know he's Chinese.  He's considered the best Go player in the world.  Now, what's interesting, and I don't have to have to confirm this.  Let me look at the DeepMind channel, see if there's been another game.  Is there a second match already?  I guess not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't hear anything about a second match yesterday.  I thought there was.  I think it's best of five and they're going to do a team games too, which sounds really neat.  But I didn't hear anything about anybody winning or losing last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Traditionally, you know, I'm a chess player.  And of course, we chess players learned that machines were better than us a long time ago.  Gary Kasparov, the world champion, was beaten handily by Deep Blue.  AlphaGo is taking on a much more difficult challenge.  Go has many more variations.  It is a very subtle game.  What's interesting, I don't know if this is true or apocryphal, but I've been told.  I saw a story yesterday that the Chinese government was blocking this stream.  They didn't want anybody in China to know that the best player in the world, a Chinese man, was being beaten by a machine.  I don't know if that's true.  You could see it's just a gripping exhibition.  Just nonstop action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The commentator is pretty cool, though.  It's Michael Redman doing a lot of the commentary.  And he did it for the first round of games.  And even if you know nothing about Go, which I don't, he did a pretty good job of kind of cluing people in about what is special about Go.  What is special about certain moves.  And he'll regularly tally up points and tell you who's winning.  It's fun to watch for a bit, at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I completely agree.  If you were to watch the whole thing, it would be six hours.  They each have three hours to play the game.  And that's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would imagine that Google does a little faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you can see the timer at some point.  And AlphaGo had like two hours left when the other guy had none.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think out of courtesy, purely out of courtesy, AlphaGo is taking one minute a move.  I don't know if it's actually using all that time.  It could be having a cigarette, you know, wandering around drinking some juice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It continuously calculates even when it's not its own turn.  So it's just going on and like crushing possibilities and just on and on and on.  Yeah, you can see two hours left for AlphaGo and 39 minutes left for Kudji or however you say it.  Kudji, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't really, and by the way, you can't underestimate that because time pressure is a killer.  And as you get short on time, you can lose if you run out of time.  So as you get short on time, you just don't have the luxury of spending some time thinking about your move.  The goal of the game is to occupy territory by surrounding the other players pieces.  You play white and black. It is a big board.  There's a lot going on and it's an ancient game with huge amounts of subtlety.  I played it, but it completely defeats me.  I was a pretty good chess player, but Go is another level entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's amazing hearing some of the stuff Redmond says about Go in the last year since AlphaGo started.  It's already changing the game.  Even the guy that was playing AlphaGo changed his play style and was learning from AlphaGo already.  It's amazing how receptive everyone is to the different play style of a computer.  Which is different from chess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The chess community really doesn't like how computers play.  They don't play like a human.  I guess in theory, Go is completely deterministic and calculable.  Chess is much more so. Both are incredibly complex.  But the computer almost feels like a brute force machine when it's playing chess.  And from what I hear these Go players say, AlphaGo is in some way making something beautiful.  There's an aesthetic to what it's doing that is impressing the Go community in a very different way than the chess community.  It reacted to Deep Blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It may be the different ways they were.  Chess was a brute force understanding of the rules.  That's it.  Go is learning from people and creating its own rules than originally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think you can brute force Go.  I think there's too many possibilities. It's too complicated.  So you have to really understand what's going on.  Maybe it is more artistic.  We live in interesting times, don't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, I can play Clue in Gin Rummy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Neither artistically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Lisa always beats me at Gin Rummy.  She has card sense. It's really interesting actually.  She's very good at numbers.  Is she a card counter?  She could probably.  Probably.  But I think it's a gut.  It's really interesting to watch her play because she always wins even though it's a game of luck.  Right?  But she always wins.  And I think she really understands at a deep level what's going on.  I'm paying attention.  It's not Go Fish.  Although I am very good at Go Fish.  Did you read Steve Kovac?  Good to know.  Stay away from me on the Go Fish.  Did you read Steve Kovac's interesting article about ATAP?  Google's advanced technology group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did not get a chance to, but I wanted to.  I had marked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was excited that we're talking about it on the show.  That saves me from reading it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting is it's very much changed how it's run.  As much of, I think much of Alphabet has under the stern gaze of CFO Ruth Porat.  Somebody, Steve quotes somebody involved with ATAP who said, we're not pirates anymore.  We're lowering the flag.  Steve writes, instead of dreaming up far-fetched research and development projects,  the ATAP group now functions more like a product division tasked with shipping market-ready goods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, ATAP announced so many things that never really came to market.  The one thing that made it was Project Tango.  And I think they did the Motorola Spotlight videos where you can hold your phone up.  I love the Spotlight stories.  Oh, that's what they were, the Spotlight stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, right.  Jacquard came out, but I don't know if it's actually for sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's part of the Loom Weave trio.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then the...  No, Weave is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's Brillo, there's Weave, there's Loom, and there's Jacquard.  These are all home automation thingies, right?  No.  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Weave and Brillo, Brillo became Android Things.  Weave is still a protocol, and that is home automation.  But Jacquard was weaving conductive fibers into fabrics.  Oh, that's right.  It was smart-correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was a touchscreen in a jean jacket, basically.  Yeah.  Well, a touch surface, not a screen.  That's dopey.  But other than that, they've had five or six things that they've announced and demoed and never became projects, or never became products.  They have the little, like a radar, a tiny radar sensor that can live on your wrist,  and you're supposed to be able to, like, gesture above a smartwatch.  Oh, yeah.  What else?  There was Project Vault, which was like a little micro SD card with a tiny computer on it that would have, like, its own secure storage that you could control access to.  There was Project Abacus, which used, like, the camera and location and your typing style and all sorts of stuff to, like, identify the user.  So, like, rather than a fingerprint, this would blaze up all of your phone sensors and use everything possible to try and identify you, which sounds like huge battery drain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but you wouldn't have to put your, do a fingerprint because you would be authenticated just by using the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, like continuous authentication.  Yeah.  But actually launching this stuff hasn't really happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember Project Aura?  Everybody loved this.  I thought it was dopey.  Yeah.  Yeah, I thought it was dopey.  You did think it was dopey, yes.  Yeah.  Rick Osterloh killed that.  So Rick now is the man not in charge of ATAP, but the boss of the person in charge of ATAP.  Rick, of course, he's in charge of all hardware.  And, of course, he came.  Rick, where's my new Chromebook?  He came from Motorola, where he was very good, I think.  Did a good job with the Moto X.  But he killed Aura.  He said, no.  Maybe, maybe they're going to.  Yeah, where is your new Chromebook?  You're going to get the Samsung Plus Pro?  I returned the Plus.  Yeah, the Pro is coming out now.  It was pokey.  The Pro is coming out tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I remember you said the Pro is not going to be that much faster.  Well, that's my guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it might be.  It's an Intel chip instead of an ARM chip.  That's the big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was on a set, Margie, to be a little faster, but they need to get the software in order.  And it's still going to launch with the software being beta and still not released.  You're talking about the Android Store, the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, I mean, yeah, so it still doesn't seem that great.  They're still working on all of that.  Apparently, getting Android up and running on Chromebooks is very hard.  Yes.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently, among things, Steve did some great reporting.  Steve Kovac did some great reporting.  Among things that they're working on right now at ATAP, they did mention the Jacquard  jacket that Levi's is doing.  That was their first real standalone project.  Supposed to launch this spring, but they hope it'll get out by the fall.  They're also working on a handheld device based on the concept of effective computing  as an affect, as an emotion, a discipline focused on creating gadgets that can  interpret and respond to human emotions.  Uh-huh.  One source referred to the project as similar to a smartphone but without a screen.  These are crazy ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're not necessarily good ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, Freescale had a series of sensors that they could use in a software  package that ran on top of them that let you, that could tell the emotions of people  like from their phones.  Sounds like Microsoft Bob.  I see you're crying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would you like me to write a suicide note for you?  That'd be useful.  Or Facebook's sentiment analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you want to talk about that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Holy cow.  Let's take a break because this one, this is going to get me angry, but we will have  that in the moment.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  You don't get a Leo rant very often.  There's two rantable subjects today, net neutrality and this Facebook study.  I'll let Stacey take that one.  Stacey Higabotham is here.  Her podcast, Stacey on IoT, is with Kevin Toffle.  You can find it at iotpodcast.com.  She also does newsletters and is on the Twitter at gig with Stacey.  Ron Amadio from Ars Technica where he covers Android.  And I bet you get to cover anything you want because you're just the greatest.  Yes, we should still talk about Cardstuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just covered that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're not done with Cardstuff and he's got more to say about that.  Good.  And of course, Jeff Jarvis, we didn't expect you today.  You got home early?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I was always supposed to be in here.  I think actually, oh no, I know what happened.  I was going to be in Ukraine right now, but I didn't go.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a Crimea.  True.  You know why I'm a little feisty today?  I got a good night's sleep on my Casper mattress.  That's why you cannot downplay the...  How about that?  The master.  You are the master.  You cannot downplay the importance of a good night's sleep.  I think we know now that that is a big part of overall health, right?  Not only you just feel bad if you didn't get a good night's sleep,  but really it can affect your physical health.  It can make you sick.  So get a great mattress, a mattress obsessively designed and made in the United States by Casper,  made of supportive memory phones for a sleep surface that's just the right sink  and just the right bounce.  I don't know.  It's kind of magical because you want a little give where your bony parts are,  but at the same time you want support for your back.  It does both.  And because it's breathable, it sleeps cool.  You do not want a hot night's sleep.  You want a cool night's sleep.  And regulating your temperature tonight.  Science is showing, scientists are showing a lot of research  that that is a big part of overall sleep hygiene.  A Casper mattress is going to last a long time.  It's going to give you the support you want.  There's no springs.  That means no lumps, just comfort.  And you can buy it online easily and risk free.  Because I know what you're thinking.  You're saying, but if I buy online, how do I try before I buy?  Well, I'll tell you, everybody knows trying a mattress in a mattress store is not any way to try anything.  So get the Casper mattress.  It comes in this great compact little box.  You open it up and smells fresh and clean, comfortable as can be.  And then get this.  You have a hundred nights to try it.  A hundred nights.  If at any time, delivery is free.  And if at any time during the hundred day period you say, I don't like it,  they will come and get it and refund you every penny.  You can't beat that.  Free shipping and free returns in the US and Canada.  Get your Casper mattress today.  Really affordable because they eliminate the middleman.  It makes it easy.

Can I play one more game of Candy Crush?  But no.  No, you won't do that because your mattress is so, so, so comfortable.  You say I can't wait to go to bed tonight.  Oh, it feels so good.  Casper.com slash twig.  And don't forget that offer code twig for $50 off.  Rana Matio, what did you write about?  What did you do this time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I spent the last like year probably looking at car infotainment systems.  So this is like the screens that are built into your car dashboard.  And just kind of like the general mess of the industry there.  Yeah.  I feel like it's a lot like the smartphone market when it first started where you have these companies that weren't making computers suddenly have suddenly find themselves like having to make computers.  And they're not like super great at it.  So the question is when will like the real software companies move in and start making car software?  And Google actually announced that at Google I.O. this week where they showed off Android Automotive, which is an operating system.  Oh, this is not Android Auto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not the your phone interface on a screen.  This is your phone running the car.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Android Auto runs on your smartphone and uses the car screen as like an external touchscreen monitor.  Basically, where this is this is exactly a copy of the phone model where Google sells their whatever licenses the software to OEMs and they integrate it into their hardware.  And in this case, the hardware is a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So a lot of cars use QNX, which is owned by Blackberry.  Yeah.  Ford used Microsoft Car for a long time for its Ford SYNC and Ford Touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they switch to QNX with SYNC 3.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is so this competes with QNX then?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But also in the car market, some companies use Linux, which is almost always terrible because you have to do a lot of work to make Linux be good in a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there and as you say, they're not good at software.  They're car companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  And then some cars right now use Android.  And this is companies like Honda and Hyundai.  And this shows exactly why Google needs to be involved because Honda in their 2017 car ships Android 4.2.  But they use it.  In other words, they use it like, say, Amazon uses it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They use AOSP as the base for their car software, which they make themselves.  But, you know, that's I'm not surprised to hear that's Kit Kat.  I'm not surprised because what is the what is the development cycle for for cars?  It's years.  Yes.  Five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everything takes five years.  And I looked at these cars like they were computers, which car journalists usually don't do.  So I like figured out what SoC was in them and what software they ran and stuff like that.  And, yeah, everything is three years old.  Like these are all Tigra three Nvidia processors from 2011.  And it's almost like universally three year old or five year old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's good reason for that.  For one, they've got to certify it.  But two, you can't just put a you wouldn't just put an Android device in a car.  There's security issues, safety issues.  There's distract driver distraction issues.  This is non-trivial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, you can talk about security issues, but Honda also ships a web browser from 2011.  Like the AOSP web browser.  And I was trying it and like it won't even render like ours, Technica, because it's so old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Please don't put a browser in a car for any reason anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Hyundai's worse.  They ship Android 2.3 Gingerbread.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  But these are, I presume, heavily patched, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're heavily modified.  I don't think they're patched.  I mean, the web browser is from 2011.  Like it's not up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't update that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you could have all kinds of security issues with that.  So who's going to use Android Automotive?  It's Audi and Volvo.  And yeah, the big deal about Google being involved is that number one, you get up to date Android software.  These were all running Android 7.0 and they're going to be upgraded to Android 0 before release.  And then the other thing is you get Google Apps.  Like all of these cars had Google Maps on board, which is amazing because everybody's building infotainment system is horrible.  That was that was the other takeaway.  Like none of the car companies really want to do Internet driven maps.  So what you end up with is totally local stuff, usually from here maps, which used to be owned by Nokia and is now owned by Audi and BMW and somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My old Audi, my my 20, I want to say 13 Audi, maybe it's older than that, had Google Earth as the but the met with.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those were the ones with the.  Did you have a digital gauge and then have like a screen directly where the speedometer usually is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this was on the side.  The Audi 8.  Yeah, I like it.  I like what Audi's done.  And now the test, my Tesla has, I don't know what Google Maps.  Because it has satellite imagery as well as street energy from Google Maps, but I'm not clear whether it gets its nav.  So you can have the map and then there's something that does the turn by turn, which could be Google or could be third party.  And then there's something that's points of interest.  And then does it get updated or not is another matter.  So it's complicated, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Tesla is another Linux based one.  It uses Google Maps, but it seems it's not the same as Google Maps on your phone.  Like it's like it's old.  It doesn't seem like it gets live traffic because it's different than your phone.  Maybe it's delayed live traffic and the directions are different.  Like everything's different.  If you just hold up a phone and compare, everything's different between Google Maps on a Tesla and on a phone.  Probably because they don't want to use that much Internet data.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they build LTE into the car as did Audi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you don't pay money for it a month?  Tesla you don't.  Audi I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Audi you get like a year free, but then you pay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Tesla probably doesn't want to use a ton of data because they're paying for that.  Right.  But the official like Google blessed Android software had like real Google Maps.  Like it's very heavily based on Android Auto, but kind of expanded to be a full operating system.  So you get Google Maps, you get all of the Android Auto apps, which is another huge problem with cars today.  Like there's no app platform that runs across cars.  Like I remember in the days before Android, Larry Page complained or like Google to do their mobile apps needed to have like drawers full of cell phones in order to maintain these.  And if you want the car version of that, Pandora has a page called Pandora in your car where they list 33 separate apps.  Oh God.  And I assume to maintain that.  They have a garage full of cars that they can dig through.  And while a company like Pandora can do that, your standard like small time app developer cannot afford to buy 33 different vehicles because everybody runs their own software and it's just a huge mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Will this fix it?  Will Android Automotive make this better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  It's the Android Auto app platform which limits you to audio apps.  So like music and podcasts and stuff like that and messages.  And that's all you're allowed to do for safety reasons.  The Google makes the UI and app developers just plug into the UI.  So like every single audio app looks exactly the same.  That's what you want.  That's what Pandora wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what Spotify wants, I presume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what's really cool about Android Auto is that the car manufacturers skin Android, but they also skin the app templates.  So Spotify on the Volvo looks totally different than Spotify on the Audi.  And it's the exact same app.  But the thing they plugged into was skinned so that it looks like a perfect part of the infotainment system.  It looked great.  It was really cool looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Jeff, this resonates with him because you spent like two years looking for an Android Auto car.  I gave up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I gave up.  And part of the problem was that when I played with Android Auto on the phone, it was so limiting.  It was so nanny-ish.  I wasn't that crazy, but I never got the full experience.  And trying to find a car that had Android Auto and had what else I needed just didn't exist.  I also was being picky in lots of ways.  I needed four-wheel drive for two days a year in New Jersey.  I did not want to pay for premium gas, so no car with a turbo, which took out a lot of them.  And I ended up with a Mazda CX-5.  I like the car very much.  The UI sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it have Android Auto?  No, nothing like that.  But look at this.  So this is Ron's picture from...  Was this a show that you went to?  This was I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, this is on I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is Spotify on Audi?  Yeah, that's the Audi.  And this is Spotify Volvo.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exact same app, same code.  Developer doesn't have to do anything.  This just happens automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is Volvo.  You call it their accordion interface, which is kind of a weird, funky interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the Volvo thing is very interesting because it looks exactly the way Volvo looks today.  They just ripped out the underlying operating system and used Android.  So from the consumer perspective, the difference is mostly going to be your software runs faster because it was made by a real software company.  And you'll have a couple more apps, at least.  I like it that you got Audible on here, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good to me.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The big problem with Android Auto is there's still not that many Android Auto apps, even like some really big media apps don't have Android Auto apps.  And that makes it tough when you're stuck using Android Auto and it locks your phone out and everything else.  But hopefully more developers will kind of get on board now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So which do you think will be the best on board entertainment system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right now, everything based on QNX was the nicest, which is like Audi and BMW and some other stuff.  Just because QNX runs like a smartphone operating system in that it can do an animation and it will run at a decent frame rate instead of the janky, stuttery mess that Linux usually is and all the old.  Like the five-year-old Android that they had in these cars ran like a five-year-old Android device.  It was really bad.  Yeah, that's depressing.  So yeah, anything QNX ran really nice.  And my favorite thing was the Audi because they took the dashboard.  Like they took the digital gauge cluster and stuck the map in it.  So you had the infotainment system directly in front of the driver rather than like off to the side in the center of the car.  And that's something I hope more companies do.  Yeah, this is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, Tesla does a pretty nice job of it, I think.  Yeah.  This is Audi.  So you can see the dashboard.  So that does not run Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's a problem right now with the Android setup is that for safety reasons, those have to run a real-time operating system like QNX.  Like your speedometer is not allowed to lag because you're downloading a software update.  So they were investigating ways to kind of project a map or whatever else they needed into that, which is usually a separate computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So why is an Android automotive real-time operating system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because it's Linux and Android is not.  And that's a big mess.  It's just too slow.  There is a way to converge those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you want some.  So it's called.  Well, I think this would be a solution.  It's happening because this is a big problem in the industrial IoT.  But it's is it TSN time sensitive networking?  So it's a protocol that is an attempt to bridge old proprietary messaging systems.  But you can also have an RTOS that's running on another computer somewhere and message using something that works with that over to Ethernet.  So in the automotive guys are actually really interested in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there you go.  And Google does have a real time OS under development.  That's that's fuchsia.  But fuchsia.  We don't have to get into that.  But that explains why they're doing fuchsia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That explains why they're doing it.  Yeah.  There's been a lot of questions.  What do you need with a third operating system that explains it?  How far along is fuchsia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's been in development for a year and a half.  So if you follow Android's development, that took about five years.  So give them about three and a half years and we'll see.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fuchsia is based on a microkernel called magenta that's derived from little kernel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's all Google developed like it's a Google developed kernel with Google developed operating system running a Google developed programming language.  So they're just kicking everybody out the door and they're not going to deal with any upstream stuff.  And it's all Google Google Google.  And nobody really knows what they're going to do with it.  They have a smartphone like demo concept UI that you can download.  But other than that, who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're talking to the guy who wrote the book on fuchsia, by the way.  So we got the fuchsia expert here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's I think it's really overhyped just because it's so not finished.  And like if you look at what Android looked at when they released their first emulator, that was back when it was a BlackBerry clone.  And like imagine if before the G1 came out, you spent all this time, you know, theorizing about the BlackBerry Android clone and what it did and how it worked and all that.  Like it's it's so early right now that I am not too worried about fuchsia.  Like I'll peek at it once in a while.  But it's it does seem like a replacement for Android eventually one day like they say it's run on smartphones.  They say it's designed to run on a modern smartphone and on a modern desktop computer.  But like all projects inside of Google, they run multiple competing things at once.  It has nothing to do with the Android team.  I don't think it's going to merge with Android or anything.  They do these competing projects and some of them die and future could easily die and never see the light of day.  It's it's something that like I said, it's it's like three years out.  So just relax and and don't get don't get too hyped up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's still open source, though, which is great.  BSD 3 MIT and Apache 2 licenses, not GPL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But yeah, they get rid of the GPL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's interesting. Yeah.  Although these other licenses are highly respected in the open source community.  So it's not that's I mean, at least they're doing an open source operating system.  I think they understand how to do that.  But yeah, it takes a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think if you want to like read the tea leaves on Flutter on Fuchsia, the thing to look out for is Flutter, which is Google's SDK for Fuchsia.  Like Fuchsia should probably be called Flutter OS.  So Flutter is an SDK that you program in with the programming language Dart that Google invented.  There's so many code names for this stuff.  It's ridiculous.  But Flutter apps run on Android, iOS and Fuchsia.  So if you see Google push developers to use Flutter, then that is the transition point to Fuchsia because they're telling people when you hear the word Flutter, that means write a Fuchsia app.  And you can do that today and it will run on Android and iOS.  And in the future, if they ever release this operating system, it'll run on that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Stacey will like this.  The system UI for Fuchsia is called Armadillo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, they have a lovely little drawing there.  That is that that guy is definitely on the art team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Spent some time doing that in a big ballpoint pen.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And now Google Draw can turn into a real Armadillo like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because it runs on Android, you can download Armadillo and get it up and running on your phone, which is where I got the screenshots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very bare bones.  They got a long way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Obviously, it doesn't even work like nothing works at all.  None of the sliders work.  The buttons don't really work.  The multi window thing is crazy.  Like you can just drag apps on top of each other and it'll do a multi window split.  And then you can just keep going until it crashes and you have like eight multi window splits where it's like, you know, horizontal and vertical lines and tiny little columns and everything's this big.  So it seems powerful.  It's just nowhere near finished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's I mean, it takes a long time to do an OS.  These are not.  These are non-trivial things.  Do you know how many people are working on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not a bunch like double digit numbers.  Last I checked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, that's a lot.  You can't get too big.  You can't, you know, as we know from the Mythical Man month, you can't just throw programmers at it and solve it.  It just takes that long.  Thank you for explaining that, Ron.  I've been wondering what Fuchsia was all about for a long time.  We have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we even I think we even referenced him when we talked about it last time.  We did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  We should ask Ron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should get Ron on.  That's probably why you're here.  Why aren't why is how come Android is still taking so long to get on Chromebooks and not?  Ron can explain that too.  Can you explain that, Ron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, on the pro on the Chromebook Pro, that's Intel based and that's a little harder than the ARM based plus the Samsung Chromebook plus.  So still in beta on the pro.  Yeah.  Well, like I was saying, it's still not done.  Like they I think they just got it up and running on Android 7.0 Nougat.  But it still doesn't do things like take advantage of the multi window API.  So like apps aren't resizable.  Yeah, that's really ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've played with that on my Chromebook.  It just looks like you got a phone app in portrait mode on your screen.  It just doesn't.  It's as bad as the Google the Android tablet experience was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a ton of bugs right now.  It seems to be a lot better now than it was when Chromebook Pro review units went out in February.  But they're trying to like it make Android run on top of Chrome OS in a container thing.  And it's just really complicated.  And it was never supposed to be easy.  And it's just taking way longer than they expect, really.  And that's why you see I think why you see the Chromebook Pro get delayed.  They're all just waiting for the software to be finished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Paul Therotte had a good article about about all of this and why it's taken so long.  Do we know why?  So apparently all Chromebooks that are sold this year will have eventually have access to the Play Store.  But it seems a kind of mystery which ones don't.  For instance, why the Pixel 1 will not and the Pixel 2 will.  Both have touch. Both are very powerful machines with lots of RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't it that the Pixel is end of life?  Is that it? It's just not going to spend any energy on it?  Yeah, it's just not supported.  OK.  It probably matters what version of Linux you use and what underlying software is there.  And they probably just want to kill the old Pixel because probably no one uses it.  I imagine they sold a very small amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know who uses it? Jason Howell uses it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I saw him with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's the last man standing.  So what should Jeff do?  Because he wants a Chromebook.  But I was saying wait for the ASUS C302A that has the i7 and the 16 gigs of RAM.  No pen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know the specs for the Chromebook Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You talked about it on ours, I thought. You didn't look at it?  It comes out in three or four days.  Yeah, that would be cool to play with.  I love the Chromebook Plus. Jeff got it on my recommendation, I'm sorry, and didn't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, the Pro was a Core M3.  Right.  What was the ASUS one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They said they were going to have, I think, I don't know if it would be a mobile part, probably would be an i5 or an i7.  But nobody's seen hide or hair of it.  I mean, they announced it so long ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, all of those are the same.  C320?  C302.  Because the software is not done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's two in one, very similar to the Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't do Chromebooks because I don't do Photoshop. So I'm just out of luck there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't do Chromebooks because you do Photoshop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't have Photoshop.  Oh, you need Photoshop.  Or it's a work. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It says it's a Core M3. Does that tell you enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's the current one. The current one is...  The ASUS C302CA.  Yes, the current one is an M3, but they have teased that they're going to do a faster one.  Oh, I see.  I thought it was an i7, but I may be wrong on that.  And it's probably still a mobile, but still...  And 16 gigs of RAM, which is even more important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the key. And I wish it would do LTE.  So the new... So I don't know how miserable would I be with a Microsoft service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think you'd be all that miserable, to be honest with you.  Well, I'm always miserable.  What's changed is that we don't really use the operating system anymore.  You could use a Microsoft, a Windows tablet, like you use a Chromebook.  Just keep Chrome full screen running and you would never see Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm the same way. I have a Windows computer and a Mac laptop.  And switching doesn't bother me because I use Chrome and Dropbox and Photoshop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's increasingly the case. Yeah, and if you use Adobe applications, it doesn't matter.  I'm actually bringing a Windows laptop on my trip because I'll just be using Lightroom and Chrome.  And I wanted something powerful and light.  And I like to... I don't know why, but I like that two-in-one fold-over thing.  Because you can tent it and watch a movie on the plane.  And you could use it as a tablet. And you can also use it as a laptop.  I just like that. I don't like detachable screens.  And that's why I don't like the Pro because the surface is detachable.  It's just really a tablet with a flimsy little keyboard that sticks on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, laptops are tough right now since Apple did the whole MacBook thing.  The next one is supposed to have a better battery, which would be super great.  But right now it's tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, we don't know what to do for you.  You know, you might... Yeah, look at the Surface laptop.  You know what? Here's a wild one.  Use the Surface laptop, which comes with Windows 10 S, which is kind of like...  It's like the Chromebook of Windows.  You can only use apps that are in the store.  It's very light. It's very portable. You can get it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the Windows store has such a great browser selection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, you have to use Edge. You can't use Chrome. And that's kind of a...  Oh, well, that defeats it.  That's it. You have to have Chrome, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, you can...  Plus I have my Google Play and I have my Netflix and my HBO Go.  Showtime beats the heck out of HBO because I can download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Both of those, I think, are available in the Windows store.  However, if you buy the Surface laptop now, you can upgrade it to Windows 10 Pro for free.  B!  I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just think I'll probably bombard the show with complaints of mining if I buy a Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you'll love the luxurious...  I'll blame you for it.  ...rich Alcantara material covered keyboard. You'll love that.  It's got a fabric key...  Eww! No.  Yes!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, how do you clean that with alcohol then?  You don't.  Oh, no.  It's made of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I really wonder how that will age.  ...space age materials.  No.  No, my keyboard every...  Stacey's. Stacey's.  Eww!  Are you a germaphobe, Stacey? Is this something we didn't know about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not a germaphobe, but dear God, keyboards are...they're filthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Clearly, looking at her office, she's a mesophobe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you could use a Clorox wipe on it. I don't think that would hurt it.  It's plastic, basically. Alcantara is polyurethane and polyester. It's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that what Tesla has as their header inside the car?  Yes, headliner is Alcantara.  Okay, headliner. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Only if you upgrade to the finest things in life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Finest Corinthian headliner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It's Corinthian Alcantara. Yes.  So, Mark Zuckerberg says, I am not using this trip to run for office.  Some of you have asked, he writes on Facebook on Sunday, if this 50 states in a year challenge means I'm running for public office.  I am not. I'm doing it to get a broader perspective, to make sure we're best serving our community of almost 2 billion people at Facebook,  and doing the best work to promote equal opportunity at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. So there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what everybody says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Everybody's not running for president until they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think he's running for office. I just don't think... I think he couldn't bear politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't see Mark Zuckerberg really enjoying politics. God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see him live streaming his visit to his Harvard...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I missed it. I saw it was up there. Was it funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he and his wife Priscilla, because Priscilla was his girlfriend despite the movie.  Priscilla was his girlfriend in college. Why am I not getting audio? Is that me?  Oh, it's your fault? Okay. It's not your fault.  6.5 million views of Mark at his old... first time he'd visited his Harvard dorm room since he invented Facebook.  And by the way, yes, there was an old beer that he'd left there some years ago. Here it is. H33. Do you know where this is, Karsten?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's the Jock Dorm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the Jock Dorm, really? Was Mark a jock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  It explains his love of the Adidas flip-flops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. He went to visit his high school and then he went to visit his old dorm room. I've done that. Have you done that, Karsten? It's kind of fun.  No.  Go see your old dorm room?  No.  No. Too many bad memories. What house were you in?  Adams.  He was in Adams. Which house is this?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The Artsy House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You were in the Artsy House?  It was bigger than... people were in black.  By the way, H33 is now considered the most coveted dorm room in America.  Ha ha ha ha!  Because Mark Zuckerberg was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They didn't enshrine his dorm room and preserve it.  It's unchanged since Mark was here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he gives a billion dollars, they'll do that.  His math formulas are still on the window where he wrote them.  Ha ha ha ha!  That's a good use of Facebook Live. I think that's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So when is his address?  H33.  When is his commencement address?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, is he speaking? That's why he's there.  That's why he's there. Yeah.  He's speaking at Harvard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Remember we showed the Bill Gates...  Yeah.  ...Suckerberg...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I have some audio now. Can you hear it now?  What is wrong with me?  Why have I failed you?  I failed you in so many ways.  It's probably me.  It's just me.  It's just Windows.  My sound is on.  Sending it out the HDMI port.  All right.  We don't have to share our private family troubles with the rest of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The students who live here during the year have moved out by now.  So the folks who are here now are basically...  Harvard has this program where they allow students who haven't graduated yet,  so these guys are I guess rising juniors,  to come live in the dorms and help out crew with...  This is simple.  I don't care.  This is what Harvard does.  It's like you get the Harvard cards.  So you guys are what? You're rising juniors and seniors.  We just met right before this.  You want to introduce yourself and tell them what you...  No.  Congratulations.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Priscilla, do you have any stories from this suite from 13 years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's gotten pretty good at this. This is pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  None that I should tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The overlap that we have between stories that are good,  stories that I'm not already going to share at commencement in two days,  and stories that are reasonable to tell on a live stream with 100,000 people watching is very small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's just say I was 18 when you were in this room,  and people should be allowed to move on from things that happened when they were 18 years old.  That's ironic considering Facebook's business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll never let you move on.  Everything you do is now memorialized for future.  Private chat rooms have been added to Facebook Live,  so that'll help people do the right thing.  Amazon has hired James Gosling.  We had a great interview with James.  He's the inventor of Java when he was at Sun Microsystems.  He told some good stories about that on triangulation some months ago.  He's got a good title.  Senior Special Heavyweight Person.  What is his title? I can't find it.  Distinguished Engineer?  When we talked to him, he was working...  Distinguished Engineer, yeah, there you go.  He was working designing underwater robots when we talked to him.  Remember that? That was cool.  Distinguished Engineer.  I don't actually know what that's called.  I think it is though, something like that.  Sorry, Ryan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How they're hiring older people, that's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my friend James Govner from Redbunk.  That's who was.  Yeah, he's a smart dude.  And yes, I was pulling up his thing so I could see...  Because his blog post was on AWS demolishing the cult of youth over at Redbunk.  Good.  And it talked about them hiring Adrian Cockroft and how James Hamilton,  who if you've never seen him present, he's hilarious, and he's like 51.  And he's still sporting his mullet.  51 is not that old. Not that old.  Sorry, sorry, he's in his 50s.  Oh, and they talked about Tim Bray being hired there.  Oh, I love Tim Bray.  There you go. He's 61 now.  Tim's 61, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always think of him as a youngster.  That's according to this.  Hackers have defeated the Iris scanner in your Galaxy S8.  The Chaos Computer Club in Germany has figured out how to simulate your Iris.  This is the same group that bypassed Apple's Touch ID system in 2013.  A camera with a 200mm lens, a long telephoto lens,  can capture a usable picture of your Iris from up to 16 feet away.  And at that point, you can print it out with a laser printer.  Ironically, the best results on a Samsung laser printer.  Then you place a contact lens on top of the print to mimic the curvature of a real eye.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is great thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All of this face-based security, the face unlock thing that Samsung did,  it was also broken, and the eyeball thing.  It's really weird because there's a lot of pictures of people's faces on the internet.  That's the number one thing that's going to be out there.  It seems like a really weird thing to base your security around.  Whereas there's way less fingerprint pictures out there.  Yeah, although.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're taking with just a point and shoot from just a medium distance.  They don't really need to get in close.  See, that's good enough.  They're taking his picture, then they're printing it out.  And then I guess they're going to put a contact lens on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what you're saying is that any photo of somebody that already exists, this could be done with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, look, see they got a contact lens.  You got to get the eye the same size.  That's a pretty high-res picture.  Well, does it?  Whoa, look how fast that unlocked it.  Wow.  That's the beauty of that, by the way, that iris recognition is really fast.  Even if it's not very safe.  That's a lot of work.  Yeah, well, right.  I would use a long password would be the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the kind of thing that like a targeted VIP would fall victim to, but not necessarily like your average phone thief.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But yeah, I mean, if you're a public figure or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo's concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm always concerned.  However, I can get Trump's iris pretty easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, like something like that, like a post-it note.  You know, it's easy.  I am interested in what one password is doing.  They've created they're one of the most popular password vaults out there and they've created a new travel mode.  This is what we were talking about a couple of weeks ago.  Yeah, designed for travelers.  So the idea is you will designate the passwords that are OK to reveal smart, safe for travel.  And then everything else will get deleted before you get off the plane.  It'll be removed from your device in every respect possible.  But don't worry, because one password still has your password fault and they'll restore it when you get home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So can the authorities force you to restore it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because they say there's no way of knowing travel mode is there.  Except now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So wait, so is the implementation like they won't see my Facebook app that's on my phone when they ask me to open it?  The apps are still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're going to ask me to open it and then I'll just be like, I can't because I don't have access to my password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Save my passwords on.  Yeah, I don't have my passwords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could they hold me in contempt of court?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I'm going to test this in a couple of weeks and I'll let you know.  I'm a little nervous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think what you say is I forget.  I forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you're good.  Rather than unlock it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just I forget.  Don't say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't ever lie.  Say I don't know it.  I don't.  I don't.  It's at home.  It's in my password vault at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't we discuss a legal case that had a guy who declined to give him he declined to give his password because he had child pornography on his computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The judge said you have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is that a worrying precedent we should look to when we look at this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the problem is the courts are not in agreement on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will one password pay your legal fees if you want to be the test case?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  FCC.  Let's talk about net neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got eight minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got eight minutes.  All right.  Let's not.  I'll just tell you a couple of things that make me mad.  One, if you went to go FCC yourself, John Oliver's site, because you wanted to comment on this.  Let's see if it's working now.  The FCC pulled down the public comments because they say they were D DOS, but then they would give no evidence that they were D DOS.  No, it's back up.  Good.  So they've put those comments back on.  So if you go FCC yourself, please do it while you can.  There's also some evidence of astroturfing going on.  People Internet service providers using your name to pretend that you're against net neutrality.  I hate net neutrality.  And then, Jeff, I imagine you're a little miffed by the story of John M. Donnelly, who's with the CQ roll call and is also chairman, ironically, of the National Press Club's press freedom team.  He was booted out of FCC headquarters because he had the temerity to ask questions of the FCC commissioners in a government owned building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He was accused of, you know, kind of violating the privacy of the FCC head.  It's just it's just ridiculous.  These people work for us, but they don't realize it.  I'm not getting trouble from somebody in Twitter.  Oh, you brought politics into the show.  So I brought it in the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he was walking up after a commission meeting and just was trying to talk to him politely.  Yeah.  I mean, having having been to the FCC and done similar things, this is not terrible behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The good news is Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire said a letter to Ajit Pai one day later, questioning questioning this behavior.  It said they said in their letter, the FCC should set a sterling example of what comes to supporting the First Amendment and freedom of the press.  Yesterday's incident is not an isolated one seems to be a part of a larger pattern of hostility toward the press, which underscores our serious concern.  Doesn't just a letter.  No investigation, no committee has been formed.  But nevertheless.  And then in England, the Tories platform, they call it their manifesto.  You know that Theresa May and the Tories are she called an election.  They're up for election.  And the Tory platform is well, here's a line towards the end of the end of the platform.  Some people say it is not for the government to regulate when it comes to technology and the Internet.  We disagree.  But it's not just the Tories.  Apparently, the liberals are also kind of pro.  You know, let's shut the Internet down because it's full of bad stuff.  Legislation.  If they win their seats, legislation be introduced to protect the public from abuse and offensive material online.  And everyone would have the right to wipe the protect the public from the public.  Yes.  And and the right to forget.  Yes, you'll have the right to wipe material that was posted when you're under 18.  Mark Zuckerberg would like that.  Priscilla Chan would like that.  Internet companies would also be asked to help promote counter extremism narratives.  New rules requiring companies to make it harder for people to access pornography and violent images.  All content creators are forced to justify their policies to the government.  Labor's doing the same thing.  You know, so if you live in the UK, well, brace yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No Europe, no Internet.  Australia is talking about a Google tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's ready for us.  I keep it right here.  This is the Wemo dimmer switch.  This just came out.  Okay.  So the good thing is Wemo has had a light switch for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you show us the Lutron before and recommended that, right?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does this do the same thing?  Yes.  This is a dimmer, except it doesn't require a hub.  But it's $80, which is kind of expensive for a Wi-Fi dimmer switch because I have the box for it.  I don't have the light switch.  I also have the Levitan Wi-Fi dimmer switch that's only about $45 or $50.  But if you're already in the Wemo world, this is nice.  It's pretty.  I haven't installed it yet.  That's happening this weekend, but I will show you.  It is pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the night mode.  It glows.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here we are, back of the light switch.  You need a neutral wire for this.  So keep that in mind.  And here's the front.  It's not a...  What's the word I want to hear?  It doesn't click like a normal toggle switch.  There's a little bit of give here, but it's not like on off kind of clicky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's more like you run your finger along it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh-huh.  And this is a touch thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like wiping a tear from a baby's eye.  Just like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Stacey, I also want to hear your thoughts on the IKEA stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about the IKEA stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The fact that they're going to have a whole line that's compatible with both home and Amazon?  IoT home lighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  It's going to be called...  It's going to be called...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thread-free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we've talked about this, haven't we?  I had like a couple...  No.  Okay.  Like a month ago, I had IKEA on my show.  So the guy who's in charge of all of this.  So if you want details...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does this support like Zigbee or is it its own standard or...?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thread-free is the current product or Zigbee with the hub that'll convert it.  It's like $80 for the hub and I think two light bulbs.  You can buy them at your local IKEA now.  You can't buy them online.  And they're all right.  They're not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of the Crestron, of the Lutron, Leviton, and Wemo, which do you like the best?  Or do you not have enough information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't installed this Wemo switch.  I hated the original Wemo switch, but Wemo's done a lot of work on their software.  I also hated it because it was a smart switch with no dimmer, which was just stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Go get your daughter.  She's waiting on the curb wondering where mommy is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they start charging me if I'm late.  What?  Gotta go.  Oh, man.  They gotta keep someone there for her.  All right. Bye, you guys. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bye, Stacey. IOTpodcast.com.  Bye, Stacey.  Bye, Stacey. Bye, Stacey.  And now it's time for Jeff's number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For Ron. No, I lost mine.  Okay.  Now it's time for Ron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ron's thing. Hi, Ron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. This just arrived like two hours ago, and I'm super excited about it, but I don't know that much about it right now.  Do you remember the old Optimus keyboards from Art?  Art Lebedev.  Art Lebedev.  They were these really cool keyboards that had like LCDs.  And OLEDs on the keys.  The keys.  And somebody actually made a real life one.  That you can actually buy that works.  Let me get a little more.  Oh, this is from Elgato.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They used to make Mac stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. This is the Elgato Stream Deck.  And the name Stream Deck is because it's for like Twitch streamers.  But screw that. I'm going to turn it into a productivity device.  So like all these, these are all keys here and you can you can press buttons and the whole thing will change.  150 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's 150 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the Optimus version of this was like a thousand dollars.  And you could never ever buy one.  And I always I always like lost it after the pictures on the Internet.  But like this this thing came out in March.  And the little keys are great.  Like it seems to be working awesome.  The the only problem I have with it is that the look the software is for like Twitch streamers.  So it doesn't do a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's designed for OBS Studio or Tippy Stream and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what you can do is run EXE.  So I'm just making auto hotkey scripts and binding them to all the buttons.  So I can do things like paste text.  Like one of the things I do all the time when I'm writing is link to past articles.  And a lot of stuff is very like foundational, like the major Android OS reviews.  And I can just have that on a button that says link this text as the the Android review or link this text as the last phone review or whatever.  So like with auto hotkey, which is a bunch of programming, I can have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love auto hotkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Clipboard or open web site.  This is interesting because really what it is is to kind of give a big time TV switcher capabilities to online streamers.  It's kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if you're willing to do the programming work, I think it's going to be an awesome little productivity device.  And the best thing is this little stand that can pop out and it can kind of sit up like this on your desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've got to come back and give us a review after you've played with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I showed this. I showed this to the guys in Slack and they're like, so when is your review?  And I'm like, I guess.  Crap.  I guess it's right about it.  Now more work.

And there were some great links in there about how artists are using it.  And I can't find it now.  You pasted a different link in.  I pasted the wrong thing into the, yeah, I did with two links.

Interesting.  Is that fun or what?  What?  The snapshots of life.  Yeah.  So this is one of many, many art pieces linked to from this, the conversation.com.  A series of unfortunate events.  Look, a van fire.  Michael Wolf did this.  That's cool.  He's a computer.  He got an honorable mention in the World Press photo competition for photographs he took from Street View.  That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
