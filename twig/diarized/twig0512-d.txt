It's time for Twig This Week in Google. Oh, we got a lot to talk about today. Let's kick this thing  off. Jeff Jarvis is here. He is the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism  at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  And he's mad as hell and he's not going to take it anymore.  I don't know what I'm mad about yet. Have you seen Network Yet with Brian Crampstead? Oh,  I guess it closed. No, I haven't. You missed it. You know, Colleen here in our office,  our supervising producer, saw The Last Night. She says it was really good. I said, shut up.  That's Kevin, the chortle of Kevin Toffle, the Torffle chortle from AboutChromebooks.com.  And of course, co-host on the IOT podcast with Stacey. My Chrome hero. And his Chrome hero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my goal in life, Jeff, is to be your Chrome hero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you've succeeded. You are the wing beneath his trackpad. So Jeff, I thought I'd start with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that New York Times story. I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your response. It was kind of weird that New York Times just printed what is essentially a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  press release. Oh, with conflict of interest up the yin yang for its own industry. But you should

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  explain it first. Headline, Google made $4.7 billion from the news industry in 2018, study says.  And the study, of course, is from the News Media Alliance. Formerly the Newspaper Association of  America, they finally changed their name. Yeah. And it comes from, I think, a false premise,  which is that when Google shows snippets from news articles and its search results,  the money it makes from those ads, Google should give some of that to the newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It gets worse and worse. They, yes, they presume that the value is in the snippet, or as I said in  the post I wrote, that it's as if if you take one sentence of theirs, it's like a camera taking a  picture and stealing the soul of a native. You've taken all the value out, right? And so that's  problem one. So obviously all the value is the opposite. So it argues at length, see all these  ways that Google's gotten more interested in news. They're doing more news and more news and more  news. That's all good for the news industry. Yeah, because it sends more traffic to news people,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right? As you point out, every month, every month, this is from Google's statement,  they're talking about the 4.7 billion. These back of envelope calculations are inaccurate,  as a number of experts are pointing out. And really that's true. After the Times published that,  everybody jumped on. The overwhelming number of news queries do not show ads, number one.  The study ignores the value Google provides. And this is, I think, the most important point. Every  month, Google News and Search drives over 10 billion clicks to publishers' websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now let's add to that, Leo. That number is eight years old. Wow. It is much higher now,  but I couldn't get that number out of them now. I tried. Much higher. And we know because was it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  France? Was it Spain? Where did they cut off Google? Spain. Spain. And it killed traffic by 10 or 20%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a big flop. Yeah. And then so the next fallacy of this whole thing, so the basic logic  of it falls apart in the second paragraph. Google's paying more attention to news. They should pay us  more. No, Google already is paying you more, but giving you more traffic. All flawed from then on.  But the real statistical travesty of this is they relied entirely on a 10-year-old offhand comment  in some conference made by Marissa Meyer, remember her, where she was just trying to be nice to news  and saying, yeah, yeah, we're not crazy to have news. I don't know. It could be worth $100 million.  So they used that and then extrapolated that and said, well, Google's grown this much. They used  data from two publishers. It's grown this much. Ergo, it's now worth $4.7 million. The entire thing  is flawed to flawed to flawed. Now, normally I would just write that off as well in New York

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Times. They're one of the newspapers and this is self-serving. They're in a conflict of interest.  But they're publishing this. They published a study on Monday because the House subcommittee  on Tuesday was having a hearing and the news alliance hopes, in fact, the director of the news  alliance said he hoped an outcome of any conversation generated by the study would be the passage  of a bill, a law, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, which would give news publishers  a four-year antitrust exemption and allow them to collectively bargain with Google and other  online platforms over revenue splitting. Because if you go all together, it's collusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're arguing that Google's antitrust, so what's the cure to antitrust? More antitrust.  It's all just ridiculous. And the real problem here is that it's, and I get some trouble for  criticizing publishers and a lot of them do try and editors do try and this is really hard and  we don't have the answers. I don't have the answers, but this is not the answer. Protectionism is no  strategy for the future. It's distracting from their real job, which to serve the public and  figure out new ways to do that. And you know what? Even if they got $4.7 billion and divided by all  the members of the news media Alliance, it's nothing. Nothing. There is no solution here.  There is no answer here. Basically the Americans are jealous that Europe has its  European copyright directive with its horrible clauses. And I had just come from Google news  guys, full disclosure, Google pays for the venue, the food and a lot of drinks.  Isn't that ironic?  But we pay for our travel. I pay for my travel in Athens. Very nice, by the way.  Great grilled sardines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we're going to Athens this fall. You'll have to give us the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I wish I knew more. I was there for two and a half days, but 20 minutes at the Acropolis.  But I sat in a room filled with European editors and publishers who are scared S-less over what  the copyright director is going to do to them because they're sitting there in the room saying,  well, this, this demands that Google licenses and pays for snippets. Google saying,  they're doing that. No way we're doing that. We didn't do it in Spain. We're not doing that.  So then what's the extension of that? Does Google at some point pull, not just pull Google news out,  but do they, they say we can't really put in snippets and decent links to news sites  that haven't given us a license throughout search. So who suffers? The publishers suffer,  the journalists suffer, the public suffers. Good work industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently there's unilaterally bilateral support in Congress for this bill.  Now this doesn't mean they'll be able to make a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Succeed. Cause the same thing is going to happen here. They're going to say pay us Google.  Right. And Google is going to say, we already give you value. And, and the new publishers should be  smarter about how to exploit those relationships. And they weren't. So what, what did Google do?  Google came along and they created Google and subscribe with Google to make it really,  really easy to subscribe instantly from Google pages, just because the publishers were too  busy to figure out how to do this on their own. That was nice of me. Wasn't it? And Google,  I think Google takes 5% fees, something ridiculously little just to, just to cover their costs. That's  it. And they've been doing that. But the bigger issue here is that this is an example of what  pub news publishers are doing to ruin the internet. And it's happening over and over and again. And  you know, it occurred to me, Leo and Kevin that, so I appeared on MSNBC yesterday about this.  And you know, when the antitrust argument is made, the problem is that everybody now thinks that  Google and Twitter are the internet. They're not though. What you do to them, you do to the  internet, which is an issue. But I sat there at an NBC studio and I said Comcast is an internet  company. AT&T is an internet company. Amazon's an internet company. Soon the Washington Post,  the New York Times will be internet companies. There's lots of internet companies out there.  So when you talk antitrust, let's talk about the whole internet and all the functions of the  internet. And I think it's hard to argue antitrust, but that's what's happening in Congress.  And the result is publishers are using their political capital in conflict of interest,  corruptly, corruptly, knowing they have the click, the plout they have to attack not just Google and  Facebook, but also the net itself and how it operates. And I have had it. I am mad as hell  my own damned industry. And I'm pissed. And I was far from alone. There were a lots and lots  of tweets and posts. So I was flying back from Athens like 10 minutes before I got on. I see  tweets from my friends, Aaron Pilhover and Jay Rosen about this. Jay said, you gotta get on this.  So I'm on the plane with 100-baud internet,  trying to follow all these links and figure out what's what. I spend most of the flight back from  Athens writing this post because I'm just so pissed off at my own industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was the outcome in Spain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The outcome of Spain was that, so I'll say it just because you'd love to hear me say it.  In Germany, the Leistungsschutzrecht, the ancillary copyright said that  the publisher has to grant a license to allow the snippets. Publishers goes to Google and says,  pay us for snippets. Google says, ha, kind of vague. No way. And so then publishers pulled out  of Google for literally a few days, hurt like hell, came back and said, okay, uncle, put us back up.  In Spain, there was no option for a free license. Spain decreed that the platforms must pay  everyone in news that they quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's another way to negotiate, get the legislator to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what happened was Google said, we won't do it. We can't do it. No way. And thus they closed  Google News in Spain. And there have been many reports since that this hurt, especially small  publishers. The big guys in all of these discussions with Google and Facebook are the  biggest publishers, the New York Times and the Washington Post, they can deal with a lot.  But I sat in at News Geist Europe and there were small publishers there who are hurting already.  And these things, when they come along, cause just huge service and cost for them.  So it reduces the diversity of the news ecosystem at the time when we need it most.  And it's short sighted and it's anti-competitive and it's stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If Google decided to take snippets from our podcasts and put them in search results,  I would be so happy. Why wouldn't you be happy? Right? It was a link to the show.  I mean, it would be the best thing Google could ever do. I'm happy that they're even thinking  about indexing the podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. That's a great example. That's a superb example of a parallel about how that's going  to be extremely helpful to you. You get more involved in search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So it seems to me almost rent seeking, like they think Google's rent seeking, in other  words, not adding value and asking for money. But of course they're not. It's really the other way  around. Google's giving you value and you're saying, well, you should pay us for the value  you're giving us. That's nutty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's discovery. I am one of those small publishers, very small publishers.  And I just.  You're big in my mind, Kevin. You're very big in my mind.  Thank you, sir. Thank you. About 35% of my traffic comes from Google News.  That's not insignificant, number one. Number two, I wonder, and Jeff, maybe you've seen a  real study because I don't buy this any more than anybody else does. The one that we addressed  earlier, is there a study showing how many people maybe who don't subscribe to news sites  but still go there as a result of Google News or Apple News or some other, you know, internet  discovery mechanism? I'm guessing it's quite high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. The problem with this is that you're kind of proving a negative. The contrary argument  that's made is how many people just see the snippet and don't go. You're saying the opposite  how many do see the snippet and go. You don't know what they wouldn't have seen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in a way. You know what I'm saying? That happens to me every day. I get a, I get a,  I look at a snippet and go to a story, but I'm a very specific use case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, but I mean, it is part of our, it is part of our, you know, beat check.  I go to tech meme and sites like it and, and, and I want to see news sources. I see like,  here's tech meme with top tech news, right? It's got snippets. I want to see the snippets.  It also has links to competing stories from other places.  You might prefer another brand.  Yeah. It has. So Kevin tweets, this is all good for everybody. This, this is, I just  dragged me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's insane. So Kevin, there was a study as somebody from a certain large company.  We happened to be discussing and told me, but, but didn't have the details and didn't  remember who it was from. So this is take this with a grain of salt, the size of Utah.  Cause I don't have the details, but did say that there was a study in Europe that valued  the clicks. Now I don't know the problem is I can't see the study. I can't know what,  at what level is it just new users? Is it a user? But in the range of like four to five euro,  for whatever definition that was, there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a tangible value  for a link. But the only way to exploit that link is if the publisher does so.  And if the publisher is going to show you, you know, junk links and 55 ads, then you're going  to lose them. The publisher's job is to start, try to start to build a relationship with you  and find your lifetime value. We're going to get to Mary Meeker's thing in a minute. But one thing  that's emphasized is the customer acquisition cost. She said it goes up above lifetime value  and that's unsustainable. When you get somebody from Google that is free customer acquisition,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  free, that's where the value is. Yeah. Right. My bigger. So there's two issues. One is,  you don't want Congress to get involved in this because there's apparently just going to, oh,  okay. Maybe because maybe, I don't know, this newspaper Alliance pays members of Congress  money, but, uh, which would be unheard of, but probably the case. Uh, but also because there  are reasons to be upset about Google and their monopoly and there are things perhaps Congress  should get involved with. This is not one of them. This is a special interest case that I just don't,  I don't think benefits anybody. It's stupid. By the way, I have to admire Google. Well played,  sir. This morning I woke up to see images of a Pixel 4 phone from, from unbox therapy and other  places. It was really, uh, it's the usual leaks we get cause the Pixel wouldn't probably come out.  Four wouldn't come out till October, but the leaks we usually get around this time as they start  putting out, uh, models for case makers. So it was that and Google responded the made by Google  Twitter feed. Well, since there seems to be some interest, here you go. They sent out actual pictures  of the back of the Pixel 4, which I just, I mean, that's the way to handle it. There's still lots  of things they didn't tell anybody. There's no way to know if there's a headphone jack. We're not  front of it. So we don't know what kinds of affordances there are. And you can, you can only  see one button. So there's a lot of question marks. What a great way to handle a leak like that. I've  never heard of any company doing that. Yeah. That's kind of a nice exchange there with,  with Marcus Brownlee. Yeah. He says, at least let me drop my dream phone 2019 video first

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and Google responds. The year's not over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pretty, pretty good Google. Well played. It also makes me wonder if maybe October is not the day  that's when they've released the previous Pixel phones. Maybe they're thinking since they announced,  well, I guess it would still make sense to do it later in the year. They just announced the Pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  3A, but they could do it. Yeah, I wouldn't think, I wouldn't think they follow up the 3A launch with  Pixel 4 a month or two later. I still think October. Yeah, but they are kind of going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  different markets. I mean, this will be, this will, I'm sure be an expensive phone. I hope Google's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going to do what others are doing now and do a high end and a less expensive version. That would

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  be fantastic. I mean, but it's, you know, I really like my 3A. I can't say that I see huge  difference between it and the 2XL that I had, but who cares? It's new and I love new. So it's really  nice. But if the four comes out, you know, the other question and Paul Therotte brought this up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  earlier on Windows Weekly is why doesn't Google tie the release of its high end flagship phone  to the release of the Snapdragon it's going to run on? At this point, it's coming out kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  toward the end of life of the Snapdragon. Yeah, a lot of the phone makers and even  computer makers fall into this trap of chip cycles. And you can tell who's got the most pull with the  chip makers because they're the ones who come out early in the cycle. You know, they pre-buy or  commit to buying, you know, 50 million Snapdragons or Core i5s, whatever the case may be. Or they  have their own chips like Samsung with Exynos. So they're in a very enviable position of having  a high market, you know, percentage. Plus they have their own chips to rely on. So they go in  March or April. Everybody else has to follow along. Right. And to do it in October is to basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  say, well, yeah, you're not going to have the latest chip, but hey, it's from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that determined by the holiday shopping schedule? Maybe. Aren't they? If you're going  to change something, change the chip schedule. So Samsung does the Galaxy S phones in the spring and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  does a fall release of the Note. And that's been worked pretty well for them. I don't know. Anyway,  they have lots of products, whereas Google basically has. That's true. This is Google's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. If something's wrong with the chip, then you save yourself from. Well, that's true. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the chip comes out in the spring, comes out around March. You want some time to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  expose any problems. I think Kirsten's right. Yeah, like a whole year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's really locked down now. Let's take a break. We have Mary Meeker's 333 slide

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  future of the Internet. I brought dinner because I figured we were going to be here until about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  nine o'clock. Yeah, we're not going to go through every slide, but I am counting on you and Kevin  to tell me what the important slides are because I had planned last night. It was good. I was going

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to watch the it's like just the even ones, the even numbers. Yeah, you do the even Jeff will do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the odd and we'll. So Mary Meeker, who is before we take the break just to set this up, who is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mary Meeker, Jeff? She was a famous analyst. Then she was a Kleiner Perkins. Then she left  Kleiner Perkins as the basis of a new company. And she's just the the Mondo analyst of digital  Internet and technology. And this how many years has been coming out? God, it feels like we do it  every year for a while. She comes out with this 300 plus page PowerPoint every once a year. And

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's very well done. It's very valuable. She also became famous because back when she was an analyst,  she made some right on predictions. Right. And people she got the reputation, which is easy to  get and oddly hard to lose that she's really prescient. But I don't think she does that as

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I tend to dismiss the notion of futurists. I can't imagine a more hubristic job title.  I see the future. Right. I don't think she does that so much as she just sees the current trends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And notes them. She was an analyst at Morgan Stanley. And in 1995, she foresaw how the Internet  was going to change everything basically. And they called her the Nostradamus of technology.  In fact, she made a lot of money for Morgan Stanley because in 1995, who went public? Oh,  yeah, Netscape, Priceline, later Google. They got in on those IPOs. She also recommended Amazon,  AOL, Intuit and Dell. So she made a lot of money for Morgan Stanley with her predictions.  It's gotten longer. This article is from 2012 by Stephen Levy and Wired from 2012,  seven years ago. At that time, it was 99 slides in 20 minutes. This year, 333 slides.  And I'd be curious, actually, this is back when she was a Kleiner. I'd be curious to see how much  she got right in 2012. But we'll leave that. There's a lot to do just to go through the today's  slides. So we'll talk about some of Marymaker's predictions and what you all think of them in  just a second. But first, I got a prediction. More and more people are going to be using  virtual private networks. There's two reasons you'd want to use one. One, for your security,  especially when you're on an open access point at a coffee shop or you're at a hotel or a cruise  ship or just anywhere where you're joining in a Wi-Fi network others are on. That means they're  on your network too. And so there's some risks involved. If it's Wi-Fi, your data is flying  through the air. Plus, because of the nature of networks, people can actually see your computer  on there and try to attack it. And there are some really interesting attacks out there on Wi-Fi  networks, even of machines that are secure. Just look up the Wi-Fi pineapple and get some idea of  what you can do with that thing. So that's one reason you might want to run a VPN. The other one  is for privacy. A VPN encrypts all your traffic from your computer to the VPN server so that your  internet service provider, your carrier, anybody in that area, anyone in between you and that server  can see what you're up to and can sell that to the highest bidder. We know carriers and ISPs  often do that. So that's another reason people use a VPN. There's a third reason, geographic  restrictions. ExpressVPN allows you to enter the public internet from many different countries.  They have servers all over the world. So you can bypass geographic restrictions on a lot of,  let's say you're somewhere and you want to watch Netflix, but you're out of the country or  maybe you're in the US and you want to watch the BBC's iPlayer. There's some really cool  reasons you might want to use a VPN. Now here's what you're looking for in a VPN, something that  protects your privacy and security. What Leo you say? I thought all VPNs did that. Well,  I wish it were true. Unfortunately, some VPNs are not well run. They're not well secured. We've  heard problems with VPNs in the past never express VPN. The other problem, they leak IP addresses. The  other problem is frankly, some VPN people are not scrupulous. And so especially if you're getting a  cheap or free VPN, often they are taking that information and selling it. See all the stuff  that you kept from your ISP now is going through the VPN provider. ExpressVPN does none of that.  They secure and anonymize your internet browsing. They encrypt your data. They hide your public IP  address and they never log. They know nothing about you. They don't want to. So that if ever  anybody asks, they say they could just say, I don't know. It's the other thing I think that's  great as pure convenience is they have apps for every platform. It takes one click to turn it on,  one click to turn it off. And because they have so many servers more than anybody else, it's fast.  ExpressVPN rated the number one VPN service by tech radar. I give it my two thumbs up,  an absolute recommendation. And it comes with a 30 day money back guarantee. It is literally the  best VPN in the world. It's the one you should be using. Protect your online activity today  and find out how you can get an extra three months free when you buy a one year package at  express. That's the best deal by the way, at expressvpn.com slash twig, the number one most  trusted VPN in the world. The one I use expressvpn.com slash twig three months free with a one year  package. We thank them for supporting this week in Google. And I thank you for supporting us by  using that special URL expressvpn.com slash twig. All right. Should I pull up the slideshow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I put my favorite link already there to slide number 22. Slide number 22. Yes, that was mine too.  I happen to like this one. You're missing the top. For those of you listening, we'll describe  all the bars to you. It's cut off a little bit. It's media time versus advertising spending.  2010 and 2018. Okay. So should we start with 2010? Yes. Print had very low time spent 8%,  but 27% of ad spend went there. Oh, interesting. Three, more than three times what it deserved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Advertisers were still spending in the old world. Poor old radio. It was the other way around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lots of time. 16% spent. 11% ad spend. Now TV was equal. 43 and 43 because advertisers understood  TV. They knew what it was. They got it. They tracked it markedly. And nobody ever got fired  for buying the Super Bowl. Right. Desktop time spent 25%. Advertising spend lagged that only 19%.  Mobile 8% time spent, half a percent ad spend because nobody knew what it was yet. So that was  the picture in 2010. Now let's come to 2018 and start the other end of the chart. Now mobile  is almost tied with TV at 33% time spent, 33% ad spend. A third of time spent and a third of ad  spend is mobile. This is actually fairly critical. In fact, just moments ago, the amount of time spent

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  watching screens on mobile bypassed that of TV just this month. So you're really starting to see  this big sea change. What's interesting is that advertising spending has gone along with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've figured it out. Right. Well, and desktop is also equal. 18 and 18. There's another part of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this story to me, which is it's very efficient. When both numbers are the same. And the reason  it's so efficient on these digital platforms, I think, is because they know they can measure  it better than anything. Bingo. Right. So you know what you're getting. I don't know why TV's been

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so efficient, but maybe. I think they're just used to it and they know it. But then if you go to the  old media, right. Print has gone from time spent has gone from 8% to a mere 3%. Gutenberg is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  3% print, ad spend 7%. So if I read the times on the web, that doesn't count? Does that not count?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. This is the medium used, not the kind of. I haven't read anything printed in a long time.  Dead trees. Wow. What a radio is still undervalued a little bit. 12% of attention goes to an 8% goes  to the spend. So those two are both cockeyed, but this clearly becomes the mobile story going forward.  And there's another slide elsewhere in the presentation that shows that in media,  viewing like video, it's incremental growth in mobile. It's all new growth. It's phenomenal.  That's stealing from TV and that's how people are watching things now. Well, that's interesting. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  think mobile stole not only from TV, but also from desktop. So, you know, it's really become the  platform. And I think that this trend in another 10 years is going to be, you know, 70% mobile. It's  going to be huge, right? It's going to double. Yeah, you're going to watch everything on mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're going to listen to things on mobile. You're going to read things on mobile. Who needs these

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  other media? I'm surprised people aren't sitting at their screens. I guess 34% is not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't want to have to go and get your news or your whatever media it is. You want it  in your pocket. That's the whole point. The whole thing here. And again, it's incremental. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  filling time when you couldn't have been consuming media before. Right. So Ronnie Mala at Recode

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  picked out a few other interesting slides. There are now 3.8 billion internet users in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really critical. 51%. Now the majority of the world by 1%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And mostly, you know, most of the new growth, of course, is in mobile. A lot of people with  smartphones. Sales of smartphones, though, are declining because everybody's got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mm hmm. But still huge growth to be had. This is another slide in Asia and Africa.  Yeah. So as big, I mean, China is gigantic now, killer now, it will only get much bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is more a victory lap than anything else, but seven out of the 10 world's most valuable  companies are tech companies. Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Tencent,  those seven. And then, you know, there's Berkshire Hathaway,  Visa, and Johnson & Johnson, which just barely made it. So that's not a surprise, though. But  Microsoft, number one in terms of market cap, I think, and Amazon and then Apple. E-commerce  is 15% of retail sales, which this is actually a little surprising. Growth has slowed,  but growth in regular retail was only 2%. But growth has slowed. It's still growing.  It's still growing. But you'd think with only 15% of all sales, it would grow, still be at a,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you know, at a growth pace. But you're still going to compete with the convenience of going to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  quarter store to buy toothpaste. Red milk is keeping the retail sales alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they've already eaten most of the retail sales. So, right, their growth could slow because  there's not that much more retail to swallow. Well, but 15, it's only 15% of all sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's still a lot, there's still a lot to go. That's what I kind of was thinking.  Internet ad spending has accelerated up 22% last year. Most of the spending is still on Google and  Facebook. Dang it. But Amazon is... Here's the basic thing on this, Leo, for the slide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Programmatic ad buying. Do I need to explain what that is to the audience? Yes, what is that?  So programmatic ad... You know those ads that you see when you look at some boots on Amazon and the  frigging boots follow you around for the next two months everywhere you go? Yes. That's a combination  of retargeting and programmatic advertising. Retargeting has a data point about you that,  as a cookie, that goes, hey, she looked at boots, he looked at boots. Right. But programmatic  then is an automated, AI-powered, instantaneous trading floor, competitive trading floor,  bidding structure for ads. Point being, you open up an ad page, there's a blank ad there.  The site says, hey, programmatic networks, I've got somebody who looked at boots. Who wants her?  Who wants him? And then all the traders come along and say, well, I'll bid this much, I'll  bid that much, I'll bid that much. And then one ad wins and then goes in there. And that happens  in the time it takes you to open the page. Google invented this and this was really... Well, Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and AppNexus. AppNexus invented it too. Oh, okay. Okay. But Google, the auction model, right, was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's idea. Yes, the auction model, but this programmatic, there's notion of the trading  floors. So programmatic buying in micros has gone up from 10% in 2012 to 62% last year. Now, I was  at an event, I held an event at Newark School a few weeks ago. It was a follow-up to a post I wrote  about the scorched earth of our media business models. And there was an ad, it was a Chatham  house, so I can't say who, but there was an ad exec there who scolded the room of media people,  these are high level executives, and said, why are you using programmatic? It... I'm fading as we go  here. It commodifies you. You shouldn't be on programmatic. But one of the ad VPs in the room  said, sorry, bud, but yeah, you're right. I don't like using it, but that's where all the ad dollars  go. And I got to follow where the ad dollars are. So the ad agencies are using programmatic because  it's an easy way to get the best price. Is it more effective though?  Well, that's an argument that goes on. I can see why Google loves it and Facebook loves it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because it maximizes their price. You know, one of the challenges for old school media like us is to  figure out, well, what should we charge for our ads? But they have this automatic system that  immediately automatically instantly maximizes it. They literally charge every penny the market will

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  bear. The old media guys try to say that, oh, targeting is overdone. It doesn't really work.  I just saw some lobbyists in saying that just now, because they want to say it's branding that works  with the environment. Right. But you look at a company like Meredith, which is another meeker  slide, they do a lot of this and they really target very well and their revenue is going up  and they bought Time Inc. So no, I think the targeting. They do a lot of it as buying ads,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  not selling ads, or do they do programmatic? Meredith is a publishing company. So they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  normally selling ads, but they're doing it around data and they work with companies.  This is one of meeker's examples. And meeker emphasizes strongly the personalization and  targeting has real value. So yes, as far as we know now, it works. The problem is that it's an  abundance based marketplace. So prices will keep falling. And this is why she emphasizes that  desperation will increase. So even so customer acquisition cost goes down. And that's why  things like freemium are going to be better than advertising because it's all but free to the, even  to the, you know, we were talking before we were on the air, there's a, what's it called DaVinci,  a video platform, a video editing software that's free. And I was saying, how could it be free?  And Kevin and Leo schooled me that it has all this high end other stuff. Freemium is your,  is your, is, is essentially a free customer acquisition cost. And advertising is going to  be expensive. So I think advertising is going to end up suffering. And that means that Google and  Facebook could suffer. And meanwhile, Amazon is a force in advertising suddenly now,  and it knows more about users. So targeting is still going to be there, but it's going to be in  a commodified, abundant marketplace. Sorry, I'm media walking out here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's interesting. Of course, I have a little dog in this hunt because that's not how we sell  advertising. So, so should I get out of this business? You think? Well, in a sense, you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you kind of do though. You have a freemium product. I mean, there's a slide on here about  zoom, for example, which she talks about for user conversion of paid subscribers. I mean,  as Jeff said, there's no acquisition cost when you're doing it this way with zoom. And  they basically say, we just make our product freaking awesome. And we get conversions as a  result of it that we focus on the product and more and more people are doing that. I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the strong platforms. Google growth 1.4 times, Facebook 1.9 times, still smaller than  Google, but they're growing faster. And you know, who's really going fast? Amazon, Twitter, Snap,  and Pinterest 2.6 X. And this is the programmatic buying as a percentage of digital display.  In seven years, it went from 10% to 62%. Which commodifies everything because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah, it doesn't matter where that boot ad appears. What they care about is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that person was interested in boots. The content is irrelevant. As long as you get the eyeballs,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you got to get eyeballs. Well, the right eyeballs. Yeah, that's the point of it.  It's a lead generator, right? Jeff? Yeah, product lead. I mean, that's what all advertising is in  the end. Right. And that's what this ad executive was saying about programmatic. He said you're  fools to be using it because it was invented really to create more inventory for commerce.  It was created so the boot buyer could be found. That was the idea. But then it was so easy for  advertisers to go in and they so loved the idea of getting all this inventory and the publishers.  The reason they went in is I heard them say this and I asked them, they said, well, this is great  for us. We get to expose our inventory to all these new advertisers. We're not going out and  selling. We don't get RFPs for them. So, hey, it's new to us. Well, but the advertiser, the reader  don't really give a damn where their ad appears or where they are. Yeah. But if you're a content

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  creator, it helps you too, because whatever the audience you have, you can monetize, right? Because  you may not have boot buyers, but surely if you have people listening, they're buying something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But in an abundant marketplace, more and more and more places come into these marketplaces  and that boot buyer could be anywhere and somebody's going to undercut you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. But that's why you have to focus on your product, right? I mean, I focus on my content.  Leo, you focus on your content and so on. If I make great content and keep people coming back,  I don't care that there's an abundance because hopefully they're coming to me or, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get ad revenue. The I get ad revenue is the tough part. Yeah. As you get more efficient with  programmatic buying, maybe you don't get ad revenue is the point. That's the problem. That's  exactly the problem. That's the last connection that's a challenge. Reasons for trying a new  service is what you were talking about. The best way to do it is free. Free trial or tier. Now,  this is a survey. So this is a little softer number, but free trial or a free tier for online  streaming is easily the best. Not content library access to exclusives. That's important because I  think we all thought it was exclusives that drove traffic to places like Netflix, right? Good user  experience. No, free trial. Free ad supported products. This is Spotify. She, by the way,  Spotify we should probably say is one of Bond's investments, her company's investments.  All right. Our premium model accounts for about 60% of our gross, says Spotify, of our gross. I'm  sorry, our gross added premium subscribers. I remember during Phil Libbon's reign at Evernote,  he said, and I think this was a pretty common number, 5% pay, 95% don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Right. So you want to hold down the cost of that 95%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. But you know you're going to get a solid five. I don't know how this relates to that,  but it sounds like the premium model is the way people start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the New York Times conversion rate to paid is running a little over 2%.  For most newspapers in the US, the conversion to paid is running about 0.4%.  So a 5% conversion to paid is pretty impressive in that world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say an interesting thing here too, Spotify does, the ad supported service subsidizes the  costs of the free service, the new subscriber acquisition. So that's actually low, thus lowering  your premium side. Very clever, your cost, yeah, cost of acquisition. Happy customers.  Right. So Leo, stay over a second. This is the Zoom thing you were talking about. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stay there for one second. So if you're a newspaper and you get someone to convert,  Logic would say you should offer them an ad free experience.  But those who convert are your most frequent users, and so they have a disproportionate amount of  your traffic and inventory. So they don't want to take away the ad. So you still give the payers  the same kind of crappy experience you give everybody. That sounds like Hulu.  There you go. Big old companies running Hulu. Yep. Yep. They don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They finally added a more expensive ad free tier.  So this is Zoom, free to join when paid user hosts. We really want to get customers to test  our products. It's really hard to get customers to try it without a freemium model.  Yeah, that's what you were saying. Reasons for trying a new subscription box recommended by

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  someone, maybe a podcast. Which is to say free. Maybe a podcast. Yeah, it's not free, but it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  cheap. Maybe a podcast. Oh, now somehow we're actually in the slide deck and we're only on the  37th slide. One tenth of the way. I'm sorry. I'm going to go through stuff like this.  It's slide crack. Yeah. She puts more content into one slide than a whole lecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This one is interesting. This is interesting. So this is daily digital media usage,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and it's desktop, laptop versus mobile plus other. So mobile is the green bar, the top bar,  desktop, laptops, the middle gray bar. Other is blue. Desktop laptop has stayed fairly consistent

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  at a little over two hours. But there's huge growth in the overall and all of that growth in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the overall is mobile. All of it. Yeah. That shows the network rollout pretty well in the USA  because 2008, that's when you started having 3G and 4G. Yeah. See, imagine what 5G. 5G will mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there's no benefit to using a desktop or other connected device. Just online. Yeah, you'll be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  online. Well, even your desktop could even be online because that'd be your home broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it will certainly help mobile considerably, as will Elon Musk's Starlink, if that ever happens.  Daily time spent. This was what I was talking about. The crossing of the lines between mobile  and television just happened. The red line, the top line is TV viewing. The blue line is mobile  viewing. And for the first time ever, daily time spent in the United States is higher in mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we can't tell from this slide. So I know we're not going to come up with an answer. I'm just  curious how they handle watching online television on a device because I generally watch YouTube TV  on my Pixel Slate, not on a TV. We can. My wife watches it on a TV, but I don't know where that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  fits in. I'm going to make a ruling here that if you're watching on the slate, that's mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Because you can get up and walk around. My wife watching YouTube on her TV is actually TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Okay. But you're right. I don't know what E-Marketer who created this.  Non-Ddupe defined as time spent with each medium individually, regardless of multitasking. I don't  know what I mean. I don't know. I don't know. Video time, daily minutes of watching video  actually is pretty constant. Digital has been growing at the expense of TV, but it hasn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  overall. I'm surprised it's grown so slow. There's only so much TV anybody could watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here you go. Coming up to slide 50. Yeah, that's the one I know. Okay. Okay. 70 million

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  monthly active podcast listeners. That's doubled, doubled, ladies and gentlemen,  over the last four years. I wish our audience had doubled.  Do you think, Leo? What year did you start again, Leo? 2005?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Do you think this is actually a big growth rate? Because when I saw this, I was like,  huh, and Stacey and I were looking at this together and we were both like,  we're not that impressed by that. I mean, it's great to see the growth, but doubling in four  years by comparison to all the other things that have grown fast, I'm just not blown away by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to have to call an audible though on this right hand column. They're claiming  that Apple knows how many podcasts downloads there are. Apple does not. So this number,  she's misunderstood. This might be based on Apple's charts, which are based on subscriptions  and are heavily weighted for recent subscriptions. That's why we're not on here.  We have more downloads, I'm sure than some of these, but that's not how it works.  This is not, this is not the most downloaded Apple podcasts, but it doesn't matter because  these are very big podcasts. That's for sure, but they're not the most downloaded

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because Apple doesn't know that. I wonder. Yeah. I also wonder if these two data bits are  totally separate, don't really relate to each other. They're just two snapshots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. She threw this in to give you an idea. So, oh, that's a podcast. Oh, I know the Daily.  Right. Oh, that's a podcast. The Daily is claiming two million Daily listeners. So that's a big  number. That's a lot of the growth right there. Multiply that times 52 weeks times 510. Actually,  yeah, that's actually more listeners than the monthly active. Okay. Yeah, that would make sense.  Yeah. Half of the monthly active listeners are listening to the Daily, essentially. Amazon Echo  installed base, big growth there, doubled in a year. So did the Echo Skills. In fact, that is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hockey stick almost of Echo Skills. Yeah. Well, Amazon, if you've been following any of their  developer blog, actually Stacey and I look at that on a weekly basis, and they have made it so easy  to build skills with their blueprints. I mean, you could be in grade school and make an Echo  Skill at this point. I'm not saying it shouldn't count or it should count. That's irrelevant.  The point is they have just really made it simple, far simpler. I think. How does anyone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  discover a skill? That's the real question. That is the hard part. That is the hard part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The discovery mechanism on Amazon's site is not that great. We ought to do more of this on the  IoT podcast and highlight some of our favorites on a regular basis or new ones. Yeah, it's really,  really difficult. How many of those skills are actually used on a daily basis? For example,  I'd love to see that number. I would think that percentage is pretty low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll skip through the international growth, except to say, yeah, she has a whole section on that. It's  big. It's growing. It's fast. This is about images. This is fascinating. The annual new photos taken,  it's going up. It's going up fast. The Instagram monthly active users growing up even faster.  Instagram is now one million monthly active users. The number of photos taken globally  is somewhere around a trillion, up from under 0.7 trillion four years ago.  She also points this out that more than half of all tweet impressions contain  images of some kind. Which is amazing. Images or other video. It was just text.  We get to slide 86. There's a funny quote. Okay. I can get there by pressing the button fast.  Kevin Seistrom. Kevin. Oh yeah. Creator of Instagram. People have always been visual.  Our brains are wired for images. Writing was a hack, a detour. Pictorial languages are how  we all started to communicate. We're all coming full circle. I've heard a little of this, a  variation of this for years. I remember Trey Radcliffe, the photographer said, thanks to  Instagram and Facebook and Google Plus, that people are learning to communicate again with  images. That images communicate better and more. But not as precisely, I might add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't think writing was like there wouldn't, if we had Instagram, we wouldn't be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  writing. No. No. It's a lot. I mean, have you ever put something together using a IKEA manual,  which is all pictorial? It's not fun. There are some things the precision of writing is a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  better for. Have you guys ever looked at your Twitter analytics or similar service?  Looked at the engagement of the tweets with images that you send out versus the tweets  without images. I've actually done A-B testing using the same text with and without a tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh wow. Images are much better. But we knew this years ago with blogs, right? A blog post that has  an image in it does much better than a blog post that's just text. But I love Mary's sense of humor  because she puts in this slide, which is worth more, a picture or 1000 words. Here's a picture  of little ducklings jumping into the water and a thousand words about ducklings, which is really,  frankly, got a lot more information. So maybe a picture isn't worth a thousand words,  or it just depends on whether it's a picture of, I don't know. I think that's pretty funny of  Ms. Meeker. Interactive gaming, not growing as fast as I thought. The number of players  globally is only up 5% year over year. It's almost half of the world though.  Oh yeah. Good point. It's more than 2 billion. Okay. Nevermind. 2.4 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is kind of fair to be a little astonished by this because mobile gaming has really grown quite  a bit. That's what it is. Yeah. So yeah. Fortnite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Let's see. Epic Fortnite cross-platform evolution versus registered users. Some of these,  you know, I'm not, I'm sure, does Ms. Oh, there's Ninja. Ninja got a shout out. Discord registered  users. Look at that jump from almost nothing two years ago to somewhat over 200 million, 250 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I wish they could filter out the non-gamers that use discord. Like my study group at school,  we use discord. A lot of people use discord. It's not just gaming. I agree. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Any more than Twitch and this is the Twitch slide is just about gaming. We're on Twitch.  She talks about Fortnite and Battle Royale.  Freemium business. I guess she's come back to this. Freemium gaming. In just the gaming context.  Right. Just in gaming. All right. I don't want to go through this whole thing one by one. Give me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  some other. 185. Okay. Hey, halfway through. Kevin, do you have any before that? I'm scrolling  through real quick, but I don't think I have any before that. We do this every year. One of these

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  days, I'll figure out a better way to do this. There's so much information in here, but it is,  I think it's a value. I think it's become a valuable yearly exercise. It's just kind of the  state of the internet or the state of technology. Here's the perception of the internet. So you hear,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if you listen to media, allow me my moment here. If you listen to media, oh my God, the internet and  social media are ruining lives. They're ruining society. It's all a mess. Oh my Lord. Sky is  falling. This is just awful. However, a Pew survey asked when you add up internet advantages,  disadvantages of the internet. Sorry. When you add, yeah, it has been blank for me and society.  Mostly good. For me, 88% say it's mostly good. That's down 2% from four years ago, but still

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a big number. That's margin of error, folks. Yeah. And for society, 70%. Yeah. Right. The internet  is still a good. The vast majority of people thinks on balance it's a good. And I think, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we'd all say that. Yeah. But not if you listen to, I mean, you know, you watch the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wine. I'm wine all the time about social media and stuff, but I think there's just no question  that in balance, you should say that more often. Damn it. I do. I say it a lot. I would, I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  not allow to live in a world without the internet. And if you go to one 88, you see a contrast of  quotes of where we could be headed, where you see, I'm sorry, the wrong slide, right slide.  Nevermind. There's another slide later. Nevermind. That's good. Pass it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Internet regulation, open internet, why it's a good thing.  Online reviews can boost multi-sided accountability. She gives us an example.  Airbnb 70% of guests leave a review, which I think I think that's actually a very powerful. Yeah.  Yeah. That review system, if it's, if it's verified works quite well, it works well on Airbnb  because you can't leave a review unless you stay there. It doesn't work quite as well on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe Amazon should require this. I'm one of, I'd love for somebody to study  Uber where your motivation is to leave sterling reviews, even for bad drivers. So you don't get  a bad review. Two-sided reviews is fascinating. Yeah. Yeah. Well, Airbnb is two-sided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if they put in some measure to keep, like when the landlord does the review, if,  if she's not allowed to see what your review was first or something like that, that would be a  good idea. Interesting. Yeah. Social media is important for Pew survey. 69% say getting the  government to pay attention to issues. 67% say creating sustained movement for social change.  58% say influencing government policy decisions. It's a good, I don't know if this would be,  if anybody would think social media was useful in government and pre-Trump.  Oh, yeah. Black lives matter. Okay. Good. You're right. There you go. And of course the Arab spring.  There you go. Okay. Well, it's not, it's not the first, it's not my go-to way to go contact  my Congressman or should it be? Oh, I, yeah. I tweet your, tweet your member of Congress.  You bet. Okay. I guess they're paying attention. Yeah, they're paying attention. Just like brands  pay attention to Twitter, even though I think it's, its importance is outsized compared to the actual,  its actual importance. But, well, this is a food for thought. That's most of what I have. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin, did you have anything else? No, I mean, we were kind of interested in, in what's going on in  China in general, but I mean, as you said earlier, Jeff, tons of growth opportunity, just about  everything that Mary talks about there will be dwarfed here in the U S by what happens in Asia  between internet speeds, usage, so on and so forth. So one example there was, I remember,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I couldn't remember the names of these services. There were group buying services many years ago,  10, 12 years ago. Yeah, they're still around. Yeah. But nobody really used them. You know,  they're just like mass drop. I think it's called. Yeah. That's kind of stuff. China, one of them,  you know, huge gigantic things that we, we didn't scale. They're now scaling.  Uh, there's a lot here about, about work and on demand work, a lot about health. Here's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  disappear. This is a disappointing slide to me. The number of sites supporting two factor  authentication has actually gone down over the last few years. That's really disappointing to  me. I would, I would have hoped that that, that would have been a, a completely different direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's just, that's just odd. I have a horror story to share, but it's my thing. So I will  wait till the very end and it relates exactly to this. Oh, okay. Okay. Uh, cyber warfare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was good thing conversation there. Yes. Yes. I have a good thing too. So stay tuned.  All right. So thank you, uh, Mary and you, Mary Meeker. Yeah. I think one of the better, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  presentations this year, lots of, I really, I really think it was very good. Yeah. I was,  I was glued to, Oh, I didn't watch her, but I, but I went through the PowerPoint. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's working on the next one already. Good Lord. Yes. She only has 333 days to create those slides.  Yep. One slide a day. Get going girl. I showed you, they brought you by WordPress. See, if I  were creating a great presentation or a great talk, uh, I would want to put that on my personal  website as just another data points. Then when people Google my name, they go to my website.  That's the first thing that shows up. That's the place, your home on the internet where you show  your best work, whether you're an individual or a business is your website. Everybody needs a website.  Everybody has my campaign. Everybody needs a website and WordPress is the place. It's the  best place to make your website, wordpress.com. They do the hosting. They have powerful site  building tools, thousands of themes. And if you ever run into a problem or a question, they have  full time support 24 seven from actual WordPress experts, 300 strong. And they're just great.  They're just great. WordPress.com. Let's anyone pursue whatever it is they love by launching a  site that's free to start and has room to grow. That's that really, since the day Matt Mullenweg  started WordPress, that was always the plan. WordPress was created so anyone can publish  their ideas. There are no gatekeepers. You own your content forever. And it's fine to be on  Facebook and Twitter and medium and everywhere else. But if you don't have your own site,  you're missing out. And if you're a business without a website, what the heck WordPress.com.  I go to, I sometimes I see business sites like in other places and it's like, come on, you know,  this could look so much better, so much more professional. That's why I use it. Leo Laporte.com.  I've been there for 12 years. WordPress has no two week trials, no hidden fees. You own your content  forever, free to start, but it'll build. It gets built to grow with you to get you wherever you  want to be tomorrow. And it's so flexible and powerful. Some of the biggest companies on the  earth use wordpress.com to build their websites. Not only we talked to Harry McCracken, he said,  yeah, fast company. It's our content management system. Fortune.com, Quartz, millions of people,  big and small use wordpress.com every day to turn their dreams into reality. When it's time to create  a new website or your first website or a gift for somebody just coming into the world, this is the  new coming out party, create a website and gift it to them. WordPress.com slash twig. You'll get  15% off any new plan purchase. WordPress.com slash twig. We thank WordPress so much for  supporting this week in Google. They're a great, great partner. And we thank you for supporting  us by using that URL. WordPress.com slash twig. Google has bought 270 companies in the last  decade, or actually in the 2000s, compared to a much smaller number of acquisitions by Facebook.  Is there anything to say about that? I just like the production is beautiful of this. This is from  the privacy project, Tim Wu. Big tech companies like Google and Facebook are in the reality  products of hundreds of mergers. And they have this great graph showing how Google became Google  or Alphabet by acquiring 270 companies over two decades. But the problem is they present this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  under the ages of privacy. And a lot of these acquisitions are back end technology,  double click, presentation technology, advertising technology. Most of these do not bring users and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  user data with them. I did see, and let me see if I can go back and find that article because I did  bookmark it, really a good analysis of why modern, why current antitrust law can be effectively used  against or in these big technology companies. And let me see if I can find it.  I hope I bookmarked it because I want to give you the exact quote.  I think I didn't. But the point was, here's the criterion. Was that acquisition done  because it's a sensible growth to the business or to stop a competitor or put a competitor out of  business or to keep that competitor from becoming a problem? And he says, if we use that acid test,  and he says, if we use that acid test, that's a good way to judge whether these acquisitions are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sensible or not. Where do you stand on T-Mobile's print?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a big one going on right now. And now just how many state attorneys, state attorney generals,  10 I think, are suing, trying to stop it, making the, I guess, reasonable claim that  with only three big phone companies, it would be roughly a third, a third, a third,  AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint. There's not enough competition. I don't know. That's a lot.  Three companies is not a monopoly. It's more cable companies than I have.  Yeah. And I think you could also make the case that Sprint and T-Mobile are weak,  third and fourth, by themselves. And that allows Verizon and AT&T really to stomp all over them.  And if you want 5G to take off, you're going to need somebody strong enough  to do the very hard thing that's 5G, which is putting in double the number of towers.  All right. You just convinced me.  I have, I mean, I think I'm a little biased because I'm a T-Mobile customer.  And I would love to see a better, stronger T-Mobile. I think T-Mobile's done a lot of good.  I hate things. Some of the things T-Mobile does, for instance, zero rating is a very,  very bad thing. It's against net neutrality and they zero rate a lot of services,  but they also got everybody else to lower their costs, to provide decent international plans.  I think they're scrappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm behind on this question because I remember the old days of the radically incompatible  standards they use. Are all the phone companies now?  Yeah. LTE.  Relatively interchangeable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There still is that CDMA, GSM, golf, but any modern phone uses LTE and that's what they all  support. And 5G will be the same way. It will be across all platforms. So the world is moving  towards it. We're past that.  Yeah, we're past that. We're moving away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it was mostly a US thing, Jeff. I mean, most companies around the globe were not. I  think there was only one other major CDMA. I can't remember.  Japan was CDMA.  Was it Japan? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So these lawsuits are essentially, the FCC chairman came out in favor. The Department of  Justice said, well, we don't think so. And these Democratic Attorneys General filed suit, all 10  of them, because if the merger goes through, the prices consumer pay for phone plans would rise  because there'd be one fewer competitor. I don't think that that's true. Sprint is so weak. I  don't think anything Sprint does. It's like, how does that impact what AT&T's pricing is?  That just doesn't make sense. I think if you have three strong competitors,  that's better than two strong competitors and two weak competitors.  Right.  So I don't think I agree. The lawsuit may not stop the merger, but the Times says it could  delay the deal significantly. They wanted to close it by next month. That ain't going to happen.  Federal regulators might fast track it, but the courts have it. And you know how long that's  going to take. The Attorneys General say that the merger would cost T-Mobile and Sprint subscribers  $4.5 billion. Low income and minority communities would be hit especially hard. It's exactly the  consumer harming job killing mega-merger our antitrust laws are designed to prevent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These days everything costs $4.5 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, everything. Literally. Everything. It's just the new normal.  I'm in favor of it, but I understand that competition is critical, but  I don't think this is a bad thing, especially when you have companies that aren't doing very well.  Remember exactly how many satellite radio companies are there in America?  There used to be two. Sirius and XM were both about to go out of business.  So they were allowed to merge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, better than that, they were one company. The government insisted they be split up into two,  which means that neither had the full, and to this day don't have the full range of  frequency that they could have had if they had stayed one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The good news there is that the competition to satellite radio is terrestrial radio,  and there's plenty of competition there, and your iPhone. But I don't know. I think we should,  I'm in favor of the merger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have the same bias as you as a happy T-Mobile customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd love to see it be stronger, and I want it to be strong in 5G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As a Verizon customer, I'm for it because I've seen...  You should thank T-Mobile.  I've seen, exactly. I've seen, I got back an unlimited plan because of T-Mobile,  and I haven't seen Sprint affect anything on Verizon or AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh man, this absolutely brought tears to my eyes. This is a story in the New York Times.  You know, the Times makes me crazy because they do things like publish that press release  journalism, the crappiest journalism ever, and then they do this. This was in Sunday's  New York Times magazine, an incredible expose. Do you remember in 2008 when the Universal Studios  back lot burned?  Barely.  Yeah. It was a big deal. It was the town square and Back to the Future and a lot of  Western sets. It might have made more of an impression if you knew that also burned there  a warehouse rented by Universal Music Group that contained the master recordings,  22,000 square feet of more than half a million recordings.  I know as a music lover, Kevin, this has got to affect you. Every single Buddy Holly master  is gone. At the time, Universal downplayed it. Oh, we got copies of everything. The masters,  those were second copies. It's not true. And the only reason that this story is coming out now is  because the man in charge of the warehouse was fired by UMG last year and is now talking.  And it is devastating. There's also a lot of the documents came from a lawsuit UMG filed against  Universal Studios. In discovery, there was a lot of information about what we really lost.  Part of the reason UMG didn't want to tell people is because the artists themselves would have been  livid. Steely Dan, for instance, and there's an anecdote in here about Steely Dan's manager  calling saying, we want our masters. Where are the masters? And it turned out that some of the  masters have been stored somewhere else. So they gave them those, but they didn't mention that a  whole bunch more of those albums are gone. Now, I think to understand the importance of this,  because a lot of people say, well, I can get everybody's Holly song on Spotify or Apple  music right now. What's the big deal? But these are the originals. These are the actual recordings.  And Kevin, maybe you can speak to this, but I know when the Beatles,  Sergeant Pepper was just remastered and Giles Martin went back to the vault, got the tapes,  the eight track tapes with handwritten notes. And they re digitize them with more modern equipment.  The point made in this article is there's stuff on the masters that you couldn't hear on the  masters until more modern technologies came along, allowing us to capture that. Plus, as you know,  from Sergeant Pepper, there's outtakes that were never released that are on the masters.  So this, I don't know, this could make you cry. It was the biggest disaster in the history of  the music business. The things that were lost, Frank Sinatra original recordings,  Etta James original recordings, UMG put out a press release where they mentioned two artists  nobody ever heard of and said, you know, it was people like this. It was people like this and John  Coltrane and Patsy Klein. Almost all of Coltrane's masters from impulse were lost.  Just devastating and they're gone. So there's not much more to say about it. But  it's shameful that UMG was able to hide this for so long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I mean, two contrary thoughts here. One is that in a digital world,  it would never have happened. It never happened. Yeah. Though it says we have to worry about  formats and why storage strategies and other things that it could happen in the sense that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  formats become useless. I should also point out there were digital masters lost as well as  tape masters in storage warehouse. So digital can burn down just as much as, you know, and of course  a vault, things can happen. The originals, there's only one, there only ever is one,  no matter how many copies you make. It just makes me very sad to learn about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of people are probably sitting here because I hear this one, like every time there's a new  remastered album from the Beatles or something. Why you buy that? Exactly. Don't you already have that?  You do have that. You don't have exactly that, if it makes sense, because they can,  you mentioned the handwritten notes when Giles Martin went through with the masters and they  spent so much time reading the notes and trying to remaster the original Sergeant Peppers,  the way the Beatles intended it to be, the way they wanted it to be heard, not the way some other  person wanted it to be heard. And if you need a simple comparison, if you're familiar with the  Let It Be album, the Phil Spector Wall of Sound, there's also the Let It Be Naked album, which is  without the wall of sound, vastly different music, even though it is the same music. And that's maybe  not the greatest comparison, but it's a simple one, if you've ever heard the two of them, that you can  understand. It's really, really sad to see this original, and that's what it is, it's original  music. We have copies of everything these days, so you can say, I've got it on my iPhone, but you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  really don't. Well, and there are stuff you don't have copies of. There's outtakes, there's extra  material, there's hundreds, millions of hours lost. The other thing is Martin remixed the mono mix,  so that's really interesting because he had the masters, he had the original tracks,  and he could mix those in stereo from a mono master. That was the big thing with the Beatles,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  sorry, the Beach Boys reissue that came out probably 10 years ago now. A Smiley Smile, what was it?  Well, it had Smile, the two big things were it had extra tracks from Smile, which were never released,  and was a huge, huge thing for the fans. I remember that, that was so awesome. And also,  Brian Wilson was mostly deaf in one ear, so he did everything in mono. So they re-released stuff  in stereo for that. Well, that's what the market demanded. Yeah, exactly. No, they re-released stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I see, they were able to. They were able to re-do it in stereo. It was the other way with  the Beatles. They kind of said, oh, we've got to make a stereo version for the Americas,  because they won't buy mono. So they just kind of threw out a stereo mix. It was terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Notoriously terrible. You've got different people on different tracks.  Right, it was horrible. Paul's in one ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, nobody cared. It was an afterthought. Anyway, yeah, so that's the story. I mean,  there's nothing to say except that this is just one more example of why the music industry sucks,  and that these record labels were just, they didn't care, really. They really didn't care.  It's sad. Read the articles, really well done.  The information for the litigation is pretty funny, because they talk about a New Jersey  warehouse that UMG also owned that the upstairs tenant of a food service company loaded too many  pallets of salad dressing into its storage hole, which caved in the ceiling above the vault,  ruptured a pipe, collapsed sheetrock, dangling electricity lines, hundreds of shattered salad  dressing bottles, and a foot of water in a vault that contained 350,000 master tapes,  including the entire Motown catalog. They actually were able to save a lot of those,  but thank God, but they didn't save anything from the universal fire. Mamas and the Papas,  universal fire. Mamas and the Papas, Joni Mitchell, a ton of stuff, Tom Petty.  I just thought I'd bring that up. There is a tech angle in the sense that we have digitized this  stuff, but the problem is there's always better technology. These tapes especially contain a lot  more information than you can create in a recording, in a performance. Even stuff as  recent as Sheryl Crow, stuff was lost. So there you have that. Let's do some Google changing of  the logging, shall we? Play the trumpets. Here's a huge one. The Google Assistant is now available  in ways. What took them so gosh darn long? It feels like they bought, this is an example of  where Google probably bought a company to keep them from becoming too big, right?  No, no, no. They wanted the technology. They've really not used it well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but here's what they did. At IO a couple years ago, I talked to Waze people and I tried to talk  to Waze people when I was working with a newspaper company to work with them. I think they were left  alone so that they would develop new stuff. Waze as a product is magnificent. It's not a case where  everything that AOL bought and others like that, but CompuServe bought and Yahoo bought and all  those companies in the past, they've ruined everything. Waze is far from ruined. Waze is  improved much. It's better because they left them alone in Israel to develop. I'm not defending  Google in this case. I'm just saying that Waze is brilliant. You got to look at how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and the nice thing now in Android Auto, you can use Waze or Google Maps, which is really nice.  I think anybody who commutes knows that Waze is the superior experience from that point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can say things like, hey, gee, I want to report traffic or find me a route without tolls.  I wonder if Waze will do things like find me the nearest Starbucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope so. That's an interesting take on it because I was hoping they would incorporate  all of those great Waze features into Maps. But that's an interesting point of view. They

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  wanted to preserve it. It's weird too because you want to get so used to something. My son Jake  uses Maps. I use Waze. I don't know all the tricks because you've got to know the tricks well because  you're not going to be screwing around with UI when you're driving. I use Waze religiously and  I just don't know from Maps unless I'm walking. Is there a real problem with taxis in India?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Because Google has introduced a new alert for you when your taxi goes off route.  He's taking you somewhere else, but it's initially rolled out in India. Maybe that's just where  they're testing it. But your phone will alert you if your ride goes off route by 500 meters or more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they being overcharged?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it's for overcharging. I was thinking kidnapping. You're right. It's more like  he's taking the long way. He's taking the long way alert. It is available in India.  Maybe it'll be offered in other places. But I really do see it. This is what I think. Google  is doing a lot of good things in Maps. Waze felt like it was a little bit behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if you're ever in cabs or Ubers, but do you find yourself sometimes going ahead  and train on Waze just to track and make sure that they're taking the right route or how long

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's going to take you or that kind of stuff? Cabs I never worry. Well, maybe I do. I should worry.  I guess Uber you know they're not going off route because they have the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I just sit back and relax. You're not paying more for the Uber if they go off route.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I just figure my feeling is they drive this every day. They know the best way to go.  Especially from the airport. You'll get in a cab from JFK to Manhattan. I know you probably have  this happen all the time, Jeff, because you probably make that trip monthly, daily, weekly.  But they'll, you know, they're on the highway and they go, oh crap. And then just go off on the side  roads up on the, up there on the, you know, by the houses. And I feel so bad for the people  live there because all these cabs are going, it's all cabs. But I'm never, I'm not going to say no.  First of all, I'm not, I'm just not going to say no period. Any cabbie.  But they're probably using Waze. That's the thing.  Yeah. It looks like a Waze detour. Definitely.  What did I have here? Oh, I am sad to say, did you ever use Google trips? I like this idea. I  thought, and then what, it's not very old. They were going to use it kind of as a TripIt substitute,  but now it's dead. It will be incorporated, they say, into Google's travel, new travel search page.  But after August 5th, if you're using Google's trips, which I did because I really liked it,  no more. It would grab flight ticket and hotel booking information from your Google inbox,  set up a trip in the app, make other suggestions saying, I know you're going to Rome. Here's some  restaurants you might like. I thought it was very useful. Google apparently has a new  page that's going to replace this. This is reminding me how much I miss inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they just kill stuff. I was just going to say that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it wasn't just that, but they also, the trip part of inbox was brilliant.  Oh. They brought all this stuff together in one discussion that would add more value. It was great.  Yeah. Yep. And Gmail is just so frigging ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sometimes change the log is things going away, not just new things. And in fact, according to  a guy named Kevin Toffle, the pixel slate Celeron edition is going away too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, it is. I hear that's a WordPress blog, by the way.  Is it? It's very attractive. It's very attractive. And you don't apparently like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  me using an ad blocker. That must be a WordPress plugin. I'm going to turn off my ad blocker.  Cause no, that was the GDPR, but you just, I click the GDPR, but at the bottom there was an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, did I? Yeah. I have my little personal note there, but, but yes, um, as the side,  the pixel slate Celeron, which probably should have never been launched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You couldn't even buy it right for, I mean, it was like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It wasn't long. It was not long. Uh, I think it was on the market until about a week after the bad  reviews of that particular model came out. And it's a darn shame because not because of the  Celeron going away. That probably should, as I said, it just doesn't have the horsepower to handle  that type of device 3000 by 2000 pixels and so on. But that gave all of the pixel slate line a bad  name and it's a much improved device now. Um, so it's a, it's a real darn shame that that happened.  It probably never should have, you can't get one anymore anyway. So they probably did it so that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they'd have a 599 starting price, but they've actually taken care of it anyway, by reducing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the price of the other models, right? Yes. Yes. Uh, and I don't know if that's temporary, but yes,  the prices have come down on all the other models. Um, they, I agree with you because when they talked  about the slate, they said it's coming, it'll, it'll be a rent. It'll start at 599. So that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  probably why they had to do that. And yeah, because they, I don't know. They know I was  going to say they think we're stupid, but it's not, they know that the headline will say 599.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not rocket science. People over, you know, over, uh, under promise and over delivery, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yep. Everybody done it. You have one more there, Leo, that I wanted to mention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google photos. Yeah, that's bad. Will no longer sink. You think it's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do. I think a lot of people really want to automatically stop. It won't automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem was, so I accidentally said yes to that. And my drive is now filled with photos  that are in photos anyway. Right. So I don't want that. So users can choose to sync photos to drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why would you do that? It's a second copy and it's eating up your storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not necessarily. The, the, the photos are technically stored on drive. This is really, um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or at least they used to be, but you have unlimited storage for Google photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I think the bigger issue is having to use two apps. Um, some people just want to go into  drive and get all their drive stuff. What's, what's different about photos that they have to be on  their own UI and all that. Right. It really should be optional. Uh, and it was confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unlike this was for G suite. This was for G suite. G suite users do not have the option to show  photos from my drive in Google photos, but you can choose to sync photos to drive so that when  you upload a file of photos is automatically uploaded to the folder in Google photos folder and  drive. Once these changes go into effect, this photo with this folder will no longer get updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I don't think this is just for G suite because there's a link that like in that story from the,  the Google blog, the G suite updates, there's a helpful link that takes you to the keyword,  which is their main blog. Right. And they're not really saying G suite only here. Well, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We heard feedback that you just were confused. Yeah, I am now confusing. And I get exactly what

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff is saying because, you know, if you on drive, if you have the information pane on and it shows  your most recently updated files, all of a sudden you've uploaded some photos from your phone  automatically. It's all the most. Yeah. Yeah. It's all tons of images. And they're like, what is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Starting in July, new photos and videos from drive will not automatically show in photos.  Similarly, new photos and videos in photos will may not added to the photos for link drive  photos and videos you delete and drive will not be removed from photos.  Items you delete and photos will not be removed from drive.  So I'm still puzzled. Why is that the only reason people would put their photos in drive  is so that they have that available when they make presentations or stuff. Why don't you just say,  here's your photos and do you want to see your photos and photos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Maybe it should link to just photos that Google economy done with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll give you another place you can get them. So this, this, this is under the G suite updates.  Is this only for G suite customers? No, no. It's also under the normal updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. Thanks. If you look in their normal, everybody next month, but it would only affect

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  people who are intentionally copying photos to drive those who enabled the Google photos.  Yeah. Yes. It's not on by default, right? No. No. And it does make sense to simplify it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Their explanation was very simple and confusing. I ain't doing it no more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google celebrating for the second year in a row, 100% running on renewable energy.  Now that's a little deceptive because of course they're not, but they're buying credits, I guess.  Right. Yeah. So there, so what it really is that during 2018, their purchases of energy from  sources like solar and wind once again matched our entire electricity consumption.  So in Mountain View, they get the, I presume they get their electricity from this Mountain  View electric company, PG&E, which is generated by a variety of means, including diesel, wind, water,  coal. I don't know if we have any coal plants in California, but hamsters, whatever it can,  but what they do is they buy offsets so that they buy as, I don't even, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Excuse me. It's confusing because electricity is electricity, no matter how it's produced.  Right. Like I pay for wind generated here in Pennsylvania, I pay a few extra cents per  kilowatt hour. I'm getting the same electricity as my next door neighbor who doesn't get wind power.  I mean, it's, yeah. So it's a shell game of sorts. They should do it. It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's better that way. See, I have solar panels on my roof,  so I know that the electricity comes from there into my house. Actually it doesn't because it  then goes from there into my house and up to the PG&E, it snarfs it up and then gives me money.  And that's the Google change law.  Ah, such sad news. We talked about this on Sunday. Maker Faire is closing its doors as is Make  Magazine. Though there's some good news. Everybody's favorite VR maven Palmer Lucky says,  I'd buy it. Did he? Not yet. He's kind of, you know, he might be a big talker. I don't know.  This is nuts. He tweets to Dale Dowherty, some friends and I would love to help save Maker Media.  I love Maker Faire and I've been a Make reader since literally the first issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. I hope so. Well, that was five days ago and I haven't heard that he's bought it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they all 20 staffers were laid off. I'm sad to say I am a huge fan. And what's really sad  is they were doing well. They made their ticket goals for their most recent Maker Faire.  The magazine was beloved for 15 years. 15 years? Wow. Yeah. And it really created a Maker movement,  I think. But it's been tough. Dowherty, who we've had on our shows, he's a great guy.  They're just up the road a piece. It's going to try to get some way to keep the Make online  archive running and allowing third parties to license the name to throw affiliated events. So  they're not going for bankruptcy, rather assignment for benefit of creditors process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does it say how much debt he's in? The company had raised $10 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The magazine had 125,000 paid subscribers, 1 million YouTube subscribers, 1.45 million people  attended its events in 2016. I think what was really bad is that it never was able to make money  without sponsorships. And they had some big sponsorship pullouts, Microsoft and Autodesk  pulled out before this year's flagship Maker Faire. And I bet you that was it. They just, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sometimes... Yeah, one bump of the road and the tire is gone. Yeah. But jeez, I thought that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  such a great thing. And I have a lot of Maker books and magazines. We've interviewed many of them.  You actually make stuff. Make people. I don't make anything. I sit in my underwear and watch TV.  On the phone. Yeah, on my little phone. According to Merry Maker.  We are actually, but of course we're older, right? So the older demographic, we're going to be doing  an old fashioned thing. I have more TVs in the house than I have phones and I have a lot of phones.  I don't know what any of that just meant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go. Jeff's got a trio of phones in his hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. See, I have a TV. I have, actually it's kind of embarrassing. I don't have TVs in the  bathrooms yet. We have one. I have TVs pretty much everywhere else. Good. Well,  you're a former TV guide critic, so it's okay. It's okay for you. There's so much, there's too  much good TV. I don't, I can't keep up. So I have to watch more. Fortnite Maker Epic Games  acquires house party this morning. We don't know by how, for how much. House party has kind of an  interesting story. This, do you remember Meerkat? Yeah. Remember? Sure. And Jeff Needles, who used  to work for us, was like so into Meerkat we all kind of got into it, allowed you to stream live  video. And then the company that started Meerkat shut it down saying, yeah, it's failing because  it had a lot of, it was one of those things that had a big uptake and then nobody used it after a  while. And I think that he went on to do house party. That was their pivot. They took some of  the same technology and created house party. In fact, here's the article from 2016 from The Verge,  Meerkat built a new app in secret and almost 1 million people are using it. It's house party.  It's basically Meerkat for groups, kind of like hangout, group hangouts, but it's done all right.  And as of 2016, they had a million users. Jeff Needles, by the way, continued to work for house  party and was very happy this morning because- Really? Yes. Well, he made the right choice. He  left us to go to work for them. Epic does Fortnite. And I think what's really interesting  about this is many people think that Fortnite is actually a social network more than a game,  including me, that for the 12 year olds who play it and every 12 year old plays it,  it's the lobbies and the socializing that occur in Fortnite are really a big part of the game.  So house party kind of makes sense. It is a video chat that they could perhaps build into  Fortnite. CEO Tim Sweeney says, by teaming up, we can build even more fun shared experiences than  what could be achieved alone. House party says, nothing's going to change. The app will stay the  same, but I suspect what you'll see is house party integrated into Fortnite. And this is  this is how you disrupt companies like Facebook. You don't try to make another Facebook.  Right. I would say this is one, one, a company to watch.  Did you read the article from kev.net? Why you probably don't need reCAPTCHA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tried, but good Lord, it goes on forever. So I was hoping you would just explain it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will explain it to you. His basic position is you probably don't need it if you run a website.  People use reCAPTCHA to prevent robotic logins, automated logins by spammers and things like that.  It's a Google service that's free. So a lot of people use it, but Google gets a lot of  information from it. And as it resonated with me, because I'm pissed off at the new traffic sign.  Is this a car capture? Remember you've seen the grid of such a pain. It's horrible. And it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  training Google's automated vehicles for free. Yeah. It's machine learning. We're doing the work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm doing all the work for Google for free. And so his point is that that you're giving Google a  lot of privacy information. Plus you're giving them machine learning for free. What privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  information to give them just because Google? Well, they know you're there. They see you. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google, I use Brave and turn off all those pixels. So there was a debate I read on Hacker  News about this article about whether you really need to use reCAPTCHA and not his position is it  doesn't. There's lots of other ways to prevent robotic sign ins. Many developers vastly overestimate  the likelihood of customized spam. He says he also offers some reCAPTCHA alternatives  that are well known. And of course it's a back and forth battle between spammers.  But I kind of agree. I feel I just, I mean the old capture was so such a pain in the butt  anyway. Now they've added all these images. It's even more painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to some very, very small conference with 20 people and they have me sign,  you know, register and put my stuff in this fund. Nobody ever goes to this page ever for any reason  and they have a reCAPTCHA. Yeah. It's just kind of automatic. What robot is going to sign up for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the conference? Yeah. And there are other ways to do that. And other captures. So I kind of,  I kind of agree. If you're Twitter or Facebook, no capture will solve all your issues for everyone  else. He still, he writes, there are still a lot of simple tools and heuristics that go a long way  in helping to stop abuse. Be kind to your users and try, and try your best not to force them to  spend their free time completing reCAPTCHAs for Google. They, they will appreciate it. Kevin Davis.  I agree. I will appreciate it. Drives me nuts. Have I Been Pwned is for sale Troy  Hunt, who was the security researcher who created one of the single most useful services out there.  If you haven't used Have I Been Pwned, give it a shot. It allows you to enter your email address.  Actually, let me go to it just to show you real quickly. It allows you to enter your email address  and you'll see if you are in one of the massive breaches that corporations have reported. And by  the way, my email address has been pwned on 28 breach sites and found in two pastes.  So there's also though, I think an even more useful tool where you can enter a password  and see if that password is among the half billion real word passwords exposed in data breaches.  And by, so I entered monkey one, two, three, and apparently so did 60,803 other people and they use  it for real passwords. Use your good real secure password, maybe your last pass master password,  something like that, just to make sure people sometimes ask me, well, wait a minute, I shouldn't  put my real password in there, right? Because he gets it. No, the way the JavaScript works and it's  unobfuscated, he does not get it. It's actually a very clever hashing technique that he uses to make  sure to check. He checks against a hash database to see if your hash shows up. So it's safe to do that.  And he has a whole explanation of how that works and so forth. But this is a really good site and  Troy's it's such a good site. A lot of people use it. And Troy says, I just can't, I just can't,  I want to sell it. He created it back in 2013 for free as a kind of a labor of love.  So I just mentioned this because somebody should buy it. So it's a great thing.  Well, but it matters who buys it. Yeah. That's a good point. Somebody good should buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I mean, he's not going to sell it, but he bad. No, I don't think so. Troy's,  Troy's pretty serious, but you don't know who whoever sells it can sell it again. And yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, actually, I don't know. Yeah, that's interesting. It's a hell of a database of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  passwords. Then again, he has a series of seven commitments that he sets forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Saying, you know, saying why this is, this is going to be okay.  And, um, you know, so forth. So he's going to work with KPMG to find an organization that would  fit his requirements. And it really is important. Have I been pwned? So I would hate to see it go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. You've used it. Oh yeah. I get emails every once in a while. Like, hey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  your email address showed up in another breach. And it's built into a one password. I think.  I think I've seen it in Chrome. Maybe I can't remember where else I've seen it, but it's,  yeah, it's great. It'll let you, you know, it's nice to know Chrome has a plugin that will let  you know if your password has been used elsewhere. I think cut password checkup. I don't know if they  use have I been pwned, but that's another great Chrome plugin. Uh, okay. Okay. Anything else? Did  I leave anything out kids? So much stuff. I know it's a giant day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd like to talk about Stadia just for a tiny bit.  Okay. So they should mention it. They rolled out the more information. They figured out who it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for. I didn't. It's for me. It's not for me. It's for you. So Stadia, the announcement was on Monday.  It will launch in November in the U S UK, Canada and 14 other territories, 31 games, 21 publishers.  They have an initial founders edition for a bizarrely overpriced $130.  Bought it.  You get a Chromecast ultra. That's 89 bucks by itself. I already have one. You get this weirdo  wifi controller, although that's a good thing. You don't have to use it for Stadia. You get three  months, uh, Stadia, which will be $10 a month after that. And you also get, um, a game that  you don't want called destiny to that about sums it up. Yeah. The weird thing about Stadia. So it's  one of those, it's like online. It's like guy, Kai. It's a streaming service runs on Google servers,  very powerful servers, has some very nice features. They showed it. They had an event at GDC and they  talked about that. You can run it on anything. Doesn't need a lot of power. In fact, a Chromecast  ultra. So you plug that into your TV. The Chromecast ultra isn't doing anything except streaming the  game. Your, your controller, which is wifi is talking directly to the server. So there's low  latencies supposedly, although state really the proof will be in the pudding depending on your  internet service provider. The weird thing is it's not a streaming service in the sense. A lot of  them are where you get access to a bunch of games. You have to buy literally outright by the game

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to play it. Right. So, so this is a little different than the Microsoft version, which is what

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  game pass. Yeah. You pay a monthly fee. You get access to a hundred games, a hundred games. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was just looking at it today because I have an X-Box, uh, collecting dust right now. I'm a member.  Yeah, it's good. Yeah. So yes, this is different in that. Yeah. You're getting destiny too, and all  the content for it. Um, Google has not said what other content you will get for free as part of this,  uh, premium service. You will also, there's gate three will, will ship pretty exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like Baldur's gate, but all right. It's a fun enough game. I mean, yeah, yeah. So also a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  farming simulator 19. I can pass on that one. Um, the thing is a lot of people are getting worked  up appropriately for the $10 a month and I still have to buy my games effectively. Yes. But the  pro service is literally the first part that's launching in November. And that will give you  4k 60 frames per second service for your games. And a service provider allowing. Well, that's a  whole nother issue with the whole caps we can, but that's not Google's issue. That's individual's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  issue. Well, it's my issue if I buy it, I still have to get through my internet service. You'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  be able to play for 65 hours. Oh, that's good. Yeah. Yeah. That's a lot of Baldur's gate. Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in 2020, the subscription part of it will be free. If you want to drop down to 10 ADP,  60 frames per second streaming better, frankly, for streaming. Yeah. I mean, you're going to go  through your caps much slower. Number one, and if you don't have a 4k TV, what's the point and so  on and so forth, you can drop out of the service. It's a month to month thing. So you can switch  back and forth. You don't lose your content. If you drop from one service to the other or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  leave for three months. Um, I mean, I feel like given the competition from Sony and Xbox,  this is a non-starter. I don't even understand. I think Google's going to give up on this in three  months. Let me, let me explain to you. Okay. We know the market now. Karsten Bondi once again. Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  just to, to, to go back a little bit, my son, uh, Zach is 14 and he has been ridiculing this  since they first announced. He has, he even made a video. He thinks it's the dumbest idea ever.  It's not for him until, until there was another announcement at E3, Ubisoft announced that they  are going to be streaming their entire catalog, their entire PC catalog to they're going to,  for $14 a month, you can get their entire, it's either streaming or download, um, on Steam and  Stadia. Oh, so, oh, that does change things a little bit. We are a gaming household, but we don't  have a gaming PC. What, but you know, honestly, we have all the consoles, but we don't have a  gaming PC. So that is who this is for console gamers who want to play two years of Stadia.  You could afford to buy an Xbox. Uh, yeah. An Xbox, not how many, how many hours of, of how many  years is it going to cost me to buy a $2,000 gaming? So you think this will be better than an Xbox?  I think this will be better than a gaming PC. You're renting a gaming PC essentially.  You're renting a gaming PC. It gets automatically updated every year. You don't have to buy a new  gaming PC every two years. Um, and I don't have to play PC games on my 24 inch monitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can play it on a 70 inch TV or your phone or my phone or a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Okay. I did not two weeks ago. I had no idea who this service was for. Now I know it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for me. It's a gaming PC. It's a gaming PC. Now we should say you have obviously some sort of magical

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  internet service. I have Sonic. Yeah, you do in fact have magical internet service, which, um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is what is the minute? What is the bandwidth you need for 4k? 50 megabits. I'm not going to have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's, I'm not going to get, I'm probably not going to buy this day one. I'm going to get the free tier  and then I'm going to get, see what 1080 looks like. I'm going to get Ubisoft streaming service  or Activision streaming service or what, because that's the next five years of gaming is every  major gaming platform is going to offer a streaming service. So in about six months, when this comes  out, Carson's going to stop shaving. Yeah. Well, I already stopped shaving. Oh, he already did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's going to come into work a little bleary. I've been playing Baldur's Gate three. It's amazing.  Okay. I guess that, you know, again, the only issue is your bandwidth and Google doesn't control  that. So it's, it's, it's caps, you know, my, I have a terabyte and a half cap and I want to do  other things besides playing Stadia two hours a day on my internet access and it's latency and speed.  All of those will really be, your mileage may vary. You're just going to have to see,  but if you do have a magic ISP, if you have a very good ISP with low latency, no bandwidth caps,  high speed, this would be better than a gaming PC. I guess. As soon as Sonic gets fiber to my neighborhood, then I'll be super happy.  Yeah. Fiber will change, will be transformative. Yeah. Okay.  I have fiber, so I'm all in. Yeah. So this is a specialized, maybe 5G. Or, or Elon. Elon's magic.  Will 5G work inside? Yeah. Yeah. They're going to have home, they're going to have home 5G. Yeah.  Cause you'll put something in the window. Actually, that's the only kind of 5G you can get right now is  Verizon's home 5G or business 5G. Yeah. Yeah. But it's a different, anyway, it's a long story. If  next time Stacey's here, I'll let you ask her about it. Google says Chrome is not killing ad blockers.  We've never talked about this one. Yes, we have. It's just trying to make extensions safer, guys.  Why are you, why are you, why are you misunderstanding us? Except that the ad blocker I use on Chrome,  you block origin, won't work. When they, when they update Chrome and with manifest V3.  I think it's reasonable to say that Google is doing this to make you safer. Cause it's going to  change the way plugins work. Google says there's been a lot of confusion and misconception around  both the motivations and implications of this change, including speculation. These changes were  designed to prevent or weaken ad blockers. That's absolutely not the goal. It's just a nice side  effect. He didn't say that part, but it is a side effect. So maybe they're making, I suspect before  it happens, they're going to make some changes to perhaps make it possible. Gore Hill who creates  C block origin is obviously not very happy. There will be, and it's interesting opera, Vivaldi, Brave,  other browsers that use Chromium, the open source Chrome have said, well, we're not going to  implement that part of it. We're not going to do it because they all want to have ad blockers.  In fact, Brave is an ad blocking browser. All right. I think, I think, I think we're flagging  here. I think we need an infusion of advertising and then we've hit our data caps. Yeah, I've hit  my data cap and then we will get picks and numbers and things like that. But first a word from  Captera. If you have businesses, and I know many of you do, and you use software in your business,  and I know many of you do, and I know many of you using software that is old to put a finer point  on it. It's really old. It is so old that you still have to use IE8 or Windows XP. That's not good.  It's time to get some up to date software. There is up to date, beautifully written,  highly functional business software out there for every business, for every possible application.  And the place to find it is captera.com. 700 categories of businesses, all the big ones,  CRM, IT project management, e-commerce, link management tools, web conferencing. Also,  all the little ones. Are you running a veterinary business? Are you a yoga studio? They've got that  too. Software for every business. What's great is you can find the software you're looking for,  maybe filter it down based on say product rating, user deployment, how many users you can have,  features, whether it's on the web, on your hard drive, that kind of thing. Is there a free trial?  Get a list of filtered suggestions that work for you. What's chemical software? Is that what the  chemical brothers use to make their albums? What is chemical software? I don't know. But hey,  if you use it, you can get all this here. And then here's the best part. They have almost a million  reviews of products by actual users. So every product, you can look at them, compare them side  by side, and then read the reviews to know, oh, that's a CMS, chemical software. It's not for  chemists. I get it. I get it. It's actually, you know what? It's fun to go just browse around  Captera. It's really interesting, all the kinds of software there is out there. And these reviews  are very helpful. More than a thousand new reviews every day. In fact, instead of asking you for  money, because Captera is absolutely free, Captera says, why don't you leave a review?  Pay it forward. We're sharing our knowledge, right? A free directory of business software,  all the latest tools, and real reviews from real customers. Wow. captera.com slash twig,  C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A, captera.com slash twig. I think you're going to find this incredibly useful.  Incredibly useful. Captera, and it's free. captera.com slash twig. Captera is software  selection simplified. And we thank you for their support of this week. And Google, Kevin Tofel,  I got to pick about Chromebooks.com, Kevin's incredible website, all about Chromebooks.  You have a number one fan over here in Jeff Jarvis. And of course, the podcast, the IoT podcast,  he does with Stacey Higginbotham, who is now in Seattle. Who? Yes, she's in Montreal. Actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right now she's in Montreal. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. So, so my pick is more of a public service  announcement. And we talked about security today quite a bit and two factor authentication. In fact,  this week, I don't think we got to it on the show notes, but real quick, you can now use a Google  Android phone as your two factor authentication method to authenticate in Google services on  iOS devices, which you wouldn't think would be too handy, but a lot of Android phone users

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have iPads. How does that work? Is it NFC? It's Bluetooth. Oh, so it's so your Android phone is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  dongle. In a sense. Yeah, nice. Right. So whether you use that Android phone as a two factor  authentication bit, or you buy like I did, I bought the Google Titan security key, which is  like a UV key. It's just a specific implementation Google made. Will you use an authenticator app?  Definitely use two factor authentication. And here's my horror story as to why I do another podcast  on weekends. I've been doing since 2006 with a great guy who writes for ZD net Matthew Miller.  People may know him on Twitter as Palm Solo because he's a huge Han Solo and Star Wars fan.  His phone, I love the internet. His phone was sim hacked, meaning somebody called T-Mobile and  convinced T-Mobile that they lost their sim or whatever and had his phone number transferred  to their sim. Using using two factor authentication text messaging, those folks now have access to  all of his Google accounts, as well as his Twitter account. His verified Twitter account is gone.  The person has removed two years worth of tweets. He will not be able to get it back from Twitter  until they get a response from him from his registered email, which is Gmail, which he doesn't  have access to. So my point here is, and he's very upset about this, and he should be. My point here  don't use text codes for authentication if you can help it. Just please download the Google  Authenticator or the Microsoft Authenticator app. Use that for one time codes, a little more secure.  Use a hardware key or an Android phone or some other physical device to authenticate everything  these days because it's just getting too easy for people to get these text messages and sim card  hacks and so on. And you lose everything. He's distraught. It's just terrible. Who is this?  Matthew Miller, Palm Solo on ZDNet. And if you go to Palm Solo, his verified account is still there.  But now all the tweets from 2015 onward are gone. The person has deleted them. He's livid, livid.  And he and I mean, he should have taken my advice, unfortunately didn't, you know, he probably had  text authentication and such. And it's not his fault that he was sim hacked. That's on the carrier.  You can put, this is another piece of the puzzle, go to your carrier and put a pin number on your  account. Therefore, he didn't have that. If somebody calls and tries to move your phone number to their  sim, they're asked for the pin code and chances are they're not going to get that right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You shouldn't also allow SMS messages for two factor. Sometimes you have to, my bank.  Yeah. Sometimes you have to, but Google doesn't and you know, turn that off, you know, just don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  do that because that's dangerous. And it gets back to the slide Leo that you pointed out how two factor  authentication websites has actually, the number of them has decreased or the percentage. It is sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I cringe when I hear that. Yeah. And so many banks still allow SMS messages. Now they, he was targeted,  right? Because you can't, this is not a general purpose attack. Somebody has to take the trouble  to get your phone number and then call the cell phone company, impersonate you, get them to send  the sin out. So it's somebody targeting him. Correct. Nevertheless, so that, but that doesn't  mean it won't happen to you. It's not a good thing. How did they get the Gmail? Just because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  don't you have to have both the password and the text? Well, that's a good point. I think you can,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if you don't remember your password, one of the, one of the ways to get through is text me a code.  Right. Exactly. Yeah. Phone numbers. I mean, we take them for granted, but people use them a little  or rely on them too heavily for security purposes. And we can't be doing that anymore. Long ago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  not long ago, but last year list NIST finally said, do not use it is not safe to use SMS messages for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  two factor. Now, when I sign on to Google from a new device and it, and it says unlock your phone  and say, yes, that's me. That counts as two factor. It does. It does. It's, it's an app based,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's basically an app based system. So yes. So Google offers a huge variety of two factor  solutions. I have a Yuba key, which I use. This is the Yuba key. So it's on my key chain. So that way  that's a physical dongle. And then you're going to give it a backup. And so you can print out  codes if you want, put them in your drawer. You can use Google authenticator to generate a six  digit number. The more modern way to do it, which I really like in Google started using this is you  can have it send a notification to your phone. That's different from an SMS because it's sending  it over wifi or the internet to the app, which the app then pops up a notification and it says,  did you just log in? Do you want to approve that? And you say approve Microsoft and Google both  offer, which is so much easier too than having to put a number in. It's just great. I far prefer it.  But do go into your Google security. I guess I shouldn't show mine because it has  personal information in it, but go into your Google security.google.com.  Take a look at how it suggests to secure your account. And if two step verification is on,  make sure that it is not on and allowing SMS. You can say no text messages is not one of them. It  shouldn't be a fallback. It shouldn't be anything because if it's a fallback, it's the weakest link  and that's that'll work. And they can, they can SIM jack you and it's, it's not just SIM jacking.  Does he know how they got his, his SIM, his phone number? There's a variety of ways to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He hasn't told me. I mean, I've had little, little contact because I don't even know.  He doesn't, he's probably offline.  Yeah, he's, he's got a new Twitter account temporarily. You know, I've actually asked him  things that he would know only things I've said to him privately, not something I've emailed him or  is available online just to verify it was him.

The more common way is to call your phone company and say, uh, hi, this is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin Toffle and I lost my SIM. Please send me a new one, a new address and the phone company

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because they are after all customer service reps often will say, Oh yeah, sure. What's the address  now? Don't use SMS. That's a good reminder. Thank you.  Is fi any better or worse?  You know, I hope so. Cause that's the number I use is my fi number. I would hope they're smarter.  Put a pin on it though. You're right, Kevin. That's a good thing to do. Cause then at least  the customer service rep will say, well, what's your pin? And that would stymie a hacker, I think  in most cases, Jeff, your number of the week. I was just trying to look up how to put a fit on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  just send me your phone number. Jeff. I'll put the pin on. Yeah, that's right. Actually just tell us

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  open the Google fi app in the account tab under phone settings, click voicemail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's a voicemail. You want an authentication, uh, pin with support. Never mind. They may not.  Who knows if they don't offer it because they don't have any mobile does. In fact,  team mobile got hacked some time ago and they sent text messages to many of their users,  including me saying, put a pin on your account now. So I did, uh, Jeff, you're, you're,

Transcript:  all right. So Facebook watch says they have 140 million daily viewers who watch at least one  minute, but an average of 26 minutes a day, 200, 720 million monthly users compared to 400 million  in 2018. So it's growing. Uh, I don't know. I don't know whether Facebook does, does that include the  videos that come by in my newsfeed? No, no, no, that's a separate channel. So you've got to,  you've got to go to Facebook. Watch. I don't, do you go to Facebook? Watch? You don't even have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook account. I did see yesterday an exclusive of something I would have liked to have watched.  It was only on Facebook watch, but I can't remember what it was because I didn't,  because I can't. So don't, uh, folks, if you want people to watch the exclusives, not a good idea,  but Facebook watch, yes. Surprisingly getting surprisingly traction, but I guess if you have  two and a half billion users or whatever, it's probably not hard to do that. Right. I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  really see, I mean, it's not being promoted in my, in my newsfeed. So it's funny. I just don't think  to go there. I'm going there right now. Oh, no, no, no baby. Dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, so they have, uh, they have Fox news on it. CNN's on it. Uh, it's amazing. They have  700, what is it? 720 million viewers. That's a, that's, that's amazing. And arguing that now the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  um, the best, the best video of, of the year is the, the baby talking to his father.  Is that on Facebook watch? It's on a Facebook watch. Yeah. It's everywhere. You've seen that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you haven't seen that one. All right. All right. Can you find it? Yeah, I could play it.  You want to watch it? Oh, you do want to watch this. This is, this is, uh, this is, uh, from  YouTube. This is a, um, a vertical video recorded apparently with a somebody's, uh, smartphone.  Oh, I, I, you know what? I've seen it without audio, which you got, you got to have the audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they're watching. Yes. Okay. Did you understand it though? No. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, not, not this one. This is the grand finale. Yeah. That's the last one.  I said, I was wondering, I don't know what they're going to do next season. Cause they did some stuff  this time. Exactly what I was thinking. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. Right. Don't bring that in. You don't say don't do the same stuff. You understand? Yeah.  Yeah. Like go somewhere else with that, but don't bring it here. You understand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I said. You know what I'm saying? I was like, what in the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't do it here. You understand? Yeah. So the kids talking Sim talk. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really? I thought the same thing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You think a lot of like, huh?  That's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Uh huh. Now who says the internet's a bad place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been watched more than 55 million times. Oh, it's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shared one and a half million times on Facebook. I'm surprised I haven't seen them on Ellen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Generous yet. I've had that conversation a million times. So to me it's like, well, yeah.  Okay. Fine. I guess people who don't have kids don't like it or something. I don't know.  Hard hearted people. Yeah. I'm a hard hearted person. It's cute. Cute kid. Cute. So anyway,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's on that. That among everything else is on Facebook watch and people are watching  Facebook watch and they're starting to feel left out. So the bigger, the bigger thing that's  interesting to me. So I think Google has been standing back kind of saying, but Facebook,  they're on the hot seat. We're not the same. Google people say to me all the time,  don't call us platforms. We are different companies. Right? So now YouTube is causing  trouble for Google. So they're in the same hot seat that Facebook's put on and you can't,  and then the newspaper industry goes after Google. So now Google's on the hot seat again.  So it'll be Google for a month or two and then it'll be Facebook again. And then,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so this is what you get. If you don't have a Facebook account, when you go to Facebook watch  is a sign up for Facebook, original shows, popular videos, and producers.  So, um, I'm not sure if you guys have, um, none of these,  I, I've heard of Will Smith. I don't really care about his bucket lists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, Steph Curry. Okay, great. But I can watch him, uh, play basketball too on TV.

And then I watched it in German and I  said, I don't understand it, but it's a lot better show. Oh yeah, it was good. It was basically  German stranger things in German. You would like it, Jeff, but you know, there just came out today.  We were talking about music, the Martin Scorsese documentary of Bob Dylan's rolling thunder review,  which I remember seeing was a seminal moment in my young life in 1975 at the New Haven Coliseum  arena. Uh, there's, uh, there's a bunch of good stuff on Netflix. That's not all dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's all everything is showing me is dark. Okay. Well, maybe then you'll understand my pick

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to die this afternoon, by the way, just to, just to hold on for a second. You know, my fear,  fear about hate, my, my, my hate of heights. Yes. Your height hate, uh, the glass bottomed  observation deck in the building formerly known as the Sears tower. Yes. Cracked. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I stood there and thought, this is terrifying because you're looking down. My palms are sweating.  Did it crack and people fell through it? No, no, just as a crack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's not a Willis. If you, if you search for Willis tower, protective layer  of a sky deck cracks under visitors feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And again, this is my scare at the Willis tower. Sky high scare under visitors feet.  This video is shot on the 103rd floor last night after the ledges protect splintered into thousands  of pieces. It actually covers the glass bottom below the Willis tower says no one was ever in  danger. But try telling that to the mother who was with her kids. Oh, it's just the kids and it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  cracked. I thought I was going to die, but when I do die, I want to be buried in a tree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There we go. Now. Oh my God, it's cracking. It's cracking.  Leo, that's, that's the actual, that's actually wild. This is a bridge in China that cracked while  people were on it. Are you still showing it? Yeah. You could stop now, Karsten. So Jeff,

Transcript:  Jeff wouldn't do what I did. I'm pretty sure it's, it's video screens. Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Oh, it's, it's not real. No. It, oh, it gives a terrifying experience. An extra zing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Zing. Jeff Jarvis. So that's how I'm going to die. Now what are you going to do with my body? If it  survives that long fall, it doesn't just splat into a million pieces. Silicon valley. What are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you going to do with it? Silicon valley startup called better place forests. It's better place  forest.com instead of, and they've already bought, started to buy up old growth forests.  One of the things they do when they buy them up is they make sure they'll never be built on ever.  Cause now it's a natural Memorial. You, uh, there's one near us. I'm going to do this. You take your  pick of giant redwoods, mossy, tan oaks, Reverend Firs and more. Find a tree that fits your  personality. Choose your forest, make it your own. And then when you kick, they cremate you and  they put you in the tree. They fertilize the tree with you. And I hope put a little plaque on the  tree. I don't know about that part until the tree burns down. Well, it's, well, you know, everything  dies, whatever you think that anybody's going to visit your grave in a hundred years. Oh yes. Oh  yes. I'll be famous. Oh, okay. You'll be like, good. People go to visit good as cemeteries.  Yeah, exactly. Oh yeah. Jim Morrison. He was on twig.  Here's the one I want. It's in Santa Cruz, where I went to high school. It's an 84 acre woods,  unerupted view. Look at this. Wouldn't you like to be buried there?  You're actually buried. I think you're cremated. And then they use your here in case you want to  visit it or some hotels and restaurants nearby. Silicon Valley. Let's see what the, this is  Silicon Valley. So you get pricing. Is this include cremation? Pick your tree.  Don't think so. No. Your pricing include is based on your tree's size, species and location.  Oh Jesus. Not cheap. If you want a young tree up to 70 feet tall, rising toward the sunlight,  or young trees are quickly headed for the canopy. Santa Cruz is $6,400, but point arena is cheaper,  $2,900. And then they can put you, they can spread you out other places. Of course, if you want a big  tree, Jeff, cause you're going to live forever. $16,000. I'm a big guy. Yeah. Cause you're gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  have a tree that's my size. You know, cremation kills like most of your benefit for them. They

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  shouldn't really cremate you. They should compost you. There are composting caskets. That might be  the next thing. Um, they, did you see that? They spray you with a little mushroom foam.  And you can even include your pets. Of course you can because there's plenty of room. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. What do you think? I like it. Do they inject you in the tree? What do they do with your  roommate? They just sprinkle you on the tree. Yeah. Uh, is there, smear you, your smear? Nellie Bowles,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wrote about this today in the, in the times, um, better place forests. Uh, it's cheaper than a  cemetery. You don't have to worry about somebody cleaning your grave. They already have a few dozen  remains in the soil. They've sold thousands of trees to the future. Dead. Most customers are  pre knee pre need middle aged and healthy decades of head of finding themselves in the roots.  They've raised 12 million in venture capital. Oh, Silicon Valley is so nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is a good idea. I mean, if your tree dies, they will replace it with the same species.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah. I mean, as soon as they, as soon as they don't do cremation, cause this has always been my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  plan to be, you know, get the mushroom spray and then just, you know, dig a standing hole and just  jump in. Customers come to claim a tree for perpetuity, which costs between 3000 and 30,000,  depending on your tree. There's also a $970. You could just be in a community tree cremation,  not included. Uh, then you get a round plaque in the earth, like a gravestone.  They dig a three by two foot trench at the roots of the tree. They mix your remains in with soil  and water, sometimes adding other elements to offset the alkalinity of the bone ash.  Um, you know, pets are allowed spreading is what they call the ash deposit. The tree, the trenches  is space. The watering can is a vessel. The onsite sales staff are forest stewards. Get it right.  When you, and then here's your available trees. You can go in the forest, see these ribbons.  That means you could be buried there. That's a cheap one right by the liver there. Nice location,  location, location. Yeah. Death is a growth industry says Nellie Bowles. Why isn't this in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mary Meeker's presentation? I think this is awesome. Look at the market. Look, and you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  even have a little quote. I was spread here. Most people I know who've had cremated relatives did

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this for free though. Yeah, you're not supposed to. You can't. That's not right. You're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  allowed. People say, Oh, please spread me at Disneyland. You have to sneak in this way. It's  legit. Plus there's a plaque. I guess you're right. You could have somebody do it. My mother's in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Memorial garden. My sister's church. My sister's best friend minister. It's a little weird. She  kind of walks by walks by mom every day. Yeah. I'm going to do the mushroom spray. I think.  Oh, no. What is this mushroom spray? This is like the whole foods mushroom rack thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a composting. It's a composting casket. Mushrooms. They turn you into a host. They call  it the mushroom burial suit. It turns dead bodies into clean compost. See, that would be so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  better for the tree. It would be good in that Carson. The tree would be love. This would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  good. Good. Radar detection too. Apparently. Yeah. Look at that thing. Yeah. It's stealth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this got a little fungi spores in it. And there you go. And you don't have to burn it. It's  the infinity burial suit. And according to the CDC, it cleans, cleans the body of toxins  before returning it to nature. What's that t-shirt say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Choose the suit. Infinity burial. Oh, that's a fun thing to go wearing around town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Get the t-shirt. The t-shirt is cheaper than the suit. The suit is 1500 bucks. It comes in  black or natural colors. Who cares what color it is? I'm going to have to get the large. Let me  just add this. Do you want an infinity burial shroud? So then you have no coffin at all.  They wrap you in the shroud, stick you in the ground, put a plaque by the tree and you're done.  That's, that's my goal. Coeio.com. If you want the infinity burial suit too,  I feel bad for the people who have suit one.  There's no upgrade.  Upgrade.  Ladies and gentlemen, what a way to end not only this show, but there's no upgrade in death.  It's no upgrade in the infinity. One and done.  Kevin Toffle.
