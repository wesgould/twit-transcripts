Hello. Mr. Pruitt. You look good, man  That is boy. That's the best shot man. You look like it's like lit. It's got

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Background it's just beautiful. Well. Thank you sir. I did turn off one of the lights still

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think that's good. We don't want it too bright. We want it relaxed. We want it looking good, and then there's Jeff Jarvis

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's still pink no one you know we finally figured out it's because  There's two different color temperatures in your room  There's the warm light of the back of the room and the blue light from the daylight in the front

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll try the lip, but I think you're wrong. I think it's just because I'm in front of a really big

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Window yeah, so that's daylight

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a lot of daylight

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some lights and to have daylight in the background

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Precisely, okay. Oh, so here's the question well those light, but I have I have high hats  Right those lights come in  Yeah, yeah, you need the  VR 30 yeah, you need the VR 30 right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are those yeah, they have can lights they have they I have in my cans, so I know that they make them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we are 30s yeah, and you'll want the if you don't want fancy colors, which  You know you probably don't you just need to get the white ambience and what'll happen is for this show  You can make them cool, but if you like warm you can warm them up for every other time and that my hand you can get it  You can get a button for 20 bucks  And you can program the button when the show starts and you can just be like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cool like you don't get too fancy of me come on come on  Brilliant  So these are the wise light bulbs no no no no these are the hue

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you want the wise ones because  Let's see they do actually you could use wise, but you can't use a button then sorry  Okay, what about a button, but you can tell you could tell Google or Amazon hey  Make the wise cool showtime

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And  That ladies and gentlemen is exactly why we have Stacy other show Stacey about them the queen of iot Stacey on iot.com  Subscribe to her newsletter check out her events and then of course listen to the iot podcast  She does with my or her plant and my her perfect perfect plant

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going with my background is a solid 10. I would say 10 out of 10

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember me I did well we've got to put it to the test we got to see what they say  Listen listen. No there's there is only 110 here, and that is mr.. And prudent

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually ants. I don't know what room raider would say about and he would say well no that's too bland. That's a portrait  I'm sorry. That's too. Yeah, mine's too bland. That's all all and  Not about the room yeah, you no longer you no longer would now it looks like you got cement or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that this paper dark slab stuff yes that papers dark slab

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For the classroom that's not too cheery  Let's see oh, there's so many things we could talk about today  How about this great article by Steve Yeggy? Did you read this I love this article  Steve is a now retired former Google engineer  He is he's he's obviously made enough money now that he doesn't have to actually work effect if you look at his bio  Steve Yeggy is ex Geo works ex Amazon ex Google and ex grab with nearly 30 years of tech experience nowadays  He's pretty much retired in other words his stock vested, but when he was at Google  By the way, I love his lead god dang it. I don't want to blog again  I have so much stuff to do blogging takes time and energy and creativity  I could be putting my  Novels my music my game and so on but you get me riled enough and I have to blog so let's get this over with then  The headline dear Google Cloud your deprecation  Policy is killing you. I don't even know why he added the cloud part, but I guess it's because  This post is really about what's going on in the cloud  SEO baby, yeah, but yes, CEO maybe but really you could say this is true about Google in general  And it's an interesting lesson for people like us who follow the tech industry  You know one of the knocks that Microsoft always got was you know?  They never let a technology die that they're always  Adding code to Windows so that everything that ever worked on Windows will continue to work on Windows  Steve says it's exactly the opposite at Google in fact. They almost it's almost like they honor  People engineering teams that kill  legacy old

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Code that's that's part of the lore of product that it's it's as good to kill things as it is to make things yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says but the problem with that is your customers pretty soon learn that don't depend on Google  And again, he's talking about the cloud, but I think this applies to all of Google  Google engineers he says pride themselves on their software engineering discipline  and that's actually what gets them into trouble pride is a trap for the unwary and  It has ensnared many a Google team into thinking their decisions are always right and that correctness is more important than customer  focus  customer focus gives you  legacy  Correctness gives you only the stuff. Oh, it's new modern and good. Yeah, and I make sense. That's I can see an engine  That's that's yeah, that's that's a good good hot take, but he says backwards compatibility  Keep systems alive and relevant for decades  One of the best lines in this the first system I'll pick as an example of this is the oldest e max  which is  Which he says and this is I've the greatest line ever sort of a hybrid between Windows notepad a  monolithic kernel operating system and the International Space Station

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In a nutshell e max is a platform written in  1976 for writing software to make you more productive masquerading as a text editor  But what he says he writes a lot of extensions as many people do for e max but more importantly  No extension he's ever written  Since 1976 doesn't work. I'm still using software. I wrote for e max back in 1995  I'm sure there's still people using software. They wrote for me max from the mid 80s  Every once in a while might require a minor trick. It's really rare and actually I'll add to that  That's one of the reasons. I love the lisp programming language a  program you wrote  For lisp in the 70s would still run today. It just would  Whereas in the Google world  Deprecation means we're breaking our commitments to you  It really does that's what it ultimately means it means they're going to force you you to do some work  possibly a large amount of rework on a regular base basis as a punishment for  Doing what they told you to do originally as a punishment for listening to their glossy marketing on their website better software  Faster you do everything they tell you to do and you launch your application or service and then bang a year or two later  It breaks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm, this is Google across the board like Jeff and I will both tell you that being a paying Google G suites customer is like punishment  No one should do it. Yep  Yeah, they just stuck just don't care about the user. That's really the end of I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yagi says this is hurting them far more than they realize and it will continue to hurt them for years to come  Because it's not part of their DNA to care about customers

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's all data but could this be considered  Google trying to force the users to air quotes evolve

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but as well and the reason it hurts them on cloud more than anywhere else is because the customers are developers who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Develop for Google compute cloud another yeah, that's I think I cut a different. There's a difference between  the consistency of developers and the consistency of searchers I  Think Google does care deeply about customers when they're non tech people trying to use its services  Okay, but people who have to?  Integrate with Google on a technical level Google says do it our way because we're smarter than you are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there are parts of Google that do  Care for instance he uses as an example Android  He says Android folks take backwards compatibility to almost unimaginable extremes  True which files on massive amounts of legacy technical debt in their systems and tool chains  Oh boy, you should see some of the crazy stuff. They have to do in their build system all in the name of compatibility  For this I award Android the coveted you're not Google award

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gonna be retired like that that'd be nice. I know be cranky  Screw you all say what I want to say I'm rich I tell you he brought up one thing that I'm sorry Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I go ahead  Jeff's already that way I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey Stacey you just wait  It's gonna get worse when he doesn't care. Oh, yeah. Yeah, but I'm when I'm that grumpy old man. Oh, you just wait I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't wait as an example he gives he brings up an example. That's a pet pet  Peeve of mine instant apps remember that  Yes, instant apps was a pretty dumb idea though  You know why because it required you to rewrite and re-architect your application as if people are just gonna up and rewrite 2 million apps  I'm guessing instant apps wasn't an Android idea. It was a Googler's idea  And of course Android apps instant apps is gone  So if you did all that work  Sorry, sorry  No payoff for it. Sorry Google's pride in their software engineering hygiene is what gets them into trouble  They don't like it when there are lots of with different ways to do the same thing with older less desirable ways sitting alongside newer  Fancier ways so they just kill it. I  Think this is really a well-written  Piece it's on medium  Steve what I hope I'm probably saying his name wrong. Why II GG II?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When he mentions the hygiene aspect of it is he saying that they're they're too efficient with their

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hygienic code or did not yes, so what you do, so if you know programmers are so you you've got a code base  And you go, you know, we didn't do that the right way. Oh, we didn't do that the right way  So you take it out you fix it you write it. It's beautiful. It's clean. It's elegant code hygiene  Yep, but then as a result you broke everything that was written  Prior that depended on those things that you took out and fixed  Yeah  And there are lots of examples in in the technology world of this Python 3  broke everything in Python 2  Pearl 6 ended up having to be renamed  Because it didn't work with any wasn't really poor pearls and wasn't pearl anymore  So there are examples of this engineers, you know being  Engineers if there's nobody saying this is the problem  You know what it takes is a marketing team and people and normally I don't like the input of marketing team  I'm more on the engineer side saying no, you can't deprecate. You can't take that out  You can't but the customers depend on that and engineers  Like Guido von Rossum of Python and Larry Wall of Pearl say I can do anything. I want there's no marketing team  I'm gonna make it better and and meanwhile everybody else is  You know, but I still think there's some sort of a fine line between

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Deprecating old code versus improving old code. You know what I mean? That's why you have updates, right?  Yeah, no, no improving old codes a good thing  What you don't want to do is take out the old code or break it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So all right what you can do is and and this is again anathema to  To engineers who like who don't like five ways to do something four of which are old-fashioned and outmoded  He uses an example Java. He says, you know Java they don't  They they'll deprecate something. They'll say don't use this method, but they won't take it out  So all the programs that used it still work  They just don't work maybe as elegantly and as beautifully as the as newer programs that use the new methods  They just don't work maybe as elegantly and as beautifully as the as newer programs that use the new methods  But what you don't want to do is just break everything  That's just double more than memory hog or something right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Say again Jeff. How much do you give up? Yeah, I mean are there features you just can't do as a result

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so he talks about Apple  Says Apple at best gets a C- because they break stuff all the time for no good reason  But  Apple as a result though is famously in fact  They're about to do it again by by leaving Intel in the dust and moving to their own designs chips that will inevitably  Break a lot of stuff in the newest Apple version of a Mac OS Catalina  They refuse to run 32-bit apps  Microsoft will never stop running 32-bit apps. Yeah, and it's a security problem for Microsoft  Because it's a you know, Windows win 32 is kind of called Gus are all sorts of messy stuff in there  So it's a it's a it's actually really more than just the Google problem. This is a problem in the tech industry in general  It's very I thought it was a good piece but it's fun cuz I agree  Google for their customer facing products and services  They've always been ruthless and shutting down any offering that doesn't meet their money bar  Even if it has millions of users, we know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's not the engineers talking correctly well, it's not just the engineers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why when he's talking about cloud he's talking about the engineers because they're the Google cloud platform  He says they're not committed to supporting anything. It's well known that they refuse to host  Any third-party software until after Amazon's already done that and built a successful business around it at which point their customers hold them at gunpoint  The lack of support culture combined with a let's break it in the name of making a prettier deprecation  Treadmill is alienating their developers and it's why the Google cloud platform is now  third  after AWS and Azure and  He says failing fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well at some point the poops gonna hit the fan right and  Somebody higher up is gonna say, you know what? This really is hurting us from a bottom-line standpoint

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Google's not structured. No, that's that's exactly. I wonder if Thomas Korean will come in and do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's their cloud GCP guy the guy they pulled over from Oracle who's been making some really severe changes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Oracle's a good example of the opposite, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm saying  I'm saying Google brought him in because they were terror GCP is a joke in the enterprise. No right for this very reason  Yeah, so I actually think that that may be one of the things he's doing  he's also really focusing less on engineering and more on monetization right in a way that is  Challenging to the traditional Google ethos when we think about how they're  Introducing and charging for products. So I actually think there may be some changes happening here, right?  Interesting at least on the enterprise side for the good or the bad  it depends I mean, I think probably for the good of  Google's bottom line and possibly for some users. I  mean, I do think there will be I mean part of the fun of  Google is they invent really cool random stuff and  That's harder to do in an environment when you're incentivized less towards cool technology and more towards maintaining and supporting technology  those are two very different mindsets and  we don't see a lot of companies get it right in terms of  maintainers versus inventors, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take a little break when we come back  The massive battle that's going on right now. No, I'm not talking about epic versus Apple  No, I'm not talking about Trump versus tick-tock. We've covered those we're sick of that. I'm talking about Google versus Australia  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  boy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're gonna do your accent we come back. Yeah, I can't I wish I could do a good I can do  For a little bit and then it's and then it fades into something else then it turns into scotch  Everything  It goes bad it all goes it goes south.

Thank you Roman  Open letter to Australians  So you better explain this because this is right up your alley Jeff Jarvis. This is like light song seeks reaction  Act in Australia should strike. It's an Australian. It's like some shit track bang. I  Was pretty good. It's the news media bargaining code  Which is not yet law but proposed  This is what Google says in their open letter  It will hurt how Australians use Google search and YouTube the way Aussie search every day on Google is at risk  from new regulation  The law would force us to give unfair advantage to one group of businesses  news media  Over everyone else who has a website YouTube channel or small business news media businesses alone would be given information  That would help them artificially inflate their ranking over everyone else  Even if someone else should provide a better result  Yep  The proposed changes are not fair  Says Google and they mean Google search results in YouTube will be worse  for you  Under this law Google has to tell news media how they can gain access to data about  Your use your use of our products  There's no way of knowing if any data handed over would be protected or how it might be used by news media  We deeply believe in the importance of news to society we partner closely with Australian news media  We already pay them millions of dollars and send them billions of free clicks every year  We've offered to pay more to licensed content  But rather than encouraging these types of partnerships the law is set up to give big media companies special and treatment and to encourage them  to make enormous and unreasonable demands that would put our free services at  Risk the law wouldn't just that's a threat. Oh  That would put our free service free services with that Google start charging or would Google pull out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's that's no that's well one report is that they would start charging Australians for services. That's one report  Or in Spain they pulled out a Google they pulled out they can do either. Yep. So here's the response

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From the Australian competitive competition and consumer Commission, right?  Can't do it. I shouldn't do it. It's bad and I apologize. It's not quite the ACC. I'm used to but close a  CCC an open letter published. What does ACC stand for in your world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Atlantic Coast Conference, of course home of the  Defending the Atlantic Coast Conference champion Clemson Tigers. I had to give him an opportunity to do that folks. You understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's in his contract. I know  Why what does ACC stand for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  An open letter published by Google is the only real man here about yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's football I understand that  Handegg we call it the open letter published by Google today contains  Misinformation about the draft news media bargaining code, which the ACC would like to address Google  Will not be required. Oh, yes is what what what what?  You won't be required to charge Australians for use of its free services like search and YouTube unless you choose to do so  Google will not be required to share any additional data with Australian news businesses unless it chooses to do so  The draft code will allow Australian news to negotiate for  Fair payments for their journalists work that's included in Google services. It's snippets all over again. Yes  Oh it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ready it is the life story should correct  So the I the point do that to reggae if you like folks the point that bothers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Publishers is that little paragraph that's under the news search results  that is from the article and  Their concern is that you read that you got the answer you got the answer you need in fact  A lot of people say this I get the answer I need from Google. I don't need to click that link

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't Google's basically they're not really saying that they're what they're really saying is we're trying to find an excuse to try to  Force Google to pay us

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not fair though to say that Google might be stealing some traffic with the snippets

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, that's a that's a case of proving a negative that presumes that everyone was going to go to every article that crossed their paths  Had they not seen the Google snippet?  In fact, it's the opposite with the snippet what we've what I found in the research that I did long ago  But but the longer the snippet the more traffic that went  Because you got a better sample of the article and you had more cause to want to go actually read the article  So the short snippets are  It's proving a negative saying that that had they not seen the snippet. They would have gone to that article. No  There's no way to say that and you know, are there some pieces of information I get on Google sure?  What's what's the Dow Jones? Yeah, I don't need to go to the Wall Street Journal find out what the Dow Jones average is right now  No, and that's fine  And it's public information and it's Google's right to do that. And yes Dow Jones. Yes, the Wall Street Journal might lose some  Clicks there, but they're dumb clicks. They're commodity clicks  So I'm looking at it in work

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, no you go ahead I never worked for like the Wall Street Journal anything like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But when you look at content management systems  There's usually some type of configuration far as how your slugs and things like that will display in search, right?  Bingo

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In search right bingo regardless of the country management system control the snippet you put in right if when I put a medium post

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Up it says change your you know, that's become common and you know, that's interesting. So Google's only is does Google always honor that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think in the case of news they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is looking and I actually don't see any snippets here. I'm on Google's news  So is it only on Google search not Google News that these snippets appear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if I if I go to Google and search for Google which will Google think I'm very stupid to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me hear okay, here's an example  Here's an example. I search for California fires and then click the news tab and here  I'm seeing a paragraph California fires live update fast moving fires  This is the snippet are spreading across California in the north says wind whipped  Flames forced people to flee nice alliteration in the north wind whipped  wind whipped  Flames forced people to flee their homes near Vacaville  So now you're saying I should click by the way that didn't that didn't mean I didn't want to read that story  That was just more information about what that story covers  Alright, so I don't think that would hurt the click  And it was in fact this was in fact this subhead. Yep, but go to another one. Let's try this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's try this again. That's that's just sounds like perfectly crafting the content management part of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now here's one with an ellipsis, which means it's right not have been intentional. This is CNN's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Story wildfires raced toward populated areas of Northern California's wine country  That's where we're going tonight early today forcing some residents to evacuate follow here for dot dot dot

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think they did that on purpose that might be intentional so you they want you to finish reading the sentence?  Yes. Yeah, they said follow here for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then there's some people that would say that was enough for me to read. Oh look here's that snippet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's interesting follow here for is new that's that's new

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think what that in there this was this was the content management system and then they added yes better  It's quite better would be something like and you won't believe what happened next  Of course, I'm just saying  It's only on Facebook. Oh, sorry  So yeah, none of these snippets give me enough information to say. Oh good. I don't have to yeah  So they don't they don't they don't care about the snippet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They want an excuse to say Google you took our money as if God gave them that money  This entire thing this entire entire thing is Rupert Murdoch  And that's all you need to know folks because that's the man who's ruined democracy in the English-speaking world, but I'll leave that aside  The equivalent in Germany is a company called Axel Springer headed by a man named Matthias Diffner  And in Germany, they started the fight that led to the nice to the Schutze Rakt. Don't you love this?  And and Murdoch has been his ally from the beginning going after Google and the funny thing is that Murdoch  And and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and  Murdoch and and and and and Springer both tweak Google by making friends with Facebook and Zuckerberg and  Zuckerberg they have wrapped around their little fingers. So Zuckerberg is indeed pain  for content  So what's happened now is Google gets stuck in a bad position. So Google by all reports is going to pay  publishers for content starting in Germany because that's the squeakiest wheels  So Murdoch is coming along in Australia and saying pay us now pay us for what?  For the privilege of linking to you for sending you traffic for sending you customers for sending you people. No  You owe us Rup, but no Google was foolish in the beginning by not setting that precedent  And by saying you can't pay and the reason they were a foolish is wrong  Google said you can't pay for search presence  So if Google had charged people they would have been they would have been selling  Search presence and Google made an ethical decision not to do that unlike early  Yahoo, which did do that in the original model Google said no that would be a bad service to the public  That would be unethical of us. We're not going to charge for that  So the economics became all skewed and even though Google was sending value to the publishers  The publishers are saying you stole the soul when you took my picture

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's by the way the ACCC CC CC's responses actually a little disingenuous because it isn't completely up to Google what happens here  Here's the draft code  the negotiation process  One news business notifies a digital platform by the way that is only Google and Facebook initially

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That they want to negotiate under the code and and let me cut off and news businesses of only a certain large size  Oh interesting not as if I'm if I'm you know, no, no, no, no, no if I'm a small startup  I'm not in this game only large news services

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Step two negotiation and mediation takes place for up to three months  Google says no  No, if no agreement can be reached on payment for content the news business may choose to proceed to binding  final offer  arbitration in which each party lodges just one offer with the arbitrator and  Then the arbitrator chooses one of the offers  One of the offers  So it is it's a lie. It's a it's a blatant lie when it says absolute law Google doesn't have to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and the other issue here is  There's something to sound like Benedict  Evans here in this argument, but but why does Google owe the news business money, right? Why doesn't Google owe?  You know, it's why doesn't Wikipedia owe insectopedias money why doesn't  Amazon or Walmart and why doesn't Walmart? Oh a P&P and what is an A&P own Jones's corner grocery, right?  Right. It's it's almost asking for capitalistic reparations

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  or disruption and even if that were  You can't even say that reparations are owed because as we just demonstrated  The links don't take traffic from units  Everybody knows that the search links drive a lot of traffic to you  Even if a little bit of the snippets cut traffic, you're still getting a net  Yeah, I think you must be getting a net gain of traffic. We know that because in Spain when Google said fine, we won't  Drive any search traffic to you the Spanish publishers  Wave the white flag pretty quickly  Well  Go ahead sorry Stacey Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the value of Google search if they can't pull?  quality and reputable  answers for those snippets

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I guess the the publisher might say well I don't don't publish a snippet just the headline

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm just asking  I mean like if Google doesn't have the ability to search through like if they did  I don't know why they would do this but you know, they they didn't allow the robot crawlers onto their their sites  Google then becomes less valuable because you don't have  easily  credible or easily verifiably like good information to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The newspaper gets a lot less traffic presumably, right? Yes. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This this conversation seems to be  Glossing over the fact that that newspapers do provide and add  Credibility to a Google search result Google gets value. Yeah that gives Google value and keeps people turning to their search  If I as a publisher say hey  You know, you're you're kind of burnishing your credibility with my content. What's that worth to you?  I don't think that's a wrong conversation to start. I don't know  It was trying to get it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we're trying to get before but then I want to respond to that Stacey  No, go ahead. Yeah, there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I was just saying that it you still as a  Content creator at least from my perspective if you have some control over how those search results can be you could block them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just like he said you could use robots.txt and say don't annex me  Bye

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it doesn't take that no  No, and clearly they go to the effort to do the SEO that you know all this Stacey a few responses to what you just said  One to Stacey then to do you Leo?  Stacey on that point perhaps  but what Google will point out is that  97% of searches have no news on  the news content that ends up on search result pages is a  Tiny proportion. We're gonna see it more because we're weird people but it's tiny  Yep  So, you know Wikipedia gives a lot more valuable value to Google for credibility than the news industry  I would argue because it appears in a lot more places  Secondly, oh Spain Spain did not wave the white flag Spain set up the law such there was no choice and Google said  Okay, if you're gonna make us pay we're leaving and they closed Google news in Spain in Germany  So close it's still closed. Oh  The publishers lost. Oh publishers lost a lot of about a lot of traffic in in Germany under the I know you want me to  Say it lay still should rect  There was flexibility in the law so Springer for the first I think it was 15 days or thereabouts two weeks  Said no, you can't run our snippets. You must pay us and Google said nope and and and Springer put the white flag  Springer said  Okay. Yeah, we're losing too much. Okay fine  So there was a new law in Europe the the copyright directive in Europe  Articles 15 and 17 is the lightstone should threat for all of the EU and then each country is gonna write their own version of it  France wrote it wrote its version saying Google you want you must pay us and Google told France  How do you say F off in French? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know you do you do I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Know how to say go F yourself is that close enough? Yeah, say it really are we allowed? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, we're gonna have to okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll take it whatever it is Carson show title

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So  That's actually the experiment in Germany the actual experiment  Do publishers gain more than they lose from Google and and the proponent of the law

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  gave up like  Right. So that's why they try to then go to the next level the EU to try to force Google into it for the whole  Of Europe and Google's gonna just say no everywhere  So the bad thing that could happen here is that Google could kill Google News and say screw it  Not worth it tiny portion of our search most people are looking for mixers to buy  And and Stacey light bulbs to put in their homes and  That woke her up  Yes, then you then you should be the person

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So interesting I don't know who Alan Gibson is  When he's at home land shark.io. I think he's a venture capitalist  and I  Just bring this up because he actually said something a little light bulb went on for me. He's talking about  How not only is the browser war over the the internet war is over and Google won it is  The the Google web or web by Google trademark  And you can read the the various details some of which I agree with and some which I don't  But he does make an interesting point. He says two deficiencies have determined the course the web has taken  One is lack of native payments. I disagree with him on that. So I won't bring that one up  He says we wouldn't have to have all this advertising if we just figured out a way to do with micro payments  And I that's that's not  To get upset about that it's just blatantly not it's obviously not the case because we've had ad-supported media for as long as we've had  Media that's what newspapers are created to do initially. So it's clearly not the case. This is you know, he's it's kind of retro  Retroactive history to say oh if we only had a way to pay blogs you wouldn't have had out of ads  No, no, we've had ads since 1776. It's just the way it is  And I personally and I thought it was thinking about this would I could I convert?  Twit into some sort of micro payment system. Nobody would do it  We know without ads we just wouldn't exist  Yes, too much friction but his interesting first point is lack of native search and I never really thought about this  He says had we designed the web in the early days for search  Lacking native  distributed search  Allowed Google to grab a monopoly position as the entry point to the web  The web's original architects were off base on hyperlinks  It turns out people just want to go right to the answer they're looking for and  and I  Think that's a really interesting. I mean, it's too late now, but it is an interesting point  Google solved a problem that didn't have to exist had search been built in to early web protocols  We wouldn't need a gatekeeper  The web would just do it itself a distributed search. I wish we had well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, okay, but but Google adds a lot of value to that search Google's the amount you know the mat the army of Matt  Cutts is  Who are taking out?  spam and dealing with the bad guys and  Trying to come up with ever better search and ever better page rank and ever better this never better that it's not a commodity

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yahoo, perhaps although Doran in our chat room says they invented the phone network without a phone book  You can you could that's an analogy we had a phone network and they realized oh you need a phone book to find people on  The phone network and so they created the phone book and yes, it's conceivable. You could have a commercial entity that makes a better phone book  There's certainly room for  personalized phone books and so forth  But honestly if you design the web with at least kind of minimal phone book capability  Maybe Google I mean there probably be a business, you know, you know, the web was done with Alta Vista

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. It was just it was probably was done. That don't need to do it. I think it's a really good argument

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a very good argument  Not at all I think that that  That you know, of course Google filled that void, but the problem is now a private company controls the web. I  Mean really does it for now for now folks for now  Yeah, but it's still a concern if you're not on Google Google delists you you don't exist  It doesn't matter if you have a website if no one can find it  It's irrelevant

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well that leads to something interesting I found I put in under Facebook  An academic paper policy review paper was done on what if Facebook goes down one if it dies  We're somewhere wishing for oh, I wish I don't think you're gonna say that. Okay, so so the paper is very interesting  It says there are a lot of communities that are I mean, you may say this is a bad thing  But yeah, I'll give you one community dependent on Facebook Q anon  Wouldn't exist anymore. Not anymore. Did they do list them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, they did and I added it to the one down and militants militants. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Facebook is in large parts of the world become the de facto platform for communication and social interaction  If you don't find problems with their opening sense  This is that the world you want to be against. This is a negative Facebook paper. Oh, okay  De facto is doing a lot of work there. Yeah, well de facto always does a lot of work though, doesn't it?  Yeah. Yeah, well said Stacy  The closure of an online social network would not be unprecedented Friendster yik. Yak Google Plus and Yahoo groups leap to mind  So, what do they what do they conclude that who would who would suffer  If for some reason Facebook said yeah, we're done. That's too much work  groups  I mean we used to have

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  specific communities that connect only now that chose this as their platform, right?  You know where my young daughter was a was an American Girl fan and they had the American Girl chat  That's how she had friends an American Girl killed it and suddenly her friends were gone, right? Right? So I wrote at the time  There's that there's a responsibility when you create something for a community  you're creating this is the point of the paper an ethical obligation and  It's not so easy to just say whether it's Facebook turning it off or government turning it off, you know  What hell have you turned off?  It's the same as as as Tim Wu had a column in the Times Today that drove me nutty. Oh, I mean with Trump's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like Tim Wu. I was shocked by that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because because what you're shutting off Sarah is what he said was just I know I'm dancing around five stories in the rundown driving  Carson crazy, but that's what I do for a living  He's he's siding with Trump  He's agreeing with Trump on tik-tok and the problem is you're not cutting down cutting off tik-tok. You're cutting off Sarah Cooper, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're cutting off he says  It's foolish of us to allow  Tik-tok to exist when China is shutting down Facebook and Twitter  We should be doing the same back in any he mentions people like me  who who think that  The open web is a is something to be promoted and honored  And that in fact we can unilaterally do that just as we almost unilaterally do it with democracy  He says the asymmetry  between China  the country's extensive blocking censorship and surveillance and  The way us treats it should no longer be tolerated the privilege of full internet access the open internet  Should be extended only to companies from countries that respect that openness themselves

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like like America killing tik-tok. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I think that I think I would stand on the side that says  No, that's the whole point is that we have to stand up for an open internet and that it's not justified to do what they do  Yeah  I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of our society forests like the industrial industrial side of things

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yes, there's consequences so much and Tim does point out that that the president Trump is not perhaps the best  bearer of this message  Some think that it's a tragic mistake who writes  He by the way, the headline of the article is it's an opinion piece in the New York Times today a tik-tok ban  Is overdue some think that it's a tragic mistake for the United States to violate the principles of internet openness that were pioneered in this country  But there's also such a thing as being a sucker if China refuses to follow the rules of the open internet  Why continue to give it access to internet markets around the world?  Well, because we believe in open internet. I'm by the way  Yeah, I got no problem  About us. I have no problem with the Department of Defense banning it from  Phones and military personnel. I have no problem the Commerce Department and the government saying you can't have it  I have no problem problems with private enterprise  like Wells Fargo Bank saying no tick-tock on your company phone and I also have no problem with  individual users like me  Deleting tick-tock because I did do it after Amy Webb convinced me  Of the yeah on Sunday. I know well, no, I'm still saying it's fine  You are just so fickle. I'm still saying it's fine. I would not want to ban it new information  I'm I'm saying as an individual her point was bite dance. We think of it as a social media company the owner of tick-tock  They're actually an AI company. They were instrumental in China's social  Credit score system and that in fact, I'm actually not worried about the privacy invasion of tick-tock  I think it's legitimate to worry about how tick-tock could be weaponized as a propaganda tool  We already know that they banned Uyghurs and Hong Kong and so forth from tick-tock  So I choose as an individual  I don't think there's anything wrong from an individual to choose not to have tick-tock on their device  But I would never support a nationwide ban about against tick-tock same thing with Facebook. I don't have Facebook on my phone  I would never have any Facebook app on my phone, but it should not be banned  We would all agree on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have neither and I really don't care if  If either those get banned I get why people would be upset, but it doesn't really move the needle from me one way or the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we need to stand up. I  Don't think government our government  at least as  Constructed as a open in favor of open and free speech should be doing that kind of thing  I don't have any problem with private individuals or  Institutions that want to do it but not

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll make no law respecting and establishes a religion or prohibiting the free expression thereof or abridging the freedom of a speech or the  Press or of the right to people peaceably to assemble which is what they do on tick-tock and to petition the government for a redress  Of grievances, which is what they do on Twitter and Facebook, right?  so I think it's so what has happened now is this is now a First Amendment issue and  But but does the First Amendment protect the Chinese government?  The Chinese company Cooper if if if he's using their accrues printing press is tick-tock  That's a good this is yeah  This is a whole new area of law that I don't see people go for now. I was on  With with two people I respect on a podcast. We was going they said they thought it was a First Amendment issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's an interesting way to  to look at Philippo Distrada in

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  petitioned the Doge of Venice  To get rid of to stop printers because the printers were foreign Germans coming in and stealing his work as a scribe and  and polluting the minds of children and getting drunk on their money and  Stop it. He said stop it. These foreigners are doing terrible things here in Italy  That was a downer sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And one more time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what's going on with foreigners in Italy this is I need to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's it's it's it's a parallel. It's we've had to be this is why we have a First Amendment to protect against that kind of government

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, actually now Larry Ellis didn't do it now Larry Ellison and Oracle. Oh, I tick-tock. Well, it's okay. He's gonna ruin it anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jesus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is like help me understand?  The rash like I saw that I've covered Oracle

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm I think the president asked him to because he's it I was gonna say is this just like weird cronyism

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's what it is. Trump Trump already endorsed that which is none of his damn business

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But he endorsed Ellison's purchase. It'd be like the government's shutting down comic books  Which yeah, which it wanted to by the way. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah  And  There's a great comic book confidential great documentary about  About that era they even show Al Gaines the founder of Mad Magazine before that he did, you know  two horror magazines horror comics and  Testifying in front of Congress because Congress was very close. I think to shutting down  Comic books in the 50s and the comic book did not know that yeah comic book industry because it was think of the kids  the comic book industry's  Prevented it by self-regulating they created the comic book code which ruined comic books for about ten years  But it did create Mad Magazine. So that's the good. That's the good thing. So wait, wait, wait, wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the comic book. What did the comic book code decree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You couldn't do anything. So Gaines tells the story in comic book confidential again great documentary  about one of the comic books where  the hero had beads of sweat and the comic book code censor said can we  Get take the sweat office off his brow. It was to eliminate  I could read you the comic book code, but it had the effect of basically bowed lorizing comic books  So that it'd be safe for kids  Wow, but a complete lack of interest  So the code was voluntary, but everybody was expected to adhere to it  You would submit the comic to the CCA for screening  So it was essentially a censorship operation  It lasted a good long time  Let me see if I can find it prohibited the presentation of policemen judges government officials and respected  Institutions in such a way as to create disrespect for established authority in every instance good should well  This is no sadomasochism. That's for sure and then every instance good should triumph over evil  Discouraged  discouraged  instances of law enforcement officers dying as a result of criminal activities  Depictions of excessive violence were forbidden as well as lurid unsavory  gruesome illustrations  vampires werewolves ghouls and zombies were banned outright  Comics could not use the word horror or terror in their titles. The word crime was subject to numerous restrictions  No sexy wanton comics, I didn't know all of this. Yeah  so  But love stories brown sweat from the brow. I think that's lurid  Wow love stories were enjoined to emphasize the sanctity of marriage and those portraying scenes of passion  We're advised to avoid stimulating lower and baser emotions and all this was  Was voluntary, but it was really to save comics  Because

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, how long did it stay in force? It was created in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  1954 and  It looks like it took until the year 2000 that can't be right before  Nobody paid any attention to it. I remember that low. No, I actually know it's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was like Dark Horse and stuff. I think that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? No, they were publishing underground comics came around and in fact this  Documentary interviews Robert Crumb and so there were these they didn't bother but they didn't care about distribution  Remember part of the problems with the comic book code was no newsstand  No drugstore would carry a comic that didn't have the seal of approval. So underground comics didn't care if they were in the drugstores  They were in head shops and stuff like that  So that's when it started to break is in the 60s in the 70s  But boy  The coders revised in 1971  Yeah, we have a yeah by  Documentary violence was allowed by the 1980s  By the 2000s advertisers no longer made decisions to advertise based on the appearance of the stamp  Most new publishers to emerge during this time did not join the CCA. So literally until 20 years ago  Wow in  2001 the CCA rejected an issue of the Marvel Comics Series X-Force  Requiring changes to be made instead Marvel stopped submitting its comics and implemented its own rating system

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You mentioned there was still a room filled with old buddies look buddies looking at comic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  2001 you kind of I'm telling you comic book confidential  They have a scene where a comic book artist submits his comic and they have it's literally an old biddy going  No, I don't know and then he goes and takes it back and takes off the beads of sweat or whatever and resubmits it  She goes stamps it. It's okay  This is called comic book confidential, yeah, it's a great documentary I was this this is what the world now wants

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for Twitter Facebook and  tik-tok

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe but I can understand it Facebook this did you see this in the Guardian Facebook is  funneling readers towards kovat  misinformation this is a study by a  group called a vase  That

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is that campaign group. What is that? Yeah, I don't know what it means. Yeah. Well, that's an issue. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank You, Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the report. Let's see if they say something about a vase the Guardian has gotten. I love the Guardian has gotten so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get ready moral panic really? Oh, I just started subscribing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Vos

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  uncovers health misinformation spreading networks  That's their that's their job. Basically, that's what they do  It's let me see if I can find more information about them. That's okay  Is the campaigning community bringing people powered politics to decision wide world to decision-making worldwide? I  Know I don't know who they are. You're right. We should probably investigate them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other thing we have to do is we've got to figure out this is and there's WHO is doing something  I'm involved in something that is making a proposal to the WHO so full disclosure about what do we do about vaccine misinformation and  my addition to the project was saying we need to listen to  Neuroscience and cognitive science because why are people scared? What what what actually well, it's always had information

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This always happens. Yeah, I mean  This is universal I'm reading the great I mentioned this before but I'll mention again for those who I didn't watch to it on Sunday  Eric Larsen spoke this splendid in the vile about the  Battle of Britain, you know the German bombing of London and one of the big challenges was suppressing  Rumors that spread like wildfire the Germans have a super bomb  They're bricking up don't go in a shelter because when it gets hit by a bomb  They just brick it up and it's now in you know, a burial site all sorts of stuff. It's a tomb  Yeah, all sorts of stuff that was wrong and it was a big problem and that's without Facebook. That's for that  You know, they that's without any modern means of spreading these things spread like wildfire. So it's a it's a human trait  Especially under stress and what are we under stress with kovat? Yeah  Global health according to avaz, I guess we'll have to consider the source. I don't know anything about them  Global health misinformation spreading networks spanning at least five countries generated an estimated 3.8 billion views on facebook in the last year  Peaking at 460 million views in april views in april  Content from the top 10  website spreading health misinformation had four times as many estimated views on facebook as  equivalent content from the World Health Organization the Centers for Disease Control and other leading health  respected health institutions only 16 percent of all misinformation  Analyzed had a warning label from Facebook  That's part of the problem because Facebook says no, we don't want any kovat misinformation and we will identify it  But of course, it's a very big challenge  They fail and listen on the time. Yeah, and that's not surprising. I mean, it's hard to do  And you're right. The problem isn't maybe necessarily Facebook. Maybe we need to find a way to  Convince people not to be so accepting of all. I don't know. I don't know what the answer is  Maybe I've just got the shingles factor

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shingles vaccine right and she's in misery  Um for a couple days, but it's better than shingles  Well, yeah. Yeah, what I'm saying is people people then spread that and say oh these vaccines. They're awful  Right and and you're proving a negative again, but you don't get shingles. Well, by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There were there was a well-known  study of a  Flu vaccine. I think it was last year. It was a double blind  Which means placebo half the people got  Nothing half the people got the flu vaccine  More people who got the placebo complained of side effects than the people who got the vaccine  There's a there's a huge society. There's a huge, you know, uh  mind component in all of this  Um, I got the shingles vaccine and did not have any symptoms. So that's partly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's probably partly why tabloids have always worked so much. Exactly over the we love this stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so I just wanted to follow up with avaz. Yes, if you want to understand where it came from good, please do  It was co-founded by res publica  And also by move on.org good. We are familiar with move on and it is supported by the seiu

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The service employees international union  Which represents most nurses and people like that health workers. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they do they do polls and so it's kind of like imagine if you funded your change.org petitions and then you actually created  groups around them to  In had an outside organization help organize your change.org positions into actual physical real world action

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's so it's left leaning obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But um, it's it's heart is in the right place

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did campaign against donald trump in the 2016 election, how dare they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How dare they against our dear leader

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, can I ask you a question? I just saw something new that I had not seen before on twitter  Would you go to twitter, please or do you still have it or did you kill it leo? No, I have it but i'm, uh private on twitter  What what do you want to talk about jeff? Well because because what so if you do a retweet now  It used to say retweet or retweet with comment. Yeah, now it says, uh, basically, uh retweet  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on mine still says as quote tweet mine says

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mine says retweet with retweet as quote tweet. It does say that stacey  Yes, mine just started saying that today

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is typical of twitter. You know, it's not it's not universal eight-year rollout. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, mine says it's quote tweet too, but it's still the same functionality used to say quote tweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, he said with comment. Okay  All right. Never mind. I thought I thought they were trying to I I don't understand what their what their aim is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're pulling a google and changing the code

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're deprecating  Deprecating

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  uh speaking of twitter actually, this is something worth talking about because  Uh this broke fairly recently I think today it is a story from tech crunch by zach whitaker  It's talking about a university in michigan requiring students to install an app tracking their location for contact tracing  What's interesting is they can't opt out so the university makes you do this  the  cherry on top  So the app is called aura. It is made by a company that does not historically make contact tracing apps  And they've already found two security flaws  One allows you access to the apps back in servers big big not issue or sorry big issue rather  And then the other allows you to infer someone's coven 19 test results. Oh, yeah. Yeah, those vulnerabilities happen fixed  But this is a really interesting story. So  uh, I I thought  This is where the intersection of privacy and public health kind of come into conflict and where in the u.s  we're probably going to err more towards on privacy and  I I just was curious like if you you can't not download this app

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right if you're a student there, otherwise you get suspended but that seems fair because they they want to bring people back to the campus  So they're trying to find a way to do that safely  And a hundred percent compliance you can ask that it's you know, I mean, it's a public university  But you could ask that if that's part that's a con that's a concomitant with going with going back to school

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So another school is is is not allowing students to leave campus at all, right? They're imprisoned on campus

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does aura I don't think any I think there's always going to be somebody losing regarding school  Education nowadays. It's just it is what it is. Somebody's gonna lose spoken as someone was hit over the knuckles with a ruler

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Many many times I said this was the university of michigan. It is a university in michigan  Oh, my bad. Is it a private public? It's a private. Oh that makes I read it the same way because I read the I just read

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the um the headline, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What university is it does it say?  Albion, oh albion, which sounds yeah, it's a small school

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, okay, can I can I uh stacey bait? Can I ask stacey a question?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey you're asking me permission to stacey bait. Yes, I am. I give you permission

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think she'll like this one. So i'm trying to ask permission granted  um  Stacey dr. Stacey the google seeks to test six gigahertz broadband in secret test  story

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder if you could explain it to me explain it to me. This is we were talking about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Super high frequency broadband a couple of weeks ago, right?  I think it was last week last week. It was yes. I I haven't um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't really  Done it. Uh, I I wrote about using six gigahertz for broadband for actually what was webpass  So I have this thesis that companies with satellite  clinic satellite  Physical satellite dishes on top of people's roofs have an inherent advantage as we move to millimeter wave  Yes, so it makes sense can be a line of sight  Yeah, because you you do actually need  Something on the roof to do this. So yeah, this makes a ton of sense  I don't know what else you want me to say about it. Okay, I just want to this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  people constantly think that we're gonna have  the thing that frees us from wires, but but but  Never fiber will always be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is interesting and there have been other  Six, I don't know if it's been in six gigahertz or if it's been some of the tests have been actually in 24  Which is much more difficult. But yeah for something like this you do need line of sight  And you need the dishes to be fairly close together, but it could free us from wires  And what would happen is it go into the dish itself or into the cpe is the dish plus whatever and then you'd have it  That would be converted into wi-fi probably into your home  so  And you also by the way, if you do something like this you still need somewhere  A massive physical pipe to go to this is my massive physical. It's like a culvert for the internet. It's a big  You need that for backhaul because obviously  This six get this wireless has to like it's transmitted from somewhere  To your house, right? So you still need  That transmission tower needs to have a big fat pipe

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microwave internet's been around forever  Yeah, this is sounds like it's similar to that. It's the same thing. You have to dish you have to be high up  You have to have line of sight to the tower  Uh, it could be microwave can be very fast. Here's one company that does it  Geolinks and they can they say they can get up to a gigabit with very low latency, but you know  You have to have line of sight

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you sounds very niche to me it's yeah, it's for cities. It's for specialized use

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's a actually so this is one of those things where  I had argued for a long time that it would be bad for rural or not as useful for rural  But then I had some guys like in wisconsin or wyoming. I'm, so sorry people in wisconsin and wyoming  Argue they were they were wisp owners, which is a wireless isp. Oh, I bet you heard from brett  Brett glass contact you brett brett does not call me anymore, please don't mention

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He comes in here a lot he's a he's a wisp in wyoming

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And laramie and uh, let's not invoke that. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I won't say his name three times because that would only say it twice. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the wisp pointed out that it might still be economically viable  to have  essentially repeaters so  Maybe it would be okay for rural in some or they bring they because you still need fiber out to someplace, right?  To right and if you're still super far apart  But there are areas where it may be worth it to bring fiber  Especially if there's already fiber for like a cell tower nearby, right? You need that backhaul. That's the key. Yeah. Yeah  So I'm gonna start calling them internet culverts because that's just super culverts. I like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so google did in fact  Apply in 17 states

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what that's what amazed me it was this it was this mondo multi-state thing. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it's just a test. I think it's great. Yeah, um google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google fiber when they were building their fiber in austin for example, they actually built their own fiber backhaul around the city  so imagine you're pissed off because your  Awesome trench digging technology did not work out as anticipated and people started hating you  Uh, so now you're like well  What if I convince people to put dishes on their house and I offered them this broadband because they have the backhaul

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have the backhaul. They have the fiber. This is a last mile solution  at best last mile  So last half last block maybe I don't know. So did you did your friends?  Uh your friends in wyoming and montana say anything about the distance that you could go with this stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It depends on what I mean as as is always the case in wireless broadband it depends on  The weather yeah depends on if it rains you're out of luck. Yeah. Yeah, well that not not true  Not necessarily actually six gigahertz is pretty terrible  It'll bounce off anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's gonna be the big problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah  It'll it'll bounce off. Um human sacks of saltwater. Absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or just tiny droplets of drops of water. Yeah, yeah bushes. Yeah those pesky trees

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tear them down. That's what ronald reagan said just get rid of them. MIT researchers have found a new use for spot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're putting a little doctor on this robot dog  And they're using it to uh to test  Uh to do patient triage and test for covid 19. This isn't new  Well, no, they've been doing the triage for a long time. Oh, okay. I was like i've seen spot in hospital since

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's weird to me is this dog?  You know imagine spot coming in different colors, right?  Because singapore was using it to patrol its parks for social distancing. Right. MIT's testing, you know hospital remote patient care  Like you've got your red cross spot you've got your sentry enforcer spot that spot could do is there anything spot can't do

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Imagine you have a fever and spot comes into your hospital room

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's what they're doing because spot has  Next you have high blood pressure has can simultaneously measure skin temperature respiratory rate heart rate blood auctions and  Saturation while maintaining social distancing  It's tele tele operated they call it doctor spot  So the clinical staff drives spot the little dog in  And it's equipped with all this  measuring stuff  And they can get vital signs  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were net money be used for something else instead of that robot. Yeah, 75 000 robot just to take vitals

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well with the argument the argument that might be that that you're not  In in the case of covid  People couldn't  The doctors ppe and such  They were going through it at such a rate  They couldn't if it can go in and check on the patient every every 30 minutes  Without the doctor having to put be at more risk without humans being at greater risk

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay more often that's fair and medical but still 75k though

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No for a hospital if you look yeah  It's yeah, they they spend a lot of money on stuff that is unnecessarily expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what do you think about this?  The right to be forgotten  Uh and the question  The question whether I mean we don't like the right to be forgotten in general, but the question whether it is  Equally applied really starts to bring up some issues in 2014 a german princess

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was just stop right there, right? Whatever. This is stop right there. That's it  But there are still german princesses. There is a i was gonna say I didn't even know they existed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's a wittgenstein  She was 27, uh attended the october fest at in scotland at the university of saint andrews got a little tipsy  Assaulted police officers and first responders and said I was doing my nails this morning and wondering  How many muslims I could kill  This got into the news. What a shock  Her family with the help of google and the european right to be forgotten law  And many lawyers and many lawyers have been getting those those stories removed  197 links  to be exact  from the uh search  And thereby being removed from the world of the internet  Um, she apparently took off her clothes, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I find this interesting because I do think there's value in the right to be forgotten. I kind of wish young and  Yeah, I wish that when you turn 21  Your like internet search history was expunged, right? Yeah, just because kids  Do and say stupid things and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's not a kid though. She was 27

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well at 27, I I think you don't get that right anymore. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not gonna I mean 27. I was married if if you search. Yeah, right if you search for her name  uh in germany  Uh  You'll get almost exclusive results about her marriage if you search outside of germany you're gonna get those  those fun stories about the  drunken outburst  Uh, although, uh, if you you know dual does have a little thing it puts at the bottom of the page where it says  The information on this page represents a request to remove material from an online site or a dmca counter notice  Blah blah blah. It lets you know  That this was taken down out of the right to be forgotten. It doesn't give you what but it gives you  why

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to go back if I may for one moment to something that's just breaking. Yes  So back to q anon  Yes, so in his in his, uh update I think occurring now  Trump is asked to shed light on his thoughts about the lunatic q anon conspiracy theory says erin rupar  Instead of denouncing it. He says I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate  I've heard these people these are people who love our country. Oh lord  So  The war is not only on social media friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so it doesn't really matter what facebook does back right? Exactly. Although the president of the united states just endorsed q anon  But here's the difference. Okay, so that makes q anon. Okay  To a certain group of people but what facebook does is facilitate the actual  You know do the research which is the tagline on q anon it facilitates all of that  It provides you with all the document it allows somebody to go down that rabbit hole

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. It goes on  Reporter q anon believes you are secretly saving the world from this cult of pedophiles and cannibals. Are you behind that?  I can guess what he's drunk  Is that supposed to be a bad thing? Yes, we are actually we are saving the world you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's this is the second time he's been asked about the q anon the first time he just kind of moved on  I guess he's decided now to embrace

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is his base. Yeah, it's his base. He's got nowhere else to go. Yeah, it's his base

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook has said that  It will restrict the spread of q anon content on its pages groups and instagram accounts  It will allow people to post content  supporting movements like q anon if other policies are not broken  Such as those about harassment fake accounts hate speech or inciting violence, none of which q anon does outwardly  Q anon pages and groups will be ranked lower in its news feed in the near future  right after the election  Depending on what happens and the hashtags titles or accounts associated with the conspiracy theory will be demoted in search  Results they did remove 790 groups 100 pages and 1500 ads tied to q anon  They restricted over 10 000 instagram accounts. Wow  alongside  1950 groups and 440 facebook pages and blocked more than 300 hashtags  so  Of course the problem with the conspiracy theory is all of this anything that happens but all of this confirms the conspiracy theory  You go you see you see I told you it must be true  um  But I think probably, you know  And if you want to know what is q anon, there's a very good piece in the atlantic from last month  That I'd highly recommend  That that goes deep down the rabbit hole  It actually was I think the cover story in the  In the july or august by adrian le france  The prophecies of q it was really really well done  um  And there's a you know, it's deep. It's a deep long and it's a really good example of conspiracy theory  In fact, what's really interesting about q anon?  It's kind of a meta conspiracy theory. It takes all of the best parts of all the other conspiracy theories and merges it into one  weird volcano of conspiracy theories

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And pizza and laughs to keep from crying 5g

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got it all the the the protocols of the zion the protocols of the zion elders of zion  George soror all of that stuff is all kind of merged in to one  Weird thing and then and the funny thing is no matter what happens to counter it  Uh, there's always well  You see  That's the problem with conspiracy theory. It's just it's all really confirmation bias. It's just it's you you know, it's  Yeah, it's too bad. But what are you gonna do? Yeah  And by the way, trump is trump is not alone. There are 11 congressional  Candidates this election cycle that others just won in florida. There's 11 that publicly support one in georgia that actually won  Their she won her primary  But she's not alone  11 yeah  According to axios 11 gop congressional nominees support q anon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  congressional  Member of congress scott tipton in the republican primary for the third congressional  It's it's it's republican district and trump had endorsed tipton, but but lauren. Yeah beat him

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is bad news for the election because that's kind of why trump won in 2016 he was the fu candidate, right?  He was for people's sake politics as usual in q anon. Did you say that in french, please? It sounds so much better  I can't say it. I don't know how to say it like to conjugate it correctly for that  They didn't cover that and I can't remember  Yeah  re verb conjugation  anyway, um the point is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we lost ant he his zoom box shut down  Is that his monitor or is he? Oh, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I I have ordered some air conditioners, but okay, i'm still waiting on delivery. It's 87. Well, i bet they're hard to get. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh  Poor people of the deep south. That's my that's where I think it comes from

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  resourceful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember I used to sit in my boxer shorts spritzing myself in front of a fan. That's kind of like  That's like you're not one of them vision. It's pretty similar but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Requires action on your part. Yeah  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Zoom and all the other devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is part of the change like but we'll  Mention. Oh, is it this morning? I woke up because I saw that google is going to add duo and meet  to the nest  home max  Microsoft has announced they're going to take that lenovo  Screen that they that's a google home screen, but they're going to take that and they're going to make it a microsoft teams device  And now we hear that zoom and other  conferencing technologies are going to make it to  Facebook's portal same idea. So I ordered  Another I have one in the kitchen, but I ordered another because I thought this is actually at first. I thought stupid  Why do you need this? You know people have been asking us for this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is like one of the top on our little show we have a call-in question line  I've had at least four or five questions from people asking. How do we do this?  And the answer unfortunately was always you can't so we never

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I ordered pretty lousy the nest hub max because that's the one with the camera  And i'm hoping it's small enough that I could just put it in front of my computer  You know just right below the screen if it can't i'll mount it on a shelf right above the screen  And and the reason I thought well this is dumb because I can do this with my computer  But this is kind of a standalone dedicated meet or zoom  or duo device and because it's the google hub  I can it recognizes me. It shows my calendar. I can send audio messages. I can say, you know  Send a message to aunt. We're going to start 10 minutes late. It will record that voice and send it to him

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can make phone calls I can play music I can actually say  You know play some music on my stereo  I can control the lights  This is now i'm starting to get into this idea that maybe this little box could be the assistant in my office  My home office sitting right on the it could be like a little mini karsten  only more obedient  Promote time below it  More obedient and sitting right in front. I thought maybe I this is a good idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't think about any of that  But I did think that this is just further proven that working from home is definitely  normal and probably going to be that way for  Quite a long time not just for the rest of this year  But next year and beyond if we continue to get tools like this to help make it more of a simplified approach to get work done

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in theory you can even  Do your use your voice you could say hey, you know who start a meeting?  And on the screen  And you'll be glad to hear stacy and jeff beta support for g suite accounts  But you have to go to g.co  slash  G suite

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now does the google assistant hubmax follow you around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you move no, i'd have to attach it to a boston robotics  Spot dog  Are we going leo  Oh, does it follow you around? Yes, it does. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah the camera isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I thought you meant like from room to room jeff because I would love to be able to die

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, it will you can switch I want to be able to lecture by pacing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes  I want to stay with the white board and pace

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what that's what graduate students are for just bring it just have them aim the camera. That's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so zoom's going to be on all of them, right? It's going to be on on on  Um google and facebook and  eventually

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is one of those zoom announcements where they say  coming soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But is it on it's on the um  Uh a portal now or september

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's right portal next month

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  echo  Uh, it's slated to be available in the echo show  And google to power displays by the end of the year, right? But then the portal is also getting blue jeans  Which is what facebook uses because they refuse to use any google products. They wouldn't use meat  And webex and go to meeting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yay portal  That thing's still creepy I would not use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think i'm gonna regret this  I got two new you regret everything. I know I will I got two new phones on the way one  We mentioned last week, which is the the duo phone from microsoft the thinnest phone ever made the other  Is the pine phone which is going to be so clunky  It is oh, no, you didn't. Yeah. Yeah. I got the wrong link here. We have a pine phone  This is a linux phone. Well, I thought it'd be interesting to try a linux phone  Of course you would of course it's open source  Community driven  It's the moral panic phone. It's the moral panic phone. I'm gonna have my own very own moral panic phone  and  It's also the privacy phone because it has switches  Hardware switches to turn on or off lte wi-fi microphone speakers and cameras  So you want privacy? You don't have to break your phone in half and throw it out the window  Just flip a piece of glass that does nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I know you get a lot of grief for buying all of this stuff  That's pretty popular and newly released or whatever and you also get a lot of grief for buying some of the crap  Where did you see an instagram ads? I stopped but by quitting instagram

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this this looks more like up your alley. Yeah, and it it makes total sense  It's not the other thing is it's not expensive. It was like 150. Yeah, so  That's expensive to some people no, yeah, but relative to a modern smartphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sure  Relative to a thousand dollar phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sagan  The obama phone that's for uh, yeah, that's the low-income phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so I we we had on community leaders from the south bronx in the class I had before we were on today  And and I didn't realize how widely it is used there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah  I get callers all the time who?  It's only colloquially colloquially  Obama phone, I think it's it's a subsidized phone  Yes  for low-income people  Which is cool because it's great. Right  Nowadays, it's really is the way people

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Connect without it without it you you you're not connected to the world. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure how it stands under the current fcc  It has to be funded  By the fcc, so I don't know  It comes from the lifeline, you know, we all pay that lifeline fee. Yep a fee on our cell phone rural  Rural and others. Yeah. Yep  It's a it's called a lifeline phone really I think that's the actual  lifeline  phone service  Um  What else what else is going on  I could do the changelog. I just want to make sure I get everything  Before he does that that we that we head toward the home base, right? Yes. It's the it's the head for home sound  Uh, did you read the fake blog that this kid wrote and it got on hacker news?  It got a number one spot on hacker news using this ai tool gpt3  We've talked about it before  that generates

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pretty realistic  Here, this is the post i'll give this is the post  uh  It's a sub stack blog. So he was able to set it up quickly. This was the post that made it to hacker news feeling  unproductive maybe  You should stop overthinking  There's a picture of a guy thinking in order to get something done. Maybe we need to think less  It seems counterintuitive  But I believe sometimes our thoughts can get in the way of the creative process  We can work better at times when we tune out the external world and focus on what's in front of us  I've been thinking about this lately. So I thought it'd be good to write an article about it  So what does this mean? Well for starters, let's start with some definitions  Definition one creative thinking definition two overthinking. How do these two concepts relate to each other?  And they got there was a whole conversation on hacker news about it  It's taking it seriously

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it I was going to say was it voted up voted because it was nobody I could see it was only one post on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hacker news has said  Is this generated by an ai  So, uh the most recent post on the blog which is adolos  dot sub stack dot com adolos is  What would what I would do with a g with gpt3 if I had no ethics  Was gpt3 trained on reddit or hacker news articles? It was trained on articles. Uh, remember we talked about  It's from open ai remember and we read some stuff. I'm just wondering

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean because there is a style of writing that very much wins on  Yes, uh hacker news and so if it were trained on those articles, I would imagine that of course it would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the whole story is actually revealed in the final post on this blog adolos the kid  Uh, I'm sure you got an a  Uh, he talked about how easy was to do he got some help  Uh from a graduate student had been working on it and so forth  The way it worked. It turns out gpt3 does a very good job if you give it a prompt  Uh, so he would create some blog prompts  And then generate a number of articles which he would go through to pick the best one  The post went viral more than 26 000 visitors  Only one person reached out to ask if the post was ai generated although several commenters  Did guess that gpt3  Was the author but

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The community downvoted those comments. I don't want to hear that. No, no, no, no, no  I don't think less

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really a wild story  He's a computer science student at the uc berkeley  That's what I was gonna ask he had to get access to the api, which is not public  Only researchers and can get it in a private beta from open ai  But he knew a phd student who had access to the api who agreed to work with him  uh poor  The student wrote a script that gave gpt3 a blog post headline an intro  It would generate a few versions of the post  Uh, then he'd choose one for the blog copy pasted  From gpt3's version with very little editing. So it sounds like there might have been a little bit of a  a tune up on this liam  poor  Was the student?  So maybe we are getting a little closer to that  Liam suggests gpt3  Writing and he puts that in quotes could replace content producers  Readers  The whole point of releasing this in private beta  Is so the community can show open ai new use cases that they should either encourage or look out for  Notably, he does not yet have access to the api even though he's applied for it  He said to mit technology view review. It's possible. They're upset. I did this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, it's not in my top 10  It's kind of a boring gin boring. It's i like i like gins that have a little something like a little  Uniqueness or punch so I like like I like 209 because it has a hint of coriander, right?  You can taste that in there and you're like, oh, what's that? There's coriander in my gin  And aviation it is very smooth, but you know at that point you might as well be drinking vodka

Transcript:  So, um  You wrote a piece on buzz machine jeff about the youtube convention

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I also wrote it on medium, but you get pissed at me if you went there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I put it up the buzz machine. I pay five bucks to have you do now. Oh good boy  Oh, there's enough good stuff there  I want to support it. Um, but it's interesting because  Here we are and this is not I don't this is not partisan content because there'll be a republican convention next week  But here we are in an era where you can't really do a convention  How do you simulate because conventions historically are a big bump for the party  It's like a big long week long ad on on television  So how do you get all that gin up all that excitement get all that attention?  And you call it the youtube convention

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did it work appropriate to the age? I think so. I mean if you watch  Michelle obama, I mean what I mean by youtube too is the intimacy of it  Right you watch you michelle obama and she's just talking to you. Yeah, she's not talking for a television camera  She's not talking for a huge cheering crowd. She's not doing all that  She's talking to you. Yeah, and then I saw a clip of hillary clinton  Closing the nominations very different obama and the noise and all this and all that that was that was just it was a bs  Thing that was made for television  But the next generation is youtube generation this and they didn't try it this way they had to do this, right?  They were forced into it by the pandemic, but I found it fascinating  that um  It really is appropriate to the time  And is more conversational in a way because you know, you can you can rather than just applauding  You can you can talk about it on twitter. You can send it around you can in a normal tone of voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in fact, that's one thing and and uh  Joe biden's having a little difficulty with this the older pauls are having a little different quality not declaiming  Bernie sanders shouted the whole time because they're used to giving speeches  And so it's the younger people  Who had a little bit more a little more comfort with michelle obama was a good example  Uh, and actually you'd expect her but she's not a politician is she so right? Maybe that's why she was able to do it  but she

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She was brilliant. And then and then last night they had the roll call the stage  Which I you know, you know the most boring thing it was great and then calamari in roteisland. Yeah, brilliant

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so I when I was telling lisa lisa and I were watching it and uh  When I was a kid, I was such a you know politics nerd  I would actually get graph paper and I would put all the states and I would write  Because this was back in when a convention you might have multiple it wasn't decided by the time you got to the convention  So you'd have multiple votes and there'd be a lot of politicking in between  It was really the smoke-filled room. And so it was really fun  And as a kid, I remember staying up late saying oh he's almost got enough it was really exciting  But that's of late. That's all been gone. It's all very  Very much stage managed and this was stage managed, but at least we got to see the states

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really enjoyed it. It was and also they had a time limit. So it wasn't gonna go on forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um carsten's making an excellent point. He's channeling it right now. Let me let me hear it  He says and I agree with him the use of celebration  When he crossed the threshold was a little bit cringy. I agree  Okay, and they couldn't do a balloon drop  and honestly  Uncle joe didn't really know what to do  It's different if you're standing on a stage  Actually, though the candidates never at the convention when he gets nominated  And it's only been in recent years. You've had a feed a tv feed and years passes. Oh, well  Senator kennedy  Will be here in two days to give his speech. He has to take the train out  And that would that would be it you wouldn't see so it's always been a little cringy since they've started having these tv feeds of the  candidate  But joe just didn't really know he started picking at his pants at one point. It was like he didn't know what to do  But you know the family came in through confetti bless his heart it was a bless his heart moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Putter joe says they should have done a tricaster virtual balloon drop

Transcript:  Where's mr. Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they did a very I think he did given the limitations of what they could do  It was a little bit but it always is isn't it a little bit promotional?  But it was I thought it was it was surprisingly engaging

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, and that's why I think it was it was really appropriate at the time  So that's what I wanted to say about it. Yeah, I was I was passionate and the other good news  Is you don't have 15 000 in recent years they have sent 15 000 journalists to the convention  Where no news occurs, right where they just all pontificate and predict and and postulate  And uh, it's a huge waste of resource  In journalism, and so I think it's a good thing all around

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I heard you remember dan rather  Well 68 he had the big backpack with an antenna  And he was down on the floor and he's looking up at the sky booth because all the networks had a sky booth  And the you know, frank mcgee or whoever was sitting there and dan what's going on on the floor?

That was wild

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then there was some news being made at that time. That was the last time that was there was too much news in 68  So there's gonna never be news again. Yeah  So I think I think we're over we're over that  spectacle wow  I don't know what trump's gonna because because trump dies for the spectacle right he is of the spectacle

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what do you think? So next week are they will this will be actually if anything the only thing will be interesting to me and you  Will be the comparison between how they use the technology and so forth.

Here's an example  On iceland the new map design does a better job distinguishing between the ice caps and the greenery  So you can actually now see those ice caps  Google says it uses satellite imagery as the basis for the redesign maps and it has a new color mapping algorithmic technique  So, uh, here's the before actually here's a before  And here's the after I kind of like before better  Before makes iceland look like it's all ice which is not. That's right. It's only a little ice  Makes it look more like greenland  So that's that's I guess how about this? Here's uh, you can see vegetation  On the northern coast of morocco. So this is not satellite imagery. It's just the non-satellite map injury imagery  enhanced  So you can see that I think that's interesting because you wouldn't necessarily assume that northern morocco  Would be that green, you know, but it is  It is  Yeah, i'm all for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh mute mute mute mute mute

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I'm muted, sorry zoom moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, really unmute your zoom is on the bingo card

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry y'all my dog is just nuts. No, it's fine  So I was i'm a little confused because I think this is actually out but it's still sending me the indiegogo page  so i'm a little like oh I guess  This may not be out but it's about to be out or you can buy one of 22 that's available now  So this is the fire walla gold  And fire walla makes an internet security device that you plug into your router  The gold is the new consumer version  And this is a device that we have tested out. We did not test out the gold. We tested out the blue  Which was the enterprise version but the gold has  It does deep packet inspection. It is local on your network. Really? Wow  So  What it's doing is it's basically monitoring your network activity for weird discrepancies and insecure sites  When it finds them it sends you a notification you can quarantine devices. It also has like a vpn and  So, let's see. What else does it have?  Uh, oh network segmentation. That's  Not a hundred percent sold on it. It's got an ad blocker

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the kind of thing you'd want if if you wanted to segment your iot devices from the rest of your network that kind of thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is this is a very  Powerful device and the gold like the red was the cheaper version that they had for consumers  But it was only for 100 megabit per second connections  And so it would slow down your network if you were using it on faster things because you know  It just didn't have the computing power to do the dpi  um  now with gold it's super fast and  it's awesome and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can handle they say up to three gigabits, which is fantastic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I would say though if you buy this you should let people on your network know that you will be able to see  The sites they go to is the person who's managing the network the dashboard shows that huh?  So yeah, so I just you know, like so your kids you should be like hey  Yo, when you're going to those those questionable sites, I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This looks roughly like the edge router x i've been using from ubiquity

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it is it's a little friendlier than the ubiquity router that's not  Yeah  That was it was that diplomatic of me? I thought that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The advantage of the edger router x is it's 50 59 bucks. How much is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, this is a little more you could buy it buy it now for 396. So 400 bucks. Yeah  Yeah, yeah, but for normal people this is actually quite good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna have to address this because we're getting uh, we're getting our whole home  Wired we've got somebody coming out. We're gonna get it. We're gonna build a rack  Uh, we're gonna do the whole thing and I think i'm really gonna have to need a security appliance like this  So i'm gonna have to really start to look at these

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a good one. We we're actually so we're testing the fire wall of gold right now, but  We had tested the other one and really liked it. It did not impact network performance  Which can sometimes happen just kind of like a pie hole on steroids  Yeah, and again, this is  This is for people who don't want to do, you know  Take a pie and download specialized software to it and manage all that themselves

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's more sophisticated and deep packet inspection is a is a very is a high-end firewall feature  It means you can look into the packets and uh and see what's going on there, which is but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need that for iot stuff. Yeah. Um, well I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the thesis anyway, yeah, this is really interesting. Yeah  Yeah, i'm see i'm trying i'm i'm torn. I mean the other option is to go with a appliance running pf sense  Which would be also less expensive, but i'm gonna this is i'm gonna have to do some research on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know if you want i'm happy to hook you up with them and i'm sure they will uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Send you i'm just gonna read your review. I don't do that, but i'll read your review and then i'll decide

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We send ours back and then buy them. Yeah, exactly  That's i'm like i'm i'm having this issue right now because i'm trying to install the the leak monitoring systems and they're like  Okay, we're gonna send a plumber out to install it, but we don't want it back and i'm like you have to take it back

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know I know  Uh, this by the way would be a really good tool in building the great firewall of stacey  Because it has goip filtering so you could say I don't want anything from china coming in my house

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would then void like a good chunk of my smart home devices because a lot of them do talk  They do pick out data. Oh how interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Forget tiktok. What about your smart home device?  This is interesting. Yeah, i'm gonna i'm gonna look a lot at this firewall. It's on indiegogo right now will be 500  Uh, it's a it's a deal right now 396  And there's only 22 left. So hurry  hurry  Jeff you got a number
