So thanks for letting me kind of take it over.  Joining us today, of course, Stacey Higginbotham, creator of the IoT podcast and Internet of  Things newsletter.  How are you doing, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks.  Fantastic.  It's good to have you here.  Good to see you.  And then also we don't have Jeff quite yet.  Hopefully he's in France and maybe he will he will fly in at some point.  If so, we'll we'll make room on the set, of course, for him.  But in in his absence, we have Kevin Toffle coming back about Chromebooks.com and also  the IoT podcast along with Stacey.  How's it going, KT?  You silly America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's going well.  Probably.  I'm probably not as happy as Stacey is right now.  And we'll find out why a little later.  But I'm in a good mood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, boy.  That's quite a setup.  Right now.  But do we have to wait until later?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's not my thing of the week.  So, oh, OK, if you want to.  OK, cool.  Is that what we call it?  The thing of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, those those things and items and whatever it is that we call them.  Why don't we start the show with something good?  Why don't we start the show with something that Stacey is excited about?  What are you excited about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the moment for the gin calendar, right?  Not not Google stuff.  I think so.  Last week.  Is that your thing of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that your thing of the week?  Is your thing of the week the gin calendar?  If so, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was my thing of the week last week.  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so what happened is Kevin Toffle apparently decided that I was worthy of owning one of  these and he ordered one for me as a Christmas present, which is really nice.  Thanks, Kevin.  So I'm having my first gin and tonic made with one of my brand new gins.  It's from Italy and it is quite delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, this totally works.  Chicken head in the chat.  Twig this week in gin.  It works.  I don't know if that was coined last week, but it works for this week, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so, which is really astonishing.  Yeah.  So this is yeah, I will not drink too many of these, but I did want to partake and enjoy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that you should drink too many of those.  If it's an advent calendar, you got to at least drink one a day.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is my daughter's argument.  She's like, I ate the chocolate right away when I opened my advent calendar.  You've got four unopened bottles, mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got some catching up to do.  When did she say you're going to break your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  When did when did that start the first?  An advent calendar counts down one to 24 days.  Right.  So Christmas Eve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Today is the fifth.  So you should go through five on the show and get caught up.  Good God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I mean, I bounce this alcohol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, let's see how we could break this up.  If you finish a bottle before the first ad, then a bottle before the second ad,  then a bottle before the third ad and then a bottle with your thing at the at the end  of the show.  I mean, that's four bottles.  You're close at that point.  OK, a shot right now.  That way, you're guaranteed to make it.  And I swear this entire episode might make the best of in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There we go. Well, I don't want to be.  I'll definitely hit one.  If I hit two, we'll be OK.  That's not crazy amounts of alcohol.  I can still talk intelligently about some things, not all things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, she does two or three on the IOT podcast and she's fine every week.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's it, like eight in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's the eight in the morning.  Everyone knows is the best time for gin.  We all know this.  Tell I start my day.  What do we want to start with that doesn't involve alcohol?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what's happening with with the communications  platforms that we have long mocked Google for.  Oh, boy. Yes.  Hangouts. I I feel like I should be where I am wearing black.  But but what's happening there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is going on with Hangouts?  Well, apparently, nine five Google has sources that say Hangouts  is going to reach its end of life in 2020.  I feel like the writing has been on the wall here with Hangouts.  And then we'll talk about it.  I'll in a second. The writing is really on the wall with aloe.  But, you know, they made the shift away from Hangouts  as a consumer product towards it being an enterprise product.  Of course, Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet, I think, are only available  if you're a G Suite subscriber.  But nine five Google posted this this article to say, well,  the consumer version of Hangouts is going away.  And somebody on the team from Google said, wow, you know, your sources are really  off the mark. Scott Johnson.  There we go.  From Google says your sources are off the mark  that the consumer Hangouts will at some point be upgraded  to Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet.  I don't know. As as usual with Google messaging, I'm completely confused  when news or leaks happen.  You just never actually know what the deal is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Hangouts Chat is is just chat and Hangouts Meet is the audio  and video what help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. So, Stacey, you have a G Suite account.  I do not. And you and I use Hangouts all the time.  We will never talk again.  No, we won't. Not on regular Hangouts, because once we get migrated  or until we get migrated, I should say, if Hangouts is sort of shut down,  I don't think they'll do that.  Where consumers don't have an option.  You would have to invite me to a video chat, for example,  because I'm outside of your G Suite domain.  Using what? You would use Hangouts Meet  for video or Hangouts Chat to chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so I would still use it and invite you.  But it would no longer be this wonderfully convenient  I am kind of function on the side of my Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Correct. It would no longer be this wide open I am,  which is really how it's been since day one or since the product before it.  However, we want to look at it.  So and what Google it's ironic that we're talking about messaging apps  and it's really Google's messaging.  That's that's really the issue here.  It's it's branding, it's messaging, it's PR.  They have to tell a story here and they're not telling it.  They're letting the story be told for them.  And that's not the way you want to do things.  Meet and Aloe or Aloe and Duo.  I mean, that was going to replace things that sort of didn't happen.  Is Duo I don't know what's going to happen to Duo  because why would you have a duplicate of Hangouts Meet and Duo?  I'm not sure. But they did, Jason, as you said,  you know, start devoting resources away from consumer towards enterprise.  And I mean, a lot of enterprises that comes with their G Suite,  a lot of enterprises actually do use that as a G Suite shop.  That's pretty much the thing to use.  But it just wasn't clear on what was happening with the consumer side.  It wasn't clear from the time they put Aloe and Duo out there  a year and a half, two and a half years ago, whatever it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, and obviously, it's, you know, it's continued to be confusing today.  A nine to five Google post from a reliable source there  says that Aloe is going to be shut down, quote, soon,  although they say it's probably at least somewhat delayed  because of this Hangout story that, you know, that published  that we started talking about.  The last Aloe update happened back in January.  That was about the time that the Aloe  lead Emmett fully left for Facebook.  And then if you remember, Aloe's team was entirely diverted over to  Android messages to kind of lead up that team, which, you know, there  at that point, you're kind of like, OK, well, Aloe's days are definitely numbered.  It's just so confusing.  There's so much movement.  There's so many name changes.  There's so many.  Well, let's stop, you know, stop making our product for consumers.  And now it's for business.  And now it's back to consumers again.  No wonder nobody knows what's going on.  It's just so confusing.  So right now, then, should I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not going to worry about this until like right before it sunsets.  But I am going to keep my eyes open, because then what kind of messaging  and I am service do I use to talk to the world?  I can't use Facebook Messenger because I don't use Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. That's a good question.  I mean, I mean, I think I think Google would love for Android messages at some point.  It is still called Android messages, right?  There's messages.  Where's the Google messages?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's texting. I don't want I need a differentiation between texting and voicemail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And voicemail.  Oh, sorry, not voicemail. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Text texting and like I am chat. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think I think the idea behind Android messages was that it was going to get the RCS  functionality built into it, which would bring it closer to being a more unified  product of yes, SMS, but also kind of the chat features that you get in a messaging app.  I don't know. You know, but you might you might want those siloed  between two different places entirely, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do, because my friends text me and I like to ignore it.  But I need my my messaging needs to be immediate.  And those aren't my friends.  Those are my work people who might also be my friend.  Wait, wait. Yeah, I was going to say, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like you evil woman.  Give me that. Say it about me. Huh?  Yeah, I this all ties in, as you're saying, the RCS chat.  I know we're going to discuss that in a second.  But I just wonder, see, part of the issue is Android messages is an Android app.  It's not like you're going to have that on an iPhone,  whereas you have iMessage and, you know, on your iPhone.  So are they going to make that work together? I don't know.  Google wants an open platform, I think, for chat.  And it's hard to do when you've got iOS and iMessage.  So I thought Hangouts was that because I use Hangouts on my iPhone all the time.  He's on my Apple Watch. Talk to Stacey when I'm walking the dog.  I mean, I don't I don't know.  I think they're just trying to figure out what to do.  And a lot of these I am clients have been bought up.  You know, we chat is what with Facebook now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is we chat with Facebook or is it a know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, what's it? What's up? There we go.  There's too many of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are. And they're all like combinations of the same words,  but in different orders and stuff.  Yeah, no, it's true. It's confusing at this point.  Even when Gulo Gulo, Google came out with Aloe,  it still felt like Google was behind, like it had already missed that opportunity.  And the fact that Aloe is being shuttered after not very long of existing  and after Google totally built it up in the beginning,  proves that it was just really late to the game with Aloe.  And it should have, you know, moved on that type of a product before  or or that Hangouts was the solution all along.  And for whatever reason, they decided to bail and change their strategy.  And that's really unfortunate because I feel like at a certain point,  all they really needed to do was really cultivate that SMS  functionality within Hangouts and kind of clarify it a little bit.  And that would have been the great option.  That would have been the perfect service.  People were using it already.  But that's just not how Google does things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I could tell you a little bit about how Google does things.  And I think two of these come into play here.  One is that over the past couple of years, Google has made a really big push  to get into enterprise and therefore differentiate some of its products  between enterprise and consumer.  So that's why we have Hangouts and Hangouts Meet, for example.  Secondly, I can't stress this enough.  Google is such a data driven company that I don't want to say  it doesn't matter if consumers or people like a certain product  that Google doesn't care that they like it.  But if the data shows that they're not getting, you know, their 10x  or 100x efficiency return or whatever it may be or engagement, et cetera,  they don't keep it around.  That's that's how they look at everything.  It's all data driven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes sense.  And you mentioned Duo as far as like, who knows what's going to happen with Duo?  Strangely, I think Duo is one of the things that seems to be working OK.  The Duo ends up pre-installed on phones.  I think it's getting it's getting regular updates.  I think I just saw in the chat room a new update today  that's around improving faster video messaging using Duo.  But I but I don't know how that interplays with a video solution on,  you know, Hangouts chat or I guess it would be Meet.  I don't know. I still only have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see. I have six contacts in Duo.  Three of them are people I forced to be on to talk to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you are not sold on the Duo strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, I'm just like, and one of one of them is Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I can see I actually know I still out of all of my contacts.  There's only a few that are actually on Duo.  Yeah. Oh, Jerry W.  You know, a tweet is on Duo.  Go Jerry W. Jerry. Hey, Jerry.  Yeah. I have never used Duo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, aren't we using Duo to connect with you in France right now?  Isn't Duo powering our French connection?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm using Skype from from Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course you are.  Jeff Jarvis, BuzzVision.com.  How you doing, Jeff? It's great to see you.  All right. Let's hope this works.  So far, so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, you need to grab a bottle of vino  because this is a beverage heavy twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I already had mine laid here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we all have a beverage.  It's just 50 percent of us have water and the other 50 are getting drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just utterly trashed, trashed on twig.  No. OK. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's good to have you here, Jeff.  We did not talk about the slate without you,  because I'm sure that you are you are interested in the Google Pixel Slate.  We might as well do that now because I just said the words out loud.  What do you think? First of all, before we kind of talk about,  you know, Kevin's had his time with the Pixel Slate,  I've had a good amount of time with my Pixel Slate.  I'm always curious to know, Jeff, where you stand on Google's  solutions for its Chrome OS, you know,  salute tablets and and and laptops and everything.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So just now I was trying to get on and I had to reboot  because the Android app insisted on answering.  It wouldn't let go.  And we know that it's inferior.  And I had to get to the Skype on the browser, which isn't perfect either.  But so I had to reboot.  So what's the problem there?  The problem is that Android apps on Chrome are still inadequate.  Thus, the app world on Chrome is still inadequate.  I love my Pixelbook, as does Kevin like his.  For God's sakes, he devoted a blog and part of his career to it.  Bless him.  But I'm not ready to say that Chrome is the OS for all yet.  And as a tablet goes,  I think Android is still a better OS for a tablet than Chrome is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Android is a bet is better as a tablet OS than Chrome OS is  as a tablet.  Neither are amazing.  Tablet form.  It's a low bar.  Yeah. But if you had to choose between the two and I, I might.  I would actually probably agree with that, even though I thought that I would  carry the other side of it, because in my time with the Pixel Slate  in the like there just isn't a whole lot of points in my life  where I really want to work in a productivity environment with a tablet.  But I've kind of forced myself to with the Pixel Slate.  And all it's done has been full of headaches.  Like it's just weird little hiccups trying to be productive  on the Pixel Slate in tablet mode, working within like Google  Docs and everything like that.  I appreciate that Google has has made the updates.  Yeah, here it is with an overhead shot that they've made the updates to  Chrome OS to better appeal to tablet form factors.  But I don't know if it's going to is going to snap out or does it feel the magnet  behind? There we go.  So, I mean, it's it's set up a little bit nicer for a touch environment.  But there's just weird stuff like I've had.  I've been trying to multitask and do like the split screen thing.  So I'd have one one app on this side, one app on this side.  And I tap onto one side to edit into the field.  And the onscreen keyboard would come on and throw everything out of order.  And you can minimize it down into a small keyboard on the side.  But there was just no fluidity, no seamlessness about it.  I'd tap over here to type and it would still be caught over on this window.  And then I'd have to go over here and find out where I typed over there,  because even though I typed over here to put focus on this side, it still didn't  register. And just weird things like that, that, you know, on a productivity stamp  device, that's going to slow you down.  And you're only going to deal with that so many times before you completely give up.  And that's how I feel about the tablet form factor on the Pixelbook slate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So let me let me ask a question here.  Actually, I'll make an agreement with Jeff.  There's definitely work to be done on Android apps in Chrome OS.  That's not unique to the Pixel slate, because the Pixel slate runs the same  software as every other Chromebook.  It's actually one version ahead right now, but the rest will catch up next week.  So any Android app issues you have on the slate, you're going to have elsewhere as well.  It's no different. Yeah. However, I guess I've been using this full time for productivity.  Like I spent six hours yesterday coding on it, writing some blog posts.  Doing my normal stuff.  And I was very productive, which is not what you just said you were, Jason.  What did you do in a tablet environment or did you do it with a keyboard?  That's the point I'm bringing up.  So I don't I'm kind of being funny here.  Don't take this the wrong way. You're using it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, no, I would agree.  I would absolutely agree. But yes, continue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't I don't really mean it that way.  But my point is to be productive on most any device.  You probably need a hardware keyboard. Right.  Yeah. To try and split screen and use an onscreen keyboard  and expect the same productivity that you would get from a laptop or desktop.  I don't find that to be a feasible expectation.  So, yes, I have the keyboard attached.  It's actually on my lap. It was on my lap for six hours yesterday.  I was in a recliner.  Yes, the keyboard does wobble or the slate wobbles when you type.  I'm kind of used to it by now.  A lot of people wrote it off after one day and I get that.  That's a very personal choice keyboards.  But I would never try and be productive with this without the keyboard  for any length of time, I guess I should say.  And when I don't want to be productive, meaning that's when I'm going to watch  my YouTube TV and just cruise the web and chill out and whatnot.  That's when I take the keyboard off and I'm just in my lean back mode with my tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I never have lean back modes with my tablet anymore.  That's my problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, when I'm in lean back mode, I'm like, screw my devices.  Is there a jigsaw puzzle I can do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I completely agree, Kevin.  And it's a fair point.  I think my exercise has been if Google has created a device that it sees  and has created a device around its updates to Chrome OS  to make it more friendly in both a docked environment and a touchscreen environment.  How far could I push that?  And could I be productive if I didn't have that keyboard?  I would say that in that regard, I probably am using it wrong.  There's probably better uses for just the tablet mode.  In that case, it's probably fine.  Like you said, though, you are going to run into these issues with Android apps,  which is, you know, I would say a large part of what you might want to do  with it in tablet mode is, oh, well, I'll run a tablet app and play some games  and whatever, and there are going to be weird little issues  that pop up here and there.  And that's probably more on that kind of strange kind of  sandwiching of Android app compatibility into Chrome OS.  Sometimes I like I love that as a feature  and I love that they are capable of doing that.  But sometimes I just I desire more,  more, more, more streamlined something with it.  And at least Chrome OS in a keyboard environment feels  feels familiar to me from the Pixelbook.  And I can move fast on a Pixelbook.  And I'll be honest, like this the PixelSlate keyboard,  when I first started using it, I didn't care for it.  It's really grown on me.  I think my my only complaint for it is that it does have this kind of deep  deepness to it, that if you're really using it, you know, on your lap  as a laptop, it can be a little awkward.  Thankfully, it like I'm six foot eight, so I have really long legs.  So it works for me.  I could see how it would not work for most people,  because it's just super deep as far as that's concerned  and a little wobbly when you're when you're in that situation.  But so possibly for me, maybe that bridge.  Have you checked out the bridge keyboard option?  Is it out yet?  I think it is. Yeah, it's out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's forty dollars less than the Google option.  And it has less of a footprint because you're just sliding  the tablet piece into the keyboard itself.  There's no nothing behind the keyboard at that point for a base.  It's more stable, for sure.  I didn't find the typing experience or the trackpad experience quite as good.  I'm not saying it's bad.  But also it's Bluetooth and Chrome OS has some Bluetooth issues.  Google's been working on a new Bluetooth stack for Chrome OS.  So I didn't want to go that route, even though I know it would have made  for a better laptop. But yeah, I mean, it's it's out.  It's it's nice. It's nice.  I did. I felt the same as you, Jason.  I wasn't too crazy.  In fact, 10 minutes after my review unit got here,  I was on email with my PR contract at Google.  I'm like, what is up with this keyboard?  Why is it wobbling, et cetera, et cetera?  And, you know, I mean, they know what's done is done.  It's been designed and all I could do is make suggestions at this point.  Yeah. So but it has grown on me.  And. You know, it's kind of like phones when I get a really big phone,  bigger than what I used to have.  I'm like, oh, this is terrible.  A couple of days later, like, it's not so bad.  And then a week later, I'm like, what was I complaining about?  This is awesome.  I know it's not keeping me from being productive, I should say.  So I would tell people to give it a try if they're interested in a tablet.  And not everybody needs a tablet.  That's a whole other aspect of this conversation, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. The key to me here is you're both right.  The problem is that because you're right, Kevin, this is exactly like my Chromebook  Pixel. The only thing is that I hardly ever think of it as a tablet,  except when you buy the slate, you're thinking of first as a tablet.  And that brings out all its weaknesses. But it is the same.  The only time I use the Pixel as a tablet is I just did on the airplane,  come in here and flip it around to watch a movie or something.  Otherwise, I am always in laptop mode and it is always a wonderful machine.  The only weakness is when I get on the plane and I want to watch Netflix  or come here and use Skype.  But otherwise, yeah, it's great.  But when you have a tablet, every tablet, we just become more apparent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't disagree with what you said, but it's kind of funny.  I look at it completely the opposite.  I looked at it as I love my Pixelbook, but I'm not a fan of using that  in tablet mode for my entertainment time because it's heavier and so on.  So I'm like, I can get the Pixelbook laptop experience here.  And then when I want the little leanback experience later, just a tablet,  I just pull it off and go sit down somewhere and I'm good.  I don't know. Again, I'm looking at it differently because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many computers do you own or how many computers do you work on on a daily basis?  I mean, because I think that's part of it.  If you have like a regular laptop, you have a tablet.  I don't know if you need a tablet, but if you have a regular laptop,  would you use this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was full time on the Pixelbook for about six or eight months.  Before that, I was full time in an iPad Pro for a year and a half.  And Jason, I didn't use that without a keyboard.  I wouldn't even try. It was the same same discussion we had earlier.  I mean, I was productive, but with their keyboard.  The slate, I sold my Pixelbook already. I shipped it two days ago.  I'm full time on the slate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, and it's a really fair point that as far as,  you know, you using the iPad Pro with a keyboard,  100% of the time, this is,  this is probably my first time using this type of a device,  like this type of a convertible that pops out the tablet with any sort of  regularity outside of just like, oh, that's interesting.  That's neat for 20 minutes or, you know, maybe a short amount of time.  Like I've been living on the slate for, you know,  since I got it like a week and a half ago. And so it's my first time,  kind of thinking in these terms. And yeah, I,  I feel like you've,  you've kind of turned a light bulb on in my head as far as that's concerned,  cause I wanted to hold it.  I want to hold it to a certain standard because it presents itself as a tablet,  OS, you know, Chrome OS device.  And I want it to work so well in that mode for things.  So you don't always need the keyboard, but the reality is,  it's just really hard to do that.  And you really see that when you're editing a Google doc and you type into a  cell and then suddenly the keyboard pops up,  you've got this much viewable space above it.  And it's like,  it doesn't know where to put the contents of everything on the screen.  It becomes, everything becomes kind of jumpy and unexpected. And, and, uh,  that's so then that's a way to do it. It's not the way to do it.  The way to do it would be to use some sort of an attachment like this keyboard.  And in that regard, I would say with the keyboard attachment, absolutely.  I'm just as productive as I would be with my pixel book that I've gotten very  used to. And I think when I first got this, uh, you know,  probably like a day or two after getting this, I was like, Oh man,  I'm totally going to go back to the, the,  the pixel book because I just don't know if I can do this.  I'm happy that I continued working with it because I do,  I have come around to it and you're right.  It's nice to be able to pop it out if I wanted to. I just haven't,  I haven't flown on any,  on any airplanes and needed to entertain myself by popping it out yet.  So apparently I need to take a trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No,  you just need to take an office chair and stick another office chair about 17  inches in front of your office air and then try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That could do it because yes, exactly.  I wouldn't have any space to put this on the tray in front of me on a plane if I  wanted to get work done. So there's the opposite problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just take these questions, Jason. If, if next week,  Jay Leo came back and said you're allowed one machine for everything,  which one is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh boy. Um, I think I, I general,  in general the past few years have,  have tried to keep myself committed to whatever the latest Google released phone  is and the Google released, uh, you know, a pixel, uh, laptop,  whatever incarnation. So I probably picks the, pick this because I feel like,  I feel like I need personally,  I need to be along with Google at the front of their kind of philosophy.  You know what I mean? And so I probably would pick this because,  because in all reality, this,  this whole environment is not is not making me less, uh,  productive when I have it all docked and, and in this, in this boat,  the length of it is annoying, but it's not a deal breaker for me.  You know what I mean? Everything else I'm able to do just as good as anything  else. So that I use,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  are you going to buy the bridge keyboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know because every,  every review that I read about it makes it seem like it's a great solution.  If you want the form factor while it's docked to be more pixel book like,  but it's not very good if you have high, uh,  if you have a high bar for the quality of the track pad and the keyboard,  like you said, Kevin,  what's, what's that?  And Bluetooth problems and Bluetooth problems. That's another big one.  So I don't know if that's worth it to me. Um,  because I know for myself that one of the things that really annoys me about a  lot of the pixels, uh,  the Chrome books that I've tested over the last couple of years is the quality  of the track pad and the quality of the keyboard that right there,  like everything else could be amazing, but if those things feel like a toy,  then I never want to use it period.  And so if that's going to be the bridge keyboard, then it's not worth it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin, have you played with the, uh, the, the, the Bluetooth upgrade?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, I have not installed it on the pixel slate because I don't have a Bluetooth  keyboard for it. So, uh, other than, uh, let's see, I had my Sony,  uh, Sony's to watch a couple hours of Netflix last night, Bluetooth connected.  I had no problems. Um, but you know,  I think it's hit or miss depending on the device that you're connecting,  the type of device, which Bluetooth chip it has,  because there are some people in the forums that say,  I don't have any Bluetooth problems, but yet there's a lot of people who do.  So I don't know what it is.  It's called the upgrade yet.  Oh, anybody can get it. It's in the Chrome flags.  You just go into Chrome flags and it's a new blue,  any WB L U E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You enabled it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not on the slate. I had it on my pixel book,  but I generally didn't have any Bluetooth problems. So I don't know,  but people can try it if that's, you know,  if they're having Bluetooth problems on a pixel book on any Chrome book,  actually, um, just go into the flags and turn new blue on, um,  give that a shot. Maybe that'll help.  It's kind of funny. Just, just real quick, uh, cause I don't want to, you know,  hock up the whole show with pixel slate, but, um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  please do. That's why we're here for it, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's just, I mean, I read,  I read all the reviews that came out the same day as mine and whatnot.  And part of me after reading some of them was like,  did we use the same device?  Because I couldn't even replicate some of the issues that people said they saw.  And I don't doubt that they saw them,  but I don't know why I couldn't replicate them.  There are other many legitimate gripes. Don't get me wrong. It needs,  it needs some, some work. I think everything is very fixable,  but I keep hearing, I just heard this a few minutes ago in the conversation here,  you know, this is a tablet first. And I'm like, again,  I'm not sure I look at it that way because it has a desktop,  it has a desktop browser, which is a plus on a tablet.  No other tablet save for Microsoft surface has a desktop browser.  The iPad doesn't. That's actually was the bottleneck for me being as productive  as I could be on an iPad pro. So now I can be more productive.  I got the desktop browser. So I guess I don't look at it as a tablet first,  even though it technically is a slate. And if you're going to just buy the slate,  then sure, obviously you are looking at it as a tablet,  but I never even thought about buying it without a keyboard. To me,  this was always,  this will be my Pixelbook laptop experience when I need it.  And then when I don't, I can just do what I want to do, you know? So just,  just an observation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And for Android developers is the Pixelbook slate in tablet form factor mode.  Is that a good way to test your apps on a tablet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you could, let's see, I mean, I have Android studios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a good definitive way to do that, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of the only way because you can't yet connect an Android phone  to over USB to any Chrome OS device through, through Christina on,  on Linux, because the USB support isn't there yet.  So you have to actually run your app locally.  So I would think it actually would be a good environment,  but the better environment would be actually using a phone or multiple phones to  test different form factors. I think I haven't installed that Android studio,  but I haven't, I don't create Android apps yet. So I couldn't say for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Cool. Well, let's take a break because we do have a sponsor to thank,  and then we'll get back. We'll talk about a whole bunch of other googly stuff.  We've got a lot in the doc today to get through.  But first this episode of this week in Google is brought to you by express VPN.

And we thank express VPN for their support of this week in Google.  All right. So we talked all about the pixel slate here.  Let's see. Oh, I wanted to ask you guys. So, uh, pixel three users,  are we all in that, in that camp at this point or no part,  part time, part time. Okay. You got the two, Jeff's got the two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I the first time I haven't seen a pixel envy. I'm stuck with the two. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm curious to know why, because I like now, you know,  kind of the dust has settled. I'm very familiar and very used to my pixel three.  I have to say it's been strangely buggy in,  in different places and I always kind of expect a little bit of bugginess here  and there, but like on and on, I get these weird like system hangups,  things just kind of stall out and then suddenly kick back in out of nowhere.  My assistant commands are rarely registering. Like I'll,  I'll say it through assistant and it will get it completely wrong.  I'm like dive into my contacts and like, what are you doing?  I said to navigate to like the store. Uh,  and then I have to go into maps to issue the command. I, and I know that they're,  they're issuing a December security patch that's fixing a number of issues,  but is that part of the reason why you don't have pixel envy this year,  Jeff? Like, are you hearing more and more of these reports of, of,  of oddness with the pixel three or is this something different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, just simply that I've been happy with pixel two and nothing makes me envious  of having the three yet. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not even night sight night sites on two now, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Night sites on two. Yeah. Yeah. They, they, I mean, it's, I don't know,  I have the smaller version. I think you have the XL, right, Jeff? Yeah.  Man, it's, it's still a great phone and I don't,  and it's expensive.  The pixel three is a lot of money for what didn't seem to be a lot of value.  If the charging stand thingy came with it, maybe I'd consider it.  That was the most interesting aspect of that release actually. Yeah. And I mean,  yeah, that's another, that is not a reason to buy a new phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's another 70 bucks even if you did want it.  Although I think they had a deal not too long ago where they were including it  for like a day or whatever, but they've had all sorts of weird deals like that.  But have you noticed any issues you say part time Kevin on the pixel three,  but I'm, I don't know. I like,  are you using it with enough regularity to notice issues?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Probably not. My main phone is an iPhone 10 R mainly because I can't live without  the Apple watch from my running and so on. And the whole family's on iPhone.  So, you know, I messages, Apple music, et cetera. So the iPhone's,  my main phone. But I,  no, this is one thing I've prided myself on for 15 years, Jeff.  I use anything and everything.  So I have a hopefully a broad understanding of what's happening overall in the  market. I hear you. I mean,  I would love to just pick one and be done with it. But you know,  I one time I was using Blackberry and Palm and you know, just like Jason,  I'm sure it was using a whole bunch of different operating systems on the  phones back in the day. Yeah.  But I haven't really seen too, too much, too many issues, but then again,  I might not be using it enough or, you know,  certain apps that I use are fine and other apps are having issues. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I find myself constantly talking myself out of it and being like, no,  it's not the phone. It's not the phone. It's something else.  But then it just keeps on happening. And I'm like, okay, well,  I don't even know how to reverse engineer this and figure out like what,  what it is because it's definitely happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They definitely had a Ram issue, which I think they have addressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And it sounds like this,  this December security patch includes some sort of a tweak around memory  management that was, and in this case it was,  it was preventing apps from running simultaneously.  So like if you're listening to music in the background,  then you switch over to the camera to take a picture,  you take the picture and it would stop the music in the background.  Just as one example. So I don't know if that's the same issue, you know,  tied into what I've been experiencing, but you know,  I'm trying not to jump to the conclusion of, of, oh, well,  the pixel three is buggy is all get out and it's different this time,  but I can't deny the fact that these issues keep happening for me and I keep  hearing other people complaining. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know, if you use something for like a month and it's happening,  I don't think you're jumping to a conclusion. Actually. Yeah. No,  that's not jumping to a conclusion. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but to be honest, I mean, even as an iPhone user,  I see with the new brand new iOS, big version updates or a new phone,  for example, you'll see some bugs in the first month.  They're usually minor, but they've had text messaging bugs,  all kinds of issues over there on the Apple side. And it takes, you know,  a 0.1 or 0.2 release to get everything working just right.  So I don't think it's exclusive to Google by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's see here.  Should we talk about Flutter?  I was just, I was hovering on Flutter. It's like,  you read my mind. Google officially launched Flutter 1.0.  It's first stable release.  It's an open source toolkit for a cross platform UI development.  It's Android and iOS. And in reading the,  this article from Ronam Audio on Ars Technica,  he kind of compares it to like game development for unity.  And that being kind of like a, you know,  translating into something that can be played on all game systems,  similar situation here, but I'm not a developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He also said in there, and I thought this might be worth,  I was curious about the reason I can guess,  but that it's moving from a Java based environment.  Flutter is based on Dart, which Google had been focusing on.  So in Android is based on Java.  So I didn't know if that was part of like the drama with  the lawsuits or if that was just like Dart is the future.  So I was kind of curious about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Google would like Dart and Kotlin to actually be the future.  Kotlin is, you can, it's like basically Java compatible and you can translate  between the two quite easily. It's actually easier to do certain things in Kotlin.  And perhaps that's what Android apps will be written in in the future.  I think Flutter, my guess is it has a home  on pretty much anything because it runs,  you can create the app once and run it pretty much on anything kind of,  in a kind of like Java.  And that makes me question what about progressive web apps?  Because that's been Google's big push for awhile. I don't,  I don't really know yet,  but the big thing with with Flutter that I can see is really from a developer  standpoint,  and I put a link in the show notes after Ron's article because there are a couple  of videos on medium,  which was written by one of the Google developers for Flutter.  And he shows that if you're using Android Studio  and you're booting up the emulator to, to write off, to run a Flutter app,  it took him two minutes and 40 seconds to do that.  One of the big things with Flutter is they can just run it natively right there  on the desktop. It takes 10 seconds.  So that's a huge time savings if you were a developer right off the bat.  It's very responsive, kind of like a progressive web app.  So I'd like to read more about it cause I'm just getting into Java myself and  now I'm like, well, maybe I need to be learning Flutter. I don't know yet. So,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you know, if you get used to developing these Flutter apps,  you might be already preparing yourself for the post Android apocalypse of Fuchsia,  which Fuchsia runs Flutter apps natively.  And a lot of people keep pointing to Fuchsia to be the, the,  the long game for where Google goes next, you know, moving,  transitioning from Android to something else. But it's all,  it's all conjecture at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah. Go Kevin. Go Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I was, go Kevin. I wonder if this plays into,  and I don't think we have this on the show notes, but it's actually,  I'm glad we went this way.  Microsoft is getting rid of Edge apparently reportedly to go to a Chromium  based browser.  And that's probably going to shift their approach of applications to  progressive web apps.  Could it mean that they use Flutter too? I don't know.  They don't need to, if they're going to go with progressive web apps.  But I just wonder what's going on with Microsoft and how it relates here  because they're kind of throwing the towel in on Edge and going with the  Chromium, the open source Chromium browser reportedly that Google uses.  So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah, it seems like a very big, sudden kind of shift away.  Not super familiar with Microsoft at this point, but that really took me by  surprise. I think they do an operating system that I've, yeah,  I think I've maybe seen once in my life, but that seems like a really big,  really big admission to some degree that they would take their web browser and  shift it so drastically like that. Who knows where that leads.  Let's see here. Should we talk a little bit about search?  You guys want to talk about search?  Got a number of kind of juicy nuggets here. Privacy search engine DuckDuckGo  conducted a study that's, well, yeah, obviously they're our competitor.  So take it with a grain of salt,  but seems to show that Google search personalizes results even when a user is  logged out of their Google account and when that user is using incognito mode.  They did this in June of this year. They were,  they use search terms that were highly,  highly specific and divisive things like gun control, immigration,  vaccinations. In all cases,  they did the first search with all people while they were logged out or in  incognito mode on a machine.  And then they logged in immediately after and did the same search to kind of  compare the results between the two.  And most users saw the same results as they saw while logged out.  And the report seems to indicate a heavy amount of personalization going on even  when they're logged out,  even when they're in some sort of privacy mode with no clear indication as,  as far as why or what it's actually based on. Google,  of course calls the methodology of the report flawed.  Danny Sullivan, a friend of the show,  also Google's public liaison for search said on Twitter had a whole,  whole kind of tweet storm on this, but basically said over the years,  the methods to develop the Google search personalizes so much that for the same  query,  different people might get significantly different results from each other.  This isn't the case results can differ,  but usually for non personalized reasons. So  what y'all think? Do you,  does DuckDuckGo make a compelling case here and should it matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it does matter because the idea of doing incognito means that you're not  sharing information with Google, right? Right. So that definitely matters.  It is hard to say.  I think this is one of those gray areas where as we get more abstract,  it's really hard to understand what's going on behind the scenes and Google may  be right and DuckDuckGo may be right.  What I mean here is there could be technicalities that are making things more  personalized that Google will argue is not, you know,  personalized, but is really, you know,  based on like maybe it's your IP addresses location or something like that.  So I think it's going to be hard to say,  it's going to be hard to parse if that makes sense.  And that's a shame because it is, I don't know. I mean,  I don't use incognito mode except when I'm trying to like test out random Google  features. But you know, if you're hardcore, believing in incognito mode,  this would be really kind of devastating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I use incognito to test ads on my website because yeah,  because you know, I want to see what a random person might see.  So theoretically it should be totally random ads, but honestly,  every once in a while, maybe even a little more than that,  I see ads for things that I know I've searched for very recently outside of  incognito mode. So I don't know. I'm not,  I'm not saying it's an issue one way or the other. Um,  but I think,  I think Danny did a great job trying to explain it. And I,  I'd like to test a little bit more personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think it's hard to say, I mean, there's,  there's so many elements now you've got your device itself,  you've got your version of, you know, whatever browser you're using,  you've got your location, you've got your ISP,  all of that can factor into it without being super personalized, right?  And then the flip side is I used to use DuckDuckGo and I found it frustrating  because Google's results were typically more relevant for me because they were  personalized. So  I think a greater transparency here in how this works and what people,  what Google uses might be interesting, you know,  or rather really relevant to people who care about this sort of thing. But,  you know, I don't see that happening anytime soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dragonfly, the, uh, if you said China search engine,  here we go.  Code name for Google's plan censored search engine in China was kept secret both  internally and externally by those close to the project.  There's a new report on the intercept, uh, that has Jonathan Zunger.  I don't, I don't believe he's been a guest on, but I follow him on Twitter.  He should be an amazing guest. Uh, 14 year veteran of Google on the record,  along with others who still work on the project, who chose to be anonymous,  of course, uh,  talking about the lengths that they went to in order to keep all of it below the  radar. You know, they, at one point they raised concerns about,  about Chinese citizens being detained for searches that were conducted,  but head of operations, Scott Beaumont wasn't convinced.  And that led to executives shutting out Google's own security and privacy teams  from the meetings. Also sidelining, um, privacy review,  which was led by Jonathan at the time. This was prior to him leaving Google,  which he says he would have let, he left for another reason.  But if he had stayed on, uh,  he would have left because of this cause he was so divided against everybody  else on this, uh, that would have analyzed human rights abuses. So, uh,  making, making a lot of these decisions internally to say, eh, let's,  let's sidestep these,  these people because we don't want to focus too hard on these things.  Let's continue forward with this search engine in China.  What'd you guys think? Leave this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I've defended Google Lord knows I've defended space as a Facebook,  Facebook's making it hard to defend them sometimes these days. Uh,  and full disclosure is I received money for my school from Facebook,  but I'm independent of them.  I've received nothing from Google personally or from any of the platforms,  but this one, this one, I, I applauded Google when they pulled out of China.  I applauded that they stood on principle and I do not see what has changed.  It would make them go back.  And so I'm very disappointed that Google considering this and considering it  against, um, I don't know what the numbers are.  Maybe it's a very small number of their employees cause they're so huge,  but it is a fervent belief of some of their employees that they're going the  wrong way. And I think you got to listen to that. Yeah. Um,  now the same guy I was talking,  I heard somebody talk from the intelligence community the other day saying that,  um, Google's relationship with government overall is bad right now because of  the pullback on drones and other military related things.  And the intelligence people say Google would be helping save the lives of  service people if they were involved in these projects.  I get that. I can go both ways on that. That's a U S consideration. Um,  but I certainly understand the conscience of the Google employees who object to  those projects. Um, that's U S base in terms of,  of working with a Chinese government,  it's real hard for me to justify that in any way.  I'm disappointed in Google on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was ready to argue with Jeff because I think it's a moral and awful and  a real big issue, but, um, I can't cause Jeff,  Jeff actually felt like, Oh man, now what do I do?  I could argue, I could,  I guess I could play devil's advocate and argue that, you know,  China is a big economic opportunity.  It would be stupid of Google to pass this up. I,  as a person though, don't believe that to be true.  So I will just make that as an intellectual toss that out there.  And that's a, that's all I can do here. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you were a shareholder, how would you feel about this? I,  even as a shareholder, I mean, think about like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if I were a shareholder back in the eighties for a company that supported  apartheid, I would be like, no, no, we should not be doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I am a shareholder. And from that position,  I think that all of the platforms now are going to have to act ethically and  morally. And when they do not,  it is in the long run going to bite them in the rear end witness what's happening  to Facebook right now. If you don't start with a high moral plane as an  objective, when you have this control over the world,  when you have this much power, then I think it's going to hurt you as a company.  I think the same is true of Amazon and Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although when we start talking about moral arguments,  it does get dicey because different people,  different organizations are going to have different moral. I mean, I may,  I can argue that, Hey,  participating with the Chinese government and possibly aiding and abetting their  censorship and even murder, political murder of their citizens.  I don't agree with that. But other people might be like, well, you know,  Google's still flying their employees to conferences and that's contributing to  climate change. And I don't agree with that. So I'm,  I'm purposely picking very far apart issues. But as we,  as a country,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  don't I prove that every day? So you're right,  Stacy, but, um,  to select a moral standard and stand by it.  And so Google stood, chose a moral position years ago about China.  And I haven't seen the reason that changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's fair. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Except for what you said, uh, playing the devil's advocate just moments ago,  Stacy, which is that there's a big opportunity there.  Of course we're going to explore it.  And that's dang it. The devil's advocate wins.  Yes. I know the gin is slowly, but surely seeping in there. Um,  and you know, apparently according to this report,  there were only a few hundred people that knew about it.  Their jobs ran the risk of termination if they discussed it with anybody,  which I feel like that, that makes sense, right? Like, yeah, pretty standard.  I think that happens.  And communication would happen verbally.  So they would almost insist on everything being verbally minimizing a paper  trail. I mean,  they obviously knew how divisive of an issue this would be. They said,  the report says their biggest fear was that internal opposition would slow our  operations. And then, um, and then of course,  now there's a looming strike, uh, that's kind of on the forefront. Uh, you know,  a number of employees are, I think employees at Google and other large  corporations like this are starting to realize that when they don't agree,  this is actually a really effective way to do things is to shut down business  and strike. And, uh, so they're flexing that muscle more and more. And that's,  that's a good thing. Hopefully that applies to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Anytime you have to do something in utter secret from, you know,  like your family or your close friends, like you're like, Hmm,  nobody I know in love or none of my employees would agree for this.  So we're going to have to keep it super secret. Right.  You're probably doing something. That's probably, yeah. That,  that checks that box. That's a sign. Maybe we don't. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except that so much of what they do is secret for other reasons.  There's a secrecy reflex that's all too well, uh, exercise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a high, I mean, doing only verbal communication. That's, I mean,  Kevin, you've been inside Google. That seems that's that I would,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would not say that's very standard practice there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not the SOP. Oh, speaking of the Google employees,  what about their latest, uh, memo on contract workers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this, um, I feel like I was out of the loop when this broke,  probably shortly before the show. Right. So I didn't get a chance to, uh,  to read through this. So if one of you knows more of the details on this,  feel free, go for it.  Cause I didn't get a chance to read this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before reading it. Hold on. Let me make sure it's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the Bloomberg article, right? Googlers, right? Right.  The CEO demanding equal treatment for contractors. Uh, that's about all I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, so they actually,  they had put that into their original kind of sexual harassment,  uh, their, their letter and demands over sexual harassment.  And that was ignored. So, uh, today they sent full time and contract workers,  sent a letter to Sundar Pichai asking for them  to, uh, improve the conditions for their contract workers.  And I'm like, what are those improvements? Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought I saw something about, um,  communications when there was a major issue, like, uh,  I forget what issue they had. Maybe they had to evacuate the building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. They said when a shooting, when the shooting happened at YouTube's campus,  the contractors didn't get the same communications,  because they were on a different system. Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's just like, uh, apps for, uh,  G suite versus, uh, Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. Everybody on G suite run outside. Um,  okay. So I can, I can,  I can kind of speak to that because I actually was a contract worker there.  I was not a full-time employee. I was a TVC as they call it. Um,  and some communications were filtered through a TVC manager,  which would be somewhere else, maybe across the country, wherever.  So yes, I could see that being an issue.  I would say in my experience, had I ever been in that situation,  I was surrounded by full-time Googlers who did have the communications and they  certainly wouldn't say, Hey, we're all going to lunch outside. You stay here.  I mean, they would have said, we got to get out of here. Um,  should that be the standard base level of communication? No,  but I, it never affected me in a year and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sounds almost accidental. Well, what is TBC taking care of?  What does, does TBC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, uh, Tim Spender's contractors.  TBC. T is in Victor.  TBC. Right. Right. Tim Spender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Later on they get to these complaints in here and these sound very,  I can see this happening, but I can also see this not being the standard,  but being excellent to put in a news article because it's, it's wonderful. Um,  one contractor described a full-time staffer asking her to move from an office  desk or cutting ahead of her in line for coffee because she was a contractor  and therefore not as important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a typical, I think that is very,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that feels like a jerk thing to do, but there are, I mean,  I think there's some real issues here. I think there's sure being on communications  is easy to be like, Hey, please tell us things that concern our safety.  That's fixable. I think the bigger issue is people are often contracting for  positions that used to be full time to avoid paying for things like healthcare  and to avoid, uh,  certain legal requirements that come with having a full-time worker.  And I think if you are a huge company with, I think they,  did they say it was like 60,000 contractors?  I may be making that number up. Let's, let's wait before I say that,  but with lots of contractors, uh,  they don't actually give a number in this one. Um,  if you have that many contractors and they're doing those kinds of jobs,  maybe they should be full time.  I understand the financial reasons why you wouldn't do that because paying for  health insurance kind of sucks, but  if someone's actually a full-time employee and everything, but name only,  then they should be an employee.  This is, this is the issue for our time.  This is the big labor issue for the current generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems that way.  Let's take a break and then we will come back and we'll talk about more.  Maybe we will go off the Google trail a little bit and talk about the big  Facebook news that was,  that's been breaking this afternoon with the UK parliament releasing redacted  copies of some pretty sensitive Facebook documents.  Maybe we'll talk about that. Maybe we won't,  but we'll find out here in a few minutes. I'll, I'll let that stew,  stew with you guys. You can let me know if you want to go there.  This week in Google is brought to you by rocket mortgage, by quick loans.  If you're looking to buy a home,  you're probably paying attention to the interest rates and realizing, Hey,  they are rising slowly, but surely they are rising.  That can cause a little bit of anxiety because you don't know if now is the  time or if you wait, it's going to rise too high or when are those changes  happening? It's just everything's super unpredictable.  And so it makes a stressful situation even more stressful. Well,  our friends at quick loans are doing something about that.  They're calling it the power buying process and it's super simple.  First step, you answer a few simple questions.  They're going to check your credit and out of that you'll get pre-qualified  approval. So it would be pre-qualified to kind of start looking for your home.  Step two, quick loans will verify your income, your assets and your credit.  Doesn't take long. It only takes less than around 24 hours.  And that's going to give you a verified approval.  When you have that verified approval, that gives you the strength of a cash  buyer. So you can really start looking. And step three,  once you're verified,  you then qualify for their all new exclusive rate shield approval,  which basically means they're going to lock up your rate at that particular  point, whatever it happens to be for up to 90 days while you shop.  So it's not going anywhere. And the best part is if the Fed raises the rates,  if those rates go up, your rate is going to stay locked in for up to 90 days.  If the rates happen to drop, if they go down,  your rate goes down with it. So either way you win,  just it's the awesome thinking that you'd expect from America's largest mortgage  lender. So to get started and to learn more about all this,  go to rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  Rate shield approval is only valid on certain 30 year purchase transactions.  Additional conditions or exclusions may apply based on quick loans data in  comparison to public data records.  Equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states,  NMLS consumer access.org number 30 30 that's rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  And we thank rocket mortgage by quick loans for their support of this week in  Google.  Want to talk about Facebook or should we stay at stay with Google?  What do you guys think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like Google more than Facebook, but if we want to talk about Facebook,  I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just thought it was, it was big breaking news.  It's like taking over tech meme right now. We don't have to, we can talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean to me it's like, Oh,  Hey Facebook is kind of evil and uses data in ways that they've told you they  don't use your data. And Oh my gosh, news at 10.  Here's another example of Facebook being evil basically.  Yeah. So yeah, it's bad. I,  again, this is why I'm like, eh, no Facebook. But,  but if there's like deeper depth here, if someone wants to defend Facebook,  I'm looking at you, Jeff. You go right ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't understand. I haven't read enough. I don't understand it.  I mean every media company there is,  and I'm not calling the platform as a media company,  but you're in the media business, everyone in the media business,  both that way uses whatever data they have to  increase the value of what they offered advertisers full stop. Right.  The difference is Facebook has more support.  I haven't understood in this story is cause I have not read enough of it because  I was out today.  Um, is what makes this different from what,  um,  time,  Inc would have done with data they had about users, uh, at a specific time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Inc is very disorganized with their data compared to Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  True. It'll be alive as time.  Inc. Um, but, but you know, they, they would, they would, uh, uh,  use whatever data they had, even back in the print days, in essence, even,  even to mailing addresses, uh, with advertisers. So I'm not sure what's,  um, shady about this. That's not, that's not a defense. That's an,  I don't get the story yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So part of it is Facebook is looking at, uh,  so there's the data sharing, but there's also that Facebook's would, um,  it would track popularity of certain apps through their platform and monitor  their success and then use that to compete against them.  That's actually the same thing that Amazon does when it comes to launching new  features for like AWS. So that is not inherently evil.  That's just how platforms participate.  Um, so  they also talk about how Facebook gives some companies access to data,  but not other apps access to user data. So the quote,  the quote that the, the UK government government said is the files show  evidence of Facebook taking aggressive positions against apps with the  consequence that denying them access to data led to the failure of their  businesses. And then if you look at it that way,  that's kind of part of the, you know, you're on a platform.  It's not a neutral place. You live and die by the platform, you know? So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right. Large advertisers get volume discounts that others don't get. Um,  large suppliers to Walmart get benefits that others don't get. Again,  I'm not defending because they don't know enough.  Somebody can come in and tell us what, what makes this in any context bad,  but on its face, I don't see something new there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So someone pointed out, oh, that it violated an FTC agreement,  um, that Facebook had signed. And if that case, that's just illegal,  but this is a long series of tweets and I'm not reading all of them at the  moment. So I'm not a hundred percent sure how that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why you didn't want to talk about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why I'm like, Oh, well, I'm just like, Oh,  do I really want to know how many, how deeply Facebook is screwing people over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't, I don't know that there's anything really different,  Jeff, going along what you said different say than what time used to do, et  cetera. Um, I think that the issue is,  it's just a constant theme with Facebook.  It's just over and over and over again,  they kind of get caught doing things that a we question,  should they be doing at all? And B we wouldn't know unless they got caught.  That's right. Right. It's, I think it's the sneakiness in a sense.  And I don't know if that's the best word.  This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry.  Here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interpreted with the sneaky classes now.  No, this is actually sneaky.  Okay. Because that's my problem. Sometimes I can't tell what's sneaky.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here we go. I'm dropping this in here for you.  Oh, I see. Yes. Something new.  Here's a Twitter,  a Twitter thing that breaks down the level of sneakiness from the actual  documents, which is always nice to see the actual documents. So if you,  it's talking about with the Android phones, Oh, hey, look, a tie into Google.  And it, it seems to show that they said, Hey, by the way,  we need to let people positively opt into this data. There it is right there.  So if you click on those documents there,  they basically right here, they're like, Hey, we need to do opt in.  And then the next one is like, Hey, nevermind.  We're only going to request this without, you know, the personal opt-in.  So that, that actually does look a little shifty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right. They said, they actually said in these emails and,  and also like along,  along with this UK lawmakers actually publish these, these emails,  that I guess they got ahold of last week related to something else.  And so I thought that was just kind of weird, like, Hey, we got this stuff.  We want everybody to see it. Here you go. And then Facebook's, you know,  doing damage control. But within these emails, like Facebook's,  changed the Android app policy that resulted in what we're,  what you were just talking about,  the call and message data being recorded that we heard about a month ago.  It was deliberately hidden from users.  Facebook knew that it would be risky, but then they decide in those emails,  yeah, but let's just do it anyways. You know, things like that.  And kind of tying with what you said, Kevin,  it's like this constant pattern of no, we didn't do that. You know,  something is published that shows that they did it. Yeah, we did that,  but it's not as bad as you think they're getting it wrong. You know what I'm  saying? I don't know. It's, it's, it feels very familiar at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't say it's not as bad as you think. They just say, Oh yeah,  sorry about that.  Zuck gets up and writes this heartfelt long blog post about how,  you know, privacy is overrated, but he understands we're different.  We're moving along in this continuum. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this isn't the full story. You're not getting the full story.  And I think that's,  I've been struggling for months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a piece that I've been supposed to write for somebody else for a long,  long time.  And I have horrible writers block on it is,  is to look at the moral basis of behavior of the platforms.  And it's hard to know where to start, which sounds like a straight line.  I don't mean it that way,  but it's hard to know where you set the bar versus other companies.  Siva Varianathan argued when I wrote what would Google do that I  was seeing the company wrong because it can't be any better than any company  out there. It's going to operate like any company out there.  You're wrong to expect anything positive basically.  And I still disagree with Siva on that, but I, but I get it.  I especially get it in the current context and the discussion we've just had  the last half hour. And so,  but these companies are extremely powerful and they're going to be watched over  and they've got to operate on a moral plane. And what is that plane?  And I'm having trouble trying to figure out how to express that.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't be evil. I'm sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds pretty familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's very much present.  I mean, in the context of being a human being, I mean,  if I think about me as a teenager versus me today, you know,  I have done some pretty crappy things, even knowing they were kind of crappy.  And now that I'm older, I'm like, Oh, those are really crappy. Wow. So  as a company,  you have a bunch of individuals making these decisions and they're influenced by  the people at the top. And currently at different companies,  I think you start with the goals of people at the top and their  founding kind of creators and cultural ethos.  And I think Facebook started out in the kind of,  with a lot, maybe fewer assets at the top, right?  In terms of like having a good moral compass and it just  spiraled from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The entire ethos of the company followed down that road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. See what you mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How about we shift towards where we hope to,  where we aspire to be someday. And that's the highest paid YouTubers  in the world. Apparently number one, according to Forbes.  So Forbes every year publishes a list of the highest paid YouTube stars.  2018 list is upon us at the very top is Ryan ToysReview.  A seven year old that has 17 million followers has a toy line at  Walmart, apparently, and made $22 million.  $22 million.  I haven't heard of any of these people.  I almost wrote that in my notes.  Let's talk about a bunch of people we've never heard of,  but their household names to a whole lot of people.  Number two, Jake Paul, of course, Logan's younger brother, rapper,  prankster. I didn't know he was a rapper. I knew he was a prankster.  $21.5 million. Dude Perfect in third place.  $20 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Their videos are great.  Trick shot. It's the only one I know on this list, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do a bunch of trick shot stuff.  So you can kind of see it up there at the top.  PewDiePie of course, still on the list though. I believe at some point,  maybe it was last year, PewDiePie dominated this list, right?  Or it was near the top. Now number nine,  only a paltry $15.5 million last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know that his income has gone down so much. Those others have gone up.  Yeah, right. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just goes to show the crazy network effect of YouTube. Isn't that unbelievable?  And then number 10, Logan Paul, who we've heard a lot of,  unfortunately this last year. I know too much about Logan Paul.  I've never seen a single video. $14.5 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's crazy. This whole thing is crazy. I'm just looking at this and,  well,  I'm wondering where all the ASMR videos that my daughter apparently still  listens to and all of the, this is a YouTube trend.  It's lo-fi music. Is that what it's called? Lo-fi? Help me out here,  chat room or people who might be not 40 years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's lo-fi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lo-fi music. It's like, if you, if you Google it, you will find the YouTube stuff.  It's basically like chill study music.  Oh, okay.  But if you play it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think like eight bit music or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but it's, it's everywhere.  And like my child listens to it and vice did a story about it in  July about how lo-fi hip hop radio became a YouTube phenomenon.  And it's true. It's weird.  I should, I should convince my daughter to come on here and talk briefly about  YouTube. She's way ahead of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. No kidding. Yeah. Because I guess music like this is easy to work on and  not get too distracted by the words. And yeah, I can see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She works and has a YouTube video in the background.  That's just providing the music, which I'm like, as a,  as a person who grew up on dial-up, I'm like,  that is hogging a lot of bandwidth right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you know long distance cost of fortune, young lady?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't you just download your chill hop?  Like I would have done when I was a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I thought I'd see like some popular lo-fi or ASMR stuff on this list,  but I did not. It was mostly just guys who break.  No, that's the next like that's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's the trend that's threatening to take over. Sure.  A couple of years from now it's going to be dominated with the ASMR.  I don't actually know that.  And if I did I'd be doing that because that's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was about to say, it's really easy to make this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just got to get the right microphone and do that in the mic, in the,  in the mic a lot. YouTube hit 5 billion installs.  I feel like that's not really that surprising.  Google core apps always hit crazy numbers and downloads on the play store.  So I'm surprised YouTube didn't hit it sooner to be honest.  Um, there's gotta be something more meaty to bite our teeth into.  What am I missing here? Um, da da da da da.  We've already talked hangouts. Oh,  Sundar Pichai going to testify before the house committee.  It was supposed to happen today actually. Right. Uh,  it was supposed to happen today. Of course, uh, the funeral, um,  the ceremony for George HW Bush, uh, was today. So it got postponed.  So Sundar Pichai heading to, uh,  the house judiciary committee on December 11th, 10 AM Eastern.  And I'm sure he's going to talk a lot about what we were just talking about  earlier with dragon fly potentially, uh,  also conservative bias and search results,  power of Google algorithms and data privacy and a competitive behavior.  It's going to be a fun time. Uh, I don't know.  I'm sure there'll be some news from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought what, since, since that hasn't happened yet,  I thought this story was actually kind of cool,  which was the Google and Amazon to offer air pod alternatives and talking about  how Apple is likely to add health sensors to their stuff. Um,  I, I,  the reason I just thought that was neat is because I've talked to a scientist  who studies hearing and all the stuff you can do with your ears.  And you can actually get super granular, granular heartbeat, um,  oxygen and even data that can be interpreted to give like a sense of focus,  like how, how focused you are at this moment in time.  So if you want to sneak peek of like, if Apple's adding health sensors,  those might be some of the features that you would see,  like much better quality on something like that,  which means you wouldn't just have to have an Apple watch for health monitoring.  You could just have AirPods, which opens that up to a lot more people.  I was excited by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is interesting.  I'm kind of stuck on, on the implementation of that,  because I do wear an Apple watch every day and I run with the watch and the  AirPods and I track everything with the Apple watch and I get my music from the  AirPods and okay,  so now we're going to have wireless things that track my health data from my  ears, which is great, but how do I get my music?  I still need a wearable device with music on it.  So I'm kind of sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well that's, that's when you've got your watch on you and you're running,  but the rest of us who don't run people like me for happy, perhaps,  I'm just going to carry my phone and have that and I could get my health,  like health data from that. So I don't need the watch.  Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin's thinking the time he's least likely to wear the watch is when he  sweats on it, but if he'll go ahead and wear it all the rest of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I pretty much wear it all the time. It's ridiculous. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can call Kevin on his watch like anywhere. It's a little disconcerting.  I'm like, please, please don't pick up the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm outside from the house.  This is not a bathroom thing. This is just simply like,  yeah. I mean, I guess it's, I mean,  nobody's saying that the ear pods or your phones or earbuds are the next  smartwatch because of tracking. I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think if you want to get data on like focus or if you want to get  data on like your, you know,  I don't think it's like a continuous heart rate monitor kind of thing,  because you're probably not listening to them all the time.  But I think to get like a picture of like health and I,  and I don't know what data Apple actually needs for their like arrhythmia.  I don't know, Jeff, if you know this for like tracking that sort of stuff,  but if you have your headphones in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why the watch is actually suspect for,  I was talking to a doctor about this for the, for the arrhythmia.  That's why the cardiac is better because you, you, you hold down both hands.  So you get a complete circuit. Interesting. But the,  but the ear is you could get a complete circuit across two devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to, we're all like, maybe, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Listen to the heartbeat. Cause don't we all, you know, when we go to sleep,  we hear our heartbeat, right? Cause it's coursing through our ears.  I wonder with highly sensitive mics, we have speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they don't use microphones. It's a separate sensor that they, they do.  It's a, it's the type of, um,  what do they call it with the green light like on your fitness thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I see. Oximeter pulse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pulse oximeter.  They actually use those kinds of sensors. I did a,  there's a woman I did a podcast with her name is Poppy crumb and she works at  Bose.  And we had this fascinating discussion of like all the things you can sense in  your ear better than you could sense it. Like on your wrist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was, you know, we can go to the moon, we can create a self-driving car.  Can they finally just create earbuds that will stay in my frigging ears?  I have some duct tape.  They don't, they don't stay in. They just fall out. I got weird ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Jabra elite 65 teas are my favorites.  They totally stay in my ears. They're great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they hurt though? Mine hurt after. So after, like if I'm on a plane,  three hours, I have to take them out in my ear, like the,  whatever that little whirl is around the edge of your ear hole. That hurts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I know what you're talking about. Cause I've had it with other headphones.  I don't get it with these,  but I have seen complaints about from other people on the same, same thing.  And also the Bragi dash pro ear earphones,  they have a heart rate monitor embedded in them too.  So some of these actually do take your heart rate through your ear already.  So,  because Apple doesn't invent new things, just make old things better.  Yeah, exactly. They take a formula and they, they make it better, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they stay in just cause they have a little rubber tippy things that stick in  or they are,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they are definitely the kind that that kind of smush in there a little bit,  but they don't smush in so far that like, um, what is the name?  I can't remember the other earphones that I, that I used to use all the time.  When you put those in, they would secure into place,  but it's almost like they'd go so far that it would like suction your ear and  things would get louder. And I hate that. Like I dealt with it with those.  And then I tried the, the Jabra elites and I was like, wait a minute,  these stay in my ear and they don't do that anymore. And for me,  they're very comfortable and I love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You kind of jam, you put them in like at an angle and then you twist them  in.  Yep. Kind of lock it in place.  And it feels like putting in like a smoke detector or any one of those devices  where you're like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the perfect, yeah, that's the perfect comparison, strangely enough. Yes.  So those are good.  I'm actually really surprised that Google hasn't come out with their own  air pod alike because they have the pixel buds.  Remember with those buds and those are terrible.  Yeah. They have the pixel buds and those have the cable between the two.  So they're definitely there. Their minds are there. Um, I guess we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I would like Google probably, they probably shouldn't,  let them figure out messaging and then they can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  First then we'll save lives.  Take care of the things you know you need to take care of. Uh, Waymo one,  is launching today. Phoenix Metro area is there.  Obviously it's the commercial taxi service by Waymo.  They had promised to start the commercial service by the end of the year.  They got there. Uh, although apparently there's going to be, um,  it's only going to be offered to early writers who were already testing this,  uh, prior, prior to this, those early writers were subject to an NDA.  So we'll probably start hearing more now that it's officially out there for these  writers, uh, about the experience and what it's all like.  There will be someone sitting in the safety driver sitting in the cab, uh,  to be able to take over.  And I guess prices similar to what you get from Uber and Lyft.  So Waymo one coming to a Phoenix near you.  That's a hilarious name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those are, I had seen some of those when I was out in Scottsdale,  not last year, about a year ago now. Um, those surprised me.  They don't just have the lidar on top.  They have it on both sides and the front and the back. I think, I mean,  those are not cheap sensors and they've got at least four, if not five on every  one of these Pacifica mini fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They got Google money. Yeah. They got alphabet money. Uh,  five G is apparently on the horizon. I don't know if you knew,  but the, uh, the Qualcomm event,  it was Qualcomm snapdragon technology summit happened or is happening right now  in Hawaii,  but there was a big kind of announcement yesterday where they unveiled the new  Qualcomm snapdragon eight 55 processor.  So this is going to be the processor that all of your, you know,  top of the line Android devices over the course of the next year will be stocked  with. Uh, so expect to see this on all of the, you know,  including probably next year's pixel devices and everything.  This is going to be the chip set for the next year that you're going to want in  your phone if you're, if you're buying premium.  And it has features like a multi-core AI engine.  They say three times the improved AI performance specialization around enhanced  computational photography, obviously photography on high end cameras,  especially in smart phones is a really big deal.  And there's so much of that computational stuff happening nowadays. So there's,  there's going to be part of the Silicon, uh, devoted to that, um,  optimized for gaming also news about 3d sonic sensors for  in display ultrasonic finger, uh, print sensors that'll work even through like  dirty displays and stuff like that. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which is cool. Yeah. Cause I'm a, I'm a,  and ultrasonic sensors are actually relatively cheap.  They're used in all kinds of places.  Like I had once researched ultrasonic sensors and they're used all over the  place and they're pretty cheap and kind of a good use case. Um,  the challenge I think will be,  I'm curious how it will work with dirty hands because what it's doing is  measuring the distance in your fingerprint morals. So I'm like, Oh, if that's,  if that changes because your hands are a little dirty, what does that do?  That would be the test I would be performing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Get your hands super dirty, put your hands in a, in a, in a mud puddle,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just a little grit,  run a little grid across your finger pad and see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But, uh, yeah. So that's, uh,  we can expect more devices having those kinds of features next year,  including apparently, uh, a Samsung device of some sort.  Samsung and Verizon announced plans to release one of the first, uh,  5g phones in the first half of 2019.  They're all kind of getting on the record at this point saying, Oh,  we've got one too. We've got one too. We're not going to miss the 5g, uh, train.  Uh, they showed off a concept of the device, I believe at the,  at the tech summit. Um, or at least they plan to,  I'm not sure if the device that I saw during yesterday's, you know,  was the Samsung device specifically, but, uh, and,  and apparently this phone that's going to be released is not necessarily going to  be the galaxy s 10.  So if you're assuming that the s 10 is going to have 5g capability,  that might be off the mark. Um, yeah.  So there we go. I don't know what else to add on that one. Uh,  any, I don't know. Anybody excited about 5g?  I feel like there's a lot of,  they're trying to drum up a lot of excitement around 5g.  I don't know where it's leading for anyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Too early to be excited. I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think on a handset you're going to care.  I think there's some interesting use cases that we're not talking about.  So I think like for, for mobile broadband, you're basically,  it's more capacity. So yay. And lower latency. That's not,  we shouldn't scoff at that,  but I'm not sure we have the apps yet for that that are going to be on your  handset.  What's cool is if you guys really want this,  do you want me to keep going or not? Should I go? Yeah, do it. Okay.  I was like, I always feel weird nerding out about things. So I'm like,  okay. So on the fixed side, we're going to see it. You'll,  you'll be able like Verizon's doing this. Actually,  you're going to see more broadband services to places that are faster  based on this. So that's exciting.  It'll be 5g and it'll be over some of the new millimeter wave spectrum that the  FCC is auctioning off,  but it's also AT&T has talked about plans to use spectrum that's currently using  for like 3g. So you're going to see not,  you're going to see 5g over not 5g spectrum is the best way to think about that.  And then the other thing is you're going to have network slicing.  So you're going to be able to dedicate certain chunks of network capacity for  like autonomous cars or for medical devices.  And you're going to be able to do that a lot more easily and flexibly than you  have in the past. So if you think about it, a carrier,  like if you have a fleet of autonomous trucks coming across the border or  something and dropping on your network, you can automatically say, Oh crap,  those guys totally can't lose their connection.  Let's give them this slice and you can do it almost in real time.  And that's going to be really interesting.  And I don't know what that's going to do for carriers business models.  So that's one of the big questions I'm asking. I'll let you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why I want it. Hotel wifi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No one wants, no one wants good hotel wifi. You're out of touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm just kidding. I want to get rid of hot hotel wifi like right now.  Yeah. I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well then we will, uh, the remains to be seen at 5g. Oh wait,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  did we have to do the Chrome log change? Oh, we forgot that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's do that real quick. Thank you for the reminder.  It's time for the Google change log.  Dang. I almost forgot. Thanks for keeping me on task.  Let's see here. Google plays best of 2018 list has been unveiled.  If you were wondering what the fan favorites for game app movie,  a whole bunch of other things, or you can head over that, uh,  and head over to the list and check it out.  But in case you were wondering the fan favorite game, pub G mobile, uh,  fan favorite app, YouTube TV.  I feel like there's some shenanigans going on there. Maybe it's the Google S  YouTube TV. I don't know. YouTube TV is pretty cool. I'll be honest. Uh,  favorite movie, Avengers Avengers infinity war, uh,  best app of 2018 drops, learn 31 new languages.  I've never heard of that app until just now,  but apparently it's a really great app, uh, and a whole lot more.  So you can check that out and find some new apps to install or new movies to  watch. Uh, Google virtualized a museum in the, uh,  Google arts and culture app.  And apparently it allows you to get up and close up close and personal with  Johannes Vermeer's works of art. All of, of, uh, Vermeer's works of art.  Uh, you may remember the best known piece,  which is girl with a pearl earring. This is an AR kind of museum.  So everything is scaled appropriately according to all the other art and you can  kind of explore it, uh, through the magic of AR. And apparently it's really cool.  I've not checked it out yet on my own, but I have heard that it is neato.  Uh, let's see here.  Google worked with adaptive design association to host a 48 hour hackathon for  prototyping games that focus on Morse code.  And this was a way to reach kids with physical disabilities,  all about teaching Morse code to them. So games were designed, uh,  that utilize the G board Morse keyboard.  So games like an H synth that played musical notes with the Morse keyboard and a  game called Morse striker, which is a soccer spy game, uh,  and a whole bunch of others. Google, of course,  posted the games on its experiments with Google site and there are open source  examples of the code as well. It's all about improving, um,  improving, improving the capabilities through Morse code for physical  disabilities. A new Google home mini, a new color anyway,  it's not a new model, but a new color and it very, very Tiffany's inspired.  It's, uh, what is this? Aqua? I think that that would be the Aqua Google home  mini. It's very colorful. That is Aqua. If that's your jam,  then go ahead and put that in your living room or I don't know where that goes,  but there's beachy very wet beachy,  that, and I think there's also the coral color. So you can,  they're going for some really nice, uh, color options,  sharp color options, new features coming to a smart displays,  Lenovo smart display, really any smart display that's running Google assistant  software. Uh, my cookbook feature, touch alarms and quick settings,  nest. Hello to a talk.  You can remove favorite and share photos through the interface and a whole lot  more. So if you have one of those, which I do not, I can't,  I couldn't get over the fact that you can't disable YouTube on them.  And it's just, that's a deal breaker for me. Unfortunately,  hopefully one of these days they'll, they'll roll that update out. Uh,  Google uploaded an app called pixel sounds to the place store.  I don't know if it's up again. They had put it there and then it was removed.  And anyone that downloaded it really didn't get much functionality out of it.  So it seemed like one of those server side kind of activation things,  but apparently it's going to be an app where you can manage your alarms,  your ringtones, your notifications. And it will,  it will kind of integrate itself with the sounds menu settings, uh,  on the pixel phone, uh, with new options and features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God. So I have to have an app to manage my sounds. That's terrible.  Yeah, I know. I'm old and cranky. That sucks. Okay, go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tend to agree.  Have some gin.  The solution is in a bottle for you right now. Uh, 15.  Yeah. To the bottom 15 years strong, Google released Santa's village,  the Christmas theme site with a Google Santa tracker that I know I use every  year with my kids. They love it. Uh, there's a bunch of educational games,  lesson plans, instructional videos, videos, of course, the Santa tracker.  You can also ask Google home where Santa and it'll let you know.  Although I remember last year my kids were doing it for like a month after  Christmas because it was still giving the same kind of canned answers.  Afterwards, they were like, that doesn't make any sense.  Uh, in G board, apparently there's holiday stickers and stuff that you can use as  well. And then finally, Kevin, you wrote about, uh,  support for virtual desktops and, um, what else?  Requesting mobile website on Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So, um,  that's one thing that's definitely lacking on Chrome OS that every other desktop  platform has is virtual desktops or spaces or whatever you want to call them,  where you can put different apps on virtual displays, so to speak,  you can slide over to a different desktop for maybe productivity and another one  for personal, et cetera. So that's in the works. I found some code for that.  Also, um, and this,  I think we'll apply more to smaller Chrome OS tablets of which there's only one  right now, the Acer Chromebook tab 10.  You will be able to request the mobile view of a website on a Chrome OS  tablet,  which is kind of the opposite of the iOS version where you can request the  desktop site. Um, my theory though is, and I wrote it in here,  the smaller the display size,  the less value you get from a full desktop browser.  So it makes sense on a smaller device in my opinion, like the Chromebook tab 10.  I don't think I'd use the mobile sites on say the pixel slate, for example,  but you'll be able to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice. And that is the Google change log.  I love that. That's a feature. That's a feature of the show. Again,  that was sad when it disappeared. It's good to have it back.  I guess it's been back for a long time now at this point, but there you go.  Let's take a break and thank the sponsor of this episode. Sorry,  I just got a notification. Uh, and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  everyone grabs their phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does that be? No. Uh,  we'll take a break and thank the sponsor and then we'll come back with tips,  tricks, numbers, all that fun stuff.

Rounding out the show here.  Let's start with you, Kevin, cause I see something in the doc for you.  What you got? What's your stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you Jason may have actually come across this with all about Android.  But for others who may not be aware.  And since we talked about security so much today,  I wanted to point out the E foundation,  which is another mobile platform play,  basically using the lineage OS version of Android.  You can install this on a bunch of different devices right now.  It's really in the early testing phases.  And the whole idea is you will have total control over your privacy.  You will not be giving the foundation or anyone else, any app makers,  your information. I have not tried this yet.  I'd like to find one of my old phones that will work with it,  but none of them do just yet.  But the idea again is for privacy based, a privacy based experience.  They are looking to start selling phones with this operating system in about a  month. So I wonder if they're going to be at CES.  Stacey and I will be there. I don't know if anybody else on the show will be  there,  but I will actually stop by if they're there because I'm very interested in  this approach.  I think it's tough to have a third or alternative mobile platform right now,  but a lot of people are, you know,  have privacy on their minds and as well they should.  So the foundation is something that you can try and look into if that's something  that appeals to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very cool. I like that. And I'll have to check that out,  look into that a little bit more.  I'm sure I have a device somewhere that I can test that out on.  Let's see here, Stacey, what you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I, let's see, what do I have? Ooh, I have,  I could take you on the road and show it to you,  but here's a lovely picture on the website that I put in there. This is the,  it has the longest name,  but it is a smoke detector that also detects carbon monoxide,  acts as a speaker and has Apple HomeKit and Amazon's  Madam A. So, and it sounds amazing.  It is $250, which is crazy expensive. So this is not for everyone,  but if you are the type of person who does not want a bunch of echoes or  whatnots running around your house and you wanted to play Apple music,  although the Amazon echoes will start getting that on their own,  this device will have this and it sounds amazing.  It's got a little night light that you can change, like be purple or blue.  You can make phone calls on it using Madam A and  I, you know, I think it's, it's a nice device. It's not for everybody,  but if you're going to upgrade your smoke detectors,  it also sends you an alert when your smoke detector goes off.  You could have one of these with your, I have, this is a first alert,  but I have kiddie smoke detectors in my house and this works and sets off the  network smoke detectors. I don't know what else to tell you about it,  but it's actually a, it's a surprisingly good product. At first,  I thought it was really gimmicky when I read about it, but having tried it,  I would actually put this in my house. It is expensive, so it's not for everyone.  But nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although taking calls from,  like I have to wonder how the call is going to sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I'm going to test that with Kevin actually. Hey, Kevin,  stick around after the show, cause I need to call you on my smoke detector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, can't hear you. You're muted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin and you're muted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, I was talking to the dog.  Let's hope there's no fire issues when you give me a call on that,  because I don't know what would happen to the phone call. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we could set off the smoke detector. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you have to test it out, put it, yeah, put it through its paces,  light a fire so that it's, so that it's start,  the alarm starts going off and then make the call while the alarm's going off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I was thinking I would light the fire while I was talking to Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I guess you could test it before and after too, that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that, that, that covers all the bases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Totally good. Good plan. Jeff, what's your number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm hoping cause Stacey had a meeting with a Bose person.  Maybe she knows more about this than I do, but I'm fascinated by the Bose AR  headset, uh, classes coming out,  especially cause we talked a few weeks ago about how there is audio AR and how I  believe this ought to be used for people with limited sight.  And so if the glasses know where you are and where you're headed,  what could they give you an audio sounds really interesting to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  AT&T actually has a pair of glasses called Aria glasses that do that already.  And they have haptic feedback in them. So it vibrates to which way you go.  I'm not saying they're way expensive and come with an AT&T subscription.  So this is probably a cheaper, better option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is 200 bucks and available for pre-order. Yeah. Yes.  So the idea of playing with audio AR audio was a different input, uh,  smart to where you are.  If it's working in the home and it's talking to you and your smoke detector and  all that, why shouldn't it work out on the street when you're just walking around?  And also obviously you can ask Madam A,  you can ask Mr G and so on questions and get answers.  The story says that it's not, it's not an earplug. It's a small speaker.  So you don't, you don't want to ask, um,  for when is your rendezvous with your lover, uh,  on the phone because it will, other people can hear you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean then people will be like, wow, she's really amazing. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And where did she get those glasses? Uh, it's a,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  amazing to have a lover with those glasses. They're pretty dorky looking,  but that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I will tell you one tidbit from my, uh,  the interview I had with the Bose lady is everybody,  I guess this makes sense, right?  But because everybody's ear canal and outside of their ear is differently  shaped, we actually have, we all hear things differently. We don't think about it,  but we all have a different perception of what we hear.  And what she was talking about is how that experience gets flattened a lot of  time in earphones,  which subtly changes how each of us hears everything through earphones,  which I was just like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She was really fun to talk to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean as far as a dorky looking, uh, AR glasses are concerned, these aren't,  these are bad.  The sides of them are a little strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll confess to you that my non connected sunglasses without anything in them  were more expensive than these sunglasses. And yeah,  they look better, but that's just my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are Bose. So, you know, uh,  you remember back at Google IO,  Google had said about its home devices that they would add a pretty please  feature for speaking nicely to your devices and being rewarded for it.  Apparently that is rolling out now. So if you say, please,  when you ask a question, you'll get responses tailored to it.  Things like thanks for asking so nicely, you know,  never hurts to start treating our devices with respect and kindness and also  teaching our kids to do that. Maybe it's a good practice for them as well.  Some other features include list integration that now includes third party apps  like keep the way it used to before they changed it and it started to suck really  bad. Also any do bring and todoist integration so you can set that up.  So yay for that. A broadcast replies is rolling out,  which basically makes these devices more of like a two way communication thing.  I'm curious to test that out. I want to see how that works. Um,  a little confused on that, but, uh,  and then lyrics support for screened assistant devices,  although apparently right now that only works with Google play music,  which as we know Google play music is being phased out in lieu of YouTube music  and YouTube music really sucks. So I'm not, you know, very happy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're going to come out with Hangouts music next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason's things into very strong opinions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, I had to put that in there. It's their data points. They're data points.  They have to be mentioned. Uh,  and we have reached the end of this week in Google this episode.  Anyways, not the whole show, uh,  but this week's episode has come to a close and uh,  thank you once again for inviting me on you guys.  I love doing the show with you and it's always a lot of fun. Kevin Toffle.  Thanks for dropping in today. Uh,  where do you want people to follow all of your amazing work online?  I assume about Chromebooks.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what, yeah, I hear that's a pretty good site. So I would,  I would hit that.  My Bible. I love it. Um, thank you. I'm glad to hear that. Seriously.  Add Kevin C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not as good as Gutenberg's Bible, but it's Jeff's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Close second, close second. Uh,  and Jeff, thanks for making it. Uh, even in,  even France couldn't keep you from being connected to us. So thank you.  Hey, it works, man. It's, it's not the sharpest connection in the world,  but it was stable. I gotta, I gotta say it was very stable. Uh,  buzz machine.com and a whole lot else. Any,  anything you want to add at Jeff Jeff Jarvis on Twitter? All right.  It's time time for bed. Jeff, tuck yourself in.  We want to meet and Stacy Higginbotham always so much fun to do a show with  you. IOT podcast.com Stacy on IOT.com and at a gig of Stacy on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you. And I didn't, I didn't make my goal.  I only had two things at Jen's. Sorry you guys. So you did two bottles.  Yeah, but there was only one ounce. So I did two ounces. Okay. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well you know what? Just do that the next couple of days and you're caught up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, that'll be my guys. I need to drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hold on. Yes. I got a calendar reminder.  I need to do something really important. Uh, let's see here.  We do this show every Wednesday, I believe, uh,  at one 31 1 30 PM Pacific four 4 30 PM Eastern somewhere around there today.  We started a little bit earlier and I really appreciate it.  Thank you Carson for setting that up. Uh,  it helps me out for this day in particular, but uh, we do it live.  So you can watch it live. If you go to twit.tv slash live,  you can watch as we record this show live or you can subscribe to it.
