Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fine gentlemen of the free and open internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we must say a bonsoir to our good friend, Jeff Jarvis.  Who is still in Paris.  Is the EG8 all wrapped up?  It did this evening, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I have to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've had your saumon and you've spoken to the president.  In fact, I'm going to play the question you asked the president.  This is, there's a couple, there's quite a few videos of you actually at the EG8 summit.  Do you want to set this up?  What is the EG8 summit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The E8 of course is the eight world leaders who meet once a year and Sarkozy in France  are the president of it this year.  And he decided to bring the internet to the agenda.  So he held a prior EG8 meeting in Paris the last two days trying to get a discussion going  about internet policy and his belief that he should bring regulation to it.  He used to talk about wanting to civilize the internet.  He stopped doing that according to my French friends, but that's still kind of his attitude  is that he wants to bring order and civility to this very strange thing we have here.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  As does the Chinese government by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's a problem.  Yeah, it's pretty out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he kicked off the EG8 forum.  How many people were there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  About a thousand people in a gigantic kind of tent structure catering by Le Nôtre and  last night in the Louvre right next to that.  The tent structure was built on the Tuileries.  And so he opened up with Maurice Levy from publicist, the big giant agency that organized  this interviewing Sarkozy after he gave a talk.  And so he gave the talk and they talked.  And so then there were some questions.  And then I, like a rude American, drew attention to myself.  A journalist told me today that she said, well, did they arrange the question with you?  I said, well, may know.  And she said, well, every other question was arranged.  Oh, you.  Oh.  And somehow, according to her, at least, she has sent me the link yet, but I don't have  this verified.  But according to her, I guess Levy made the mistake of calling on me and a big mistake  it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, we are so proud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love you.  Representative rebel, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are so proud you went and here I had a job to do.  I was only there, only there at all, because Leo Laporte, president of the Internet, was  asked the president into that and Leo couldn't go.  And so I went and I figured I had a job to do.  So I wrote a post beforehand talking about what I would say.  And indeed, that's what I did say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  The post is on BuzzMachine.com.  The great post.  Do no harm.  Here is the official.  This is the official EG8 video, which is available on YouTube.  But of course, because it's from Sarkozy, it's only 360p.  So apologies for the poor quality.  I don't hear any audio.  Oh, here we go.  That's Sarkozy, right?  Oui.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's Maurice.  Bonjour, Monsieur le Président.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Je m'appelle Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm Jeff Jarvis, University of New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You say that, acknowledge that government does not own the Internet, yet we see governments  trying to claim sovereignty there.  A U.S. official calls the Internet an eighth continent.  It is a new land.  And what makes it free and open is its very structure of being distributed and open.  And so as you go to the G8, I have one small request.  I think this discussion is wonderful.  I think this discussion about principles and the Internet and shared understanding and  potential is very much what we need.  But I would ask a government to take a Hippocratic oath for the Internet, and that is first,  do no harm.  Not everyone applauding, I know.  No, a smacker in the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oui, honnêtement, c'est pas très difficile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, honestly, it's not difficult to answer that question.  Do no harm.  Absolutely.  I mean, why should you think we would harm you?  You've got tremendous potential for growth and knowledge.  It's extraordinary.  I like the expression, the eighth continent.  But what do you mean by harm?  I will certainly pay very close attention to this.  Now, do you mean that bringing up the matter of security from terrorism is a question of  harm?  Is that harmful?  Or if we say to you, you are creative people, what you've created has to be protected,  respected, and we have to also respect and protect other creators, is that harmful to  you?  If we say, you wanted the eighth continent to be the continent of freedom and openness,  we say that we mustn't give rise to new monopolies.  Is that harmful?  We can say there are sacred universal values such as protecting a child from some predatory  nature of some adults.  Is that harmful to you?  I do not think so.  I think what would be harmful to you would be to not recognize that you are responsible,  competent people, good citizens, good global citizens, shouldering their responsibilities.  What would be harmful to you would be to not even bring up the issue, being afraid you  wouldn't understand it.  You've understood the future so well.  I'm certainly fully capable of understanding this matter.  So if I'm to do a Hippocratic oath of doing you no harm, yes, I would accept that oath.  I could even say to you, I like you, and I'd rather the sunshine than the rainfall.  I'd rather businesses making money than businesses losing money.  It's great being here, but ask for stronger commitments on my part.  And what I can say to you, and I'm convinced that from my colleagues at the state and government,  true, we're fully aware of the power of the internet.  At the same time, the fragility of the overall internet ecosystem, we mustn't enact any  measures that would complicate the development of this system.  I agree with you fully.  Yes, indeed.  And I think with the best intentions, we could make for problems.  So be very careful.  So I think in this market that you are creating, which hasn't yet stabilized, we have to be  very careful.  Think things through carefully before taking a decision.  The idea of regulating once and for all is ill-suited to your economy.  We have to be very pragmatic, move forward, evolve, use our experience, learn from it.  We must decide to do nothing rather than do the wrong thing, better to hold back in  this sector of growth and therefore instability.  So that's my oath that I'd certainly be prepared to adhere to.  And let me say that the fact that some of you came is a good sign, because if you felt  that it weren't meaningful, you wouldn't have come.  I really do believe it's extremely important for us to continue this dialogue in mutual  respect.  Believe me, what we want as a state and government is to make no mistake in your area, your economy,  which is a work in progress, which is very fragile, which is very powerful at the same  time.  We do not want to create any instability.  Shall we change the sector?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good, I think that's certainly a politic answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, he started off, most of it was quite mocking.  Harm, what is harm?  Of course I'm not going to cause you harm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Wall Street Journal, which quoted you, unfortunately, without quoting your name,  did in fact pick up on that kind of dismissive response.  Yes.  That, hey, you're a citizen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was delighted that it was a lead up to the wall.  It got quoted around.  He was dismissive of it and said, you know, the good news is he takes the pledge.  The bad news is he doesn't believe it or know what it means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and I guess that's the difficulty is that he was smart enough to hit the right  notes towards the end there about it's a nascent economy and we'd rather do nothing  than do something wrong.  But what you're saying and what others are saying is that he doesn't believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  And the New York Times today reported that the final report of the event was as much  as written before the event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the, that was what Cory Doctorow feared is that by going, he would give an  imprimatur to an event that was really just a dog and pony show so that the document that  resulted, which by the way, I think Mark Zuckerberg is delivering, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Various.  Zuckerberg, Schmidt, I think six or seven internet executives are going to D'Odoviel  with Sarkozy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So really, they're the guys who are putting the imprimatur on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, to a great extent they are.  And there's some report coming out already.  The Germans have said that they don't go along.  The Americans said that they don't go along.  Sarkozy was trying, the way Cory Doctorow put it was this was a smoke screen on his  effort to get the G8 to regulate the internet.  Another friend of mine said to two of us who went, he sent an email to us, you are the  lipstick on the pig, smooch smooch.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's just mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, he wasn't going, he was jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is true that at least President Obama, maybe other G8 leaders didn't want the internet  on the agenda at G8 at all.  He said there's more important things, but also not having it on.  Is it better not to have it on the agenda?  That's the question here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I argued there and my post and felt more strongly even after being there was that I  don't blame Sarkozy for filling in the vacuum.  The vacuum was left by us, the people of the internet.  We didn't hold this meeting.  We didn't bring this large level discussion.  He did.  Now the problem is the meeting occurs at government's table and he invited who he wanted to that  table and that was big executives and a lot of really big old time executives to it.  Rupert Murdoch was there.  Murdoch, our favorite stocking.  He used the internet.  The head of Universal in France was just laughable.  The head of the Italian newspaper company was similarly laughable.  There was just jowly old time 1998 internet attitude from a lot of those people.  On the other hand, you had Sean Parker and Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt and other people  like that there.  So it was a very strange mix.  Susan Crawford, ex-member of the ICANN board, who's one of my heroes, said that she knew  we were lipstick on the pig.  I asked her whether she was glad we came and she said yes because she thinks that we at  least show them that there was opposition to their view.  The two heroes of the event to me were Larry Lessig and John Perry Barlow.  They were both there.  They were both there and they were both on panels.  There was an intellectual property panel that was just unbelievable and I was tweeting at  the moment this came on because Sarkozy had talked about how this is a revolution.  And I said, well, here's the revolution.  Who the hell are the revolutionaries in the room?  And on the stage walked John Perry Barlow.  Okay, done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amen.  God bless him.  God bless him.  It was just wonderful.  And he was ready to erupt like Iceland the whole time.  He was the only guy who was defending.  He said, listen to this panel.  I think I came from a different planet.  He talked about the Grateful Dead, giving away music and how it worked for them as a  business.  He was the only one up there who actually made content.  And it was pretty discussion all around.  So John was also like, they called his name, it was John Perry.  Jean Perry Barlow.  Jean Perry Barlow.  And so he was great.  And Larry Lessig did a presentation this morning.  I'm honored to say that he remade the presentation last night and included Do No Harm in it.  So I think my life is complete.  I'm on Twit and Twig.  I've been used as a Howard Stern bumper and I've been part of a Larry Lessig keynote.  You made it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're done.  It's a bucket list.  It's a cross-off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, he's got more to do.  We want more, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we do want more.  So Lessig was just great.  And the problem is, as Lessig says these days, they're using the wrong architecture to judge  all this.  And they're still judging, as we know about the old architecture, but they can't understand  the new architecture.  They can't understand how to make this world work.  And John Perry was mocking the numbers that the entertainment folks came up with and said  that even the highest number you give me, that industry is not worth saving for the  price of hampering the internet, the freedom we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, it's small.  It's tiny compared to even Google alone.  I guess one question is, if Google and Facebook are, which camp are they in?  I mean, are they going to pull the ladder up camp?  We made it.  Now let's stop innovation cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a problem.  Yochai Benkler from Harvard Berkman Center, in my respect, greatly was there.  And he was all eager to buy, he told me, an Android phone until the deal came along between  Google and Verizon.  And he pulled out his iPhone out of his pocket because it was now the lesser evil.  And there was a lot of talk there among folks like us of the great disappointment of Google.  Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Benkler, by the way, his classic book, The Wealth of Networks, he released it for free  on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And also he has the audio version is, you know, mechanized voice.  Mechanized?  No, mechanical voice.  Mechanical voice.  Yeah, computer voice.  Thank you.  And I'll tell you, listen, I've tried it.  Listening to that book, which is about 900 pages in that voice is really a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I'll read it, Yochai.  I'll read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, get Leo to do that.  I'll record it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd love to record it and do a public domain version if anybody wanted to.  It is.  Yeah, I'd love to do it.  I'll be glad to do that.  You can have my voice.  You should.  It's a great book.  It is a great book.  The only problem with it is, you know, even after a couple of years, everything's changed.  Yeah.  Yochai's brilliant.  He's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a press conference today that Susan Crawford and Yochai, and then, pardon me,  the head of Reporters Without Borders, which I would say in French, but my French has been,  all held with a guy who did try to bring in the civil society.  So we tried to get, you know, a voice of opposition going there.  Listen, it was fine for them to have a discussion.  Obviously, I'm the last person to say someone shouldn't have a discussion.  And again, I criticize us and the internet more than I do Sarkozy and Pulpices, that,  you know, they held the meeting and we didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  But what's great is, as the G8 is an incredible spur to protest, this EG8 was a spur to quite  an active internet protest around it.  There's a web page.  There's a lot of people talking about it.  So in some ways, credit to a publicist group and Sarkozy for starting the conversation.  I agree.  We can't be really surprised by what came out of it.  What did that white paper say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Frankly, I was talking to people outside.  They had bullet points, kind of tweet length points from all the sessions.  There were complaints about other points.  It didn't mean anything.  That's kind of inevitable.  You know, they showed us.  I was on a panel about data and privacy.  And you know, so it becomes nanny-pamby.  What's to be expected?  You try to summarize an hour in four points.  I think what he's saying is that it is time to, in his view, to regulate the internet  and to bring some safety to it.  And a lot of us were saying, no, it's too soon.  You don't know what it is yet.  And it's a fairly obvious disagreement there.  I think that he'll have resistance.  He'll have put it on the agenda.  And that's pretty much what he meant to do.  And Cory Doctor is right.  We were a smokescreen for it.  Were we used?  Yeah, we absolutely were.  And full disclosure is I got travel accommodations to come to this.  So I was, you know, I didn't get paid to come, but I got that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, and I'm glad you did because it's very, I, it was very expensive to do it on such  short notice.  They didn't give us a lot of notice.  I had a pizza and beer tonight for 50 euro.  Yeah, welcome to, welcome to Paris.  But I'm so, Jeff, on behalf of all of us, we're so glad you were generous enough to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  let me come to the party.  And I'm sorry I missed the Mesh conference in Toronto, which I was supposed to be at.  Right.  But I think this was probably important to do and to see what was going on.  And those of us who were growling when we were there still said it was important to  be there.  So I think it was a good move.  And I thank you for being generous enough to open me into the party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it wasn't up to me, but I'm glad Loic Lemur heard us talking about it on Twig.  And it was he who got me in.  And of course he was there.  And you too now.  And I bet you get an invitation at Loeb in December.  So you get some benefit out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure I'll be back at this one.  The Do No Arm meme, I'm grateful to say, continued throughout the meeting.  When Liv was interviewed at Zuckerberg at the end, he brought it up again.  And so we shall see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So good for you, Jeff.  That was the whole, that was what you were charged with.  You did a great job.  Mission accomplished.  Yeah, definitely.  Now, if you think if an event like this was organized by the people, Jeff, who do you  think should do it?  The EFF?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is he frozen or is he thinking?  I couldn't agree with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, he blinked.  I was trying to be cool, but it absolutely stopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She was just saying, if there were an event like this with all the players on the internet,  who should organize this?  The EFF?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I think it could be many parties.  It could be the EFF.  It could be Berkman Center.  It could be Mozilla Foundation.  Mitchell Baker was here.  Oh, interesting.  Though I'm having a little, you know, they're implementing Do Not Track and they're kind  of in the play there.  It could be a bunch of universities.  I'm not sure who else, but I think it could be a lot of different parties could do this.  South by Southwest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the EFF, I think a number of those parties would be seen as partisan.  I think that a university, I like the Berkman idea.  I think a university is more appropriate than the EFF.  The EFF had to be at the table, of course.  And you can't do it without John Perry Barlow.  Well, I think it's great.  I'm really sorry I couldn't be there for those who are wondering.  I had a family emergency, wasn't able to make it.  But I'm so glad that Jeff was there.  I obviously didn't need to be there at all.  You did a great job.  Boy, you know, you set the table really for that Do No Harm conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other highlight, Leo, was we were right next to the Louvre and we had the dinner party  last night in the Louvre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's pretty cool.  I don't imagine that happens too often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that was cool.  And Joe Schoendorf, NSL, brought the wine.  One bottle of wine was supposed to be two grand.  Wow.  And then they had some tour guides.  And so we got to go and see a little bit of the Louvre.  So, you know, he stood up close to the Mona Lisa, which was cool.  That's neat.  That makes it all worthwhile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You coming home tonight or tomorrow?  When are you coming home?  Tomorrow morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tomorrow morning, first thing.  Flying in.  We're so glad.  Hopefully there's no ash this time.  Isn't it funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The same thing happened again this year that happened to you last year.  Yeah.  M.G. Seigler, who writes for TechCrunch, was stuck in Iceland itself.  He was there for a bachelor party.  And I don't know.  I think he mis-disrupted New York because of it.  Did he make it to disrupt?  I don't think he's there now.  Sarah says he's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was a disruptor before.  Matt Cutts says that Leo, you're the president of the Internet and I'm the spokesman.  I'm proud to be the spokesman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I am now completely president emeritus and I'm handing the crown and scepter over to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will not accept.  I will not accept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  VP, VP.  If nominated, I will not run.  If elected, I will not serve.  My liege.  Actually, this is a day.  I do want to mark this.  I don't know how historic it is, but this is the day that John F. Kennedy announced  before a joint session of Congress on May 25th, 1961, that before this decade is out,  the U.S. will put a man on the moon.  And he did do it.  But it's been very interesting.  We live in such a great age of information to go back and look at the tapes.  The White House tapes have been released in the past by the Miller Center, WhiteHouseTapes.net,  and they've released some new tapes that showed that Kennedy was chiefly interested, what  a surprise, in the PR impact of the moon launch.  In fact, he says, we've spent half the expenditures, we've wrecked the budget and all these other  domestic products, and the only justification for it, in my opinion, to do it in the Pell  Mail fashion is because we hope to beat them, the Soviets, and demonstrate that starting  it behind them, as we did by a couple of years, by God, we passed them.  I think it would be a hell of a thing for us.  So, it's, you know, if you haven't gone to this, I had never heard of this site, the  University of Virginia's Miller Center for Public Affairs, they have all of these Kennedy  tapes and it's fascinating to hear what really goes on in the Oval Office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he admitted that he worried that it was just a stunt.  It's good to know, even JFK has doubts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's the proof, they didn't really go.  It was just a stunt.  Kennedy says so.  That'll feed the conspirators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've got Roosevelt here, they've got all sorts of incredible stuff.  I just, you know, even the Cuban Missile Crisis stuff is in here.  So if you haven't, I didn't know about it, I can't wait now to spend a lot of time here.  And it's all the audio is actually surprisingly good.  What is the audio when we have you, Leo?  I could just talk like this.  Actually, all I'm doing is an impression of the guy in The Simpsons.  And the mayor, is it the mayor on The Simpsons?  Yeah, I think so.  And then so he sounds just like Kennedy, so that's close enough.  But yeah, anyway, it was 1961.  It was 50 years ago today that we made the decision to go to the moon.  And whether you agree that it was a stunt or not, and I think it probably was kind of  a stunt. It was one hell of a stunt.  It sure was.  One hell of an inspiring stunt.  One hell of a PR move, that's for sure.  Jeff and I are old enough to remember it and how inspiring it was and how exciting it was.  And I think that the long lasting benefits, there's no doubt that the science that this  country, you know, the number of scientists alone that it spawned were valuable.  Let's see. Facebook revolution comes to the French presidency.  So Mark Zuckerberg was was meeting with Sarkozy.  It's so funny. I mean, Zuckerberg has now met with Obama and Sarkozy in the same week.  He's 20. What is he? 27.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  27. And he's taking you seriously because he has a suit on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yes. He's wearing actually well, his tie is loosened, which I think kind of gives it  that rakish sporty schoolboy look.  He doesn't he look like a private school. He looks like he's going to Groton.  Which he I think he did go to Groton, didn't he?  Or no, was it Exeter? It was Exeter.  Yeah. Phillips Exeter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He appeared then at the EGA after this.  Right. And by then he had changed into into the t-shirt and jeans.  Good. They settled the invitation that we were to wear  a business casual during the meetings, a smart casual to the dinner.  And I put on Twitter last night, what the heck is the difference?  Somebody said one hundred dollars today.  Zuckerberg defined smart casual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a t-shirt and jeans, t-shirt and jeans on stage.  On stage, he said when asked about meeting with Sarkozy, he said it was fun.  I understand where he's coming from.  I appreciate the chance to be here and be part of the dialogue.  He's learning to be a politician, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, is he ever? Oh, is he ever?  He's he, you know, it saddened me because Zuckerberg,  when I saw him at Muckety Muck meetings in years past, he was always direct.  It's how we got the reputation of being aspergery, though he's not.  But he would say what he had to say and then look at you.  And now he has the cool lines and he knows how to do that.  And but there's still Zuckerberg moments.  He's talking today.  And at one point, he said he kind of got distracted.  And he said, oh, it's a bug on me.  And Maurice Lévy-D said something about, oh,  that was a normal line of bugging me.  Sorry, they lost his place entirely.  He couldn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually appreciate and like that.  I'm not sure. I'm not sure I appreciate Mark playing politics, though.  Here's an opportunity to really fight the fight.  I don't know.  When you go and when you walk in the corridors of power,  even though he obviously has a lot of power and clout, it's intimidating.  Oh, yeah.  Access Now, which has been really vociferous in its opposition to the EG8  today said in a statement, President Sarkozy's disastrous design  for the Internet has become glaringly apparent.  The world's most developed economies are poised to impose  strict copyright enforcement and heavy handed government regulation of the Internet.  This based on leaked drafts of the G8 final declaration.  Rupert Murdoch called for the G8 to protect intellectual property.  We hope the G8, how does he tie? He's Australian.  We hope the G8 strongly affirm that property rights of artists and creators  are more than just a matter of protecting cultures.  Right. In this new century, there are essential requirements  for a dynamic economy and the digital future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Essential requirements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, OK, I'm a play devil's advocate.  Doesn't he make a point if you are even if, you know, if you're an old school content  creator or somebody just who's created some very expensive content, you are scared  of putting it out on the Internet.  Look at the look at the Google and Netflix.  Or actually, it's not Netflix, Google and their their movie rental system.  It doesn't work if you root your phone.  Because they can't then apparently guarantee you're not pirating the movie.  So so Google says, well, all right, it will check.  Are you rooted? Yeah, you're rooted.  OK, well, you can't rent movies from us.  Doesn't that protect?  I mean, isn't that necessary?  Doesn't Google have to do that to get a paramount and Sony and everybody  to put their movies on the Google system?  Isn't isn't Murdoch saying, yes, these are essential requirements.  We're not going to do it unless unless we know we're not going to get ripped off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really liked what  what Barlow had to say about this, that these rules, I mean, Google does that,  right, because the companies say that they have no choice to do.  Right. They have no choice.  Right. Or we can't offer it.  Right. Right. Ours wrote up Barlow's take on this.  And I'm trying to find a good good quote.  I may be one of the very few people in this room  who actually makes his living personally, personally by creating  what these gentlemen are pleased to call intellectual property.  I don't regard my expression as a form of property.  Property is something which can be taken from me.  If I don't have it, someone else does.  Expression is not like that.  The notion that expression is like that is entirely a consequence  of taking a system of expression and transporting it around,  which was necessary before there was the Internet,  which has the capacity to do this infinitely at almost no cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But OK, again, I'm going to stay devil's advocate.  And I know John's not here.  In fact, we should get John Perry.  We've had him on the triangulation, but we should get him on this show  to talk about these things specifically.  I know he I know he'd be, I'm sure, glad to do it because he's very accessible.  But that to me, that's kind of a misdirection.  Nobody's nobody.  We're not talking about the fact that you can you can make a copy of, you know,  this is a physical thing and intellectual property nowadays is no longer physical.  There's still the issue of if you kind of copy this willy nilly  or allowed to be copied willy nilly at no cost.  How do you make money on it?  And so it's not the issue of.  Yes, these new technologies allow us to make infinite,  perfect copies of your ideas and disseminate them worldwide.  Nobody's that's great.  But then how do you make a living?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, a few things.  One is that John argued that for music and tells the story of the Grateful Dead,  where they gave away the music.  They made a fortune. They made more money that way.  At the same time, he did say the movie makers.  Yeah, I understand what you make costs a great deal of money to make at that level.  And that's that's different.  And he got that.  The other interesting thing to me was that Zuckerberg today,  when he was talking, said that,  you know, he pointed to the success of Zynga and game platforms on top of  Facebook, and he said Zynga now has a higher market cap than  Oh, what's the other big market?  Game company, Electronic Arts.  Yeah, thank you.  And and Zuckerberg argued that it was because they understood  both the games and people, you know, they made it social.  And he argued that that was next going to come to media,  that the next person who's successful in music will be the person who figures out  how to combine knowledge with people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I mean, we don't know next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We know who's doing it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So same with movies or TV or I would argue news as well.  I don't think all media, I think movies, let's use movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Movies don't lend themselves to that.  Well. Novels, not all you're talking about  in the case of a movie or novel is a superior marketing campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right. You're absolutely right.  Well, but there could be an involvement in the whole process  of making it or a sense that you're involved or a belief that you're involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's better. That's better marketing.  Yeah. I mean, I guess you could say, well, we've got what we've got to communicate  to our kids is that if they like content, they're going to have to keep paying for it.  Or it won't happen. Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. But the argument is no to.  I'm not sure that we necessarily have to argue in all cases  that it's the content itself that holds the value.  Sometimes the relationship, the knowledge of that relationship,  the data around that relationship may hold more value than the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's for sure true of everything I do.  It's not about the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. Though your content is beautiful, except for what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we have good content, but the good content in and of itself.  Our content is no better or different, you know,  it may be worse in some ways than, say, ours, technical.  There's there's a content rich environment.  What we do that's different is it's social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And I was talking to an executive former head of news  to TV network who has a new gig right now, and he was trying to argue,  make that argument, the content is valuable.  And so I said, well, you know, it was arguing that Zuckerberg devalues content,  doesn't value it, right, doesn't care about it.  And I said, no, actually, it's the opposite.  I think Zuckerberg cares more about content in more ways  because he sees value in it in more places.  I'm pixelating like, man, no, that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You look good here.  I don't know how you we sound to you, but you sound great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK. And so so what I said was that he doesn't narrow the definition  of content to a little bit.  He sees the content we all create as value.  And then the executive said, well, but but content is is the steel  that makes Google's cars and so on and so forth.  And I said, well, yeah, but not necessarily.  That assumes that the content again has all the value.  Zuckerberg sees the value in the relationships.  Google sees the value in the data and the signals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just think it's not all one thing.  There's different kinds of content.  Gina, you. I agree, but.  Gina, you say that you see.  Gina, Gina, go ahead, finish your thought, Jeff,  and I'm going to let the young person speak.  Go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's a common it's a combination of all these things.  I'm not going to read a book unless I get a recommendation or hear reference.  And it's I mean, it's a combination of the socials, a combination of the data.  It's interaction.  And you were saying, you know, that you think we should teach our kids that  if they really like something, then they better buy it or else  they're either going to get locked up or they should feel really guilty.  Fact is that people buy stuff that they that they like,  and companies should be concentrating less on how to control content  and more on how to give people the opportunity to pay for the content

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that they love. Well, I agree on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that's that's where the energy should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that an old battle?  Well, that's the old that was the old argument with the music industry  where they weren't offering, you know, the the Beatles weren't off.  You couldn't buy it online instead of, you know, trying to worry  about copy protection, make it available so people can buy it.  But I think there is a deeper fear, a deeper concern among.  Let's let's use premium content creators as the sphere here,  because content can be so many things.  But among premium content creators that if we make a movie,  if we make The Hurt Locker  and it costs us a certain amount of money to make,  if people don't pay to see it, but instead just steal it,  we can't make the next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. But well, first, let's not conflate the creators  and the studios that, you know what I mean, the funders. OK.  So that's that's there's a difference.  And yeah, The Hurt Locker was kind of a weird.  It's a great movie, though.  And I think they just launched the largest

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  lawsuit, number of lawsuits ever for torrent users who downloaded.  It was over twenty five thousand subpoenas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Gaga just took down Amazon because so many people wanted to download.  Her ninety nine cents for ninety nine cents.  Yeah, but it was the day it launched.  And yes, it was ninety nine cents. So people were being cheap. Right.  She slowed down Amazon.  I mean, that's unbelievable. And she made money.  I mean, cha ching. She made the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She made money. No doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how do you want to be spending your money on like on the lawsuit  or, you know, launching an incredible album that everyone loves.  Everyone loves her.  I mean, I mean, she's she is a master of social, the marketing,  the music, the performance.  She's got the whole package.  I'm sorry, chat room and listeners.  Yes, I am a Gaga fan, but it's not just because I'm a fan.  I mean, it's kind of amazing what she's doing.  And in fact, we should we should play the chrome.  The chrome commercial is really cool. I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We will play that. Yeah.  But she to me is the Beatles of this generation in that  it's a phenomenon that is much more than about the music.  And yes, you know, I mean, it's it's and she puts it together  better than anybody else.  There's no question about it. She's a cultural icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And she has had and she knows how to use the Internet.  She knows how to reach out and she knows how to make her fans  feel like they know her.  And it's a total experience, I think, being being a Gaga fan.  And that's what more people, content creators and platforms  which launch them and distribute their their work have to learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And is it true then that if you are Lady Gaga,  you don't concern yourself with  whether people will pay for your music.  You create fans who, of course, will buy your music.  I think so. Yeah, that's true.  You know, I ask my son, I ask my son all the time  because he makes music now.  And he also and he downloads a lot of dubstep via limewire.  And I say, you know, how are you going to feel when that's your music?  And, you know, I don't it's interesting.  I don't I think maybe I'm old.  I also have that old fashioned notion.  But I am playing devil's advocate here.  But I but I do think that that is something that needs to be teased out is  people want to make a living doing their art.  I want them to be able to make a living doing their art.  And I understand their concern about that.  So I want to hear from all the people who are so smart about this,  like you and John Perry, Barlow and everybody.  How do you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don said a couple things to the to the old parts on his panel.  One is he said that we have more full time musicians now than ever.  Is that true?  I don't know. Do we have a little bit of no, but there are more musicians  in the big band era, but I would think it probably is people  who somehow find a way to make it worthwhile.  And then one of the guys complained that we spend five billion dollars  developing artists and Barlow said, man, we're not getting your money's worth.  The problem is, it's the hit based economy.  But all of these big old monopolistic  businesses are trying to be able to bring in the same revenue they used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. This is the thing, right?  Not everyone's going to be Gaga.  A lot of people are going to be Jonathan Colton.  But they, you know, but they don't want, you know, labels don't want those musicians.  They want the gaga's right, because they're easy money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and by the way, Jonathan Colton is very happy being Jonathan Colton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As he should be, he's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he's done great.  I mean, he's not making Gaga money, but he's making a good living.  That's some of it. That is expectation.  I think some art, you know, artists coming up  a few years ago might have said, how can I become a platinum artist?  I don't think they're going to be platinum artists.  So maybe there's a smaller number of people making obscene amounts of money,  but a much larger group of people who can make a living doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Choice inevitably inevitably brings the end of the blockbuster economy. Right.  Once we are fragmented,  to use the word that the big media like to use, or once we have a choice,  the way that I would like to see it, then the blockbuster is still possible.  But the risk is much, much higher.  The cost of getting there much higher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm the last person to moan because Transformers 4 won't be made.  But there is a market for blockbusters and they do cost a lot of money.  And you'd have to have investors.  I mean, that takes hundreds of people to make.  We're still are we going to still see those?  Well, you know, you know, opera is expensive.  Yeah, we still see opera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we do and we don't.  We see a lot less than we used to and the world's survived.  You know, self-change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is Transformers La Traviata of the 21st century?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  New York City Opera is leaving Lincoln Center because they can't afford to be there.  You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that makes me sad.  Not that I've been to an opera in the last 15 years. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's more of a sentimental thing.  I mean, Leo, you're an artist making your art, making a living out of it.  Because of the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And I, of course, knew from day one that I could not charge for what we do,  that we would have to give it away and that if we were going to if we were going  to make a living doing it and grow, that we would have to find a way to  give it away and make money.  And we have found a way to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And you also, you know,  you keep saying that if the network came to you tomorrow, you'd say no thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I come from a background in free pay, free advertising based  media. So I understand that medium and that's a natural medium.  But not everything lends itself to that.  True. No, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Music does not. It's pretty much a possible sponsor of music. Right.  But God, you know, the marketing piece is important.  God, God's audience distributes her, promotes her, sells her,  makes her bigger than she would be.  You know, I found her chatter at the HBO thing unbearable.  But God bless her.  Talks about her.  Her little monsters loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's funny because I had a conversation with a chat room  over the weekend in which I was saying, oh, if God got truly engaged  with her audience over Twitter, then I would be impressed.  And they said, well, read her Twitter. And in fact, she does.  She does. Or somebody.  Well, and I don't know if it's hers or Paris Hilton, but somebody is right.  You know, and it's very engaged.  And that blew me away.  I thought, oh, OK, she's not because I watched the Chrome ad and I said, well,  there's no real engagement.  She's saying, I'm so impressed by our little monsters.  But that was not a good sampling when I went back and actually looked at her Twitter.  She was very engaged with her audience in a way that is kind of amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it was interesting that commercial,  the text box she was typing into to put out status updates to her fans  was definitely not Twitter, but that's what she uses.  I mean, Twitter has been a huge platform for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ten million little monster followers.  Yeah, it's interesting because Gaga is, of course, polarizing.  As soon as we talked about people saying, I hate Lady Gaga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know everyone, everyone's getting.  Follow the Beatles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep, the Beatles did not. Did the Beatles polarize?  Maybe they did. Oh, yeah.  I guess, you know, the older generation didn't like them so much.  Oh, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, when they started off, they were bubblegum.  I mean, they were they were the right the beagle of their day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. I guess we're going to have to watch the ad.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just I just want to make you a little jealous, Gina.  Eileen is going to the Glee concert tonight in San Francisco.  Live Glee. Oh, Eileen.  And I bet she stops at Chipotle on the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pirate when you're there, Eileen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She said she will.  We just watch your Twitter stream.  It won't be like being there, but it'll be close.  Here is where did this ad air first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw it on Saturday Night Live.  That's right, because she was on Saturday Night Live.  And of course, yes, let's not forget, this is all a marketing campaign.  Yeah, this is a commercial, people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. For Gaga's new album, which came out the next day.  I'm sure it'll start any minute now.  I don't know why my YouTube is so here we go.  She's running on the gold on the Brooklyn Bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Short shorts. That's my girl on my bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then what's great is she pulls up all these YouTube videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Singing lip syncing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There she is typing, you're right.  And I don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the Twitter clone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess Google didn't want to show a Twitter clone, nor did they want to show Buzz.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't think Gaga buzzes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a Google image search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess it's really more visual for those of you listening.  You're not really seeing what's going on.  Lots of headbanging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is our moment, says Gaga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She obviously uses Chrome.  Oh, yeah. Lady Gaga uses Chrome.  The Google Gaga Nexus is fascinating.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It is. Is it Marissa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't be surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's a fan, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, she definitely is a fan.  Well, you know, there's the fashion thing, right?  There's that connection. And she interviewed Gaga and she giggled like  I've never seen Marissa so sort of kind of real and, you know, coming apart at the  seams, just so excited to see Gaga's as that interview.  So I wouldn't be surprised if.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would you love to see Marissa remade by Gaga?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Marissa in a meat dress.  One of those like wild hair pieces and some bad eye makeup.  I would love to see that.  That would be awesome. Marissa, let's make that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're going to take a break. You're listening to This Week in Google, watching it too.  I hope you can do both.  We are live, of course, every Wednesday at 1 p.m.  Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern, 2000 AUTC at live.twit.tv.  Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.org, Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com.  And more to come in just a moment.  But I do want to mention our friends at Squarespace  who make the most elegant, the most beautiful, the most sophisticated  web software for websites ever.  They do the hosting, too.  And I think that that's really what makes it such a great system,  because you're getting hosting from Squarespace  as well as software that's tuned to work with that hosting.  And there's some nice features they get, for instance, the virtual server technology  allows them to pour on the bandwidth when you need it.  Great software, too.  I mean, the software is and people, I think, think of it as blogging software.  Really, it's just for any kind of website.  All you have to do is go to the examples right at the top of the page.  Squarespace.com slash twig.  And you'll see there are blogs, of course, but there's businesses  design and our e-commerce, food and drink, health and wellness.  These are all sites, media and publishing in that use Squarespace in these  fields. Bob Woodruff's site.  This Triune film, there's our inside  twit site, Kevin Pollock, Dane Cook.  Our own Brian Brushwood, the Totally Ratch.  These are all sites in this is the beauty of Squarespace.  They can handle the kind of traffic that Dane Cook's going to generate.  And each site looks unique.  This you couldn't say, oh, that I recognize that that design.  No, each site is unique, your site, too.  Squarespace is it's a secret behind exceptional websites.  I want you to go to Squarespace.com slash twig.  Click that green button, try it free and set up a site.  Maybe you've already got a site.  If so, you can import all the content from the site  using the traditional APIs, movable type WordPress type at a blogger.  And when they do that, they do everything.  The links work, the URLs still work.  Everything works, which is really nice and export to.  So you're never trapped. I do like that.  And get that site going and take a look at what it looks like  with the new Squarespace software behind it.  If you have a friend, a family member, a favorite business  that doesn't have a site, the next time I go into the hair salon,  I'm going to say, can I set up a site for you?  Because you need a site.  If you don't have a site, you don't exist on the Internet.  Squarespace.com slash twig.  You can set that site up absolutely free, no credit card or anything.  So transferring it is as simple as giving them the URL and the password.  And it's theirs.  They can take it over, make it theirs.  It's kind of a nice little gift.  Give grandma her own website. Couldn't be simpler.  Squarespace.com slash twig. Give it a try.  I'm a big believer in everybody getting on the net,  speaking their mind, letting the people, letting people hear  what you have to say.  And boy, if you don't take advantage of these incredible technologies  to do that right now, you're missing.  The opportunity of not just a lifetime of of the of the century.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the ultimate platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really is amazing.  Mm hmm.  I mean, that's what, you know, ultimately,  you know, we talk about all these issues, but it's hard not to just say  it's going to all work out.  Do you think, Jeff, having sat at that table  that you feel like these guys could in the long run be damaging?  Or is it just a short run blip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I really think that  I think that that  the urge to regulate the urge to slow down the progress,  you know, Eric Schmidt talks about how the money and the resource goes  to the legacy companies, not to disruptors.  The Internet is profoundly disrupting the government as well.  Vivian Redding from the EU talks about four pillars of the Internet  that she wants in regulation, which includes  the right to erase, which we've talked about, and  a default privacy, which would have meant  if that existed, then Flickr never could have happened.  I think there can be a do not track.  There was discussion about that.  Mitchell Baker, who is brilliant from Los Alamos there,  and they're going to implement do not track.  They basically have started on Mozilla.  But if they decided to make that default,  I think that could be very damaging to media, as we talked about.  So, yes, damage can be done.  At one point in the meeting I got, I got  during the press conference that we rebels had,  I just turned to my colleagues there on the stage and I said, you know,  what do we do? I don't know what we really do.  And, you know, we can talk and we can change the  the agenda and we do things like that.  But I don't know that that's enough.  I'm not sure we do.  So I keep away scared of the people who are scared of the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I, you know, I wait about it.  I think they could do damage.  And there's no question about that.  But I also feel like the Internet is like it's like water.  It's happened. I don't know how long you can fight it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no way you can really, truly regulate it.  I'm the eternal optimist in the group.  Me too.  I kind of feel like there's just there's no way no matter what,  no matter what they put into place, this is an unstoppable force.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hesitate to say that because I don't want to discourage people from fighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. OK, true.  OK, I'll take it back then.  Fight.  No, you need to fight.  We need to fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not going to happen just passively, but I think we will fight.  And I think we will win.  But it's not going to happen if we just go, yeah, whatever.  Internet, it's permanent.  It'll be there forever. It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, there's Miz hack around talking.  And you can't hack around a lot of this.  Well, in the UK, there's a new rule coming out now that says that  basically the entire Internet turns into Copa.  And if you keep information on anyone,  you're going to have to get written or faxed permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But you know what?  If they do that and then all of a sudden the UK is falling behind  as development occurs in other places, then how long does that law last?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it depends on the regime.  The point is, in some regimes, it doesn't matter.  In China, they would just as soon fall behind on certain ways  because they'd rather have control.  They ran. Yes and no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, Egypt turned off the Internet. But how long?  And I think that it would become so quickly apparent  that by doing so, you're hobbling your future.  That was the that was the main message to me that Sarkozy needed to hear.  It's let's not worry about today's stakeholders.  Let's think about tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, one of Larry Lester's great lines and he had many of them,  but he said that the future of the Internet is not here.  They didn't know how to get invited. Right.  So the future of the Internet is not Google, is not Facebook.  And some kid we don't know yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tried to get my daughter in.  She's the future of the Internet. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.  Jake is the future of the Internet.  Oh, God knows where he's going to be.  And there are children, you know, being born today  that are the future of the Internet.  And it's really for them that it's important we keep this as open as possible.  Google made a big statement about NFC there, according to the chief of commerce  at Google, speaking at Disrupt.  NFC is a big bet for Google right now.  Which Google phones, Android phones support NFC?  Is it only the Nexus S?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So far, so far. Yeah. Yeah.  I'm sure there'll be more.  There's rumors that Apple, too, wants to be in this near field communications.  The idea that you can wave your phone in front of a soda machine  and it'll pop a soda out or in front of a Starbucks cash register  and you get coffee.  In fact, Starbucks was one of the places that was being tested in Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, really?  Oh, because Starbucks, I use the Starbucks app, which is just, you know,  a scam of barcode. Right.  It should have NFC. It's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They said there was a successful trial at Starbucks in London. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, there's definitely something magical about being able to pay the device.  I mean, even just using Square, which is swiping your old credit card,  you know, is kind of cool. Square is disruptive. Square is really disruptive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just look at Verifone getting upset about it. It's very disruptive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But Verifone made a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I have the same point about NFC as what about security?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Right. This is the question. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was Stephanie Tillinius,  VP of Google Commerce and Payments,  who said we're making a big bet on it, on NFC as a company.  There's a lot of potential there.  They wouldn't they wouldn't confirm any partnerships  particularly a partnership with Citibank.  But that's what they're going to have to do, right,  is have a big financial player get behind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Wasn't there a lot of hardware to be installed?  I mean, you know, every every vending machine, every parking lot,  every store register.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a lot. If it if it if it increases sales and increases profits.  Yeah. Which I'm sure it would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this this Wall Street Journal article says that they're going to make  an announcement tomorrow, which will involve a couple of retailers.  American Eagle, Subway, Macy's will have the ability to accept payments.  If this is true, this is this is how it's kind of funny, though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because how are you going to do it?  Maybe they'll give you a little card with some in it. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it is a passive chip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it just like an RFID? It just sits there.  Doesn't need power, does it? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so. I'm not sure.  I had my first NFC experience at Google I.O. thanks to Eileen,  who let me her Nexus S.  Yes, I got to write my NFC tags and a and a Googler who shall not be named  lent me an access to and said, oh, you're going to do NFC development.  That's interesting.  Yes, very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when you consider the added value that comes out of it,  you know, again, my argument is that they're looking for signals.  So Google will know more about what you buy, where you buy it.  And can offer great deals.  Use your NFC and get three percent off.  Use your NFC and get an extra, you know, whipped cream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, an interesting and little known feature of Google Latitude  is it has automated check ins.  So, you know, one of the pains with four squares every time I go somewhere  for a play this stupid game, and I am because Liz Romero stole  the mayorship of our new studios for me is  doesn't it suck you in, by the way?  I got it from I got the mayorship of the cottage, though, for my lane.  So I'm OK.  What was I saying? Oh, is that it's a pain.  You know, I feel I'm embarrassed. My wife says you're checking in. Yes.  Every time I go to a restaurant, you're going to check in, aren't you? Yes.  And so Latitude just checks you in automatically.  You could check a box and then when you get there, you're checked in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even more embarrassing, my wife, who knows I'm a creature of habit,  when I suggest going to like a new restaurant,  she'll be like, you just want to check in. You want a mayorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just want to check in.  And when a new restaurant opens, you want to be the first one there.  So you get the extra five points for creating the venue in the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  It's embarrassing. It's so embarrassing.  Biking mechanics. Honed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I never go to new restaurants because guess where I always go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chipotle. Yes. Don't say it.  Taco Bell.  We got a whole Chipotle up, you know, we got it because they're getting free  advertising. Yeah, OK, right.  So we got it.  We got it like use a code word for Chipotle so that when we say it,  people won't know. You know, so Wendy's.  And then that way, unless Chipotle buys advertising from now on, it's Wendy's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, I went to another Wendy's in New York this week  and they actually had the Torizo there, but a different place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it wasn't the one isn't the Wendy's we were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, it wasn't an extra Wendy's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody on Twitter is at Wendy's and just tweeted a picture of both  the the computer screen with the show up and the Wendy's burrito.  Oh, man. It's pretty.  This is dang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Boy, Wendy Wendy's is sure making Chipotle jealous.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm such a prostitute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To be honest, I don't want Wendy's advertising.  I wouldn't accept it. Really?  No, that stuff will kill you.  Oh, but it's good.  I went to Wendy's. We have standards here.  I went to Wendy's the other night, the actual Wendy's, not the pseudo.  I went to the actual Wendy's.  Not the Mexican Wendy's. Yeah.  There was no I was stuck somewhere and there was nothing else to eat.  Honeycomb.  It didn't taste pretty good, Leo.  Yeah, it tastes great.  The American way. Junk food tastes great.  Does.  Sound sound until about an hour afterwards.  That's when it tastes bad is later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's when you taste like regrets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it tastes like regret.  I love Krispy Kremes in the morning.  Taste like regret.  The galaxy tab that you and I have, Gina, will be shipped  next week with three point one on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Three point one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But now Zoom has three point one.  I, by the way, I stood around the Zoom display at Costco yesterday.  No, no, no takers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, the what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The zoom, you know, Motorola, the zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wait. Oh, nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to say, when you compare the 10 one, the Galaxy type 10 one to the zoom,  it's like there's nights like night and day.  Yeah. Motorola really missed the boat on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw some story.  Go ahead. Oh, sorry, Jeff.  No, I just I got onto my tab and was like, went to software update  and had to sign up for a Samsung account, which I hadn't done.  So I did that. No updates.  But I imagine that we'll get we'll get it soon, right?  Because the next couple of weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it was June 6th that it's supposed to come out.  So two weeks. Yeah. Yep.  Droid three coming out with a big, big, big keyboard for was a four  four, three inch screen, a big screen.  The details leaked.  Let's see what else Google says.  They're going to use seawater to cool their data center and Havana,  Havana, Havana, Havana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's they're going to get blamed for global warming.  I was going to say, we're going to boil the ocean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'll be good until the ocean evaporates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's interesting.  They they actually my first thought was like, wow, they're going to heat up  that whole gulf there, but they mix the outgoing warmer  water with existing raw seawater to get the temperature back down  to closer to the existing temperature so it doesn't disrupt  the environment on the way out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aren't they smart? Yeah.  But apparently it's a this is going to be in Finland.  And they bought a former paper mill which already had seawater tunnels.  They didn't have to do new tunnels, but they had to check them.  So they got an Android, I mean, a robot.  Maybe it was an Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was it an Android controlled robot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope so. To check the tunnels.  This is the first time anybody's used seawater to cool a data center.  Because, I mean, you got to clean it.  It's not easy. You got a corrosion issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I imagine it takes a lot of energy to pump that water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point. Right.  Well, that's why it probably only works in some places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's why the Google plan to have the the  the center data center that was actually on the ocean  where the waves were going to power it as well. Right.  And did they patent something like that?  I mean, it's really very cool. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's a big, you know, it's not merely environmental.  It's expensive. I mean, this is it's funny.  Nobody really thinks of the fact that every search you do costs a little bit of power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think about how hot your MacBook Pro gets and multiply that by like 10 million. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this kind of efficiency is very, very important.  No more offline Gmail and Google Chrome.  It's funny as they move closer and closer to the Chromebook,  they kill gears.  But Google doesn't maintain gears.  And so I guess they're they're taking offline mail out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're going to have the HTML5 offline version out.  They said early summer so soon.  I'm not sure why they didn't at least, if not create overlap,  do it kind of one version to the next.  But it looks like they just needed to have a cutoff point for the gear support  and then so that they can introduce the HTML5 offline version.  So there are going to be there's going to be a few weeks  where you can't do offline offline Gmail and Chrome.  And they actually recommend using the Firefox version.  Oh, no.  Document in the in the, you know, the Python help document,  you know, in the interim, which seems which seems off.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You read it's coming.  YouTube users now the nude stat upload  48 hours worth of video a minute, two days per minute.  Amazing. Three billion videos a day they serve up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's nutty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Six and YouTube is six years old now, so that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, that's just I would love to figure out how much  what the storage costs now, what it would have cost 10 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think YouTube is profitable?  Do they have ever broken that out of their in their financials?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't. I think they said it's profitable, though, didn't they?  I don't know.  But of course, what's the profit in many definitions of that?  They made a penny. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, you know what?  If you had YouTube and you made a penny a year, you'd be happy.  Yeah. Doesn't you know, as long as you don't lose a billion dollars  a year or a month or whatever, be hard not to.  I mean, that's a lot of storage, a lot of huge amount of bandwidth.  Three billion videos a day.  Uploads alone.  Forget the white. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Forget just the play at the playback. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody do some math in the chat room.  If it's 48 hours of video a minute, assuming that the video is kind of medium  quality video, how many gigabytes  or terabytes or petabytes a minute is that?  According to Forbes, Facebook's getting in the music business.  Now we got Google.  We got Amazon.  Sure. Surely we're going to have Apple any minute now doing a cloud service.  Facebook is an interesting player in all of this.  They're going to work with Spotify.  Now, that's Europe only, so maybe this won't be a US,  something we could do in the US.  Facebook is partnered with Spotify and a music streaming service  that can be launched in as little as two weeks.  According to Forbes, the integrated service is currently going through testing.  But when launched, Facebook users will see a Spotify icon  appear on the left side of their news feed, along with the usual icons  for photos and events clicking on the icon.  Will install the service on their desktop in the background.  Facebook's got it down in terms of, you know, making it easy for people  to kind of add these features to Facebook.  And then you can just be in your Facebook, which people already are.  Right. And listen to music. Millions of songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This this makes a lot of sense, right, especially with young people's music.  What you listen to the music they identify with is so much a part of your identity  and so much like defines your tribe and you want to know  what your friends are listening to. And this is this makes sense.  This makes a lot more sense than paying or even, you know, Amazon  or even Google Music.  A quick poll, which are you either of you two using Google music  regularly right now? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I uploaded almost seven thousand songs. Uh huh.  I'm using it. What do you mean using it? Actually listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you? Yeah. I mean, are you like reaching for when you get on your phone  and you want to listen to you, are you reaching for it as your kind of primary  music? What do you want to listen to music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So many ways that I can listen to music now.  I have a MOG subscription, MOG's on my Sonos, but I also have Pandora.  And I prefer to listen to those than the music I already have and know.  But I have to say the idea that I now have on any phone,  any Android phone or device that I pull out, I just log in  and I have access to my entire music collection.  I like that. Yeah, it is nice.  Nothing wrong with that. And it's free.  But where did I buy Gaga?  Amazon, right?  I didn't even bother downloading it. It's in my cloud. Right.  What do you think of this, Jeff Jarvis?  We both have college kids.  Peter Thiel is paying 24 college kids to drop out, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A hundred thousand bucks.  Jake told me that he almost applied. What?  Oh, oh, to have been there the moment you told your mother you wanted.  He would have been killed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's a mixed blessing, though, because that's  a significant amount of money you don't have to pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  Yeah, I mean, he told me that the application is not about the product.  It's kind of what you want to do in the world.  Which is interesting today, by the way, with Zuckerberg.  He was saying that he sees this very strange thing in Silicon Valley  where people decide that they want to start a company  before they know what they want to start.  And he said, it doesn't make any sense.  I think Thiel is the same way.  He's trying to say that you want to you want to change something,  you want to disrupt something, you want to fix something.  What is that?  And that's the driver. It's not starting a company.  I think he's right.  I think that if you if you look at the great successes,  they have all of them, but nothing of them made by dropouts.  It really makes me think that  the days when we had a draft,  how much innovation were we ruining by making you regimented  and putting you through college, how much we were ruining by making you regimented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I well, wait a minute, though.  Israel requires a military service of all of its young people.  True. And I can't I don't think you could say Israel is not a hotbed of innovation in the text.  That's true. You're right.  So I don't I think that that's I think we could say that's not the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the old draft dodger and me talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you a draft dodger?  No, I was 256. Yeah, me too.  I had a very high number in the I was in the I was  I was in the last I think the last lottery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was too. And and but but I had that argument with my I was ready to.  I was a bait in jail or Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wasn't going to Vietnam, that's for sure.  With all due respect to those who serve our nation, I guess.  Oh, true. I have no disrespect for you whatsoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For Gina, for Gina says, Oh, God, here go the old parts.  Yeah, I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember when beer, you had to use a can opener to open the can.  Remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hasn't been another Sinatra.  Has there been? Oh, no.  You could take your Michael Buble and.  Jaja stuff is just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just I'm a sponge.  I'm learning from my elders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just saying Gaga ain't no Jaja.  That's all I'm going to say.  We had stars in our day.  And that Conan can't light a candle to Merv Griffin.  Show title show title.  Gaga ain't no Jaja.  Half the Facebook walls have profanity.  What the?  Oh, fudge.  This was interesting. We kind of got the story on  Uber Media, Twitter and TweetDeck.  Twitter did officially close that for 40 million dollars.  Interesting article in Business Insider talking about  Bill Gross, who is a legend in this business  as an as a entrepreneur, as a businessman, a smart businessman,  kind of fumbling the deal for TweetDeck.  Uber Media was trying to buy TweetDeck, which would have given them  a significant percentage of Twitter traffic.  Foolishly, before the deals closed, he announced that he was  going to compete with Twitter.  Kind of a red. He announced it so much as it leaked.  Somehow it got out.  Apparently, he was he was messed.  I want to say dicking around with with TweetDeck.  And so TweetDeck, instead of closing the deal, and he was kind of trying  to get a better deal,  basically signaled Twitter of his interest.  Twitter swoops in and steals TweetDeck and saves the day.  I hope they keep TweetDeck alive.  I have to think, though, with their existing clients, they probably won't.  But at least they kept it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The stubbornness of Twitter makes me I'm using my iPad.  And it was the first conference I went to where I used to where it was good.  Good. As long as we got the irony of being the EG8 was, of course,  the Internet sucked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The questions were so frustrating.  The Internet connection was down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Sarkozy.  But they were just Twitter refuses to acknowledge, as much as they like  the fact that we all add in new features and conventions,  the RT, the way we'd like to use it, just amazes me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Doodle winner  depicting a doodle of life in space.  This was the contest they got a little trouble for because they were asking kids  for like what their their home address or something.  I don't remember. They were social security numbers, something like that.  I think I'm social, wasn't it?  It was the last four digits, right?  Last four digits. Oh, that's not verify unique identity.  The winner goes to seven year old Mateo Lopez of South San Francisco.  Is a hundred seven submissions, five million votes cast.  And it's like for a seven year old, that's a damn fine drawing, Mateo.  It really is. I put that on my fridge.  Wow. Kids today.  You have the feet. Kids today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the G is really good.  Both G's are good. The first G is particularly good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You were supposed to draw on the theme of what I'd like to do someday.  And of course, he's obviously wants either wants to be a little green man  or an astronaut.  I would guess the one in the middle.  That's that's nice. I like happy story.  We should end with that on a happy note. Yes. Yes.  Amazon offering a three G Kindle now for 164 ad supported.  I bought the one hundred fourteen dollars.  I think we talked about it. It's not not in any way intrusive.  Good deal. Recommend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me let me ask you about all right.  I you saw that John Malone is looking to buy Barnes and Noble.  And I'm trying to figure out why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why John Malone, who was was any Liberty Media?  He's a media mogul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's he's the he's the most barracudish,  toughest cable guy in an industry that's all tough.  And some say he wants the nook.  But I don't buy that.  You can come up with a device that has Android on it and make it in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it looks not even going to be a winner in the long run.  It's going to Google. I mean, Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I see some opportunity to attack Amazon.  That's fine. Barnes and Noble cost you a fortune.  I don't get it. I don't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it doesn't make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They want to buy up 70 percent.  Of course, Barnes and Noble is probably fire sale priced, right?  Seventeen dollars a share.  Well, that gives it a billion dollar value. Yeah.  They're betting Liberty Media Chairman  John Malone, chief executive Greg Maffei, told Investors  Money the potential for the nook platform  to become the ebook platform of choice for consumers.  No figure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a cable guy, so he thinks about distribution.  He thinks about controlling distribution.  But I know about so much of my head around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's that's misdirection.  That's not their plan.  Yeah. Liberty Media execs are hoping to gain popularity  with publishers who might not want Amazon to get too big.  I could be.  That could be.  And they said, retail stores aren't such a bad idea.  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says, Seth Goughton wrote a really good post about libraries  and how libraries, the value of libraries, librarian, blah, blah, blah.  And it was current to me after I wrote this post, I've written this up.  But you must think Barnes and Noble stores should become a place to browse,  becomes the third place you hang out.  You know what they should do? They should hire librarians.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Recommend books.  A good a good a good a good bookstore clerk is worth her weight in gold.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what Abby wants to do this summer is work in the bookstore.  Yeah, yeah. I say right on. Right on, sister.  He he says the strong store presence  will give the company's physical stores an enduring role.  What?  I mean, I love bookstores, but really, you think I mean, it's like saying,  you know, we'd like to buy that blockbuster company, too,  because we think VHS sales are going to go through the roof next year.  Holy cow.  I just want to make sure I get every major story.  I think we I think we've hit them all.  Good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Leo, sorry, just rewind for a second.  You think they're going to kill Tweetech Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, why would they keep it?  They've got the official Twitter app on all platforms now.  Right. I love Tweetech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems like they're looking to cater to the pro users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think it was a defensive buy.  I don't think it makes sense for Twitter to have two clients on any platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But like, what about if they market it as kind of like the power user client?  I mean, there's also Facebook and Buzz and Foursquare support and Tweetech.  I mean, you know, I don't know that they might kill that.  I love Tweetech.  I love Tweetech, too. I live in it.  It's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought maybe could go along with their analytics package  for the kind of the power user, the big organizations with lots of accounts.  And maybe that's just a wishful thinking, because I love it. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to give a quick thank you to Restoration Hardware.  Our furniture came.  Have you seen the have you been over to the studio and see the furniture?  It's so fun.  The we got the desks for the newsroom and they're just they're pre distressed.  They look like they look like something from France in the 18th century.  They're great.  And then we've got these other desks for the office desks are really cool.  They have like airline.  We were looking for something that really looked cool  for the new office to fit the kind of the deco retro look.  I just wanted to mention that there is a restoration.  We want to thank them and tell you about the Restoration Hardware app,  which is out for the iPad that gives you their full source book.  This is three hundred eighty four pages.  Actually, I have to download it.  I have the other one. I have the summer outdoor source book.  If you want to see the furniture we're getting and all the great stuff  at Restoration Hardware, I'm a huge Restoration Hardware fan.  We are so thrilled that they were able to help us out with our new studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they should do an AR version of it with your studio so you can see the items.  I will do it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You bet. I will do it for them.  They actually it's pretty it's pretty kind of interactive catalog.  OK, so you can look at something in the catalog, double tap it to zoom in.  And then there's that's kind of interesting.  I like that.  I want every time I look at the catalog, I want to buy something.  And then when you then the pages have zones that you can tap on to order  so you could pull up an order page is pretty cool.  I tell you, commerce is changing rapidly.  Thank you, Restoration Hardware, for your support of our twit cottage.  Don't forget, folks, to those twit bricks.  They're available at Brickstu as long as I'm plugging stuff for the cottage.  They're available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're going to be eating those Wendy's burgers right there on those chairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, too bad.  It would have been fun to have a little something else there.  But I guess we'll eat Wendy's burgers in the brick twit house.  Yeah, I'm kind of more of a fan of the Mexican, the down  you know, south of the border style.  But that's OK. Bricks.  I've enjoyed a good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  entry though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Charito.  It is time for our tip number and tool of the week,  starting with Gina Tripani and her tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've talked about Gmail Labs before, which are these experimental features  you can enable in Gmail.  Calendar has them as well.  So if you use Google Calendar, they don't roll them out as quickly  and there aren't as many as for Gmail.  But if you go into your Google Calendar settings, you can see there's a labs.  There's a lab section and there's a new labs feature called Next Meeting,  which tells you basically how many hours until the next scheduled thing that you have.  So I like. Yeah.  It's really neat. It shows on the sidebar.  I've got, you know, two two more hours till twig, which is nice.  You know, if I put on my personal productivity hat, it's a nice way to say,  like, what can I get done in two hours?  You know, so I won't start on a big project or maybe, you know,  what can I get done in a few minutes?  But there's a bunch of cool lab features in here.  Once you're in there, you should check them out.  Automatically decline events during certain times and, you know,  show me who schedule things with me.  If you're a big calendar user, definitely check them out.  But I like this next meeting, which really helps you kind of  like kind of plan out your day.  You know how much time you have until your next commitment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Love it.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Transcript:  My tool is really just a way to waste time.  I hope you don't mind.  But this was, you know, I tell you, if you if you haven't yet  put the Amazon App Store, I know it's a little hard on your Android phone  or your Android device.  Do because they they give away a free program every day.  And it's now part of my ritual in the morning to get up  and see what's free this morning.  And I've discovered so many great free Android apps.  Here's one that really works well on the tablet,  but you can also get for the phone. It's called Chalk Ball.  Did you try that yet, Gina?  No, I haven't. Oh, it's so much fun.  I'll play it. It sounds dangerous.  Yeah, see, there's the ball and you have to draw chalk to bounce the ball  and you have a limited amount of chalk.  So you're trying to bounce the ball, keep it alive.  If it falls off the screen.  See, I'm going to get a refill of chalk because I hit the hit the right thing.  If it falls off the screen, then you're kind of dead.  Now watch, I got to put a little chalk there.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, this looks dangerous.  It's deceptively fun and simple.  And but it's really it's really a great game.  It's called Chalk Ball and I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you tip the tablet, will it go the other way?  Oh, wouldn't that be good? No. Oh, you distracted me.  Sorry, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's a really it's kind of a very realistic.  It really feels like you're drawn on a chalkboard.  And it's kind of fun anyway.  It was free. I think it's a buck or something.  It's not expensive.  But but again, I just want underscore.  Get that Amazon Web Store on your Android phone.  You'll be glad you did.  I've downloaded a bunch of free crap.  Yeah, crack ball.
