Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, is this a Gastronomad trip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh my God. If you ever want to eat, drink, and be merry in an amazing place.  So Mike Elgin, as many people know, he was our news director for a couple of years.  I tied him down. Actually, I literally had to tie his leg down.  He's a nomad.  He's a nomad.  And made him live in Petaluma for two years with his wife.  But as soon as I let him go, he floated back up.  And he's now, he and Amira go all over the world. They've lived all over the world.  And they decided to make some use of that by creating these Gastronomad experiences.  If you go to gastronomad.net.  We did the one in Oaxaca. They said this is the last one they're going to do on Day of the Dead.  Although they will do Christmas next year.  In Oaxaca, Mexico, they do Provence.  Morocco is in multiple cities over two weeks.  There's the Oaxaca experience, Barcelona, Mexico City.  There, Prosecco is coming up.  And Provence, I think, I think it's, I think there's like a couple more seats left in the Prosecco.  It's a small group.  There were ten other couples, many of whom listened to it.  Hello.  Hello, all of you.  And we just had a blast.  They rented a villa.  We all were in the same villa.  And we did all these exclusive things, including my favorite, which was a cooking.  You would have loved this one, Stacey.  So Amira never tells us what we're going to do the day of, which drove Lisa crazy.  Oh yeah, that would drive me nuts.  What do I wear? What do I bring?  Nope. Just, she says, wear comfortable shoes.  I like that. That's how it should be.  Some people, well, most of the people loved it.  I was neutral.  Lisa was going, errr.  So we just, all they say is, you know, have breakfast, we'll meet you downstairs at nine.  Alright.  Get in the van. We show up at the big open-air market.  There's several in Oaxaca.  Oaxaca's a big foodie town in Mexico.  So we go to the open-air market.  And we are met by Chef Alejandro Ruiz.  Chef Alex, who is the best known.  He's actually put Oaxaca cuisine on the map.  He has three restaurants. He has a hotel.  But he's also trained.  And Mike has stayed in his home, right?  Yeah, they're friends.  I didn't know who he was.  But as we're going through the market with him  and his amanuensis, who was carrying bags  and loading them with food,  people go, are you with Chef Alex?  Is that Chef Alex?  He's like a celebrity.  So we shopped for like three hours.  We stopped and we had tacos at Doña Vale's,  which is apparently also famous because it was on Netflix, Street Food.  And so they cleared out the seats, even though it was jammed.  And we sat down.  Then we went out to Chef Alex's boyhood home  where he's built this complex  including a, they call them fire kitchens.  It's all wood fired.  Big kitchen with lots of workstations.  We cooked for hours.  Among the things that we did while cooking was  at one point Chef Alex says,  okay, it's time to go get grasshoppers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Wait, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That was kind of my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wait, what?  So we all go out to the...  We have shoes to stomp on them.  Well, I wish we don't. I would have worn my grasshopper hunting shoes.  So we went out into the herb gardens.  Apparently these grasshoppers taste like whatever they eat.  Oh, okay.  Chicken.  So, chicken, that's it.  Tastes like chicken.  So we go out, let me show you.  I'll show you pictures of us.  Let's see, these are, we have tons of pictures  because Mike took tons of pictures.  This is all in the kitchen.  That's Chef Alex in the Mercantile.  That's Chef Alex in the Mercado as we are shopping.  Let me see if I can find the grasshopper.  There's a lot of pictures.  Here's Lisa with her grasshopper.  So you catch these little buggers.  There I am.  See the bag? Full of grasshoppers.  So,  so,  so you catch these grasshoppers and they roast them  and then they put them on top of the guacamole.  It's part of the cuisine.  We made mole, 31 ingredients.  Oh my god.  Chocolate, coffee,  mole, mezcal.  That's all we did all week.  Was incredible.  Highly recommended.  These grasshoppers were in the hierba de conejo  which is bunny herbs

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  and that's I guess what they tasted like.  Bunny herbs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did you eat them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh yeah. You know what?  It's so much part of the cuisine.  When you go to the market there's like  baskets of them. Giant baskets of them.  It didn't bother me.  Look, you're drinking so much mezcal that you could eat anything.  Yeah, you could eat anything.  Here's what the wood fired  stove, one of the stoves looks like.  They're really, wow,  Pixel 6 by the way. Great camera for this stuff.  Really had a good time.  You took a 6 plus, right? 6 plus.  Pro, not plus. Pro.  Pro, pro, pro.  Yeah, got a lot of great pictures.  It was really fun.  Anyway, I don't want to bore people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I wouldn't. Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Everywhere, fresh tortillas, gorditas.  This is, it was a day of the dead  so they have a lot of day of the dead  skulls and  things. This is the giant kitchen area.  There's Lisa. Oh, we built  like three of friendas. Literally.  Three of them. Wow. I believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  altar where your ancestors  come back to visit  with you. Oh my god.  Your pictures look good, sir.  This was, thank you from you.  That's high praise, I appreciate it.  This was the iPhone fix-it guy in the Mercado  in case you had any fix-its  you needed to have done.  Anyway, it was a lot of fun. Thank you for asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What was his thoughts on the right to repair?  I did not ask about the right

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  to repair.  Mostly it was, I was only  asking about the right to eat more chocolate  was what I was asking about.  It was so much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was the best thing you ate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, these  Dona Vale. So Dona Vale,  it's a little just street  vendor. She's making, there she is  making the tacos.  And this is the Mercado.  These were  amazing.  But everything was fantastic.  It was just fantastic. She's been there  for years. Look at that, Stacey. Look at these  blue corn tortillas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Dude, that image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is Mike. Mike was  he had an A7-3  and he took a lot of great pictures. Beautiful.  Isn't that great?  It's all wood fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would like to not be  here and I would like to go to there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's Chef Alex showing us a  pepper. My job  was to strip  the peppers of their seeds and stems so  that we could just eat them. I said,  well, let's leave them in. He said, no, it's too hot for you.  Don't do that. So hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So hot. He's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Not for you, Yankee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't think so.  So big plug for  Gastronome and Dead Net.  They're small groups. Amira  only does this in places where she knows everybody  and knows all the  foodies. Food and wine.  If you're at all interested,  highly recommended.  It's not expensive for what you get.  It's all inclusive.  Not even tips.  They wouldn't let us tip.  It was really fun. That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Transcript:  You get three things.  You get a clock on your tweet with a little  rotation so you can think better of it.  You can't edit it, but at least you can pull it  back before it goes into the news.  But all that means is they just stop posting it.  That's all they do it. That's it.  Two is it's scroll brought to life  in that links to  various publishers like the Washington Post  from the Twitter feed  will go there without ads.  It doesn't get you around the paywall or anything.  It goes to an ad free experience for that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And some of the revenue goes to those publications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yes, absolutely. Absolutely.  And then three is  the return of a form of  Nuzzle. So hot news is  whatever your  people you follow on Twitter have been  linking to. So that's what got me.  I miss Nuzzle.

Transcript:  Top Articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Okay. I don't know what I'm seeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is why, to me  this is why I'm not a fan of Twitter.  It's a little random. But anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you follow Chris Salisa, you deserve

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  what you get. I deserve what I get.  You're exactly right. Top Articles?  This is the new Nuzzle? Top Articles?  Yes. Okay. So these are  This is because people I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's the same as mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Because you know  you follow the same people I do  probably. Scroll some more.  I don't care about the Goddard School District ordering 29  books removed from circulation.  I don't even know where Goddard is.  How the media missed a New Jersey  Senate candidates racist social  media posts.  Malala got married. Okay.  That's nice. Yeah, it's nice.  Mark Ruffalo and  Jonathan Scott have electile dysfunction.  Skip.  Real earnings summary.  Don't know. CNN  poll skip. 51 month  sentence for QAnon Shaman.  Oh yeah, that was interesting.  They're going through the  I guess that's what you call throwing the book at them.  And we'll see if he gets it  if they get it. But that's what the prosecutors are  asking for. So these are  This is Nuzzle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're saying. It's Nuzzle limited to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not as good as Nuzzle was  because I had different things.  But these are articles most shared in  my network of people. Can I change  it's only last 24 hours.  There's no there's no settings. It looks like  for this. But that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm going to give it a try for a month. I love  Nuzzle. For having Nuzzle like  features, that's worth three bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The best feature is look at my  look. I made my Twitter feed purple.  And I have a new Twitter  icon. How about that?  Ain't that cute. That's worth three bucks by itself.  Three bucks a month.  I have good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  stories in mind. Oh, good.  I have Chris Dixon on the future  of crypto, although that's so old. The Verge  is background policy, which good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have that at the top of mine. I don't even know why I  care about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Verge is editorial policy. It's actually a really  good policy. We can talk about it if  you want to. On background means

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  you're talking to somebody, but you're not going to quote

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  them. Yeah, but  a lot of times, I have been getting  pushback like Amazon, Google are  famous for this. They'll just  on background, I'll bring up an issue.  And then they give you the most  jargony, stupid, non-answer.  And I'm like, that's not effing anything.  That's just  how it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I clicked that, by the way, and now I got a  special on top.  Blue, here's the Verge without any ads.  Start reading PS. Ad-free articles doesn't include  paywall access right now. So this is  the ad-free version, which I'm getting  anyway because I use an ad blocker. But still,  I'm glad the Verge gets some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they could incorporate paywall stuff,  I mean, I have 50  million subscriptions. But if  I could subscribe to Twitter Blue for  like 10 bucks a month and click on all  the articles that I'm interested in, that's actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  a really interesting proposition. So you'd pay more  if it were more complete,  more comprehensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I can't seem to put into practice. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  normal people would if you paid like

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you think normal people pay even three bucks  for Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you could get access to the news articles  that people are tweeting, yes.  Because then it becomes like  your gateway to all the media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's what your old buddy, O'Malek, has to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This will be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This will be good.  He says, when you subscribe, I did.  You'll get additional icon on the right-hand menu  that says top articles. I like the conversation  panel that opens up when you highlight  the article before clicking on the link to read it off  Twitter. The ad-free  readings thus far  underwhelm me. There were three articles  in my entire 24-hour top news  articles timeline. Okay, so we obviously  are getting more. Maybe it just hasn't  kind of  worked out yet.  Notice, though, it wasn't just people we were  following. It was people we were following  divided by the publications  that would allow it to be ad-free,  which meant there was a lot of junk  in there, a lot of chaff in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  for me. Well, mine is looking okay so far.  It's pulling up a lot of college football  stuff because tis the season for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  O'me says, despite  the shortcomings, I'm willing to try this new offering  at least for six months. After all, like  most of us, I don't want to sign up for  individual magazine or newspaper subscriptions.  I'm surprised  that O'me does not, because you  and I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but if you think about it, I pay  probably  at least $1,000 a year in subscriptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Me too. New York Times,  Washington Post, The Atlantic,  The New Yorker,  Bloomberg.  The information  alone is $400 a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I stopped that. I got rid of the information  this year. I found Bloomberg way

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  more interesting and relevant. Bloomberg's  expensive. It's even more, but it's worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's $400. It's the same as

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the information. Is it the same? Oh, okay. I was paying  the monthly, which is like $39.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Woo!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Woo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  After all, the bigger question O'me writes  remains unanswered. What percentage  of 397 million Twitter users  will pay, this is my question too,  will pay $36 a year for these premium  features. I think people in our business  will. Yeah. It won't be  easy. Yeah, I think it's a small thing. Yeah, it's hard to get  people to pony up for something they perceive  they've been getting for free. Tell me about  it. I know all about that. Nevertheless,  Twitter should stick with it, says O'me,  because in time people will start to see value  in this premium upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so. And if they get enough  people who matter, so journalists actually  matter. You know you reach journalists  on this platform and you can push stories,  right? Who will then write  about your stories? You could see  some sort of media  subscription come from that, and that's  worthwhile. Or Twitter also  has their newsletter thing. So maybe  as an individual newsletter person,  if I write something really awesome,  I would love the chance to get a little bit of money  from people reading it, you know.  How would this affect the  subscription?  Well, unless Twitter did  a deal with Substack. Yeah, how would it affect all

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  of the independent folks out there using  Medium and Substack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's say if I had  a publication and I charged people $5  a month for it, and then  maybe some, and I had this, and I was doing it  through, I can't, what is Twitter's newsletter  platform? Does anyone remember what they buy?  No idea.  Whatever their platform is.  If I  had my regular subscription base,  but then I did something that's a little bit more general  interest and people wanted to read it,  I could  maybe click a button and Twitter would make it available  through that and they could share some revenue back  from the virality of it. That would be  really interesting. Look at what Aaron Rupar

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  is doing on Twitter. It's kind of  interesting. He did, he's  a journalist, just started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He is great. He watches  all the Fox News stuff, the Trump  stuff and everything else and pulls up the videos.  He's invaluable. He watches  so you don't have to. Twitter is the perfect medium

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  for him. He just started a brand new newsletter. So he  tweeted the Rittenhouse trial,  live tweeted it, and then said, I'm  tapping out for now, but if you appreciate it,  check out my newsletter. For him,  there's a lot of value.  Twitter is kind of the perfect medium  for what he did with that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He is perfect for that because he pulls  videos of everything and  makes it terribly shareable. Aaron  is, he deserves  battle pay for what he does.  So we all don't have to watch what he watches,  but he's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But will this pull people off of Facebook  for their news, you think?  No. Twitter,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  to me, Twitter is a very specialized audience.  I mean, 300-some million  people tells you right there.  Twitter is far better for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for news than Facebook.  It's for us.  I don't get news from Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're the exact audience for Twitter,  but that's not a big audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Listen,  what's gotten us in trouble  is scale for scale's sake,  scale for scale alone, to be  as big as possible. I agree.  This is why I get so excited

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  about Project Blue.  To me, Twitter is not niche enough.  Well, that's why Blue

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  matters, not this Blue, but the Blue  Sky matters, because  if the speech layer becomes  commodified, but the curation,  selection,  confirmation,  authority layer becomes  selective and you can pick who you want to define  just the stuff you want, then maybe  MirableDict2, you'd stop

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  complaining. Wouldn't it be interesting  if somebody explained what MirableDict2 means?  No, wouldn't it be interesting? No, I know what it  means. Wouldn't it be interesting?  PhoenixWarp suggests this, I think.  He's saying it may also filter out  the crap on Twitter, just like our Discord.  No one's going to pay to troll and just  tweet out crap. But right now, I'm seeing  stuff from people who pay and not pay.  Wouldn't it be nice to have a setting that said only  Twitter Blue people? Then it really becomes a niche.  I think they might get there. But you gotta wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  to get enough. Right now, it's 10 people.  That's definitely maximizing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's just me, Jeff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and Stacey. It's not 10 people, it's like a hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Tony Hale,  Tony Hale alone, is worth  $2.99 a month. Tony was the founder  of Scroll and Chartbeat before that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, they bought, okay, they bought Scroll.  And I've been seeing, that's one of the benefits  of Twitter Blue. What is Scroll?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Scroll was intended  to say to publishers,  you're losing people,  you're losing money to ad blockers,  you're never going to get money from them.  What we can do instead is we can offer  a group subscription, basically,  where somebody can come in and they'll get  an ad-free experience legit,  and you'll get a cut of the revenue.  Tony never said it was going to solve every problem  in the news industry, but it was going to be helpful.  It was going to give them money they weren't getting.  And so, but he,  trying to get all the publishers to sign up was  torture. So,  he got a lot of them, but still.  So then Twitter bought him and acquired  him, his brains, and his team.  And they included that Scroll-esque  feature into Twitter.  But again, all it does is give you,  I already subscribed to the Washington Post.  So I now get a page without ads on the Washington Post.  I actually be fine with the ads on the Washington Post. They're not awful.  I don't subscribe anymore to the Atlantic  because it overdosed me.  And so if I go to the link  to the Atlantic, I'll still hit  my two a month and you're done,  Bob. But I'll get them without ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This is definitely getting better for me.  The more I scroll,  it's just putting it more. You just turn it on.  Yeah. It's definitely getting better.  Of course, I see a lot of Twitter content on there,  but I'm seeing a lot of tech news in here now.  In addition to  top stories from top articles.  Okay. Yeah. This is so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So there's something on the right of top  articles. I guess that Scroll conversation.  Oh, I don't know. I didn't even look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, I guess that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh, not that's cool.  That's for each article. So click on an

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  article. You see the conversation about it.  The conversation. Oh, dude. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  something that Nuzzle did not have. And I kind  of like it. Yes, it did. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nuzzle, you could see. Well, you'd see all the names,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  but you wouldn't see it scrolling like this.  But this is much better.  This is good. This is good. This gives you some context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah.  Some context. Here's Jason Howell.  So I do feel

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  like this is an improvement  in the Twitter  experience.  So far, I don't mind spending

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So good on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a nice price point.  Three bucks a month.  So far, I don't mind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I mean, the Washington Post subscription  for me was about the same price,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe, because of prime. Four bucks a month,

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think. 450 or something. And I got nothing  out of it. But this is so much  more meat.  Now, here's what happens. Do you like the Washington  Post? I got nothing out  of that subscription. I would pull it up  and it was almost like  doom scrolling. Everything was just

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  sad news. I'm a little  disappointed by the Washington Post, too. I agree with you.  But I don't do that  for the Times either. Just go to their site  and scroll through it. But I pay  for it because when individual articles show up  in the other feeds, then  I want to be able to see that  without a paywall. And I think  I'm up enough in tech meme and other  things that I'm going to see those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Leo, scroll down on the left  side until you find  Washington Post or Verge, one of those.  Under top articles?  Under top articles. You'll see a blue bar  that says ad free with Twitter blue.  So click on the article.  Because you probably have an ad blocker  anyway. No, we already did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh yeah, absolutely. You did that already. I lost my internet for this.  Remember that's why I was showing you the pop-up that said  you're getting this ad free. Sorry, I lost my internet for this.  He was tweeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I  wasn't. I was screaming that I just  spent a... By the way, how do I look  in one gig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Good. It's actually better,  isn't it? He's still yellow.  He's not as... Well, no, he was pink before.  No, you can't.  One gig converts you to yellow,  which is good. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  those of us who pay for one gig would prefer to call it  gold. Gold.  Daylight's balance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  You look good. You're smooth and  frame rate's good. But you're saying you dropped  out? Can you dance for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I dropped out. They were supposed to give me eight boxes  to replace my boxes. I got two  of the eight. They were supposed to come Friday. They now say  Friday. Whoever told you Friday? No Friday.  They're supposed to do all this last Tuesday. They didn't do  much of it. I'm screaming on the phone.  But hey, I look better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I will say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was that you screaming on the corded telephone?  Show everybody that in case they

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  forgot what those were. You have a corded telephone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That thing was awesome. Just pick that up. It was like...  Holy cow! Where'd you get

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  that? Was there an antique  store in Bedminster? What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's our thumbnail. This is my land

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  line, children. My land  line. Land line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What is this land...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want to hear this weird thing? It's called  a dial tone.  What's a dial tone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I will say Twitter  is still the place to go for

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  customer service. How would you figure

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that? Oh yeah, I just did that  with... Lisa, we had  when Tesla...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  With Solar City, we got our solar panels from Solar City  now at Tesla Company. And we didn't know  it, but at the time, they installed  decorative triangular solar panels  that aren't actually  solar panels. And you can see, this is a picture,  the regular solar panels look fine,  but the one... the cosmetic  solar panels are starting to look  terrible. Yeah, that might be a  problem. So we called and called  and that's how we found out they're  cosmetic, but then we never heard from... So finally  Lisa tweeted the next day they came and took

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  them. Yeah, I agree with you on  that. If you want something done, tweet them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that, while  Elon Musk is busy destroying  his stock in Twitter. So  that was pretty good. They could do two things  at once. I thought that was impressive.  Very impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Elon, what a character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Wow. How often  is he fined for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Very rarely.  Which is surprising. He's fined with a lot.  He should be fined more often,

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think. That's what gets  me. He's like, this dude should be writing  a lot of checks.  Because a lot happens just based on what

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  he tweets. And yet, and this  show was on Twitter,  it was on Twitter where somebody  had called him a BSer  who delivers. Yeah.  And that's the thing. I mean,  the Dragon re-entry, the crew survived,  crew two is doing great, and now they've  already turned it around for the next launch.  So it's kind of like... You gotta give them that.  But don't necessarily  follow his cryptocurrency picks.  Speaking of which... Pump and dump,  maybe. Pump and dump.  Well, actually, I don't think he's even doing that. I think he  just enjoys watching  his stock price and his doge... Well, he's also  paying a tax bill.  So he's going to trade in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  10 billion dollars. He knew what was going  to happen. He goes on Twitter and says, should I sell...  Hey, they're complaining about us not paying taxes  on our assets.  Should I just sell 10 trillion?  You know what's going to happen? People are going to say, yeah. So he's going to say,  I followed the market. I sold the 10 trillion.  He has like a 10 trillion tax bill due.  10 billion. I know.  But when it gets that big, what difference does it make?  And so it was all good. But he also depressed his  stock just as he was selling it, which I guess  means you can't accuse him of insider trading when he  does that.  Man, he's scurting it though, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Somebody did tweet, wouldn't it be nice  if instead of having to take a Twitter  poll on whether you should pay your taxes, if  Congress actually made billionaires pay their taxes?  Right. Imagine that.  So Twitter...  This was a little reported story,  is getting into crypto as well.  They've hired Tess Renerson.  She just tweeted, I'm thrilled to share I've  joined Twitter to lead a new team  focused on crypto, blockchain,  and other decentralized  technologies. Is she part of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Project Blue or what was it, Blue Sky?  It's unclear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But what...  So what is... I mean, this is  Jack Dorsey in a nutshell, right? He's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You put your tweet on  the blockchain, you're never going to be able  to edit it, sucker.  It's there forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's going nowhere. We will be working  closely with the Blue Sky team  to help shape the future of decentralized  social media. Twitter  crypto will underpin all this  work and serve as a center of excellence for all  things blockchain at Twitter.  Oh, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they're going to build their own blockchain?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  First, we'll be exploring how we  can support the growing interest among creators to  use decentralized apps  to manage virtual goods and currencies  and to support their works in communities. This is  my only problem with blockchain and FTs  and crypto is I understand the  words, but I  don't understand what it means.  Where it's applying.  We'll be figuring out what crypto can do for Twitter  as well as what Twitter can do for crypto.  Oh.  Hubris.  Ask not what Twitter can do  for crypto.  Twitter truly gets crypto.  Hello Bitcoin tipping and NFTs.  But there's so much more to explore here.  She has excellent credentials  as an early proponent of crypto.  Has worked on a lot of interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the head of  Blue Sky  also has great credentials.  That's right.  I'm very excited about Blue Sky.  I think that there's a next generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the one thing  that I guess makes sense to me is  blockchain is essentially about  a decentralized ledger.  A decentralized record.  So I guess it makes sense  if you're talking about a decentralized social network  that there might be some sort of synergy between  blockchain. I'm not sure exactly  how that would work.  But it does make  sense. For instance  we have a Mastodon instance.  That's a federated social media. Looks  just like Twitter. Twitter.social.  There is one, no  one central server on that.  Everybody who runs a server  as we do, has their  copies of their  content that their users have created.  Which then gets shared to other people.  It's truly federated.  Without a centralized core. You don't need  blockchain to do that.  I don't know how blockchain would enhance that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's what I want to know. What's the point  of it? We already have federated  social in place that's working

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  just fine. Email is federated really.  Look how well that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin Topol is telling me he thinks it's  going to be a Twitter crypto wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Which is another  problem because  it's hard enough just to get bitcoin  in a wallet that's  for the masses and then you have some  other blockchain that people know nothing  about. That's what's going on with all the NFTs  because there's so many different  chains out there. You can buy an NFT  over here but you can't buy that same one  over there unless you have this wallet, this token  and so on. It's too

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  much. Jack Dorsey's other company  Square has already announced it's making a  hardware wallet  for bitcoin. So you can lose

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it? I keep forgetting that he

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and Square like  you know. That makes

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  sense. I mean bitcoin, crypto makes a lot of sense  in Square. Square, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yo, I have some issues.  I cannot work my phone.  No!  Your brand new Pixel 6?  My brand new  Pixel 6. I'm trying  to listen to y'all but I'm having a hard  time. I'm trying to. Try this.  This works so well

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  for me. Just press  and hold the volume up and down button.  There's one button. Press and hold both  ends of that and just keep holding that.  Just try. See what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want it to make a loud noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I did this  during Windows Weekly and all of a sudden  it's reading. The screen reader comes on.  Talkback comes on. I can't figure out how to turn it off  because everything I touch.  I couldn't.  I had to turn off my mic and just stop  participating in Windows Weekly.  So don't do that Stacy because we want you  to be part of the show. What's wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  with Stacy? I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Let's take a break. I'm going to do  an ad. We will help Stacy Higginbotham  with her brand new  Pixel 6 Pro when we come back.  See that's Google. That is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's some Google. It is.  And it's helpful. It just took us 33 minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  to get there. There's some actual Google in this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This week in Google  Pixel 6 Pro.  That Mezcal man. We haven't talked about Google  yet. It sticks with you for quite a while.  I think the idea is you go around all the time  with a shot glass and whenever somebody  is around you they pour Mezcal into it.  It's just it never, it's always there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've long said it should be a controlled  substance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We went to one place. There's three ways you can make  Mezcal industrial which is how most liquor is made.  In big stainless steel vats.  There's traditional.  Which is a little more traditional. You have a donkey  stuff. I don't know.  Donkey does something.  I don't want to know. And then there's  Ancestral which is everything's clay and it's  really like how it used to be made 150  200 years ago. So we went over to an Ancestral  place and the Mezcalero  which is what you call the guy who makes Mezcal.  He's wearing a cowboy hat. It looks just like John Lovitz.  Just imagine John Lovitz in a cowboy hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mezcal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But happier.  And he's got a giant  funnel. I mean like a gallon

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  funnel. And he's got his  finger over the tip right. And he  just goes around and everybody goes Mezcal?  And he takes his finger off.  Mezcal? Because I guess  the reason for the funnel is this just came  out of the distillery. Out of the  stills. So he captured it  in his giant funnel.  Did he wear a mask?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Don't they usually spit in?  This was your

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  bottle of Gastronomad

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Mezcal? I did. I have it.  It's wonderful. Well I haven't opened it yet.  The other thing that happened at the same  Ancestral  it was Mezcal  de Los Angeles.  The angels. I don't know.  They had a medicine  man come around and cleanse us.  So they burnt this incense and they blew  incense up and down our bodies. And then he  wiped us off with  herbs and stuff.  And he said by the way

Transcript:  he comes around and spits  Mezcal down your front  and the back as part of the cleansing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No no no no no no no. Yeah there's a picture.  No. That's more like it.  This is so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  absurd. You're wearing the mask  and someone is spitting on you.  It's 50% alcohol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's 100 proof so there's no COVID  in that. But I was a little damp  for the rest of the day.  What's the point?  It's a tradition. It's an ancient  tradition. We also faced each  tradition.  We each faced each direction.  Let's make

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the Yankees look really dumb.  Convince them this is a tradition.  Tradition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Tradition.  It was actually great fun. And no  when in Rome  actually Lisa said  no Mezcal down my front.  But I thought I'm going to play the game.  I'm going to do the whole thing. Of course you would.  I wanted to do it.  Our show today Vicki brought to you  by Melissa.  Not by Mezcal  but by Melissa.  You know like  Mezcal or milk  in your fridge.  After a while it goes bad.  In fact 30% of customer  data in your customer list goes bad  every year. Did you know that  the nearly 36 million address  changes were processed by the postal service  last year alone?  36 million!  And those are the people on your  contact list, your  Christmas card list, your  catalogs,  all the mailings you're doing.  30% could be  going to the dead letter office. That's no good.  Melissa can help make sure your data is  accurate and current.  In fact Melissa has been in the business for  35 years. 10,000 businesses.  The address experts  and people who use Melissa love it.  In fact they are a renewal rate of  That's because  the average typical  return on investment realized by Melissa  customers is 25%.  They save 25% because  they stop mailing to people who don't exist.  They get rid of duplicates. Yes,  Melissa's data matching can eliminate  clutter and duplicates, increasing the accuracy  of your database and reducing  postage and mailing costs.  And by the way it's not just addresses.

A lot of Melissa's customers use their  incredible API to build this into their  customer service software, to build  this into their shopping carts.  Because you know honestly a lot of times  the addresses get misentered.  You know for a long time I  swapped the numbers on our street  address. So even your customers could be  doing this. And then you can even get information  to complete your customer profiles better.  Public demographic info  like marital status, social media handles.  It really helps you  do better to help  your customers. And it saves you a  lot of money. How does Melissa work?  Well it's very flexible. There's an on-prem  software solution. There's a web  service. They even have a  secure FTP site you can upload and download  from. You can use software  as a service delivery. They have a new  Lookups app. Check it out on IOS  and Google. You can enter in addresses,  names and more at your fingertips and fix  that. 1Z2Z. But  probably the best way to do it is with their API.  You can just incorporate it  right into your software. And don't worry  Melissa treats your  customer records as they  should be treated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what do you mean you changed your address  numbers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So we are at 2-9-9-1  I would constantly type in 21-19  Oh I see.  When we first moved there. No it's not on purpose.  No no no no. Stupidly.  And stuff was getting misdelivered

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  all the time. I screw up the studio address.  I go with 54  because that's the zip code here. Yeah.  And when it should be 51.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Apple thought that's maybe why I didn't get  the laptop but I checked and no they had the right address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I do that every single time.  So that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  why you need Melissa. That's all I can say.  Big Bill coming to Google.  The EU antitrust fine  billion dollars Google appealed  and lost. This is such  an old case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's such a ridiculous case. There's other things to go  after Google on. The ad business. You can go  after Google on antitrust. But the shopping

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  case? Well but this  it's a 10 year old case. That's why it takes  a while to wind its way through the course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Even when it was done it wasn't. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They don't even do Google shopping anymore.  But the contention was that Google  favored its own  shopping service in its search results.  You know  at the time we tried it. It didn't seem to be  the case. But I think it's safe  to say that it does sometimes look like  Google's YouTube is at the top or  if they still had Google shopping  it would be at the top. Amazon does

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  the same thing on its platform. Well everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  does it. But if you're supposed to be  an agnostic search engine  your search results. Whoever said that they were?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whoever said that they were they had  to be. That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah good point. You know.  It's anti-competitive because  if you have a you know  and this is by the way how this case came up is  that a couple of  pretty tiny shopping  services went out of business  because Google didn't rank them highly  enough. It's been a while since I've read the details  Yeah some of them were

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it was really hard to tell the difference between just a link farm  and a real shopping service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well and that was Google's contention.  Those guys weren't. They were just  link farms. They were just links to  results.  And yeah they're going out of business but fine.  Anyway 2.42  billion euros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's no further appeals.  That's it. It's done.  And now the EU is  energized. We got them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's see  what else here.  They're taking the dislike button  away on YouTube. That was announced this morning.  That's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like this. I'm old enough to remember when  people were clamoring to have  it. To have

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the dislike button? You mean they didn't  used to have it? Oh I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They didn't have it and then they wanted it because they said I don't want  to just react to things. I want to be able  to say no to things. But of course then that brings out animus  and bile from people.  Like the  anger button on  Facebook. And so with  experience you learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Why do you like it Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like it because  I think things that produce less  negativity. Like here's the deal.  I think we're so polarized as  a company or as a  people.  Even seeing things like  I feel like there's people who feel like it does  something to watch these crappy videos and  down vote them or be  negative about them.  But I just don't think it's a  signal that's being used properly.  Like you're not doing anything  and you're just adding more negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's still alive on mine.  Although supposedly it's going away pretty quickly.  There's the thumbs up. I like this.  And five people didn't like  last week's show and said  I dislike this.  I don't even know.  I think you're right. You know the only  time that I can really remember the dislike button  being used was on Google's own  Google YouTube

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  rewind. The YouTube rewind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Because it was so much more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the thing. People will  go in and do these campaigns  to down vote things. That's part of the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  isn't it? Yeah. Like vaccines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know. Ah! Down vote!

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Down vote! So look this is  the rewind 2018. It had  3 million likes  and 19 million dislikes.  And I think it was  so embarrassing because Google hired Will Smith  and it was so embarrassing  that Google never did  another rewind. In fact they announced this year they were going to do it again.  So maybe that's why they got rid of the dislike button.  I think it is.  Facebook doesn't have a thumbs down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have an anger  button. And part of the Facebook  documents was that  the anger button got more  juice  than the thumbs up.  I just listened to a great  Mike Mazdick podcast  just today.  They said well they didn't say  in the media reports were number one  that all the other like ones got  more juice because they were new buttons.  And number two where they discovered  that the anger button was  getting too much juice they reduced it to like zero.  They fixed it.  But I think if you  give people the opportunity to express  negative feelings  there must be finding  that it  has other impact. So good if  they learn fine. But if all we  can do is like things. I agree with Stacey. We gotta  be grumpy sometimes right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  There's two things on this. There's  the creators perspective and  there's the consumers perspective or  content consumer perspective.  As a creator sometimes it's nice  to have those signals to see  what's working and what's not working.  So you can make sure you're putting  the content out there that not only your  existing audience enjoys but  potentially growing audience can  enjoy. And from a  viewer's perspective I  like to have that button so I'm not recommended  stuff that I'm not interested  in. The same way Netflix  works for me. What if

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yelp or  Amazon reviews took out  the negatives?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That would be a problem.  That would be a problem. So much bad stuff out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is just a fast  indicator and it  can be used to game things so easily.  If you really dislike something you  will leave a comment. Let me assure you  that people will read it all the time. But who reads YouTube comments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I believe they mention that

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  the button will still be available  privately for the creator to see  what people are  clicking that they don't like it.  It's just not necessarily showing up  publicly as 19 million  people disliked it versus

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  3 million people. So the button is still there  you just won't be able to see the count and the  creators will be able to track dislikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were punditing without  knowing. Gosh.  Dislike.  But that's useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  stuff. That's exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  why I don't like this show.  You know why

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't like this show?  Because you're not helping me with my phone.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We were supposed to help Stacy  with her Pixel 6. Did you get the  what color did you get first of all? This is  most important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sea foam with the fancy sea foam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I got orange shirt. Or the rain back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I went with the white. So we got all three colors.  What did you get Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I will be getting some white black.  That's what I thought. Black.  That's what I wear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what is the process.  You have an existing Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have an existing Android phone.  So the finger thing. The process

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  is set up which was I thought very  good. It involved connecting  a USB-C cable to the old phone.  Very quickly copied everything over.  I thought that was a very easy way to set up.  They've gotten rid of  it's too bad because the Samsung  Flip for instance uses  the fingerprint reader on the  screen on off.  I really like that feature.  And I prefer fingerprint reader face ID  in the day and age of masks.  But what is the problem with it.  People have been complaining about the fingerprint reader but actually  I found it to be quite  I said  Okay so the big problem  is if you're not paying attention  it's fussy about you got to really hit it  the right place and the right pressure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And you actually have to put pressure on it.  That's what I'm finding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I turned off my haptic feedback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh that's going to make it hard.  That's going to make it hard.  I realize that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hate having haptic when I touch my phone  because I hate my phone like having this  like touching like a sea urchin  or something.  It's alive.  Okay so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A sea urchin phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But both Paul Theron  and Mary Jo Foley were complaining about the  unpredictability of the  fingerprint. I haven't found that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's say I'm hanging out here  okay every time I'm doing stuff  it's like so I'm in the Google  like I'm  hanging out in Google for now.  And I want to get back to the home screen.  It's hard.  The swipe up.  You have a sucky case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the problem.  The case the lip of the case is preventing  that. So this is not hard  if you can really get it from the bottom.  But I think your case is the problem.  Now here's the good news.  You can turn those buttons.  It is the Google case.  It looks like a.  Okay see look here's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the G on the back.  Does it make a difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  without the case Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh it actually does.  But I can't not have a case

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  of my phone. So good news.  You can change.  You can put the buttons back.  If you like the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I do not like the gesture.  How do I do this? Button me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I do not like the gesture navigation.  So I put the three buttons back.  So if you just go to the settings menu and type  in navigation  it'll take you to the gesture menu.  And you can disable gestures  and get three buttons back. I haven't used  the gesture navigation  since it came out umpteen years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I like it but it's nice to have the choice.  It's good you have the choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the gesture thing but I don't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It doesn't work with that case very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well that's an issue.  That's probably why I don't really care for iQoA.  That's not one of the reasons but I don't like IOS  because of the gestures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you don't get the choice in IOS to go to the buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No home screen  like it used to have.  Or home button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What buttons? What three buttons?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The back, recent  and home button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't had those buttons in ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well that's right but you could put them there if you wanted them.  You see them at the bottom of my screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Some people don't care. See those three buttons?  It takes up a little screen real estate but this screen is  so big I don't think that matters so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So navigation, gesture  navigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh because y'all have the pros and I have the normal?  It's under system and gestures.  I found it. And thank you so  much for explaining this to me.  My pleasure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  John is there an over the shoulder?  Yeah there we go.  So under system navigation you can have gesture navigation  which is what Stacey was complaining about.  Swipe up, swipe left, swipe right.  Or you can go back to three buttons.  Kids love that.  Then you'll have back, home  and recent.  Let me put the keys back on and see if that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  helps. I was used to it on the old one  but on this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey the other thing is they changed  gesture with the newest  android version. They did

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and I complained about that last week because I was  big complaint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just was like. There's also, I don't know if this  will help you because it sounds like the one that you're having  trouble with is swipe up.  But there is a sensitivity in the gesture  settings. There's also sensitivity  that you can change it but that's for the back  sensitivity. So left edge, right edge  not the bottom edge. I'm not sure  why they don't give you something for the bottom edge  but I guess mainly because you often  are moving around in the screen with the left  and the right. It's part of the  part of the thing. It's funny  because I for years used a third party launcher.  I like  action launcher.  Yanova launcher. Yanova's great. I paid for both  of those. And I'm just using the pixel  launcher. I guess I'll survive.  It's not quite as  flexible or as feature as  rich but at least it's  You want another stupid Stacey question?  Sure. It's not stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is for all the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This dot. What the heck is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  A dot?  You mean the camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that the camera?  It's a selfie camera.  Okay. Now I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They don't have a notch anymore.  You might see at some point a colored  dot like a, I think it's a green dot.  When your mic or camera are on they put a little dot  up there to let you know. Oh yeah but they had that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  on Android. So that was on my old phone too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I really like that feature. I like that. Yeah.  Apple does that too. I'm like go Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh so the camera's behind the screen in the class.  I just don't pay attention to cameras because  I don't take selfies but

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  that's just me. Selfies are overrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you all  so much. I know that was like  Helen your grandma how to work her phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  but I also do  this on the show all the time.  Ask for help. Actually I do it more  on Windows weekly. Poor Paul Thorat. I go  but Paul I don't understand.  How does Windows work?  I don't get it.  Apple's going to have to change  the way. This will be very interesting  in the long run. Remember Epic  who does Fortnite sued both Apple  and Google saying we want to  be able to have our own payment options  and not give you the 30% VIG.  That was the one piece of the  case that Apple lost to Epic. They won everything  else. A judge today  or actually I guess it was yesterday  ordered Apple to fix  it by December 9th.  Apple had said please your honor give us  a little more time. Apple says  they'll appeal which means  this could go on for years.  Their lawyers are still thumbing through all of the notes.  But I suspect that  even with the appeal Apple might have  to do something by  December. Judge Gonzalez  Rogers kind of slapped him around.  She said Apple's motion is based on a  selective reading of this court's findings  and ignores all the findings  which supported the injunction.  She was a little miffed.  This will be the first time  according to Apple attorney Mark Perry  Apple has ever allowed live links  in an app for digital content. It's going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  take months to figure out the  engineering, economic, business and other  issues your honor. There have to be  it's exceedingly complicated. There have  to be guardrails and guidelines  protect the children

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  and protect the children. And they're just going to add a semi-colon at the end.  It's not hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It really isn't. It's not that hard. It's just a button  police. And you don't even  and guess what Apple you don't even have  to do it. The developers of the Apple do it.  Apple you just have to let them.  How hard is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They have to be written into guidelines that can be  explained and enforced and  applied your honor.  Please I beg of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I look forward to December  9th. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But remember at Google  by the way Tim Cook  the CEO of Apple gave Google a little gift  earlier this week  when asked  you know Apple's been on this  campaign. They did it in Europe and Cook was doing  it too in an interview I think with USA Today  he's you know they said oh  if we allow third party app stores on  the phone it just gives the criminals  access. Tim Cook  said look you want a third party  store buy an Android phone.  Just buy an Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah.  And all the Android sales goes up.  It was a little gift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't think it has to be that black and white Mr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Cook. Criminals already know that though.  Quite frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that's what. One more thing about  the Pixel phone and then I'm going to stop talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No no no never stop.  I'll have dumber questions next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These aren't questions. I just want  to make a note that this phone is really freaking

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  heavy. Yes it is compared

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  to the previous models. Is it really noticeably  heavier? Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah it is like.  That's the battery. I could weigh it.  Does it get hot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah mine. It does get warm.  I haven't had heat yet. So  I thought oh crap this phone  is really hot in the first couple of days.  I don't know it was indexing or something.  It hasn't been bad since. But the first couple  of days it was hot. I haven't had  heat yet. And that also when it's hot means battery  life is going to be depleted because it's wasting  energy. But I think the battery

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  life is very good. It is. I've  gone all

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  day. All day.  It may also have been hot because I was in  Mexico and it was doing a lot of seeking.  One of the nice things about the Pixel  is it has an eSIM.  So Google Fi was on the eSIM  which meant I could put a Verizon SIM in here and have  both really all the networks  between Verizon and Google Fi.  So that was nice because  data was spotty everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I found a 5G spot in  Santa Rosa. Nice.  How does it work Leo? I didn't see much difference in speed.  You could go there to download some movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah really in seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You could go through your bandwidth in seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's like wait a minute that says 5G on this phone now.  Oh I see that all the time. I believe it was in  Santa Rosa. That's the only place I've seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it real 5G or is it AT&T 5G?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is on Mint.  T-Mobile's 5G. And that's  mid-band or low-band.  I think it's low-band 5G.  It's not mm. It's not millimeter wave.  Nobody's got that around here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Verizon's doing it in  28 and 34. Where did T-Mobile  do theirs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No one knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll go back to asking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  cameras on my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sometimes you're so smart Stacy.  We just go huh?  You're talking about the frequencies I take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, yes. I'm talking about  the frequency.  Verizon's is  deployed in 28.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's talk about other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did you want to know anything else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I might come across a thing or two.  You've got

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the experts here. Actually you should go on all about  Android. That would be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh that's true.  An idiot discovers the pixel.  Stay tuned.  Stacy asked Jason and Michael all kinds of  questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, do you  remember, this is prior to  Ant and Stacy, but you remember  Jeff that I was in  vain for a long time against Amp.  Thinking it was really a  power grab by  Google.  And now I think we're starting to learn  both from the unredacted complaint from the  Texas AG and elsewhere  that Amp may not have been the  innocent  improvement on web technologies  that we were told.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Is this your I told you so moment?  Yes. Oh okay. I told you so.  There you go. That's what we need to hear.  I told you so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  During the  Chrome Dev Summit concluded last  week,  Paul Kinlan, who is lead for Chrome  Developer Relations  was speaking during an Ask Me Anything  Q&A with Chrome Leadership.  Former Amp advisory  board member Jeremy Keith  asked a question.  Given  the court proceedings against Amp,  he said, why should anyone trust  Flock or any, which is  Google's federated  learning of cohorts. Getting ready to host cookies.  Sandbox. Right. Or any  other Google initiatives  ostensibly focused on privacy.  Ben  Galbraith from the Chrome Leadership said,  well, I can't comment about the Amp  proceedings, but let's talk about privacy  sandbox. I think it's important to know  we're not asking for blind trust with  the sandbox effort. Instead,  we're working in the open. It means  we're sharing ideas while they're in the  early phase. I don't know  a lot of stuff. We're  transparent. He said.  We're transparent.  But I think it's very telling  that he was faced with that  fairly tough question. Why should  we trust you? And really didn't make  much of an argument  why we should trust them.  Have you read the stuff about Amp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't really  dig into it in depth because it's also  kind of losing steam anyway.  Amp is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. In fact, Google's own  internal documents, according to this  unsealed  lawsuit,  show that Amp pages brought 40%  less revenue  to publishers, which might be a  reason it's losing steam.  And this one is really  now, again, this is an allegation.  This has not been proven in court. This just  although it was a very I thought a very well  argued and  and there was a lot of evidence  in this pleading  this speed. This is from the  lawsuit. The speed benefits Google  marketed for Amp were also at least partly  a result of Google's  throttling. Google  throttles the load time of non-Amp  ads by giving them artificial  one second delays  in order to give Amp  a quote nice comparative  boost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, well, hold on there. Hold on.  Hold on.  What I don't know. I don't know  the details here. This is from Google's own  documents, by the way. Yes. Part of the argument at the time  was that Amp  forced publishers to speed up  their editorial content.  But the ad content remained  horrible. And  so  there was an argument at  the time that Google  should advantage  faster ads. Now, so you could  do they did they throttle down  the slow ones or throttle up the fast ones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apparently, they throttle down non-Amp  ads by a second to make  Amp look good. Plus,  and this is also from the  lawsuit, throttling  non-Amp ads slows down header  bidding, which then Google  uses. That's another issue. Yeah.  To denigrate header bidding for being  too slow.  Google really, it really looks  like, and a lot of this is coming from internal documents,  so it's kind of hard to argue that, oh, we didn't do  that. Google really  did a lot to favor its own ad network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you want to go after Google, go after their position  in ad networks. That's where they're  the shopping thing, Amp,  that's all small.  Google's an ad network company, and that's  where it has its power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, but they used  but they used Amp  to promote their ad network.  Also,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  anytime a big company that has  a huge share in the market  who advantages their own technology  or, I mean, in this sort of way,  I mean, that's just self-dealing.  And even if it's not a big deal, it's something  that should be stopped simply to, like, prevent  corruption and... Antitrust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Anyway.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Look, I love Google.  We wouldn't be doing a show called This Week  in Google if we didn't think they were important and there were stuff  of interest. We've been doing this show for 10 years.  And as has always been a matter of  great interest, we use a lot of Google  stuff. I want  Google to do the right thing. I don't think they need  to do the wrong thing. They make plenty of money. They don't need  to cheat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's fair to challenge them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's fair to challenge them.  I'm disappointed.  I'm a little disappointed. And I think they  got aggressively competitive.  Look, it happens in Silicon Valley  all the time. It happens to almost every  company. That's the thing. Are you surprised?  No, I shouldn't be surprised.  I believe them when they said  don't be evil. I really believe them that they  wanted to be a better company. And I think in the  beginning, Larry and Sergey really  did want to be a better company.  I also think the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  bigger you get, the harder it is not  to have more influence on people and to become  evil to someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What irritates me  here in the case of AMP itself  is  that they screwed  up what should have been  a holy cause, which is to fix  media's webpages.  Media's webpages have gotten even worse.  We got rid of popups  for a brief moment in history.  And then they invented all kinds  of new popups.  Partly just tell you it's okay  that it's the click off for the privacy stuff.  But all the other stuff you have and all the stuff  coming in and out. Media pages are  terrible. They're irritating.  They're slow.  They move around.  They're awful. And AMP at one  level was supposedly there  to help speed up the web and get back  to a purer web. And that's why I was  in favor of it. And it did that to an extent.  But then it got obviously  or apparently misused  in other ways, which then hurts the cause  of a better web. Which is a problem.  Take a little break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Come back with more.  Jeff Jarvis,  Ant Pruitt, Stacy  Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We were all serious until Stacy smiled.  I miss you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, I was caught looking at the size of my slippers  because I was trying to order a new pair of slippers  during the ad break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh, and you did re-hellen.  It was during the ad break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  We got one person that tweets  all throughout the show.  And then someone else is  buying slippers. What kind of slippers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Only during the ad break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just want to  recommend.  It's a Christmas tradition in my house  to update every year.  You got to get a new pair of Wicked Good  slippers from L.L. Bean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I'm getting.  I knew it. I knew it.  How did I know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just somehow knew  that.  I just had a feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was hoping for bunnies.  I was so hoping for bunny  slippers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you got to get a quality slipper when you're up in the Pacific  Northwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The only bad thing about Wicked Good slippers, as good as they are,  is you do really have to buy a new pair every year.  We buy them every

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's a traditional Christmas gift.  I think my son has a pair of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wicked Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I imagine the LaPorte house  it's, oh, slippers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thanks.  Last year I got them with kitty cats  on them. So I managed to dress  it up a little bit so it looks a little bit like  I'm thinking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, gee. Thank you  so much. How did you know  this is what I was hoping for?  How did you get kitty cats?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let me see. I don't know if it was a  special thing.  I have a choice of plaids,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  These were really great. I don't see them anymore.  Now, I used to get these. I don't like them.  You've got to get the moccasin ones, I think,  personally.  Oh, yeah, they were the Wicked Good clogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, no clogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, but they had cats  on them.  I don't know. Maybe I've got to  call Mr. Bean and see  what's going on because  maybe they don't do those anymore.  What am I going to do? Now it really is going to be  oh, slippers.  Aren't you special?  See, I guess they don't have the  kitty cats anymore.  They only one color. Lisa hates  brown. Those are the ones my boy has.  Yeah, yeah. Lisa thinks  I only get stuff in brown. She hates  brown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's neutral.  Oh, those are cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  boy, it's too bad LL Bean's  not a sponsor.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Another good sponsor. Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I just note. Did note it.  That in the ad, the Akamai  they were scrolling through L.L.Bean's slippers  in that ad. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, that's creepy. Is that a glitch in  the matrix? That's a glitch in the matrix.  I think that's a glitch in the matrix.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm packing up

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and going home. We are in a simulation. It's obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're not real. Musk was right.  Don't kill us, Elon. Don't kill us.  I'm not worried about

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Elon. I'm worried about Paul Gozer actually.  But that's another story for another day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Amazon. I'm not going to derail anything else.  No, that was interesting though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That was, I'm telling  you. Good eye.  There's coincidences and then there's glitches  in the matrix. And then there's  conspiracies.  I think there's just not enough  bits. And so sometimes they have to duplicate  the bits. Right?  They couldn't have something  different. They just ran out of bits.  I'm scared now. You know what I'm saying?  Did you take the blue pill or the red pill?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  There was a pill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see the matrix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What does  updating the Verge's background  policy mean, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I like this story.  So the Verge published  things saying, hey, we're ethical. This is  how we're trying to be ethical.  And it's all about on  background, which is  what companies do when they want to tell you  information that they want you to print, but they don't want to be credited with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's kind of a way of  manipulating the  story. It's waffly.  I think it's worse than that.  I think it's spin. It is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  true. It is spin. So when  a, and the thing is  it used to be for  true sources. Like I used to  have people who, you know, and sometimes  those people did work for competitors.  But sometimes people will go on background  because they want you to have  context for something, but they don't want to be  have an attribute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sometimes it could be informational, but  it's really up to the reporter to  sift through the spin to get to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the facts. And it is  your responsibility when someone gives you something  on background. You don't just print it. You go  check it out. But anyway,  so what happens is spokespeople from  companies tend to go on  background to tell you things like, I'll say  something about like  we'll just use Amazon because they do this  a lot. Talk about like,  yeah, product, this product  is behaving weird or actually  I've gotten this  like this product is behaving  weird and I don't understand  why it's doing this. And they're like  well on background we're going to issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  an update. But you can't print  that. Or can you?  Can you say  I've been told by company sources?  No, you can't even say that. You can say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've  I found that or I hear  there's going to be a back  update. I've heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's kind of weird. So the  Verge says more than one big company, and I  know one big company in particular  that does this, insists on holding  product briefings on background with  no attribution.  Which means no one can properly  report what company executives say about their  new products during marketing events.  We know exactly what company does that.  A  a big tech company  PR person emailed us, this is just  stupid, emailed us a link to  the company's own website on background.  That's just dope.  That's just useless. That's like that person  just is useless. A food  company, food delivery company  insisted on discussing the popularity of chicken  wings on background.  I don't, by the way, this is one  of the reasons, actually one of the primary  reasons, I never talk to PR people.  Because I don't, it's like  I don't want to, I don't want to have to sift  through that in my head. It's easier for  me not to know it  than to figure out if it's  guff or if it's genuine  valuable stuff. And as a result, I  miss out, I don't do Apple  briefings, so I miss out on a lot of  maybe some factual stuff.  But I also miss out on  a lot of fluff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I get a lot of fluff, but there's  probably four PR  people that I really enjoy  hearing from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And so this is important too. I don't have a policy  for you.  You get to do whatever you want. Jason gets to do whatever  he wants. Micah gets to do whatever they want.  I have, just because I've been in this business  way too long and I'm too old and cranky,  I just, I don't like loners.  I don't want to talk to PR. I've  spent way too many hours at lunches  with people who just don't want to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  anymore. Yeah, and let's see, that's the thing.  I'm pretty much right there with you.  The four PR people that I enjoy.  They know, alright,  Ant's going to dig this.  Here we go, this is the information. And as a result,  and it works. Yeah, and I get the benefit

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  frankly of having you, Micah, and Jason  around because you guys do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And I don't have to deal with it. Because I hate

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  embargoes. I don't do embargoes?  And I don't do NDAs. I haven't

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  done them in more than a decade. They're so hard,  especially when it's juicy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most reporters  don't do NDAs. I mean, I've never  signed an NDA. Even like sometimes when you show  up to a company, they're like, sign an NDA. You're like,  hi, I'm with the media. I'm not going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't take questions. I don't,  I mean, I don't say I'll submit questions to you.  I don't let them know what questions I'm going to  ask. I don't take the questions they suggest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about clearing, this is a different,  this is a cultural difference. Clearing  quotes. Yes, they don't have to do that.  I tell, I say we won't do that.  But in Germany, it is standard  procedure to call and clear the

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  quotes. I don't think it's unreasonable if you  are quoting somebody to call,  not to clear them, but just to make sure you're  quoting it accurately. Chris, you've got your notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's absolutely right to get, did I get this right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yes. But in this day of digital  recording, is that even necessary?  People record phone calls and  conversations on some type  of digital recorder all the time, right?  And it gives them the opportunity to change it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When they realize they said something stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, you never want to  clear quotes with people if you can avoid it.  And you can absolutely avoid it.  I will call people  and run by,  if I haven't done it in an  interview, and I'm going to use  like a metaphor because it's tech  reporting. So it's like, what do you have a stack of pancakes?  I'll run my metaphor by them  sometimes just to make sure that it's  decent. You clear the metaphors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You clear the metaphors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You just said pancakes instead of waffles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is what's different  about what we do from what you do, Jeff.  Because when you're doing tech reporting,  the primary part of your job  is communicating complex stuff  to non-technical people.  So you break it down.  So you use metaphors. And you want to just make sure you're not  using a metaphor that's misrepresenting  the actual technical fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So pixels are like a waffle, I can hear Stacy.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually use baking a lot.  Like when I talk about semiconductor manufacturing,  I'm like semiconductor manufacturing is like baking  a layer cake. Throw in a big  batch of cake. Then you scoop out some of it.  Then you put more frosting in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You just don't want to make a metaphor that makes  sense to you but in fact is misrepresented  in technology.  I'd say it's more like a Napoleon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe a lasagna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sometimes cybersecurity  is notorious for this. Sometimes you come up  with a metaphor that you think rocks  and then they're like, well,  no, it's more like this. And a lot of times  when I'm doing this, I'm not doing this with the  PR person. I'm doing it with the tech people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look, our goal is the same,  which is we want to accurately communicate  the information without  fear or favor.  So to the degree that you  want to be accurate, I think it's appropriate to ask.  But we don't want to give them the chance  to say, no, please don't say that  because that would hurt my feelings  or my boss would get mad.  Now this one happens.  They're doing it a lot more.  I have people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in my interviews, they're like, hey, can you take that off the record?  I hate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well,  if I may have a historic moment,  I was at People  Magazine when that shift  occurred. The People Magazine started,  it was all about the top stars  and top shows. And if you  had a Dallas is number one, you put  Dallas on the cover, Dallas sells. And then one  day I remember that my boss screaming down the hall  because I was the TV critic, TV's dead,  Jarvis is dead  because the cover hadn't sold. Because  now we had more competition because now what  mattered was the event in the stars life.  And so the flack became  uber important  because now we needed the stars  face to sell the magazine.  And the flacks knew that. And so  they would say, no, no, no, we want reporter  approval, quote approval, photo approval,  cover guarantee,  all this stuff. And they threw their  weight around quite a bit because they could, because  they controlled the commodity  that mattered. We control the commodity that mattered the old days,  the audience. Now to get the audience,  we needed the commodity they controlled,  which was the access to the star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Is it okay  for these people to say off the record  versus on background?  I'm assuming there's a nuanced difference  there. I'm not a journalist, so that's why I'm asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you do off the record stuff, Stacy?  You do, don't you? I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  only for people  I know and trust.  And again, same thing. And even then,  I bet you limit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think is a legitimate, let me ask this,  Stacy, what's a legitimate use  of off the record?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have had people  try to get me to investigate  pay disparities  or treatment issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  When Deep Throat meets you in a garage  and says you really need to  follow the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if someone tells you something and they're going to give you  internal memos, sometimes  if they're HR memos, I will  take those off the record  or in those cases,  I will run things like quote approvals  by them because  this is personnel.  Yeah, there are things

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  you need to be more careful of. I think that's smart.  So you can be off the record

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you're a valid source  and putting you on the record  hurts you. Here's a challenging one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And this is another one The Verge brings up.  Multiple big tech companies, and I would say this is  common practice in politics  and other areas too, insist on having  PR staffers quoted as  quote sources familiar with the situation  even though  they're paid spokespeople.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Politicians do this all the time too.  And regulatory agencies. So that's something that I  was like stunned at when I first started  reporting about politics.  But it's crept into  tech.  And yeah, it's super stupid,  super frustrating.  And the only reason people  do it is for access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  So what is their new policy? Anyway,  it's actually worth reading if even  if you're not a journalist, I  would suggest going to TheVerge.com and reading  this because it's interesting to  hear all the manipulations that tech  companies more than  ever have started using.  We covered  a story. Remember  the car company that said  we're going to only  do electric vehicles from now on.  I can't remember what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Volkswagen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They were going to rename themselves from  Volkswagen to Volkswagen.  Oh yeah.  They mentioned this. A major car company's  head of communications told us an April  Fool's joke was actually real  on background.  So that was the sneaky thing on  background. The joke obviously  was a joke. It wasn't  real. But on  background. So this that's nasty.  Stupid. That's nasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When people do it like what are you going to do  with that? You're like, oh well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  we're going to believe them. And then you're going  to get bit. So by

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the way, this is a really good use  of sorry. I'm looking at Twitter right  now. I hope you'll forgive me for this. No, it's  OK. We know you've already tweeted about six

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  times during the show. I've counted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go to top articles  and then go to conversation,  the first thing under my list is TheVerge policy.  And you get really good tweets  that are very relevant to  that discussion. I think this is a great use

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  for Twitter. This is a new and improved Twitter.  I'm glad that  they're doing this. Anyway, Tony

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hale on by the way. No, I'd love to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe we did it in years gone by.  We probably have. Yeah.  So this is what TheVerge is saying.  This is bad.  So we're going to reset these expectations as  loudly as possible. This is really a message to  the tech companies and their PR firms.  From now on, the default for communications  professionals and people speaking to TheVerge  in an official capacity will  be on the record. Do it.  No more background. No more off the record.  I'll read the next paragraph. But we will still  honor some requests to be on background  but at our discretion and only for specific  reasons that we can articulate

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to readers. That should have been the case always.  It used to be the case in journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what happens is you just kind of  gradually fall into this because you're a person  and these are people and you want to be nice  to people. That's why I don't talk to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because I don't want to be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These reporters are hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Honestly, I'm a people pleaser.  And if I know these people,  it's bad for me because I'll try  to protect them. I can't criticize  Microsoft. I like that guy.  I love Chris Cappucilla.  But that's the problem. He's their  chief marketing officer. He's a great  guy. But I don't want to let that  make me be nice to Microsoft.  Good journalist, Paul Thurots and  Mary Jo Forlund. Really good example.  They know all these people and  they are completely willing to be very critical  of Microsoft. I really  respect that. When I started

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Entertainment Weekly, I tried to have a policy  but it didn't last long enough to keep it in place.  I tried to have a policy that would forbade  critics from doing features  on stars and productions.  They were to be an independent critic there  as the eyes and voice of the audience.  Not to become buddy  buddy with the stars. But it  didn't work. Soon after I left,  it all gets  incestuous as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This new policy was written by  Neelay Patel. A lawyer.  I could just see him knowing him very well.  He's a lawyer, right?  And just getting so fed up with this.  He finally said, look, I'm writing this  and you're publishing it and this is our new policy  done.  But I have to say  this has been our policy here  since day one. It's been my  policy since I started doing this in the 90s.  I don't do background. I don't do any of this stuff.  I don't do off the road. That's you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But do your employees have  like, I found it interesting that you  said you didn't have like a company where you don't tell them  what to do. But I feel like every video organization  has to have a standard. I'm very

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  clear to them about what I do. And  that is kind of the ethos of what we do.  And I trust them  to do it right. You know, if  we were a bigger organization, there's only four of  us staff hosts.  If we were a bigger organization, certainly  we did at Tech TV. Jim Latterback  wrote up a very clear policy.  I completely respect and still  adhere to.  But I trust them. And if ever,  by the way, and you'll  vouch for this. And if I think there's been  a, if a line's been crossed, I will let them know.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're not going for scoops as  much as commentary and content.  As well as Miss Lisa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The reason we can do this  is because we have no, we're not  publishing three months in advance.  You know, and we, so we don't,  and we're not on, but that's by the way where  we don't have, well, I can't  say we always don't. I don't ever have  advanced products.  I know sometimes Jason, for instance, on  embargo.  I don't want to, I don't want to  get in the way of his ability to do what he considers  to be his job. And  we're certainly forthright about that when that happens.  After the fact, when Jason  during our Pixel 6 announcement  goes, oh, and I have one, we're  very clear. Oh yeah, I've had this for five days  and they sent it to me and blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, I just,  that comes more from  my point of view that this is not  a,  this is not a traditional editorial  entity where, you know, I'm the boss  or, and we have employees.  But I think of it more of a collegial  consortium of people.  And even the staff hosts, I don't want  to treat them any differently than I do you and Jeff, for instance.  I don't say to you, Stacy, here's  our policy, don't violate it. Because  you don't work for me, you're a contract  employee. And I trust  you. You wouldn't be on the show  if I thought there were going to be an issue with that.  And there certainly are people we do not let  on our air for that reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say, I'm getting a kick back on  every slipper sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If I thought  that were true, I would say, oh.  She has a waffle empire.  I said, let me in on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's true. My waffle empire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think people know that that's one of the things  that,  but I don't think we have to put it in writing. I don't know.  I don't think we have to. I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I believe all of us here, we have  a set of moral standards  if you will. We don't want to be, I believe  the term is on the take.  I see it a lot.  We have a moral compass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love it. Casey Newton immediately  picked up on that car company's  misrepresentation on Twitter. Yeah, you're right.  This is a good use of Twitter Blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really is.  Especially if you follow the right people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's put it, if you follow the  topics and people, or you follow the  topics that are interesting to you and the people that,  I mean, we think it's good because we care  about this, but many other people are like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and all the people, Phil Nickinson,  Harry McCracken, Dieter Bohn.  I mean, the people who are responding to this,  not only the people I follow, but real  journalists who agree. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's what's so great. It's Mike Madsen showing up on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Love that.  It's making Twitter be  what I think for a lot of  journalists, it has been for a long time, but in a  much more organized and useful fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's definitely targeted. I don't feel like I'm having a  stroke when I'm reading this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes! Yay, finally.  All right. Good conversation.  I know sometimes we get into the weeds  on media, but I think  media literacy is really important for you,  our audience. It's certainly important.  It's tech journalism. Yeah, you need to understand.  And I have been kind of  invading against the  lack standards in tech journalism  now for some years. It really bugs me.  I mean, YouTube journalists, they don't,  there's no standard at all.  Well, either way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  too, it went from full  utopia to full dystopia as well.  And I don't trust  the level of reporting in context  in so much of tech journalism, especially  I don't mean, I mean that actually  less about tech sites and more about  tech coverage in mainstream sites.  Yeah. Well, it's always a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a problem with  Beltway journalism. It's a problem.  It's always a problem when you're covering a niche. If you're covering autos,  it's always a problem.  You want access.  And one access you have to  and it's one of the things I wanted  to fight against from day one because I  know people don't trust auto  magazines particularly.  They know they're kind of in the pocket.  And I thought that probably people felt  the same way about tech coverage.  So I really wanted to emphasize we're not  that. We don't do that. That's not us.  And our job is to represent  you, the users. So that's  why we talk about it here. And I think it's important.  I hope you as listeners  to our podcast understand  and maybe take that knowledge out and to  be more critical about the material  you read and you see because  a lot of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Something that comes to  my mind is with my show  Hands on Photography, I have spoken  a lot to Canon  Explorer of Light photographers  and everybody will say, oh, he's a  Canon fanboy. Quite frankly,  yes, I am a Canon fanboy.  But at the same time, I also  deal with folks from Sony  or whoever else that has some interesting  camera technology. And I let it all  be known right up front. Hey, I'm  here to talk about this particular  piece of tech regardless of  what my affinity is for. Also though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  we're not quite reviewers as  Jeff pointed out. Right.  We're a little bit different.  Eric in our chat room  says YouTube  YouTubers are content creators  not journalists. That's correct. But that's problematic  to me because they're behaving  as journalists. They're reporting on  their viewing stuff. They're perceived as journalists  by the masses. So that's problematic  to me because I don't  think they have the same standards in many  cases. No, they don't. But in many  cases they don't. When I see  Linus Tech Tips investing  in framework and then covering  framework, that bugs me.  It's not to impugn  him, but it bugs me.  That's not anything  we would ever contemplate  or allow. Hey, here's  a cool story. Brain implants  really cool.  This is from Science Alert.  Brain implant translates  paralyzed man's thoughts into  text with 94%  accuracy.  This fellow has  been paralyzed with the neck down  due to a spinal cord injury.  He sustained in 2007.  They put a  device in his brain called  BrainGate, a brain computer interface.  They  tell the fella, and we don't know his name,  they call him T5 in the study, 65  years old. They say  even though he can't move any of his  limbs, concentrate as if  you're writing. Think about  writing in your mind even  though you can't. And  the interface was able to  with 94% accuracy  using AI  translate those brain impulses  into actual text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What scares me most  is being trapped in the bell jar like that  and to be able to communicate that  way is just amazing.  Where was it weep?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a good question. Let me see if they say that.  In tests, the man was able to achieve  writing speeds, get this, of  90 characters a minute, that's 18  words a minute,  with approximately  94% accuracy and up to 99%  accuracy with autocorrect enabled.  So maybe it was weak in  misunderstanding or mistyping. No Google, I didn't mean that!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's interesting. So if you're thinking about  spelling a word and you would misspell it in your head  and you're typing, wow. It fixes it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or maybe you didn't misspell it in your head  but the AI misinterpreted  and said that's an O, not an A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like there and there. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And the autocorrect fixed it.  That speed, to give you an  idea, 18 words a minute, is they say  almost on par with the typing speed of  smartphone users in that man's age group.  So, I mean, it's not slow.  That's awesome. It's not slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is slow but it's not  like horribly slow. Not that slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  People my age,  they say, get about 23  words a minute on a smartphone.  I've never timed myself.  If there's no Mavis Beacon

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  who teaches typing for your smartphone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No. Look at this.  The man's imagined  handwriting as interpreted  by the system. So again, this is not  him moving his hand.  These letters are him thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  these letters. He's not thinking  in cursive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I guess not.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the earlier version, they  had the thing where you, like  your cable TV, you point at the keyboard.  I repeat, I wonder  whether thinking that you were typing  would work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I bet it would. But they have to train it for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. This is interesting  because you know how some people, there's like always  a small subset of the population  who don't see faces, for example,  when they're thinking.  What's that condition called?  You explained that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apnosia, apganagosia or  something. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is more like some people  they don't hear a voice in their head,  but some of us do.  Prozopan...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Stacey, you want to talk about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  a little more here? I cannot say that word.  No, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  can hear sounds.  I can smell smells as if they were there  and vivid. But if I close  my eyes, I cannot see your face, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So that's like our brains  are a little wacky. So I'm thinking about  for people,  I can't see myself  writing.  I've been trying really hard, but I can  picture me typing, like not the  physical act of typing, but like the words  on a screen. Here's what they said. So when they showed  the handwriting, it's kind of crazy. Here's

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  what they said. The researchers  said, we've learned the brain retains its ability  to prescribe  fine movements a full decade after  the body has lost its ability to execute  those movements. And we've learned  that complicated, intended  motions involving  changing speeds and curved  trajectories like handwriting  can be interpreted more easily and more rapidly  by the AI we're using.  They can simpler, intended motions  like moving a cursor in a straight  path at a steady speed. Or I would predict  typing. That's just  it's the fine motor  thing. But you remember  enough about how to write, you  don't need to be, I hate writing too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have terrible penmanship. I learned to type  after the sixth grade because of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The good news about AI, it doesn't care about your penmanship.  Thank goodness. As long as you're consistent.  It scares me. Right?  It could be your A looks like this.  Consistently illegible.  Basically the researchers say alphabetic,  and I'm again reading from ScienceAlert.com,  alphabetic letters are very different from one  another in shape so the AI  can decode the user's intention more  rapidly as the characters are drawn  compared to other systems that don't make use  of dozens of different inputs in the same  way. So I guess. I wonder about things like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mandarin would be difficult  because the characters build on

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  another. That's interesting. Well maybe not though  because it's very prescribed when you  write a Chinese character, the order of the  strokes is prescribed.  So, in fact,  when I was learning how to write Mandarin,  if you write it in the wrong order, they go  they slap your hand.  You have to do it in the right, and it's actually  more precise than one would think.  I think it's actually better than English  cursive. It's very, you're almost  a painter. It's very interesting.  I bet you would work better. It's fine.  Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that cool?  So they also say, look, this  is one guy. It's just a proof of concept.  We were able to do it. That doesn't mean we're going to  have a product that you're going to be  able to use anytime soon. But the  research is starting, which is very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So can I mention a little one?  Maybe you can't play it because it's music. Please. You mean  Adele's new song?  What's interesting about this is that  John Lewis, it's not TikTok, John  Lewis and other British  merchants always have their special Christmas  adverts. And they're about  two minutes long. And you look forward to it.  You know what, the same thing that Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  has a regular, Google has a regular Christmas ad,  Apple's, we  wait for Apple's Christmas ad every year. So  that happens to your... You do?  Maybe you don't. This one's a little bit, this is more

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the British model of telling a story and...  No, no, that's totally it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. You want to see Apple's Christmas ad  from last year? Sure. It's a real  heart...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  tugger. A real hum digger. A real

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  hum... Wait a minute.  This is 2021. Oh,  the new one's out. The new one's already out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you clearly weren't waiting that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no. This is...  Well, this was published in 2019,  but it says 2021. That  says YouTube probably screwing with me.  I'm not going to play that one, just  in case.  Yeah, here's one from 2013.  How about that? They've been doing this for a long time.  Apple's Christmas  commercial. Cars driving up.  There's a kid with a  iPhone. Oh, actually, I love this ad.  I remember this one. Grandpa comes to the door,  the grandkids,  the kids, they're all... The whole family's getting  together. But there's, you know, the usual  kind of  emo 14 year old who spends a lot  of time on his phone.  They're all having fun building a snowman.  He's on his smartphone. Not Ralph.  No, Ralph. Ralph.  They throw something at Ralph because  Ralph's just... He's the Christmas tree.  He's doing his phone. They think Ralph is  a loser. Ralph is pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, after 2013, they'd send this kid to jail or

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  therapy. Ralph has really got problems.  And then  Ralph turns on the TV  and shares the video he's  been making on his iPhone  this whole time. Ladies and  gentlemen, we give you Ralph's movie,  A Harris Family Holiday.  See? See? See what I'm  saying? That's in that tradition.  They do this every year.  And it's actually the best ads  of the year. Microsoft  does the same thing. Google does  the same thing. And now  the family likes Ralph again because  it turns out he's not a nerd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's going to make millions.  He's the next Steven Spielberg. He's violated our privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and put this on YouTube. And how

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  are you going to get it?  Oh, grandma's crying. Don't cry, grandma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh,  they're all crying. The whole family's crying.  And Ralph, I'm sorry we thought you  were a loser. You're OK,  man. You're OK. What? You got two million

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  subs on YouTube?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the introvert's holiday strategy

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  right here. It is. I do it.  Mike Elgin admitted it.  He said the reason I have a camera  is because I can document  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So anyway,  Adele has a new album.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  She has a new album. She has a new  single off the album and it's debuted  as the commercial on Amazon. It's an  Amazon holiday ad.  Well, we don't say Christmas  here, yes. Yeah. Because we  killed Christmas in Santa Claus and Big Bird  too. Oh, no, that's right. Big Bird's evil.  I guess I'm confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So here's a young woman walking  in a city, but she's somehow  underground. Is this a dystopian  future or oh, she works for Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's got that color grading  dystopian. It does. It's got the blue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  kind of dark. The children of men

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  coverage. Children of men coverage. Exactly.  Exactly. But wait.  You always  know when the hopeful music starts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, she's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  college kid. OK, she's got to do  math class. She's under a lot of pressure.  She's typing. The clock's ticking backwards,  which was weird.  Maybe that's just,

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't know.  It was going backwards, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, OK, it's just me. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just thought that was odd. Just feels left out.  All the fun. They're all dancing.  This is very similar to Ralph  and his iPhone experience  in 2013. I don't know. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  here we go. Here we go. Here's the payoff.  Here's the payoff. Amazon's  going to make it. Oh, she's tapped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The neighbor's putting mistletoe up on the door.  No, it's a wreath. It's a wreath.  The neighbor looks at her. They look at each  other. The neighbor is her mother.  No.  God, I'm depressed. This is two minutes  and 13 seconds of depression.  When's the Amazon delivery guy  coming? Feeding the birds.  Feeding birds

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  out of her hand. Tuppens a bag.  Makes the girl smile.  Tuppens. Makes her happy.  Tuppens a bag. The girl's  just on her side. So just wait. Just wait. Amazon is going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  come into here in a minute. Oh, they did this

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  last year. Remember the  COVID thing? They had ballerina. Couldn't  do her concerts. So she had to dance on the roof.  And then her neighbor made a video  out of her. I just don't watch TV anymore. This  is grim. This is just  awful. Now she bought her a  bird feeder from the neighbor. So she doesn't have  to go outside anymore to feed the birds.  And she thanks the neighbor. So now the neighbor's stuck in a  hunt inside just like she is.  And now we're all in our  dystopian boxes.  Is it? Is it?  Is it really warming up? Oh!  The little nod. The little nod.  You see the little nod? That was the entire acknowledgement.  The little nod.  That's a terrible ad.  Terrible ad.  Compare that to the Apple ad.  Heartwarming. Loving.  All this was dystopian Amazon blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you love dystopia.  You spread dystopia all around you.  Like Santa Claus spreads  presents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  How about Meta? Did you guys have fun  talking about Meta last week?  We were confused by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jason said we are all sick of  talking about them. Sick of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, are we talking about it again?  No. No. I didn't  get to. I didn't get to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was in Mexico.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is not happening again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I gotta say though, one of the guys on the trip  was a Facebook engineer.  He said, yeah, they're getting me my new cards.  And this is exactly why I don't want to  know people in the business because now I like him  and I can't say bad things about Facebook anymore.  Yeah, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's nothing to say. That's the new name.  Love it. Beautiful.  In the future.  Oh, yeah. I do have in my hand.  What do you have?  Well, there's a 26 page trademark application.  Oh, yeah. I remember you talking about that.  I remember you talking about that.  Facebook files. Oh, it's hilarious.  Oh my god. They want, so when you file  a trademark application, you say  in what area? Like,  Twitter has a trademark application in like  streaming media and  technology news, that kind of thing.  You don't say in rubber shoes or slippers or  anything like that. So there could be a Twitter  wicked good slipper that  wouldn't infringe. Right. Right.  But apparently,  Metta wants to own, there's 26  pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So this is sent for approval?  Does this mean that this could be denied?  Yes. Okay. So we actually had Evan Brown

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  on Twitter, he's a lawyer and an IP lawyer  to boot. And I asked him,  that's one of the reasons we wanted to have him on and talk about it.  And he said, yeah, this is just, you know,  you ask for the moon. Yeah. But the trademark  examiner may say, well,  okay. Again, it's Metta.  They may not. I don't know. Software  for file sharing, messaging software,  virtual reality software,  downloadable software for use  in creating, designing virtual reality,  augmented reality software,  API for computer software for developing.  Again, it goes on.  Accessing, viewing text, images, electronic  data related to conferences in the field  of software development, downloadable  software. It goes on and on.  It's a mostly software download.  But wait a minute. This almost

Speaker: SPEAKER_13

Transcript:  No, no, no, no. The examiner is some guy.  Little  Pinsonet glasses. He's got  little sleeve cuffs. He works  in a darkened office on a wooden desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No. He's got a big rubber stamp and he goes  He's bitter. He's angry.  Angry, mad.  He likes to feed the birds. It's that kind  of thing.  Let's  do our TikTok  segment of the week. Forget the Google  change log. It's time for the TikTok  change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now we need the 60 minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, I'm actually curious what  you think about this, Stacey.  Maybe you've seen on TikTok a lot  of domestic violence  prevention groups and so forth  have promoted this idea that there's a hand  gesture. If you're feeling unsafe,  maybe you're walking down the street  and your boyfriend's got a hold of you and is  going to take you home and you're scared  to death. You could do this hand signal. I'm going to show  everybody because this is the new TikTok  hand signal. You bend your thumb and you  close your fingers over the thumb. That's  the signal. Simple. But if you're  doing that as you walk down the street, your boyfriend  may not know what you're doing. It just  looks like you're clenching your fist.  I'm okay.  I'm not saying that John  Slinien has trapped me here.  John is keeping him hostage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Nor has Aunt Pruitt taken him hostage.  Let's get that clear too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thank you. So, a girl  who was reported missing in Asheville,  North Carolina  in distress in the passenger seat of a car  driving through Kentucky,  she appeared to be waving through  the window to passing cars, but  one person in a car nearby recognized  the TikTok  signal. That's awesome.  The girl, 16 years old, was  using a new distress signal  according to the Laurel County Sheriff's  Office, the signal created by the Canadian  Women's Foundation for people to indicate  they're at risk of abuse and need help  has spread mostly through TikTok  in the past year. The person who  saw it, apparently a TikTok  viewer, called 911,  said, I think this girl's in trouble. She's  using the hand gesture. The  dispatcher and officers were unfamiliar  with the signal, but sheriff's  deputies pulled over the car to investigate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the person who  called tracked the car  along for some considerable amount  of time to an exit and stayed  with her, which was really important.  Stayed on the phone with the cops saying here's where they are

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  at mile markers. And they found out the girl's  parents had reported her missing two days earlier.  They arrested the driver,  charged her with unlawful imprisonment.  The girl is safe and back  home. She said she'd been trying  to get motorist attention as they traveled  south from Ohio  the whole time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So this isn't an ASL thing.  See, TikTok does good things.  Yeah, just somebody invented it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Something easy to do that doesn't look like  maybe you're doing a signal.  It could be a twitch kind of.  Or you're waving.  I'm the queen.  I'm the queen.  Actually, I think Queen Elizabeth is saying she's trapped  in Wizard Castle. But that's another  matter. Yeah, help me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you know what the Drake and Angel shot...  Sorry, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is like angel shots.  Well, exactly what I was going to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Explain please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I wondered if you do.  So when you order an angel shot at a bar,  you're trying to indicate that the person  next to you is upsetting  or cause problems for you or whatever.  Like, help me. It's basically  help me order an angel shot.  And the idea is that the  bartender knows and you don't.  But the hard thing about all of these is  when it gets to widespread  knowledge, everybody also,  like the bad guys will also know.  So there's this weird  like, not  saying that this isn't good and this  isn't, but...  It's good that this worked out this time.  Yeah. Because now that this is news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  More people will

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  know about it to use it  and recognize it, but also more people  who might be kidnapping people.  I don't think those people are there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Anyway,  it's a happy story.  Here's an unhappy story. The goddamn  Washington Post did not call my son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. I was very upset about this.  This is a trend

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  story. Apparently, food  on TikTok  is just all the rage, recipes,  quick recipes, just exactly  like my son does Salt  Hank. He does not do quick  recipes. Salt underscore Hank.  They featured  some people, but not  Mr. Salt Hank, who is now  at 1.3 million  followers. 1.3 now?  Yeah. His most recent...  He put it up a few days ago.  Apparently, Mexican food  is really big.  Let me show you  his most recent. Well, if it's his burrito,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's not Mexican. No, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's no burritos. Yeah, California...  I think that's it. Is that it?  California burrito? Oh, he's at 1.4 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  20 million for this burrito?  So he put it up four days ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  20 million views.  But no,  Washington Post. Maybe I should call them on  deep background.  I know.  I know. I used Hank

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with one of my students this week. He was talking  about a desire to start things.  And she wanted to do travel. She wanted to do  gastro med. She wanted to do travel and  culture and food. And I told  her about Salt Hank. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want to hook him up with Chef Alex  who's a Mexican. He could do some great  TikToks for Alex who wants to get  better social. How does he shoot himself?  I've been meaning to ask you that. He's got  a Canon 5D Mark IV.  I gave him that. And he's got an iPhone.  He's got various... He's got lots of  lights and he's getting more and more  important all the time. You can tell, can't you?  You can tell.  So a couple of success  stories. I hope I'm not telling this out of  school. Lady Gaga's  people paid him money  to put here her latest single  in Bind.  That's awesome. Really? Wow.  That's awesome. Yeah.  Well, I think what's interesting...  This is the one. Can we play the music?  Probably not. They paid him a lot of money  to do it.  But I think it's interesting that  big performers, just like  Adele using the Amazon  ad, are going to TikTokers.  By the way, that few, I think she got a deal  $3.3 million on that video.  Nice.  So I think Lady Gaga, you should give  her some more money. And TikTok

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  didn't necessarily know that was an ad  so they weren't going to downgrade it.  They didn't. That's a good point.  Nobody tell TikTok, please.  Nobody tell TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's see. That was his Detroit pizza  recipe.  He has been approached by CAA  out of Hollywood. Oh, that's the  big Hollywood agency.  They're going to call him...  They have a name for it, like a  shadow client. He doesn't have to sign  a deal with them, but they've got a  relationship. He's going to appear  on some syndicated daytime  talk show. I can't remember the host.  He's going to explain to her. The Today

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Show has been booking the TikTokers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know. Everybody's doing it. It's a good  time to meet a TikTokker. I was going to

Transcript:  say Regis and Kathie Lee, but  the next version, you've got contacts there  still, huh? Yeah. I should probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  call them. They probably would love to do that, actually.  Yeah. Yeah, they would.  But he's got big agents now.  I don't know if I can reach him.  He's under CAA.  Can I speak to Hank? No, I think...  What would you like to... On deep background...  What else? A lot of success  stories. He was...  He sold three ads for $10,000  to... Get it.  Oh!  Oh! The biggest one. I remember the salt  The biggest one. He's going to make a salt.  He's going to make a line of salts.  And his biggest  investor is the founder  of FJerry. You know that?  Big, big...

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  ...to my ex-B's apology text.  Hey.  I know you're probably  never going to forgive me for what happened.  But I wanted a chance to explain.  I know it  wasn't right that I technically hooked up  with your roommate.  But I've been going through a lot.  And that's not who I am.  I've been failing  most of my classes.  You know I just got  fired.  So I would really appreciate it if you showed me  some sort of sympathy. What a burn.  Stop making me feel like a villain.  Plus, you've  been really busy at work.  I've been feeling really alone.  I was just really missing you.  It was a one-time mistake.  I love you  so much more than
