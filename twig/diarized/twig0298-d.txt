It's time for Twig This Week in Google. Jeff Jarvis is somewhere outside the United States.  Where is he today, Jason? He's in India? New Delhi?  You know, he told me and suddenly I forgot.  The problem is he's all over.  So anyway, he's outside of the internet.  If such a thing might exist.  Fortunately, we always have great people to fill in. Mike Elgin's here, our news director.  You had a busy morning with the Build Conference. We'll talk about that.  It was, yeah, we had an awesome show today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm excited, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's hard to believe that on a Twig, on a Google show, I would say I'm excited, but I am actually.  Aaron Newcomb is also here.  You see him all the time on All About Android and on Floss Weekly.  We love Aaron and he brought along his little Raspberry Pi project.  Yeah, I had to because I feel so inadequate sitting next to you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You guys are going to have to really keep me honest today.  But I did bring a project and we'll talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like you brought Watson.  I feel like Watson is sitting there ready to answer questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of like the opposite of Watson, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's backwards Watson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Backwards Watson, yeah, but it's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is a show where we talk about Google, the cloud, Twitter, of course, big in the news.  Twitter results got leaked, although I guess they didn't get leaked.  They released them ahead of time.  Right.  And the stock plummeted and they stopped trading briefly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it didn't plummet because of the leak.  It just plummeted because the leak was accurate.  They plummeted because the information was bad for Twitter.  Yeah.  So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they showed a profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They showed...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what went wrong at Twitter?  Why did the stock plummet?  First of all, we should say, A, don't get your stock advice from us.  That's not our job.  We're not here to make you money in the stock market.  We're here to talk about technology from the point of view of users of technology.  So if we say we hate Twitter, that doesn't mean it should sell the stock.  That means we don't like it as a user.  But...  And I think the stock price does not necessarily reflect the strength or weakness of a company.  It reflects what investors think they're going to be able to make or lose on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think one of the things people are talking about is that online advertising is hard right now.  Hard for some, not for Facebook and Google.  I think generally speaking what's happening is that everything's moving to mobile.  And mobile is less monetizable.  The prices are lower.  The eyeballs don't stick around as long.  It's difficult to monetize mobile users and everybody's becoming increasingly mobile.  Their revenue was up.  But their advertising dollars were not what anybody expected.  It's actually pretty dire in a way.  The problem is that Twitter has lots of eyeballs and they're having trouble figuring out how to monetize it.  And so what they're doing is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's always been the case.  The fact that they're monetizing it all is almost new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is the thing.  They began all these major initiatives to monetize.  They have suddenly lots of ads.  They're messing around with putting ads in the stream.  All that stuff has happened recently.  And so investors are like, okay, let's see the money now.  After all this time, let's see the money.  And the money that they are seeing is not what they expected.  It was a significant disappointment to just about everybody.  And something of a surprise, I think.  And so that was just I think part of the larger trend.  You see, and we're probably going to talk about Google's earnings report.  We're probably going to talk about Facebook and so on.  And you see this sort of hidden...  Google and Facebook are a lot more diversified.  They don't just have the one thing that they're trying to monetize.  But hidden in all this is the fact that advertising right now, there's a glut of ads.  Everybody's going mobile.  Eyeballs are super fickle.  And it's just really difficult.  They're going to have to go to increasing extremes, contextual advertising, retargeted marketing, and so on,  to get people to be able to monetize people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are they doing right now to make money?  I'll see a sponsored post in my tweet stream.  Well, for one thing, the first thing they're doing is shutting down third-party Twitter clients  because you don't see ads in third-party Twitter clients necessarily.  So they want you to use their own Twitter client on mobile or the website.  And that's where you'll see what sponsored posts, much like Facebook,  the second post in the news feed is always an ad.  So I'm seeing that. I'm starting to see that in Twitter, although not always.  And then you can buy—in fact, I don't see one in my Twitter feed right now—  and then you can buy followers by saying, here's a suggested follower.  And you can buy trends.  So you can say—but it will always say, won't it, sponsored or paid for or that kind of thing?  Here's, for instance, here's a who to follow Richard L. Trumka promoted.  Now, it's still somebody that I follow follows him.  So in that sense, you may not see that in your feed, but that's a promoted who to follow.  What's the issue? Are these not making as much money as they want them to make?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, one of the things that they did was they transitioned to—they have these downloadable ads,  and they transitioned to a system that instead of eyeballs,  they're actually more honest about it.  They're actually charging the advertisers when action is taken through the ad.  Ah, cost per action instead of cost per view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. And so they've gotten a hit there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're also having a retention problem, and this retention is on the high end,  so lots of people are leaving.  And so they say—what they said in the call yesterday was that they're doing all these different things  with algorithmic filtering and these different streams.  A la Facebook.  Yes, and they're saying that this is designed to retain these high end users.  I think that's the kind of thing that's driving away the high end users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, you could turn that off. So I got that.  Stuff you missed, and do you want to see this? And I immediately said no,  because I want to use Twitter in the old fashioned way.  But presumably people who are new to Twitter will say, oh, well, I guess that's how you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is something that—and again, they have better information than I do.  I don't know how much of this has spin, but my feeling has always been that they're trying so hard  to be Facebook, that they're alienating their most loyal users.  And what they're doing with those initiatives is going after the less loyal people.  And so they've got increasingly sort of novice, not really that committed to the platform kind of audience, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Well, that's true. I mean, if you look at their numbers, their users actually went up.  Their mobile users, which was stagnant over the past couple quarters, actually dramatically went up in this quarter.  So they're getting more eyeballs. But like you say, if they're loyal users, the people that are actually creating content are leaving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's a big problem. We've also talked about the fact that the market expects a certain amount of growth every quarter.  And Twitter is strongly motivated to maintain that growth.  And that's one of the things that's kept Twitter from booting spammers, trolls, other undesirables for Twitter,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is that they can't afford not to have that growth. But the spammers and trolls are yet another thing that's driving away the committed users.  How many reports have you seen of major celebrities, usually women, who basically say, I quit Twitter. I can't handle the vitriol anymore.  I can't handle the trolls. For every one of those famous people, there's probably a thousand people who aren't famous who are doing the same thing.  And so it's having the trolls and the harassment, I think, are probably having a suppressive sort of effect on conversation generally and engagement generally,  because it's really bad. And what's happened is that everybody else has gotten better troll control and Twitter has been lagging in that area.  And so the trolls have all just come rushing into Twitter. Twitter is the only game in town these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is because everybody else has effectively gotten rid of it, mostly because of a real names policy, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. And YouTube...  Google Plus doesn't do it anymore, but...  Exactly. But Google Plus, like if a troll posts...  It's easy to get rid of them.  Again, we've had this conversation a million times. I can delete the trolls' message.  Right. Right.  Whereas on Twitter, their solution was algorithmic filtering.  Hide it.  Hide it from you. Everybody else still sees it, the trolls do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In your article, you wrote a great article on this. What do you liken it to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's like if you call the police because there's an armed intruder on your lawn, they come and close the curtains.  They say, just don't look.  Yeah. The problem is that you're upset about it.  Just don't look.  Exactly. And that article brought in the rarely discussed aspect of trolling that is reputation management.  So if somebody's trashing your reputation in public, not knowing that it's happening doesn't help your reputation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Reputation management is a much larger conversation because that is a big issue.  When I talk to kids, teenagers, I say, I hate to have to say this, but make a website.  Put stuff you are proud of up there because if you don't show up in the Google search  and then somebody posts a video of you beating somebody or barfing in the corner or drunk,  that's the video everybody's going to see because that's going to be the only search result for you.  That's a very tough thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's huge, especially for college kids. People are looking to get into the job market in a few years.  That's the first thing you do when you go to interview someone is you do a Google search on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only reason I have a job is because they didn't have all these recording devices when I was in high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you imagine if there were a picture of me floating around with a giant bong?  Actually, there is, but that's... I was the one who posted that.  Last weekend.  No, it was from college.  Darn it.  But actually, in a way, that's changed mores, hasn't it?  Because it's hard to find... We went from President Clinton saying, but I didn't inhale, to Obama saying, woo-hoo!  Because everybody, by this time, everybody has some sort of checkered past.  So to wrap up the Twitter conversation, do you think the market is right?  Is Twitter headed for tough times, or is this just a temporary blip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the market is wrong. I think Twitter has a bright future financially.  There's something going on there.  What they did was they just also announced yesterday, and this is, I think, an underappreciated story.  They acquired a retail retargeting company called Telepart.  And what they do is they're about to initiate this super buy button concept, where basically you'll see an ad.  The ad will say, buy now. You'll click the button. They're going to turn Twitter into Amazon.  That's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But in a way, really, that is an instantiation of what Twitter could be in general, which is this signaling box.  It's not just for buying things. It's for anything. For a news story or a show you're interested in.  And if you follow the right signals, you get all this. And that's what makes Twitter work.  If you follow the right signals, it's wonderful.  If you want to know, if you're watching Game of Thrones live and you want to have a conversation about it, where do you go?  You don't go to Google+. You don't go to Facebook. You go to Twitter.  Because that's where real-time conversations happen.  I have to say, because of this, I've been loading the Twitter page.  It's much more visual than it used to be.  And one of the reasons I now use, first of all, there's the green line for conversations.  One of the reasons I now use the website as much as anything else.  Look at how visual it is. How much more than just 140 characters it is.  In fact, you get a lot of people, I'll scroll down a little bit, posting paragraphs of texts in picture form.  So they can get around the 140 character limit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I've never liked Twitter. I'm not a big Twitter fan.  And I've always thought, okay, it's going to go belly up eventually, right?  As newer platforms come up. Somehow they've been able to hang on to it.  And the thing that they've done really well, and I think this actually goes to why the stock price fell so much,  is everybody sees Twitter. You watch CNN. I watch Survivor, right?  Everything that happens on Survivor, there's a hashtag for it.  And so they've done really well about getting out in front of people's faces with these hashtags.  And then you take a look at their numbers, and you're like, holy cow, they missed their Wall Street estimate by whatever it was.  $40 million. I thought they were doing well, you know?  And so then you sell the stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, I just found a link. Apple found a defect in a key component of the Apple Watch.  Dow Jones has reported. The story is developing. So we don't know what it is.  But it has hit Apple a little bit, a drop in the stock price.  Breaking news.  Breaking news from Twitter.  Yes.  How about that, ladies and gentlemen?  Here's breaking news. I just got a text from Apple who had, they had, I ordered, remember, 10 minutes after midnight.  My bad. Sorry. I'm sorry, Apple. I'm a bad person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're about four minutes late, two late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So we was able to get the 38 millimeter, which is leases, because nobody apparently has small risks.  And they said my 42 wouldn't come for a few weeks. It's going to come tomorrow.  Oh.  So I've started to hear this now from people. I know this isn't the Apple Watch show, but you know, the Apple Watch has this, it metastasizes into all of our programs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it does. It's like a disease.  And the other funny thing that we reported on Google, on tech news today this morning is that Apple has banned apps that keep time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you already have a watch. You want another one?  You know why? I think because it's a side, it's a side way to get different watch faces in there.  Right?  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  And Apple doesn't want you to do that yet, partly because of battery life issues.  There was rumor that they had banned Pebble compatibility on the iPhone, but that apparently Apple's denying now.  But they have a long history.  Oh, yeah. Yeah.  So I haven't found any defects in the Apple Watch, but if I find any, I'll let CNBC know immediately.  Let's talk about Google's results, because those are in, they missed estimates.  Now, this is an example. When you miss estimates, that doesn't necessarily mean a bad thing, but it means the stock market punishes you because the stock market is based on rumor.  Cap costs, caps costs as growth slows. Say that five times. Google caps costs as growth slows, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Revenue though up 12%. And how's their mobile doing? Because that's the question, isn't it, with Twitter, with Facebook, and with Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, cost per click fell 7%.  That's a trend, right?  Exactly. And this is another thing that I'm talking about. There's these little cracks in the online advertising world in this move to mobile. It's not as monetizable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just to define that, that means, and the way Google works with its advertising, they do an auction.  So there's no set price for a Google ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like buying an airline ticket or something like that. It's flex pricing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're bidding for a keyword like lawyer, you're going to pay a lot more because there's others bidding for that.  And that was really smart of Google. It was a way for Google to make sure they maximized revenue.  But when you see the cost per click go down, that means that the bids are lower. People are not willing to pay as much. It means ultimately the ads are not as effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. And the reason that's bad news for us is because in order for companies like Google to monetize mobile ads better, they're going to have to be a lot more intrusive.  And I'm talking auto playing video ads. I'm talking all the stuff that people hate.  We don't want that.  Well, it's common because that's the only way they're going to be able to monetize and continue their growth.  And of course, Google did report the growth that you mentioned. And the dollar figure on that was just under $14 billion of revenue.  So that's, you know, despite what the investors are doing, Google is a incredibly wealthy company making a ton of money.  One of the most interesting things from this report, in my opinion, was that now 55 percent of their revenue comes from outside the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like Apple, too. Apple had a 30 percent growth mostly from China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this isn't from China. So Google doesn't get revenue from China. That's why this is such a huge figure.  I mean, before Apple was in China, which is fairly recent, before they were in China Mobile, which is the big carrier in China,  and before they really made their big push into China, it was way less than that.  I mean, it was, you know, in terms of their Chinese revenue. So this is there's 55 percent without.  And the reason that's a big deal is because a big, big chunk of that is Europe.  And Google is struggling with Europe over privacy, antitrust and all kinds of other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the euro is struggling. So as the exchange rate for the dollar remains strong and the euro weakens, that means everybody loses money.  That's a problem for all companies. All U.S.-based companies are getting less money out of Europe.  So profits were fine. Revenue was fine. They just didn't meet analysts' estimate.  But there is a sign, some signs of weakness. You know, the falling price of Google ads is a long-term problem that Google has to deal with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, another interesting data point here is their expenses, which I'm always concerned about.  They got balloons and self-driving cars and all that stuff. And I'm like, how much is this costing?  You know, they're selling these inexpensive little online ads and they're doing, and they're paying for all this stuff.  And that was a concern in past analyst reports. This time they've stabilized it to a certain extent.  They did rise. Total cost and expenses rose 13% to 12.8.810.  But look at the R&D increase.  Yes, almost 30%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was a 46% increase last quarter, a 29% increase this quarter.  That tells me, and that's a knob that Larry turns, right?  That tells me that in response to the softness thing, things like ad sales, Google's saying, all right, turn up the knob.  We need to find the next big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right. And Google's pretty good at this.  I mean, if you compare them to a company like Microsoft, which has excellent research, Microsoft Research is a phenomenal organization.  It is, but they've had a hard time making a product out of it.  Exactly. Google, if you look at Google Glass, for example, everybody's, we've talked about a million times,  you know, they had this research project, which they turned into a big beta program, essentially,  and then they steamrolled it right into a product division.  And now Luxottica is going to be coming out with Google Glass, you know, hopefully a more elegant version of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My Google Glass is not going to save Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. But my point is, look at the time from, here's an idea for a research project to product.  I mean, two years, it's really gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if you think about it, the most successful Google X project I could think of is autonomous vehicles.  Will Google make any money out of that, though?  It's clearly they pushed this forward. But is it Google that's going to make the profits from this?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and they're working with all these manufacturers, right?  Do they have patents? Do they have?  They must have some patents, absolutely. But it's tough.  I mean, when I was at, this reminds me of Sun a little bit.  We're not that far down the road with Google yet, but we had all kinds of smart people working at Sun, right?  And they're doing all these crazy R&D projects, which is great.  But they're not monetized. Like the projects never go anywhere.  At the end, we were acquiring companies that were just failing left and right.  Think about Xerox PARC.  Xerox PARC, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, there's a book, How Xerox Invented the Future and Didn't Make Any Money on It, or something like that.  Right, exactly.  Think about HP.  This is a story that's more often the case than otherwise.  And I think it's going to happen to the vast majority of tech companies are not going to be able to.  We've talked about this on triangulation with people and so forth.  It is, there is a business cycle. There's always been a business cycle.  Instead of 20 years or 50 years or 100 years, it's now 10.  And a company like Microsoft that was on top for two decades, there's no guarantee that third decade will keep you on top.  I have to say, and we've been watching the Build coverage today, I should mention that Mary Jo and Paul are at Build.  That's why we didn't do a Windows Weekly today.  We will do it Friday, 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern Time, 2100 UTC, day after tomorrow.  That's going to be fantastic.  I saw some beer in there.  There is.  And it's not the regular beer.  Beer is arriving.  Beer has been coming in trucks.  I don't know who they think is going to drink this.  We have a sellout crowd, by the way, so if you've received a ticket from tickets at twit.tv, you're welcome.  But if you haven't, there is a waiting list, but I think we're full.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fortunately, we don't have a sellout staff.  They're not a bunch of sellouts.  Never.  Just the audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they're crack. They're crack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before we move on from this concept of getting research projects into products, I think an underappreciated situation at Google is Project Tango, which strikes me as the perfect example.  Project Tango, you've heard of it.  It's a research project where you use a tablet or a smartphone to 3D map the indoor spaces very rapidly.  And what's brilliant about this is this is something Google probably started working on seriously a year or two ago, maybe a year and a half ago, something like that.  The technology is such that they have the technology to do this.  And if they had smartphones that actually had this technology, they would cost $10,000 per phone.  They would be like Apple phones.  So it would be really, really expensive, which is perfect.  Exactly how you want to do it.  They're building these things because it's a high margin device.  But Moore's law, by the time this thing is a product, these will be $1,000 phones, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google, I wonder because I feel like Google was founded by two smart guys who were cognizant of the issues of keeping a tech company on top.  And from the very beginning, it wasn't, you know, Microsoft's business was we're going to we want a computer on every desktop running Microsoft software.  That was that was how they started.  That was their model for many, many decades.  It's changed a little bit now.  It had to.  But Google, you know, you could say their model there was originally to organize the world's information.  They certainly said that a lot at the beginning.  Perhaps they got seduced by selling ads against it.  But they're really a big data company.  I think they understand that their business is about data, about collecting it, about using it intelligently, analyzing it.  So Tango is a perfect example.  What is that?  That's a data collection device in a smart.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  That's what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And basically what it what it can do is it can basically very rapidly build into your phone for an application, a game or a virtual reality thing.  You can put this thing as with a with a sort of Google cardboard type of virtual reality thing and you can integrate do Microsoft HoloLens type integrations of the 3D physical space with the game.  So a ball bounces on the actual couches there and bounces off the walls because it knows where the couch and the walls are.  And so this this is uses some very high end graphics processing.  It's very high tech stuff, but they've got a bunch of really smart people working on it.  They've got a bunch of partners working on it.  And it's really exciting technology that is absolutely going to be in all of our smartphones in a few years.  And Google is all over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've already got Project Ira.  I know, Jason, you'd probably talk about that a little bit more and all about Android.  But that's the thing they acquired from Motorola.  Essentially, it was a modular smartphone.  Build your own smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People complain to me all the time that we don't talk about Project Ira.  Well, you know, it's going to be really you.  You know, I don't want a phone that's going to rattle around in my hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got to send me to Puerto Rico next.  That's where you get it.  That's right. They're going to have it in taco trucks in Puerto Rico.  We're all going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't want to.  I've had we had that.  That was the visor.  Remember that with the visor had those modules that you would put in the back.  I don't want a phone with pieces falling off of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's actually if you like the concept of modular phone, there's actually a product you can invent.  There's actually a product you can invest in on Kickstarter.  The news hit today.  It's a it's a product called the next pack.  So any ex paq.  And it's a modular case for both iPhone and Galaxy.  Now, here's what's interesting.  The modules are interchangeable between the iPhone and the Android.  It does look like Eric, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is, again, a case that will add a speaker.  It'll add a super high powered flashlight.  It'll add like all this different stuff to battery would be nice.  They do have that as well.  The battery doesn't take up the whole back like other batteries.  There's room for other stuff.  Yeah.  But how much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, pledge.  Thirty nine dollars or more.  You get the special edition US.  You get one module.  Seventy five for the SDK.  Here you go.  Eighty nine bucks.  And you get that in four modules.  All right. I might do that.  That's got an SD card reader for your iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Imagine that temperature and humidity sensors.  I don't need that.  Oh, we don't need any of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is obviously going to be another one of my Kickstarter boondoggles.  Here's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a breathalyzer module.  So if you want to make sure that you can drive legally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure. I need that.  Yeah. I get in the car and wonder all the time, what is my blood alcohol level?  I wouldn't. I maybe I'll back this project.  I haven't I haven't wasted money on Kickstarter in a long time.  What do you get for 99 bucks?  Beta bundle for iPhone 6.  I don't care about beta bundles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason, there's a video on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, they do support both the S6, which I kind of like that.  January of next year.  Oh, wait a minute.  But for a little more money, I can get the magenta version.  Or do I want green?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, think of all the money you'll save not going to Puerto Rico.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I see. It's the trim.  It is a little bit like all right, isn't it?  There's no way this is going to ever emerge from the Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you'll be waiting for years.  Yes, unfortunately.  That's the downside of Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. A lot of times people go to Kickstarter, as I just did, and say, oh, it's like a store.  I'm going to buy. I think I'll buy the green one.  And what in fact happens is nothing.  Because these guys have never I don't know if you should check.  Have they ever made anything?  Have they dealt with China before?  Do they know what making physical objects entails?  That's a challenge.  That's a whole different kettle of fish.  But I like the idea.  So back to Google, though, and Google R&D.  Some of it seems crazy, but you know, in almost every case, I think what's what's worked for Google is this undercurrent of, you know, we just want more data.  Yes.  And we'll figure out a way to monetize.  It's nice to have a business model where you could say, well, this is our underlying vision.  And we and we don't have to judge whether we're going to make money on a R&D project, just whether it will support the underlying vision.  And then we trust that the vision is well enough designed that we will make money out of it.  Does that does that feel like what they're doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like to use the word vision for Google.  I don't think they're a visionary company.  They have a philosophy.  They have a general philosophy about data.  Which is that number there are two essential ways that they look at the world that's different.  The first one, and this is goes back to Larry and Sergey.  They think big, big, big, big, big.  You know, somebody will say, hey, you know, let's let's build like, like, maybe we should build like a little satellite and put it in space.  And they'll say, no, let's build a space elevator.  You know, they think just gigantic in terms of you.  You see this in all the books, especially like in the Plex, all the books about Google.  They just take everything that normal people think about and they multiply it by 100 and say, let's do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's why their R&D budget is billions of billions.  I think you have a really good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you look at what they've done well, I mean, it goes all the way back to the beginning to the search engine.  Right. Tons of data.  They've done really well at that.  You look at my brain just went you look at what they did like Android was YouTube.  Well, Android's like the third generation.  If you look at what they're doing now with things like the Google Now integration, which they just announced, they're doing more integration from apps to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now Google as an ISP facilitates that both terrestrial and mobile because they've got Google.  Why now they have Google gigabit in some cities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was it.  So you've got the second wave.  Right. So you've got that you've got the browser search engines first, then ads, now Android.  And if you look at I think it's somewhere in the rundown.  Chrome. Same thing.  They want to own end to end.  They own they can gather data from all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the data gathering points.  But it's data on you.  And you think there's pushback now from society.  In fact, somebody in the chat room is saying that it's coming to an end says RF 2020 privacy by design is becoming necessary.  And isn't that antithetical to what Google wants?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have been very publicly embracing this notion of I'll give you everything you want Google because I feel like I'm getting my money's worth out of Google.  In other words, I don't care what Google knows about me.  Right.  It's not like I'm going to see more ads.  I already see ads on every surface.  It's a Philip K. Dick universe already.  So if they're more targeted, that's better.  As far as I'm concerned, at least I won't see ads for things I can't use.  But are they better targeted?  No, they're not.  That's why I want to give them more information.  I want to help you, Google.  I want your ads to be better targeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's why this Google Now thing, I think, is so important and cool and what they're doing.  So they want Google Now to become your interface.  This is the interface to my world.  This is the place where I spend my first minute of the day or that minute where I just want to know what's going on.  They want to take your eyeballs and dump them into Google Now.  And the way that they're doing that is making it more relevant by pulling this information from the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Now now tells me when a bill is going to be due.  Like tomorrow your PG&E bill is due.  That's useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The reason we're so excited about Google Now is it's the one rare example where contextual information actually works.  You know, you look at I saw ads on I think was YouTube today.  It was in another language.  I mean, I didn't even recognize the language.  How do they not know that I don't speak whatever that language is?  Wow, look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Spotify.  Yeah, all kinds of stuff.  Seventy. Seventy related partnerships.  So this is new integration.  This is new.  We added 70 new partnerships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do I turn that on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think it would be a good idea to install the app.  So if I have I use Wunderlist as my to do list or I have Pandora or Kayak or Waze.  But I have it by virtue of having that app installed.  Somehow Google Now will now say that's a signal.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The developers of those apps have have tapped into Google Now will feed that information in certain ways.  There's also this bottom half of the of this entire gigantic list is now cards from Gmail markup.  These are all the companies, you know, all the the the partners that when you get an email from them with any sort of information feeds into Google Now in helpful ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So now travel and this can be troubling, though, because if Google Now has a thousand cards every time I go there, this is just my inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am not worried about that because every time I go to Google Now, I'm like, give me more.  Give me an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I got a card Android 5.0 Lollipop update for the Galaxy S5 Galaxy Note 4.  And it's saying, is this car useful right now?  So I can I'm always nervous about this because I don't want to say no, because maybe I won't.  I mean, it's kind of semi useful.  Right. What should I do now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the question. But, you know, I got a I got a card.  I'll say yes. What the heck?  So you can say yes. There's restaurants nearby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not getting all of those cool integrations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got one from because Jason contacted me to be to come be a host, right, a co-host on the show.  And it said, is this something you're interested in following?  And when I said yes, it went ahead and set up the appointment on my calendar and did all this great.  So it's like one click integration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you see people, their reaction is going to be how did it know that it read my email?  What the hell? Yeah.  Don't you think that's the kind of the reaction people are going to have about that?  As long as I don't have to read my email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some people, some people will. Other people will be glad to give up for the convenience factor.  It's all about the convenience factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm thrilled. Here's the very first card is, of course, this show.  And there's a button which I like. That seems new.  Email everyone so I can now email everybody who's attached to that appointment if I am running late or if there are any actions.  Just you, Jason. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use any do which I love any do integration with any do.  So now, you know, if I have a reminder, it'll pop up on here now, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So does that just is that just going to now just happen?  How does that because I have most of those apps or many of those apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, the one thing that I don't know is whether there's an update to Google search that has to roll out for that to be enabled.  And I think that is the case, which will happen in the next week or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is, you know, it's really interesting.  In every case we've been covering Google very closely for now for 10 years.  In every case, I think, oh, they've got this great new stuff.  I can't wait. Face recognition. Yeah.  Which, you know, they're good at, but they haven't.  They're slow to roll some of this stuff out. I guess it's probably prudent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They put this amazing technology on Google Plus where they could recognize whether it was a dog or a cat, the picture, a baby or an adult, whether you're smiling or not.  Smiling or not smiling. Where is it? I don't know.  You know, it's like useless in Google Plus if it's still there.  Nobody uses it as far as I know. But it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, somebody saying you can turn apps on or off in the Google Now settings.  There's a downloaded apps section. All right.  Well, let me take a look at that. So now cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, there have been some apps already tapping into Google now.  So this is not the beginning of it. It's just a broadening of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that this is maybe you have a newer version than I have because I don't.  Yeah, I don't see that in my settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't seen an update to my search app and I'm pretty positive that's what's going to be required in order to get some of these changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see customized Google now. Oh, should I go to the custom?  So if you go to it, yeah, go to that. That's a different menu. Yeah.  Yeah. And then you should have customized. If you click on the hamburger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, customize. All right. Let's see what's in here.  Come here, baby. All right.  This is, by the way, the oh, yeah, download apps.  So your sports stocks places. This is where you control this.  This is much like Cortana on Windows Phone, where when you first set up Cortana, the speech recognition and Windows Phone,  you tell her your interests, what you want to know about the disadvantage Microsoft has is unless you're using Bing all the time  and you're really in the Microsoft ecosystem, they're not going to know as much about you.  It's interesting. It's becoming a Microsoft versus Google war here.  Who are you more plugged into? So receive now cards from your downloaded apps.  Yes. Also, I can turn this on. Continuing receiving now cards from ways.  Yes. So I haven't yet. It hasn't yet populated this individual apps, but I have turned that on.  All right. Thank you. So it is in there. It is in there. Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're starting to surface cards in Google now where if you're driving and it knows you're driving, it will tell you, oh, these are the gas stations that are on your route.  It should say put your phone away, you nitwit. That's what it should say. Google would never do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the parking one, I think, has been out for a little bit, but I'm getting parking. I love that.  Yeah, I love that. It says you parked and here's where you parked. Yeah. So I get parking. It's a map of where you parked.  Parking locations. You know, my son does a lot of Team Fortress 2. So I get any place sometimes that connects to mine.  He's playing on your Steam account. Team Fortress 2. Exactly. That's the problem. I have the same problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But you know, I like it because it makes me look like a better gamer than I am. It does, doesn't it? Yeah.  I got thousands of points or whatever achievements. Man, you're good at TF2. Yes, I am pretty good. Yes, I am. I'm almost as good as a 12 year old boy.  Yeah, look at this added quite a bit actually. So that's cool. Yeah. But again, that's the big data, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's the data analysis that they can do. They're plugging into anything and everything to get in front of you more often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Keep track of this event. I get a lot of event in my email. So you can say whether your story is to read. You know what? This is pretty amazing now.  I tell you. Yeah. The next thing is to put this, I don't know, in some sort of head mounted display. That's the problem with Google Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's never right there unless you have a Chromebook. Now it's on the Chromebook when you open the Chromebook. There it is.  Yeah. But yeah, you always have to remember to go find it. And that's just not how this should work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you use the Google launcher on Android, you swipe left from the home page and there's your Google Now cards. Maybe that's one of the ways to do it. Such a hassle.  I love the Chromebook. I'm sorry, but that's one reason a Chromebook is a great choice is if you're in the Google verse, which obviously we are sucked into the Google verse.  All right. Let's take a break. I want to see your Aaron's Arcade. Aaron Newcomb is a maker. Yep.  And the last time we saw a project of yours, you had an old time radio that was playing old time radio shows like Lawrence Welk. Like Lawrence Welk.  And out of an old time radio, but it was over the Internet from a Raspberry Pi. So let's see what he's got here. Aaron's Arcade.  But first a word from Braintree. If you're a mobile developer, you must know about Braintree. If you're a mobile developer, then you need to know about Braintree.  Braintree is a payments API. If you go to BraintreePayments.com, you can find out all about it. That makes it very easy for you.  Well, let's see. Let's say you've got a mobile app and you want to accept payments. Would you like to accept? I don't know. Bitcoin? Sure. No problem.  Apple Pay? Of course. PayPal? Yeah. Credit cards of any kind? Yes. Venmo? You know about that? That's awesome. Yeah. They accept it all.  They accept it all. And it's with a couple of lines of code in your app. That's what I love about this. The payments API is used by so many great companies.  They're used by Uber and Lyft. You know it must be good if Uber and Lyft use it. And Airbnb and Living Social.  GitHub started when they first started taking payments with Braintree. And Braintree has grown with them. They can start from one transaction a day to millions a day.  They can grow with you. And right now, if you want to try it, we're going to give you a great deal for a startup for somebody who's just getting going.  Your first $50,000 in transactions are fee free. So that really gives you a chance to get going. And by the time you're getting $50,000 in transactions, you're ready. You're doing it.  BraintreePayments.com slash twig to get that special offer. BraintreePayments.com slash twig. When you create an account, you'll be able to use their sandbox to actually see what your app would look like with Braintree.  It works with all the languages, Node, and everything that you use, .NET. Makes it very, very easy. BraintreePayments.com. I think seven different programming languages.  And look at all the companies that use Braintree. StubHub uses Braintree. Unrelated to GitHub. Airbnb, Hotels Tonight, the travel industry. I love it. BraintreePayments.com slash twig.  I want you to check it out if you want to take payments. And by the way, fast payouts and great support. This is the place. From your first dollar to your billions. BraintreePayments.com slash twig. First $50,000.  Fee free. Pretty good deal. Google's offering to buy patents. I like this. At first I thought, oh great, they want to be in the patent troll business. Then I thought, no, no, no, that's not it at all. They're taking these patents off the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From trolls. Because what happens is if you have a patent and you want to monetize it, you're not going to sue Google. So you're going to go find a patent troll who's going to pay you a ton of money and then they're going to sue Google.  And Google says, you know what, let's just skip all that. We'll buy it. If we might use it sometime in the future, we'll buy it. So they're having tryouts. There's two weeks during the month of May when you can go and submit your patent.  They'll check it out and buy it sometime in June I think it is. I love this. June 26th they will tell you yes or no about whether or not they'll buy your patent. I love this. And they said think of it like a 20% project for Google's patent lawyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Give them a little something to do with their free time. That's right. Have you received a Project Fi invite? Has anybody yet? Do we know anybody who has? I haven't got an invite. We all applied. I haven't heard of any invites yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually have a Nexus 6 but I couldn't apply for it because it goes through my work. I was bluffing. You have your Google for Work account. No, it's for NetApp. They pay for my bill and all that kind of stuff. So you can't apply for it? I can't apply for it. You can apply for it and then get your own Nexus 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have to expense my bill. You can make payments on it. One of the options is checkbox options. They'll send you the phone and then you pay for it. It's like T-Mobile or something. 20 bucks a month. Yeah. You can do a subsidy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a Nexus 6 just waiting. I love the idea. It's not much cheaper when you add it all up. It's pretty much the same as I'm already paying. But you get the carryover, which is the best part. So if you look at the month to month, it's not much cheaper. In some cases it's more expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But because you get that carryover, you can kind of budget for that worst case month of the 5 gig month. And then every other month you're only doing 3 gigs so your bill gets lowered every other month. So I think it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you travel a lot, it's a great idea because again, there's no contract. So you can just cancel it and then go back to it and go back and forth depending on what's favorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think what's going to hurt them out of the gate is the Nexus 6. You have to have a Nexus 6. Or maybe another phone from Huawei or somebody else. We'll see what happens. But right out of the gate, part of their earnings announcement we just talked about was the slip in Nexus, their Nexus brand.  So the Nexus 6 apparently isn't doing too well. Sales are dropping. And yet they're trying to roll out Google Fi and say you have to have a Nexus 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody wants a Nexus 6. That's really the problem. I do. It's all about the price. Why do you like the Nexus 6? Well yeah, but the Nexus 6 is not a cheap Nexus phone.  Exactly. The Nexus 5 was super cheap. If you want a Nexus, buy a OnePlus One. Now with Lollipop on it, the Oxygen OS is basically pure Lollipop. And it's 350 bucks. It's a Nexus priced phone.  I think they'll extend it to Android generally at some point. Or release new phones that support it. I think it's a hardware issue. I think you have to have a phone that can support the handoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A phone that's fast enough to do the handoff between WiFi and the two different cellular networks. And that's what gets me is even on my Nexus 6 I have a hard time. I leave the house and sometimes it thinks I'm still connected to WiFi. And I have to go in and manually turn WiFi off.  Every day I do that. You do. So is this going to be a problem then on Google Fi? If it doesn't work right now, how is it going to automatically switch networks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This Edge, the S6 Edge is a T-Mobile phone. So it does WiFi calling. And it's just completely transparent. I walk out the door, call continues, picks up on the cell network. T-Mobile happens to be very good in Petaluma so I don't care if Sprint is there or not.  It tells me when I'm on WiFi immediately calls will be made over WiFi. And I could of course turn that off if I want. So the settings in this are WiFi preferred, cellular network preferred, never use cellular network. Or just turn it off entirely.  And it works well. So Google did put an app in the app store. I don't know if you applied for an invite and install the app. Do you think you have a better shot at it? The app does nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wondered about that. Does that signal that you're even more serious? By installing it on your Nexus 6?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to install it on my no carrier Motorola Nexus 6. That should tell them. I'm sitting here waiting for you Google. Waiting for you. I'm going to install it on the Edge as well.  Actually there's no point installing it on the Edge because it will only work with the Nexus 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It actually lets you though?  Yeah, that's surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me see. It doesn't say it's not grayed out. T-Mobile, Samsung. So I'll install it on this too. I don't know what will happen. Congratulations. Here's an app that will never do anything.  There's an obvious flaw.  You can use this to activate your Project Fi service to manage your account settings, check your data usage, see your monthly statements or get in touch with support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apps nowadays are just all about mind share. It's like a little ad. Look at Apple. All the iPhones have Apple Watch icons and they even have the feature if you walk into Starbucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This happened to me. I was next door to Starbucks and a little Starbucks icon popped up. What the hell? I don't want that. So I signed up anyway.  It does it in the handoff. So when your iPhone is turned off, this is a new thing they added. I have an icon for a camera there but a little Starbucks icon popped up because I was near a Starbucks.  And I just had to see what do they want? And then they said, well, on your birthday we'll give you a free coffee. So I signed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not an ad. It's a feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In their defense, I had already installed the Starbucks app in my passbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you hadn't, it would have suggested it.  Really? It would say tap here to download the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's criminal. Talk about Philip K. Dick advertising everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the technology they're using is Apple iBeacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was next door to the Starbucks. So it wasn't in the Starbucks. But it was close enough that iBeacon thought I was there.  But you know Google will do that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right now Google Wallet will pull up your loyalty cards if you're nearby. And it does that based on location though. It says, oh, I see you're near CVS.  Does it pull it up without me going into the wallet?  Yeah, I get a notification. Yeah, I get a note. Well, but it's not signing up for anything.  It's just saying you've already registered this loyalty card in the app.  So would you like to use it? It's like a shortcut, which is kind of nice because, you know, I don't know why.  But it's nice. It's a big long CVS receipt. You know, you got to make it as long as possible.  So you have to use your loyalty card a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. What else here? Oh, sad story.  Of course, we all heard about the tragedy in Nepal. More than 2500 deaths so far. Actually more than 5000, I think, the last count I saw.  Yeah.  And one of them, a Google executive, he was in charge of privacy at Project X. We were talking about Google's R&D arm.  Dan Fredenberg, friend to many people I know. I don't know Dan myself, but a lot of people posting this.  His sister posted on his Instagram account saying that he had died. He was at base camp, I guess, preparing to climb Everest.  A big Everest season begins in a couple of weeks. So people are already at base camp getting acclimated to the oxygen.  He was there. There was a massive, I don't know if you've seen the YouTube video, but dramatic video, a massive avalanche onto base camp.  I saw that. Oh, man. Scary.  17 climbers killed, including Mr. Fredenberg. So a sad story. Google has done their people finder again, which is great for Nepal.  That is a huge benefit. My son, a kid that we know, he grew up with, was in Nepal.  And Saturday, Spencer's mom called and said, Spencer's out, we don't know where he is, he's out of touch. Here's this video.  Please, this is very dramatic. Avert your eyes if there's no blood and guts. But it's pretty terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What it shows is that there was literally nowhere to run. Basically, if a rock got you, you were done for. And if it didn't, you were lucky. And that was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Huge avalanche. That's a wall of snow. And that'll give you nightmares. And there you go.  Anyway, Spencer did call by sat phone yesterday and reported in and he's OK. So and we had talked to Chris Marquardt on Saturday on the radio show.  He was very worried about a Nepalese friend of his who ran a very popular cafe in Kathmandu, had been not had been not heard from.  But he was heard from. And one of the things a lot of people are using is Facebook dot com slash safety check.  Have you seen this? This is Facebook started to do it this last year after another natural disaster.  It knows where you are. So if you're in the affected area, it will pop up a thing saying post a status update to let your friends know you're OK.  And and if you're not, you can see how your friends are. And it says here, none of my friends are appear to be in the affected area.  I asked Chris Marquardt about this. I said Kathmandu and Nepal in general, very poor country.  He said, yes, but they're all on Facebook on their phones. So this is actually a huge value. Yeah.  And in case of an emergency. And of course, we encourage people to donate to contribute.  There are lots of good charities. Apple has put a Red Cross donation button as they've done in the past on their iTunes store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the one I donated to. It's a direct relief, just direct relief dot org.  And they've pledged there for the earthquake situation in Nepal.  They're going to donate every single bit of money that's donated to relief and recovery efforts.  And they've done this for a lot of other natural disasters and donation opportunities that exist.  So I would highly recommend going to direct relief dot org and donating there if you haven't done so already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will. That's great. Five Star Charity from Charity Navigator.  And you do you I love giving to a charity where the vast majority, in this case, 100 percent go to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I believe that I mean, that's why they're called Direct Relief.  That's their that's their mission is to use as much money that's donated as possible to go towards the relief effort of whatever the situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some people want to go rushing to disaster areas to help. Never do that.  Always stay home and send money. Much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let the NGOs, the trained professionals, the Red Cross, UNICEF, the people who know what to do and how to do it.  Let them do it. You don't want to cause chaos. Good.  That's a great tip. Direct Relief dot org.  And our sympathy to Dan's family and friends. Absolutely.  A lot of people knew Dan and he was very much like it's kind of a great tragedy, but one of many thousands of tragedies in Nepal right now.  Have you started using notes and directions from search on desktop?  This is weird. You could send it to your phone. So you do a search.  Tell me how this works. I do a search for directions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. If you do a if you go to Google, just open up a Google.  I think this is what we're talking about.  Open up a Google. Google dot com.  Type in send directions. Send directions.  Actually, tried this earlier. So cool.  That's it. Just send it. Oh, I said direct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google knows, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's my phone's located.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is interesting because this is on my desktop, but it knows where my phone is.  And by the way, because I have many phones, I can choose.  But it's looking at the Galaxy S6. Where do I want to go?  Let's see. I want to go to Reading, California right now.  It'll do the directions. And now I press send directions to my phone.  You know, I do that all the time. It's funny.  I use like push bullet and things like that to do that third party applications.  Your phone should buzz. Did it buzz?  It hasn't buzzed me yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mine buzzed almost immediately when I did it earlier today. I was like very impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unfortunately, Project Phi has stopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you should sign up for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There it is. Got it. Look at that.  It says pull up for details about this place. And there it is.  There's directions to Reading. Wow, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can also use the search bar to set reminders and alarms and send that to your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And of course, we talked about this a couple of weeks ago. You can search for your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where is my phone? Find my phone. Find my device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This all makes sense. And again, this is the ecosystem play.  And in some ways, I hate it if it's a closed ecosystem.  We talk about Apple's ecosystem. It's a lock-in.  Is this a lock-in to Google? It certainly incents you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would be more inclined to blame Apple.  I bet you that Google would love to have this support on Apple.  But they're the ones. And this is the biggest thing that sucks about the iPhone and Apple.  Is that they're so anti-Google. They're irrationally harming users.  Because the best experience, in my opinion, is an Apple device with all the Google stuff.  Yeah, you carry an iPhone.  But I want Google now to be more integrated. I want all these other integrations.  I don't want to have Bing come up as the default when I search for things.  I don't want Twitter and Facebook to be the default where there's no possibility of using Google+.  And it's one of those things where they've got this be in their bonnet about this other company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By default, if I search on my watch, Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I want to search Google Search. I want to use Google Maps.  I want the Google-y stuff on my Apple device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To be fair, Google does the same thing to Windows Phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To be fair.  Windows Phone has no market share. I mean, they have a business reason for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess. I'd be much more likely to use Windows Phone if it supported all my Google services, but it doesn't.  So what do I use? I use Android.  I'm really, by the way, schizophrenic because I want to use the Apple Watch.  And so I have to carry two phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have two pockets. You have two arms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I feel like I've talked about this.  The Apple Watch is easily the most attractive.  It's designed by two of the best designers in the world, Mark Newsom and Johnny Ive.  I disagree.  Well, a lot of people think it's not attractive. I think it's attractive.  But that's a matter of taste.  It's like a chicken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very Johnny Ivy.  It's Johnny Ivy.  It looks like it's from the 70s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  I'm sorry to derail your point, though.  But my actual point is the guts, the functionality is not particularly ahead of Android Wear in any particular way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Until about a half an hour ago, I would have disagreed with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, but that's because you just used Apple Pay at the Petaluma Market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the Taptic's engine is brilliant, but it turns out it's the Taptic engine that's broken on this thing.  That's the broken part.  Yeah, that's the broken part.  That's what's delaying our watches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, apparently one of the two Chinese suppliers for the...  By the way, the Taptic thing, it's just a buzzer.  It's not that different.  Do you have an Apple Watch?  No.  Trust me.  It's a buzzer.  I thought it was going to do all these fancy...  Like it would buzz my left wrist for a left turn or a right...  No, it's just a...  It's just a...  Anyway, it's not the Taptic engine.  But anyway, the buzzer...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ...was probably apparently part of the...  It's very, very, very good marketing.  It was apparently part of the problem in that...  But not all of them are flawed.  And apparently, as I said, I'm getting mine in two or three weeks before they said it would come.  So I think that whatever that problem was has been solved.  That's what CNBC was reporting.  This Apple Pay is the biggest difference.  But I feel like Android Wear in the next iteration can in every respect duplicate what they've done with this, except maybe looks.  But that's just going to be a question of somebody coming along and designing a better looking watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It also has to be said that there's no Android Wear watch with anywhere near the quality of display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, you know...  I agree with that.  Okay.  That's true because for some reason all the Android Wear watches use IPS LCDs.  This is OLED.  It's funny.  It's Apple's first OLED.  Right.  So OLED's been in Android in many respects in so many ways for so long.  And finally, and it's still not OLED on the iPhone, for the first OLED display.  And you're right.  It's gorgeous.  But Samsung has used OLED displays for its gear watches and they look great.  Isn't the new LG going to be OLED?  Yeah.  What you're going to see is now that Apple has said, okay, here's our...  They didn't go so far ahead that Android Wear can't come up with some very compatible...  Does it do Wi-Fi?  This does Wi-Fi.  This does low-power Bluetooth, Bluetooth LE, until it can't or it needs more data, then it'll go to Wi-Fi.  That's good.  Much like Android Wear will do.  One thing Android Wear does do in the new iteration, which we haven't seen yet, but supposedly,  is just as this Apple Watch will talk to the iPhone anywhere on the local Wi-Fi network to any Apple phone,  or to my Apple phone, Android Wear will do it over the public Internet, which is great.  I could leave my Android phone at home and my Android Wear watch would still communicate with it.  I feel like what's going on is much like with the phones, it's neck and neck.  And on any given day, any horse could win.  And now, well, that's good for consumers because it gives consumers choice, it gives consumers options that they might not have.  I think that there's some real similarities in the platforms.  I'm very interested to see what the next generation of Android Wear does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think that the price of the Apple Watch will affect the Android Watches?  Will they go up in price or go down in price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's much like the phones.  There may be some high-end Android Wear.  But remember, the Apple Watch starts at $350.  That's only $100 more than the most expensive.  It's not crazy, but I'm surprised they don't have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And another $250 when you break it.  When you break the screen because it's not sapphire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, if you break the screen, that's your problem.  It's not Apple's problem.  You broke your screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've already scheduled the breaking of my screen.  Also, we learned from the iFix at Teardown is that the battery is actually weaker than your average Android Wear battery, but it gets comparable battery life.  So they're doing some really interesting kung fu there with the battery.  I think part of that's the OLED, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OLEDs are much more efficient screens.  But yeah, you know, I get much better battery life on my iPhones than I do on my Android phones.  Galaxy Edge, iPhone, comparable batteries, comparable usage, 80% on the iPhone 6, 55% left on the S6.  And here we are at 2 in the afternoon.  I still have some hours to go.  You know, I think Apple knows...  You know, when you have a closed ecosystem, you can do better because you can limit things.  For instance, there's only nine watch faces, and they're all OLED-friendly.  You're not letting third-party watch faces on the Apple Watch because they could kill your battery life.  Android Wear, Pebble, thousands of ugly choices. Thousands.  But again, I think that's great.  You get to choose. You want choice. You want the Apple Way. You get to choose.  If you hate all that money in your pocket...  I'm surprised you, given that you love Google, are using an iPhone.  You were using an Android phone before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm using an iPhone specifically so that I could use the Apple Watch.  I've been excited about the Apple Watch for a long, long time, and I always felt that Apple would come out with a really great watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So can I send you a heartbeat when you get yours?  Yes, would you?  With a little drawing?  That would be wonderful.  Renee Richie has been sending me Batman heads.  It's the most useless feature of all.  But now that mine's coming tomorrow, I can send them to Lisa. We'll see. I can send little hearts and flowers.  I can't wait till mine comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They sent me an email yesterday that said, the Apple Watch is here. And I thought they were talking about my Apple Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, don't get your hopes up.  Was that me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was from me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should have known. I didn't get a tap. A wrist tap.  We did have a changelog. We've kind of encroached a little bit in the changelog.  Let me take a look and see if we've got anything else.  Password alert Chrome extension. This comes from Google.  Google combats phishing and risk from password reuse when you enter your Google password in a non-Google site.  Is that all it's going to do is check and see if it's the same password as my Google password?  Because that's stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's going to do a number of things. It's just general password management.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it? That's what I'd love to see is.  Yeah.  Is it last pass equivalent from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If somebody in Eastern Europe uses your password to log in somewhere, pops up right in the middle of your screen.  Oh, I like that.  And says, hey, watch out.  If you go to a page that's been spoofed or faked that's asking for a password, it will say, don't enter your password in this page.  This is not the right page.  This is not the page you're looking for.  That's great because that's an increasing problem there.  It's like been commoditized tools for duplicating website pages.  And so of course, the main thing they're after is to harvest your usernames and passwords.  So is that available now?  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me go to the extension store and install it.  Sounds like there's no reason not to.  Although you do want to be careful about...  It's called password alert.  Too many extensions.  Yes, password alert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yeah, exactly.  I mean, the extensions in Chrome are just like the biggest, most bloated aspect of my machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I've had to be a little judicious.  The other thing that happens is it installs on every machine.  There it is.  Google.com password alert helps protect you against phishing.  And it's open source.  It's open source.  And free.  And free.  All right.  This sounds like this would be something good for businesses as well.  Yeah, you'd think IT would love to install this everywhere, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So many businesses are using Chrome because they finally figured out that Internet Explorer is so insecure.  And then at the same time, a lot of people at work are browsing Facebook and all these public sites.  It seems like this would be a perfect thing for people to just auto push out to all their employees,  like make sure you're not going to the fake Facebook site and using your corporate password as your password for Facebook and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it doesn't seem to have any allow in incognito, allow access to file URLs.  Doesn't seem to have any icon on the on the toolbar.  I guess it just sits there and it'll notify me.  You do have to sign in your Google account, which I just did when you install it.  OK, that's cool.  Chrome Dev for Android app released.  Oh, this is the Canary release.  Is that what this is?  Yeah, that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chrome Canary for Android, basically.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there was an update to Google Play Services.  Do we know what what that did?  Oh, I know one thing it did.  You can now have more than one watch.  I don't know what the I don't know exactly what the use case is, but it's called the Leopold feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you want more than one?  I guess maybe this video will explain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now Android Wear Android Wear is supposedly not going to be just for watches.  Right.  Ah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the wearable operating so I could have Android Wear, my glass and my watch and your and your smart underwear.  And you're like, whatever.  That's what this is.  What is he talking about?  Play Services 7.3.  Get to work.  That's right.  This is worthy of a Microsoft video.  I was just going to say.  Welcome to release 7.3 of Google Play Services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Magnus.  I've seen him before.  He does all the Google Play Services videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's kind of cute.  This is all about.  Very geeky, but fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that you can now connect multiple wearables to a phone.  Let's check that out.  I can't decide which wearable I'm going to wear today.  Kind of like that black one.  That one is battery.  It is.  It is the case that people in the real world have multiple watches.  So that would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hot dog.  Since I have Google Play Services 7.3 installed, I can wear them all at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, K. Lars.  Network of wearable nodes.  All connected to a single phone.  How many watches does he have?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Network of wearable nodes.  All connected to a single phone.  How many watches does he have?  That's hilarious.  Look how big that Nexus 6 looks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are introducing a panel API in the Wear Day Nexus 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is really the future of wearable computing.  Wearable computing is not having a wearable device.  I agree.  I think you're right.  It's a personal area network.  You have different sensors in different places doing different things for different reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not only are they connecting to the phone, they're connecting to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, just my old man, dirty old man, kicked in there for a little bit.  But yes, personally, it's a personal area network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you thinking about, Mr. Maker Man?  The LG Watch Urbane is now in the Google store.  Oh, it is.  A classic timepiece.  So if you've been looking for a better design watch, 350.  See, there you go.  Apple Watch price.  Ultra clear display from any angle.  It is OLED.  So there you go.  Answers that question.  All right.  All right.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm rooting for LG.  You know, they just came out with a really cool phone.  You like the G4?  Have you taken a look at it?  Well, I like the color scanner.  There's a scanner that basically is a little sensor that's right next to the camera that basically does a quick check on the lighting conditions.  And they also do object recognition.  So if you've taken a picture of an apple, it'll check the lights.  It'll recognize that it's an apple and like, OK, here's what color the apple should be given these this context.  It's like an auto auto white balance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Love that idea.  Really impressive.  Actually, Miriam Jouer was on All About Android last night.  She brought one.  Did you play with it?  Well, yeah, a little bit.  She had only had it for a couple of hours, but had taken some shots and I can kind of show you this was in a super dark room.  She said this picture exactly matched how it looked when she took the picture to her to her eyes.  Sometimes that's nice because sometimes they over amplify it and it's brighter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is enhanced.  Yeah, this is kind of like ratcheting it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She needs to clean up her room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They need to add voice command.  So you say enhance and have it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Center zoom enhance.  Let's see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's see here.  If you go in, that's one thing maybe would be better in low light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, focusing is always tough.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the detail is unbelievable on some of these.  So this let's see here.  Let's switch to this photo.  This is a macro.  This is the normal shot, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fiddle fern, fiddlehead ferns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I mean, it's just that's gorgeous.  Really incredible.  Everything that we saw on the photo features of this definitely at least put it at the same level as the S6.  But they're they're duking it out.  There's going to be a ton of matchups between these two side by side comparisons.  And at this point, this is a big contender.  I mean, the detail is just incredible.  Yeah.  Beautiful.  Really, really nice shots.  Don't do this while you're driving.  But yeah, so there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very cool.  Come on LG.  You can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I just ordered a LG watch Urbane just to just to help them along.  Why not?  I decided to get the gold so it would compete well with the Apple Watch.  I can't afford a gold Apple Watch.  Looks pretty nice.  Yeah.  It looks like a real watch, but that's not a real watch face, right?  That's just the OLED screen.  And it doesn't have a flat tire.  It's round.  It's completely round.  It goes all the way around.  It goes to eleven.  It's one bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's got the Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got the Wi-Fi.  All right.  So let's look at the specs.  And that's a superior to Apple's implementation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  66 grams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's fairly heavy.  That's heavier than an Apple Watch.  Gold with brown leather, silver with black leather, stainless steel cover, Corning Gorilla Glass 3.  Of course, that's the same glass used on the sport watches for the iPhone.  Yep.  Four gigs of storage.  What's the price?  The Apple Watch has six gigs.  It has significant storage.  Wow.  PL LED screen at one point three inches.  It is similar to the Apple Watch.  320 by 320, 245 PPI.  It does have a microphone, but all Android Wear watches do.  Does it have a speaker?  It does not have a speaker, apparently.  And it does support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LED.  On 1.2 gigahertz.  Oh, a big battery.  410 milliamp hours.  So it should run for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's double the Apple Watch.  The Apple Watch.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Depending on when you get the watch or bane, you'll probably be the first to have the new  version of Wear as well that has those enhanced Wi-Fi capabilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It says available May 8th.  So you should be first through the door.  Two weeks.  We'll do a review on before you buy.  Then I'll be ready to retire my Apple Watch.  Will it be free?  This is, by the way, not who I am.  This is what I do for a living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're going to retire again, you need the gold Apple Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is my retirement watch.  You can.  I wonder what the charging is.  This is the one I'm most excited about right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Until Google announces what they're going to come out with, if they have a Nexus watch.  Do you think they'll do a watch?  I think they may do a watch, and we'll have to see what they do.  This is the one that at least looks the best.  I don't know if I can afford it, but it at least looks the best.  It looks like a normal watch to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm glad to see the OLED.  I like Android Wear.  I feel like Android Wear is very close.  I can't answer phone calls on this, but even though I can do that on the Apple Watch, I don't know if I'm going to do that a lot.  I've had a few phone calls.  You certainly wouldn't do a long phone call.  But what it is nice for is if somebody calls and you're in the middle of a show or you're doing something, you go, can I call you back?  It's perfect for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always like to look at actual human behavior and how it changes through technology.  I think the biggest change with a smart watch, and especially the Apple Watch, is that you stop carrying your iPhone.  When you're at home or at work or in the car, it's not in your pocket.  It's just around somewhere.  Talk to me when you have an Apple Watch.  But if somebody calls and it's in the other room, it's fine.  You just say, hey, I'll call you back, whatever.  You're not running around looking for it.  I know I'm a starry-eyed dreamer.  I think you're a dreamer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you're not the only one.  I still feel tethered to this.  I don't want to leave it behind.  I do.  I'll leave it in the bedroom and go into my office.  But then I go back again because there's so much stuff you cannot do on something the size of a watch.  We'll see.  I'm going to wear probably two watches for a while.  Maybe three.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It could be like Sven Olof.  Sven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Nexus 7 is gone.  It's dead.  I thought that was a great tablet.  I have mine.  I had the 2012 and the 2013.  I still use the 2013.  A great price.  A great tablet.  I am sad to say.  But I hope that that is a sign that they will do the Nexus 7 plus.  7.5 or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think that 7-inch tablets, they were the flavor of the month until all the phones got to be 5 and 6 inches.  And now it's like who needs it?  Maybe you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been using, even my Shield tablet, I've been using it less and less since I got my Nexus 6.  Because it's just a bigger screen.  The stuff that I was running solely on that tablet, I'm now running back on my phone again.  But I think it's safe to say that I think it's probably the most successful, or one of the most successful Nexus devices that they've ever put out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been saying this and everybody disagrees with me when I say this.  But I'll say it again and see what happens.  I think Google's lost its hardware mojo.  There was a period of like a year or a year and a half where everything they came out with was kicked.  It was just like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute, Mike.  Surely you're not talking about the Google TV or what was that ball?  Nexus Q.  My son Kevin still uses that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.  He got for free at Google I.O.?  Yeah.  Anyway, so...  He's the only one.  He's the only one.  But no, if you look at the first few Nexus devices, they were great.  They had vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember, Google didn't build any of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I know.  But they were responsible for bringing them into the world.  And they were for makers.  You could take it apart.  They were hackable.  They had tethering.  They had all these really cool things.  And they were cheap.  So it's like, where are those types of devices these days from Google?  They used to be no compromises.  Now they're back to compromises.  Namely, a huge price for the current phone.  So it's like, I don't know.  It just seemed like they were so good at hardware for a little while.  And now they're just kind of like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, and they stopped all the Google Edition phones, too.  That's exactly right.  Like the Samsung phones that would run stock Google.  They killed all those.  That's sad.  It is sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's one of the reasons I still think the OnePlus One,  but that deserves more attention.  And now that you don't need an invite to buy it,  I think that's the Nexus phone.  Because Oxygen, which is...  OnePlus One has severed ties with Cyanogen,  Oxygen, which I immediately installed on my OnePlus One.  You did that, too, didn't you?  Yeah, I did it.  It's pure lollipop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's great.  I can't...  It doesn't bother me at all.  The people that it bothers are the people that really wanted  all of that customization, the Cyanogen...  And Knock-Knock and all that.  And all that kind of stuff.  But I really don't miss that.  I just want that device to have lollipop.  And now it does.  I'm happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's the Google Play Edition phone you want, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And with a cheap, low price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Windows...  This was part of the announcement.  A lot of announcements from Bill.  And again, we'll be covering that on Friday  with Mary Jo and Paul.  But the big news,  Windows 10 will be able to run Android and iOS apps.  Well, sort of.  You'll have to rewrite them.  Microsoft is offering now a cross-platform free development tool  called Code, which is kind of a mini visual studio.  It will be available on Linux and OS X.  And that is, to me, such a departure from the Microsoft of old.  Yes.  Microsoft hated Linux.  Yeah.  Hated it.  The fact that they're now offering development tools for Linux for free  and inviting developers of Android and iOS apps to rework them  so that they can run on Windows 10 is fascinating to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Microsoft is going to be selling its own version of Linux  sometime in the next two or three years, the way they're going.  And they should.  Well, they did at one time, didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They had Zenix.  Well, it wasn't Linux.  It was a Unix.  It was a Unix.  In fact, that was, I think,  Microsoft's first operating system was, after DOS, was Zenix.  I've forgotten about that.  Wow.  Yeah.  Zenix has been around a long time.  But I think this is brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This easy porting.  We don't know how easy it's going to be.  True, but the strategy is brilliant because essentially it's like  every developer makes the same decision.  They basically, well, we've got to be on iOS or Android or both.  And then should we go to Blackberry and Windows and so on?  And it's like, nah, it's not worth it.  But if they just make it worth it, make it easy,  and this will be a chicken and egg type of thing,  if there's lots of apps available on Windows Phone.  This is the interesting thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're an Android developer, continue to use Java and C++  on Windows 10 for your Windows 10 version.  Objective-C, you continue to use Objective-C.  They've provided SDKs.  What I find really interesting, of course,  one of the things that keeps apps on Android,  I imagine this is true in iOS as well,  is the use of services, built-in OS services,  that are not available across platform.  Microsoft says, this is Terry Meyerson,  if they're using some Google API,  we have created Microsoft replacements for those APIs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know where they first used this strategy?  Remember when, and this is, I'm going to date myself here,  but remember when WordPerfect was the big,  and what they did was they came out with a,  they supported all the key strokes in WordPerfect in Word,  and that's what killed WordPerfect,  and sent Word to the top.  This is a great strategy again.  This is something they've done before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder if Microsoft's eating their own dog food.  Are the very nice iOS apps that Microsoft has released  based on this SDK?  That would be intriguing to me.  So Microsoft, for instance, offers Outlook on iOS.  Do they?  Actually, I don't know if they have a Windows Phone Outlook yet.  They will.  And I wonder if this is the same tool.  Developers will be able to leverage their .NET and Win32 work,  bring this to Windows Universal apps.  It would be, you know, we've heard of this, you know,  that's what Java was supposed to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Java, that's what I was thinking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, write once, run everywhere.  The problem with Java was native, the native UI,  and they developed Swing, which gave you a little bit more native UI,  but you could always tell, you still can,  if an app is written in Java instead of the native OS.  So when you use Eclipse on Windows, you know it's Java, right?  Mm-hmm.  Even with the Swing widgets.  Yep.  So that will be the test.  If you can't tell if it's a native app or a ported iOS or Android app,  I think that will be very interesting.  In any event, it's a, what a brave new world.  It's a new bunch of stuff.  If you had told me that someday Microsoft would make it possible  to run Apple programs on a Microsoft platform,  I would have laughed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ha-ha!  And I think a lot of people are saying that all this is coming about  because Satya Nadella is good.  I agree.  Well, my contention is, yeah, he's good, but I think the bigger point  is that Steve Ballmer was bad.  He was a terrible CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you're right.  And I've heard people say, oh, no, all this was in process  when Ballmer was there and Satya just inherited this.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that the globalization dropped by half over the period  that he was a CEO.  He was one of the worst CEOs in technology.  Wow.  And it was all because he was Bill Gates' friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think Nadella has shown that he is the right man for the time.  Yeah.  Cloud focused, not Windows, Windows, Windows,  but Microsoft, Microsoft, Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's willing to embrace the new paradigm,  which is what they've needed to do for a long time.  I've never been a big Microsoft fan,  but I like the direction they're going.  I posted something on Google Plus about all the rumors swirling  like Windows is going to become open source  because of a couple of comments that somebody made in a conference.  But still, if they're willing to at least talk about that,  and that person didn't get fired, by the way,  for saying that.  So if they're willing to talk about that,  it's a change in the momentum.  And they're saying, look, we need to embrace these things.  We can't just live in our own little bubble anymore  because we're not selling billions of copies of Windows  around the world anymore.  And it's realism.  It's a change in the momentum.  And it's realism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are certain major businesses that they rely on,  namely Windows in Office  and a lot of things around it,  where, look, they're going to lose it anyway.  So let's just try everything.  Let's be on all platforms.  That's the right attitude generally.  I think it's going to take a while  because it takes a while to change a reputation.  Good or bad, we should point out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that both Gates and Ballmer were the right men  for the time, in the 90s and the 2000s.  Ballmer was never the right CEO, I don't think.  The profits were phenomenal.  But I think you're right.  He didn't turn the corner at an appropriate...  Same way Bill almost missed the Internet.  Ballmer almost missed the cloud.  But Azure's there.  They had Ray Ozzie.  Ray Ozzie was the guy who said,  you guys got to pay attention.  The cloud is the new OS, not Windows.  And I think Nadella has recognized that.  He did, in fact, come from Microsoft's cloud side.  So he certainly recognized that.  And he said very publicly,  look, we're going to be everywhere our customers are.  And if that means iOS and Android,  we will be there.  But the best experience will always be on Windows.  I think that's exactly the right message.  I don't think users anymore...  This will be interesting to watch.  Despite the fact that our viewers,  because they're enthusiasts,  will fight that battle.  It used to be Mac versus Windows.  Now it's Android versus iOS.  I don't think real users even care or know,  just as they don't know a processor,  how much RAM.  Why should they care about what OS they're running?  If it's my data there or my apps there,  can I do what I want to do? That's fine.  And that's the promise of the cloud, isn't it?  Just as the internet is OS independent,  the cloud is OS independent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And apps as well.  One of my favorite apps on iOS  is a Microsoft app.  They do a great job.  It's a great app.  And what if Microsoft made 50 more?  Great apps. Why not?  That's Facebook's model.  Get as many apps out there.  In the case of Photosynth,  it's not really involved in Microsoft's cloud.  But what if they came out with a gazillion  mobile cloud apps for every platform?  That would be an amazing  bit of culture changing,  change the reputation of Microsoft  in the minds of the consumers.  Because you love the people who are giving you  great apps and a great mobile experience.  And they can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of like the Nintendo paradigm shift as well.  Didn't they recently announce that they were going to  start doing mobile apps?  It's like we're not going to do a console anymore.  We don't need to do a console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They did say that, but they also said,  don't expect our old apps on the...  You know what everybody wants is Mario.  They're not going to do that.  They're going to do new apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's where their value is.  It's in their Mario stuff  and the Smash Bros  and all that kind of stuff.  That's what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On Android.  Not that I would ever take an old show  that I used to do.  Of course not.  Bring that back.  Nobody wants that.  You know, I'll talk about an app  that has failed. Just came in  breaking news. Secret is now  going under.  And good riddance to it.  I erased secret from  all my platforms months ago.  For a while, a very  addictive thing. Especially because  everybody in Silicon Valley was posting  anonymous posts.  It was pretty much only people in Silicon Valley.  Anonymous posts.  Secret does not...  This is David Bidhow  who is the founder.  After a lot of thought and consultation with our board,  I decided to shut down Secret. Secret does not  represent the vision I had  when starting the company.  We built a product used by 15 million people.  Pushed the boundaries  of traditional social media.  But it's also the ultimate  double-edged sword which must be wielded  with great respect.  And Kerry's talking about anonymity.  And clearly, as we were  talking at the very beginning,  in Twitter, you are anonymous.  With the real names policy of Facebook  and formerly of Google Plus,  although I think that  legacy lingers, you cannot be  as bad as you can be  if you're anonymous.  When you're anonymous, no holds barred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And this was to me  the fundamental flaw of Secret,  which is that in the beginning, yes, it was also  Silicon Valley people leaking  details about what's happening  in various companies and so on.  But for it to go mainstream  means that 90% of the users  at some point are going to be trolls.  Because it's anonymous.  And anonymity  is the perfect platform  for being a total  a-hole.  Secret did not run out of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, they still have cash.  They say they're returning that to the investors.  However, of course, investors will  have lost a significant amount of money on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And just as a side note, it has to be said  that this was broken by a top-notch  news organization that does not  BuzzFeed.  BuzzFeed is to...  They turned into a news.  They're a link baiting type of company.  And they also are a really good journalistic organization.  They've hired their way to become a good journalist.  Exactly. And I saw somebody say  today on Twitter, that's what  people really want. People do like link bait.  And they do like good journalism. And BuzzFeed is  applying both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bring it to us both. Jonah Peretti, who founded  it, but who's running it now? They hired  some good people.  Who's the EIC over there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just heard a story on BuzzFeed the other day.  I can't remember if it was on  NPR or...  It was really interesting to listen to.  They're kind of up and down. And there are scandals  that have gone on over the years with pulling  down articles. You know who's executive vice president?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ze Frank.  Really?  I did not know that.  Wow. What? I'm glad Ze Frank got  a job. He was a very early  video blogger. The guy  who never blinked.  So, yeah, they broke the story  very fastening.  By the way, they didn't get much of a scoop since  there was a medium post almost immediately  by David Betau, the founder.  With a very lonely and sad  coyote at the head of it.  Aw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The secret's gone. Aw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, wasn't the fox, the secret's  icon was a fox. So there's  the sad fox.  Wandering off into the sunset.  Wow.  It's really...  When you see the app economy,  it is just... We've talked about  the business cycle being 10 years and less.  It's 10 months and less now.  You look at apps just come and go like  boom. Boom, boom, boom.  All right.  I think we could do some picks, but you know, I think we  should start with Aaron's Arcade  Cabinet. This is really, really  cool. You posted... You've put up  a Google slideshow or  what do they call it? I did that for you guys so you guys could

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  show some of the pictures in case  people want to kind of learn how  to do it. I'm going to actually be giving this presentation on the  6th of May in Benicia  for one of our Makerspace workshops.  So if you want to learn more, we're going to have a  pinball and video game night.  And that's... I'm going  to talk about how I built this for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When we first built the studio a few years  ago, and boy I wish I could remember his  name, one of our fans  brought by a cabinet. A full-size

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  four-player. It's very similar to the one  that I did. In fact, there's a picture of the one that I built.  Oh, you've done this? Yeah, yeah. I built one  very similar to the one you guys have in the basement.  And  that was the one I built. That's the original?  Yeah, before I moved out to California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Standing... It's pretty much like a real arcade machine.  And when you do this, you have to have  roller balls, you have to have joysticks,  you have to have 18 buttons.  Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. You didn't do it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing is, it's just too big. And we live in California,  we don't have a lot of storage space. Plus, I wanted to be  able to tote something around to  Maker Faires and show people what they can do with Raspberry Pi  and use it as a learning tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the amazing thing. The one we have in the basement,  I don't know about yours, had a Mac Mini in it.  Mine had a full-size PC. It had a computer in it.  You don't need that anymore, because  now you can do it  with a $35 Raspberry Pi.  That's right. Yeah. It's remarkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is all powered with a Raspberry Pi.  All the woodwork was  just done out of a couple of  two-foot by four-foot sections of plywood. Did you cut it yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. You got a little shop in the ground.  Yeah. Looks great. It's hardwood plywood.  And you have, by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the... Now, those are... some of these pictures  are from an Instructable, which  is linked in this presentation. Yeah, this is the two-player  bar top arcade. That was the inspiration.  This is the inspiration, because this guy did such a good  job. He even did...  If you go look for a two-player  bar top arcade cabinet on Instructables, you'll find  it. He even did... If you go to  the next page, you'll see he even did the  Ikea version assembly instructions.  This guy's an overachiever, for sure.  I want to hire this guy.  He did not have to do that for an Instructable.  But anyway, so the great thing about this, though, is  it's all reused components. Mostly.  So the Raspberry Pi, obviously, was new.  But that's cheap. You've got an SD card laying around, probably.  You've got some power cables, an old power  supply from a PC. What about all these controllers?  Yeah, they're pretty cheap these days. I got that  whole set there for about $70 on eBay.  Everything I needed to build. These are all  LED buttons, so they... Does it really require quarters?  Well, I've got quarter buttons.  They're virtual quarters.  But you know, all this stuff is  an old monitor, a 5x4...  That looks like a PC power supply.  It is, yeah. There's a PC power supply.  All the LED lights  that light up the marquee on top, that's all  being run off that PC. And you don't want a  widescreen monitor. You want 5x4. You don't want widescreen.  That's right, because a lot of the  old video games were vertical.  So the nice thing about this is it's  almost square, and you can play the  early consoles, which were done on 4.3  TV screens, and you can  play the old arcade games. They both look great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you running MAME? Are you running an emulator?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's a project, and I believe Brian used this  for when he did  the SNES  Raspberry Pi thing that he did.  It's called RetroPie.  And it emulates just about anything. And if I had left all  the emulators up here, you would have seen Apple II,  you would have seen Amiga, you would have seen  all of these cool emulators. But I took  those out, because this is mostly for games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's a Raspberry Pi. It's going to run Windows 10 too.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's supposed to run a developer  edition of Windows 10, which is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now he did button decals.  I did the button decals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The button decals are great, because they really give it a  professional look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is beautiful, what you did here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a lot of fun. There's RetroPie. You can see all the different  emulators there. I know it's hard to see, you have to squint.  Those are all the different emulators that  RetroPie runs.  And so it's the easy button  decal for doing something like this.  They even have an SD image, so you just download the image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Megan asked me, because  Megan Maroney, who hosts  Tech News Tonight and iPad Today with me,  her husband  grew up playing Wizardry I  on an Apple II.  And she said, Marco,  the kids, he's just got two 10 year olds,  are very into Minecraft. Marco  wants to play something older with them.  How can he play Wizardry I?  And I pointed it to an Apple II emulator.  But this would be awesome.  To have this and play Wizardry I on this?  That would be so much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does a lot of early PC games too.  Lands of Lore I think is on there.  Commander Keen would be fun on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, that was a  successful project.  Huck and Milo, his 10 year olds, loved it.  I thought, oh this isn't going to fly.  But now they want to build Wizardry I  in Minecraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So total cost, 285  bucks for you? Now that's with all the extras.  You don't have to go to that extent. But again,  it could be a lot more expensive if you're not reusing  all of the stuff that you would normally throw out,  put in a landfill, or send to some place to be broken down.  You can just reuse all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody sells the wood, because I don't have  any woodworking skills. I can't just buy the woods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't buy the wood,  but what you could do is find a local maker  or a local makerspace.  Send them the designs. Maybe they'll cut it on a  CNC machine for you and all you have to do is  patch it together. I'd love to have this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wi-Fi dongle? So this has Wi-Fi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Built-in Wi-Fi. Why? So you can update it?  Yeah, exactly.  So one of the nice things  about RetroPie is  it automatically does a  sift share over your network with a link  to all the ROM directories.  When you need to import a game that you  previously owned into this  machine, you can just  be on your Windows thing, open it up,  copy the file over, and then go run it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the parts list.  We'll put a link to Aaron's  slideshow in  the show notes here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can get all the details or just come see the presentation.  There's a lot of pictures. Where are you going to do this?  This is in Benicia. Why no MDF  or particle board? MDF or particle board.  They're both awfully messy. Number one, they're not  very strong. The first one I built out  of MDF because it looked nice. It's easy to  route. Oh man, what a mess. I got sawdust  all over the place. Hardwood plywood's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  solid. Feels good. Very solid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it paints well because you can get  a birch veneer or even the stuff  you get out of Home Depot. How big does that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  SD card, how much storage do you need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is only 8 gig.  It's amazing really. It's amazing.  Every Atari game  is on here. There's plenty.  That was made and it takes up  I think less than 10  megs of space or something. It's  crazy. It's crazy. Now you  can't run everything on here. Some of the newer  arcade games and all that, you're not going to be able to run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're talking anything that's 20 years old  or black. Exactly. 1990

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  previous you can run. I love it.  So it runs really well. And do the kids like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, are you kidding me? You put little speakers  in there. Look, it's got its own speakers.  And good speakers so you can really make it sound good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What my wife likes is that I actually  reuse these speakers that I bought on Amazon  and if I point over to that one  you can maybe make out there's a little  headphone adapter.  So what my wife loves is the kids want to play their games  they can put on the headphones. What is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the game selection interface like?  Is it text or is it images?  Here it is. There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can go to whatever  I don't know what people like to play but  you kind of scroll down. There's so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  many games on here. You're still in the A's.  You've been scrolling down for like half an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's just one emulator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at that.  Ours had a keyboard so you could simplify  some of this stuff. And you can with this too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can go to... A Bluetooth keyboard  you could use.  I'll pull up  Donkey Kong just for fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh I love Donkey Kong. The first appearance of Mario.  Although he wasn't called Mario then.  I got an image on that one.  Yeah you can imagine that.  Oh look how good that looks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Aaron do you mind if I keep this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it make this...  My initials are not MAR but that was a nickname as a kid.  So those are my high scores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See there's Mario at the bottom though.  Although he was at the time not called Mario. I don't know what he was called.  It was Little Plumber Man.  Oh my god.  That's such memories.  And it looks exactly the colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's emulating the exact machine.  It's just emulating it in software.  And the Pi is fast enough to run all of these old games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like I said not the new ones.  One of these games were running on 6502.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was not...  And this is running...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used the Pi 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The model 2 for this.  So that's another thing to keep in mind.  The model 2 is going to run more games because it's a lot faster.  The model 2 is going to run more games because it's a lot faster than the original Raspberry Pi.  The model 2 is going to run more games because it's a lot faster.  With single core technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a thing of beauty I tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am so impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the unveiling. This is the first time I've had it out of the garage.  So I thought since I was coming over I'd bring it.  Also... Well we'll get to that in a minute.  But it's a lot of fun.  The kids... Burger time.  You know they're having burger time competitions.  I don't know if anyone's been to the... Burger time?  Burger time.  Oh my word. Here we got a Paul Burgers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sounds familiar.  Are you throwing burgers?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of similar to Donkey Kong in the level approach.  But there's little...  Like burgers and eggs and stuff.  There it is.  Walking around that you have to throw salt and pepper on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're walking over them and making them drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah. It's kind of coming back to me.  I think I was too old to play Burger Time.  Oh look at that.  What was your game, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh. I mean.  I was always...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was the one where you're climbing up?  Crazy Climber.  Oh seriously? Was that the one you were talking about?  Yes. That's exactly what I was thinking.  You're climbing up a building.  Now didn't you have to do the joysticks like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the problem with emulators on Crazy Climber.  Because if you do it on a PC you've got one joystick and you need two.  Here it would work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got them. You could do Joust.  All the games that had weird controls.  I want this so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I need to make this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I loved Crazy Climber.  Now we should say these are totally illegal ROMs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I'm using this for demonstration purposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is for demonstration purposes only.  If you were to do this... Oh that's the game!  That's so funny. You and I were both thinking of that game.  It was a hard game.  Very hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. It was in the pizzeria around...  near my house when I was a kid.  I played it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh no!  Oh no!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to move around because there's window washers.  And they drop pots on you.  They drop stuff. Flowers.  Oh no!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what the controls are for this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You move each joystick up and down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In some of the games you have to manually specify  use the controls this way to be able to play them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And once you set that once  it's set going forward for that particular game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there a...  Archive.org has a lot of these ROMs, right?  Oh yeah. You can find a lot of these online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not hard to find.  But you know, there is some potential.  And that's the nice thing about running the old ones is  you're a little less likely to come under scrutiny  if you're running the old stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really you're not going to come under scrutiny.  People put them up on the web.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People distributing them.  Don't sell them.  Spy Hunter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Spy Hunter is on here. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like you're taking requests from the  chat room here.  Look at all these great games.  I'm so jealous.  You actually have a jump to letter sort games.  You have a lot of... because there's so many games on here.  Wow. There's Spy Hunter 1 and 2 and 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I've never built  anything remotely close to this.  Do I have any...  Do it Jason.  Do I have any ability of actually making something that looks even  Yeah, you absolutely can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's enough tutorials. That tutorial that was in that presentation  I linked to is full of great details.  The only thing I would say that's different  is he used MDF.  Don't use MDF. You're going to ruin your phones.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it plastic? Is that? What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  MDF? It's medium density fiber board.  It's kind of like a...  It's like more smaller particles than particle board.  Think of particle board and then make the particles  even smaller and glue them together.  That's what MDF is. And it does route well.  But it's not going to be as strong as this.

Transcript:  Archive.org has 80,000  ROMs.  A 50 gigabyte download.  That's the problem. There's too many.  Go with the ones you want.  So I want you to do this Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to do it. Now I need to find the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aaron, I want you to come on the screensavers and  give us an even more in depth...  Absolutely. I'd love to do it.  By the way, we do launch the new  screensavers Saturday, May 2nd.  That's this Saturday.  3pm Pacific. 6pm Eastern Time.  It is not in  any way related to any previous show,  fact or fictional.  That's going to protect us.  We are looking  for people who have  ideas, that want to show something,  ask questions, because we're going to answer calls.  Email  newscreensavers.tv  That's our email address.  newscreensavers.tv  And join us on Saturday afternoon.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  I can't wait. Mike, you got a tip?  First of all, I'd like to say thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for making me follow Aaron's Arcade.  I know. That was a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm following you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My tool is bogus compared to what you brought in.  It is what it is.  This is a tool called  Hunting Cabin.  I assume that everybody  uses Product Hunt.  It's a great resource to find new products  and miscellaneous things.  However, sometimes you want  obscure things. You don't want to go there  every single day.  Hunting Cabin is essentially like a Google Alert  for product hunts.  It's weird.  You go in there, you set in, you put the criteria  in there, and then when  your criteria are met, you'll get an email  with a link to the product hunt product.  Kind of a nice thing.  A lot of people do  Google Alerts, which is, of course,  I'm a Google Alert freak.  I think I have like three or four hundred of them.  Is it still around?  It's perfect, as always.  What a lot of people don't know, and I'm not sure  if I've mentioned this on this show before,  but there's also a Scholar version.  If you like really obscure, geeky stuff,  you can go to Google Scholar,  that's Scholar.Google.com, and click on  the Alerts button at the top.  That's a totally separate thing from Google Alerts.  Google Alerts will not give you stuff from Google Scholar.  If you have very obscure interests,  Google Scholar is one, and if you like  products, Hunting Cabin  is another that you can use  to sort of automate it, and really  go after the obscure things, because of course  you don't want to be checking, I mean  I check it every day, but most  people probably don't want to go to product hunt every  single day, so it's a great way to make sure nothing  falls to the cracks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, Tog Hoer has announced  a fourteen hundred dollar  Android Wear watch.  So get ready.  It's modeled after the  Carrera. I think that's  probably not the watch you're looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's only twice the price of one  of Apple Watch's bands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good point.  That's a good point.  I think, you know,  I am still not sold that a watch  is wearable, you want, but  I think we're going to be in a golden age of watch  choice anyway.  You mentioned, you know,  I wasn't planning on doing  this as a pick, but I am going to do it now, because  you mentioned product hunt. There is  a, and has been around for a lot longer, a product  hunt for geeks called  Hacker News.  Many people know about Y Combinator,  Paul Graham's startup school.  And for a long time, they've had a really  great news  feed. It's at  news.ycombinator.com.  It's voted up  and down, so the stuff at the top  will be the highest votes.  It's also  a great source, not just for news,  but for geeky stuff, projects,  ideas,  a lot of programming  stuff. There was a period where people  started gaming Hacker News,  and thank goodness, either they fixed it  algorithmically or people just lost interest and  moved on, because it for a while was starting to turn  into dig, and now it's not. It's really  great. It is a, I check it  just like product hunt, every single  day, and if you want some  really just kind of geeky  news stories,  I go through it and I get something almost every  day out of it. A lot of  it is for programmers and developers and  geeks. But if  for instance, you want to, you know,  Secrets Number 3 on the stories,  the launch of Visual Studio Code  is number one,  .net for Linux and Mac,  that's interesting, number two.  So lots of stuff in there, and I think  a great way to get super geeky  pretty darn quickly.  A medieval English poet exposes  the country's most corrupt industry  wool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fleeced.  I like that. Fleeced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some of this stuff is  just geeky. This is from Lapham's  Quarterly. Louis Lapham's  kind of eclectic  mix of interesting stuff.  Anyway,  I think it was a lot of fun  having you guys here. We didn't even miss  Jeff and Gina. We need some. We did  actually. I did. Aaron Newcomb,  love having you. NetApp,  thank your employer NetApp.com.  We see Aaron frequently  and all about Android and Floss Weekly  and whenever we can get him up here, I love  having you here. Yeah, thanks for having me. And what a  great project. Please do come back and show us  more. I will, absolutely. I like to open it up and look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll have to show you the guts. Yeah, I want to see the guts.  That's what's fun. You're not playing around with that thing.  That's serious. It's serious. That's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How long did it take? A couple of months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Couple of months of work. And I've been working  pretty heavily on getting all the  difficulty. Once you've got it going and you get addicted  to this, now you want to get, like I brought  my PS3  or DS3 controllers, which play  all the Super Nintendo and the ones  that need the shoulder buttons. So you've got to get those  set up just right. And you can spend hours and  hours tinkering with this, getting it set up just  the way you want. The nice thing about  it, since it's all on an 8 gig  SD card, you can just take out  the SD card, take it inside, back it up, and now you've  got a backup image if you ever need to  do something else with it. I think you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  missed out on a monetization opportunity though.  Those should be real quarters.  I think I might have gotten some trouble for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple Pay. There we go. Apple Pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just come up and tap to pay. Tap to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tap to play. Nice.  Now we're cooking with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mr. Mike Elgin is our news director,  guy in charge of keeping  us all up to date on what's going on every Monday  through Friday. 10am Pacific  1pm Eastern Time 1700 UTC  with Tech News Today. Sure is a lot of fun.  He's also Natalie dressed and looks  pretty good on a segway. I showed  the new screensavers open to a number  of people and almost universally they said,  who is that Elgin guy? Who wears a blazer  on a segway? He is dressy.  He looks good. It was mostly me saying it.  No, no. People  who didn't know who anybody was said,  hmm, they said Brian Burnett  looks suave.  We should  play it because you can see Mike looks so  sharp. Jason Howell looks tall.  Jason looks... Everybody says that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was evidenced by my hunching while I rode  the segway everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You look good. Everybody looks good.  But nobody looks good on a segway. Everybody looks a little bit dorky on a segway.  Except Mike Elgin who looks like James Bond.  I don't understand it.  It's the Google Glass.  Mike, thanks for being here. Do you want me to play it?  No, it's alright. Everybody can go to inside.twit.tv  to find out more.
