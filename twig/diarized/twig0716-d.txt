Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Suspenders.  She's cracking out the beer already.  Oh wait, here.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  There you go.  Speed drift.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Best moment in succession this week when Darwin, the guy who predicts election results, gets  Wasabi in his eye.  Wasabi in his eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's going, oh, smart.  And cousin Greg puts a La Croix in his face and Tom Wamskin says, it's got lemon in it,  you idiot.  It's only a trace of lemon though.  Just a trace.  Just a hint.  So you're watching it.  Yes.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  It's good.  It's not good.  I love succession.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Holy cow.  That episode, Sunday night's episode.  I haven't watched the rest of it yet.  It made me queasy.  It was too close to reality.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was, it was scary as hell.  I, I, I said this on Mastodon.  Sometimes fiction can be closer to the truth than fact.  You know what I mean?  Amen to that.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Such a good show though.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's play.  Could you have any game show music?  Game music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, I'm Leo Laporte and it's time to play moderator mayhem.  This is the latest host, Mike Masnick.  The latest.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  We haven't introduced ourselves.  Oh, sorry.  I realize that that is I distracted us.  I just didn't know if you cared.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Higginbotham of Stacey on iot.com and the IoT podcast.  Hello Stacey.  Hello all.  Great to see you and your La Croix.  Let's say hello to Aunt Prudence sitting next to me, which I like, you know, we did the  thing that you're not supposed to do in business.  I made everybody come back to work.  Oh yeah.  Oh, you're very taboo.  I'm the bad guy.  Yeah, you're the bad guy.  You're such a horrible man.  I said we want all hosts, editors and producers in studio from now on.  So that's how it used to be.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, you know what the laptop, what was, what was, what was this?  Laptop La La's.  Elon's Laptop La La's.  I don't agree with Elon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't agree with him on that at all.  But, you know, it's good to be here.  Until COVID, everybody was here.  You know, and occasionally people would work from home, but everybody's here.  Then in COVID, nobody was here except me and then Jammer B.  And then COVID is over.  No, it's not. But go ahead.  Well, the CDC and the World Health Organization say it's over.  So, I mean, it's mostly over.  You don't see anybody wearing masks anymore.  And hospitalizations are down 90 percent.  Deaths are down 95 percent.  It's yeah, it's going to be endemic from now on.  It's not a pandemic.  It's like the flu. It's endemic.  And yeah, it could still kill you if you're somebody like Jeff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I'm feeling I'm feeling a risk around you.  You see, I'm afraid it's going to come through the microphone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That is the WellMass director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the  Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Jeff Jarvis. Good to see you.  Good to see you, Buzz. BuzzMachine.com.  Yeah. So I said, Lisa and I were talking, I said, you know, I'd really like for Christmas.  I'd like everybody to come back.  It's not Christmas yet, though.  Well, it's early Christmas. Christmas in July.  It's Christmas in May. Yeah.  I just and I think it's better.  We had our our editorial meeting, which has been on  Google Meet for the last three years.  We had a person yesterday. It was great for me.  Yeah. But I but I never went home.  You know, I've been here the whole time.  I feel lonely.  I was lonely. Weirdo.  And I feel like there's a certain creative energy and just a happiness  that happens when we're all together.  And I know that there are I mean, I'm sure that nobody has come to me and said,  I hate you.  But I'm sure there's people who feel like, why are you doing this?  We were we and it worked at home.  It's not like the work wasn't getting done.  It worked basically well.  Yeah. But the work was getting done.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  We did a lot better than NBC, ABC and all of those cats.  I just missed you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Give people some options, though.  Yeah. You can wear pajamas to work if you want.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Well, actually, I actually I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is what's for lunch today.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Lunch today was Acme Burger.  It was pretty good.  Yes, man.  By the way, every Wednesday, we've been buying people lunch.  We even have massages sometimes.  Yeah. Doesn't mean they come in.  They come in, they eat the lunch, they go home.  No comment.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There is no free lunch, folks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know.  I this is the Reddit, the subreddit.  Am I the A hole?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Am I the A hole?  No, no, no, no.  I just want people to be here.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  It might become on the anti-work subreddit.  It could. If you're not lucky.  It could.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know.  It feels better when we're all together.  Anyway, let's play Moderator Mayhem.  This is I've introduced everybody now.  This is.  Hey, it's time once again to play Moderator Mayhem.  Nice work.  The new game, content moderation game  from Mike Masnick and Tech Turd.  Are you ready to play?  Yeah, yeah.  Contestants.  I'm going to skip the tutorial  because you guys have played.  Because we have Stacey here.  Yeah, Stacey's played this.  She can play everything.  She made her, she says, anxious.  It's terrifying.  How disturbing is this going to be?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  It's not that disturbing.  I mean.  It's asking you about things.  It's asking you.  You're not going to see anything.  Oh, okay.  It doesn't show up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay. Good luck with moderating your first reviews.  I'll be checking in to offer guidance and feedback.  I can't believe Mike Masnick.  This guy does so much and he has time to do this.  Oh, he's been working on this for long.  You've been here to judge.  You're here to judge these reviews  based on TrustHive's policies.  While I may give you feedback on some decisions  that I agree or disagree with,  there isn't time to immediately review  all of your decisions.  At the end of that round, I'll share a policy accuracy score  that shows how well I think your decisions align  with TrustHive's policy.  There's no such thing as TrustHive, right?  That's for the game.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I hope not.  Right.  This is, the idea is that you have been employed  as a content moderator at TrustHive.  Okay.  A mythical company.  Does this mean I live in the Philippines?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And you're gonna go through.  Yeah, sure.  And you can find out about the rules as you go  and more information.  Stacey will tell you how to flip things.  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Round one, reported for illegal.  By the way, I serve this on our Macedon instance.  I do this on our Macedon.  You gotta stop talking.  You gotta keep going then, keep going.  A review of you.  It's adding cards as you go.  Oh, a review of new electric vehicles  included as a video of the reviewer driving,  fun while driving.  Now, X means not legal.  It's correct.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Correct.  But you don't mean it to exit.  It's correct.  Go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's correct.  Click.  Oh, it is illegal.  Go, go.  I get it.  It is illegal.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good call.  No, no, no.  Okay.  Harassment.  they are puppy and bunny killers.  So what does that mean?  Do I click?  The green check means what?  It's okay?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  The green means it's okay and you're gonna let it go.  X means you're gonna kill it.  Kill it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Kill it?  Kill it.  Sometimes more context can help you more clearly  see the line between spam.  See, you click on more context.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And you can also see the line between spam and

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the person who just made a snap decision.  Okay.  Well, no.  Review of a new restaurant includes links to coupons  for a free appetizer.  Let's see those.  Let's see that.  Keep holding the button to take a closer look at the content.  The owner of the restaurant is a popular trust type  top reviewer and trying to reward his fans with discounts  at his new restaurant.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Wow.  I'd let it go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah, I say it's okay.  Our CEO has asked us to look at this one closely.  Oh, okay.  Kill it.  Privacy.  A review of an airport includes photo of a private plane.  That's the CEO.  Okay.  We're gonna kill it.  Kill it.  We're gonna kill it.  A review of a laptop running anti-malware software  that you should download for your new laptop.  Oh, that's okay.  Products being promoted, the last one was malware itself.  Oops.  Yeah, that's a little closer.  Yeah, mess that one up.  Review of a protest following reports of the governor  being accused of sexual harassment includes images  of a protest sign that people are reporting the sign  that means end mem.  That's fine, approve it.  It's okay to say end mem.  I'm fired.  You're fired.  Oh, dang.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  You're too slow.  I knew that was gonna happen to you.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Dang.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  So, okay.  What have we learned here?  So, you have to work fast.  You're way slow.  I'm thinking.  Your explanations are killing you.  I'm thinking.  So when I played it, I got a 67% accuracy.  I just read it and I just made a gut decision  based on my morals.  Half the time they were like, or my, like, I'm like, eh.  And then it would come back every now and then it'd be like,  Stacey, you should have looked closer.  It didn't say my name, but look closer.  And it had information that I would absolutely  not have any idea why I should look closer at it, but sure.  Or it would be like, you're wrong.  And then, you know, I kept going.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mike says, there is, often there's no correct answer.  So you're not gonna hear right or wrong,  but your manager might tell you  that they disagree with your decision  or might not at the end of each session,  you'll get a general update on how your manager.  This is- Let's do another round.  This is to say-  I was 67%. No, no, we've done enough, trust me.  That is so hard.  You'll get a general update on how your manager  thinks you're doing in accurately applying company policy.  You'll get a sense of your job security.  So I got fired like right away.  And I guess the point of all this is to show you  how hard it is to do that job, yes?  Right, right.  I couldn't do this.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yes, and if you played a little bit faster,  you would actually, in the middle of like looking at stuff,  if you wanted to get more information,  a little thing would come up and be like, hurry up.  The comments are piling up.  Yeah.  And you'd be like, okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that's what Mike's saying.  He says, you can look for more content,  but that's going to slow you down  and speed is of the essence.  Right.  So this is good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Even if it weren't, it's still hard.  Yeah.  Right, even if the speed were no factor at all,  the cases are not easy.  They're not obvious.  Yeah.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Like I had to pause.  Like I went in thinking, okay,  I'm not going to be like Trustive.  I'm just going to go with like Stacey's gut reaction  to these things.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Well, why are we so hard on these social media platforms  if this is-  I guess that's hard to the point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the point.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, that's the point.  And this is a really good way, like to me.  So I think we talked about like Google adding bar  or adding AI to search and what that means for like content,  like journalism and content and revenue,  those kinds of things.  But this is a really good example of how journalists,  if your goal is to show people viscerally,  and it used to be through storytelling,  how life affects people,  like how policies and whatnot affect people.  This is actually a great way to go to the next  like iteration of journalism is to create something  that shows people how policies work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cause it's not just that you'll have a sympathy  for the person, the poor people who are employed to do this,  but also just how kind of it is difficult.  Even if you had all the time in the world,  it's not, these decisions are always difficult.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  And this is for things.  I mean, imagine a Congress critter playing this game  and being like, oh,  what we're asking is pretty much impossible.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There you go.  The nation of Germany.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  When Facebook was researching its oversight board  and they had what the six cities and 40 people in each room  and professors and lawyers and such in there,  they would break us up into groups  with these kinds of hypotheticals.  And you have your table with 10 brilliant people.  I was at a table with Kate Plonick and they aren't easy.  And that's the point.  There were real cases.  And even if you look at the oversight board cases,  they're not easy.  It's humanity.  Humanity is not easy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and speaking of humanity,  I've decided to hire four professors of college journalism  to help us.  So we were looking at,  you might've seen this on Twitter or Reddit,  a mid journey created a series of professors.  You basically said,  I want a psychology professor and so forth.  Let me show you a little bit of the video  so you can see anthropology, art history.  There was some gender discrimination.  The soft sciences got women  and most of the other ones got men.  But there's also some, you pointed that out, Stacey,  that the psychology professor's houndstooth jacket  was pretty right on.  And what's cool is this is mid journey.  These are indistinguishable from real photographs,  I think, right?  You're a photographer.  I agree.  I think these could really be real people.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We don't see their hands.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't see their hands.  But you know what?  Mid journey five has been trained on hands.  So it's better at hands.  So, but Jeff pointed out,  where's the journalism professor?  So we decided to use mid journey 5.1.  And so this is what,  and I think, I don't know about the first one.  The second one looks like a journalism professor.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Which do you think, Jeff?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Man.  Oh, they're kind of dorky.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I've never had a cool journalism.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I was gonna say, wait a minute,  journalism professors.  Hey, hey, hey.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think number two is,  we're gonna upscale number two.  I'm leaning towards two and three.  And three, you like three?  Let's look.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Three looks like he has a drinking problem.  Let's look a little more closely.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Again, journalism professor.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Drinking problem.  That's fair.  That looks like, but by the way,  one of the criticisms of these original professors  where they were all,  they were white except for the ethnic studies professor.  But look at this, this is, I think, an African American.  Is he?  I don't know.  I can't tell.  I would say South Asian.  They're all men.  They're all men.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, women don't teach journalism.  And let us be clear,  this, a petapixel said this revealed the bias of the AI.  No.  No.  It's the bias of the academy in the real world.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Human life.  Right.  Which one of this one?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah.  But by doing that,  it just re-emphasizes the fact that women don't belong.  If I don't see myself represented there, I don't.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  But Stacey, here's the question.  Is it better,  or no, I'm not gonna say better or worse.  Is there a point at which you edit it  and enforce it to show a vision that isn't a mirror of  society or do you recognize the mirror  as a bad image of ourselves?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  So this is a lovely segue into something I haven't written,  but I think a lot about for journalists in training on AI,  which is they need to understand how this was trained.  So was this trained on like journalism professors at,  at 10 universities?  Like understanding what your training was.  We don't know if it was even trained

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  on professors at all, right?  We don't know.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Right.  We don't.  So understanding your subset of training data is important.  And then understanding like the probabilities  and how it comes up with this is also important.  And journalists don't usually ask those questions.  And I think it's an important question to ask because,  Jeff, that may reflect reality at the 20 places  the data was scraped from, right?  We don't know.  But that's not the reality.  That's a subset of reality that this was then trained on.  So it will not actually reflect the accurate world.  It reflects the world that of English speaking, whatever.  You're saying there's bias.  That's why journalists need to ask this.  There's inevitably this bias.  We take this as, because it's driven by data, right?  It's a computer.  So we take it as a factual representation of something  that's based on an image of the world that we can trust  because it's generated by a computer.  But what we don't realize, just like statistics,  we don't understand how that data was manipulated going in.  And we need to as a journalist.  I mean, as people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is exactly what Stochastic Parrots,  Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell said.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, can I just start taking a drink  every time you say this was exactly?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But this is their point.  Was because they're computers,  they're given more credence than they ought to be.  And that the biases are hidden  and they're built into these large language models.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, the model is so huge  and you can't have that kind of transparency  because you have no idea when it's too big.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, the harm done by this compared to the harm done  by face recognition used by law enforcement  is not as harmful, right?  I mean, law enforcement using face recognition  is throwing people in jail that didn't commit a crime.  That's a problem.  Right.  So, I mean, there are different harms as well.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Well, where's the government gonna step in on this?  What can they do if this data set is so massive?  Oh, well, after this week,  they're gonna start to smart people to get in there.  Yeah, you don't want government to say anything, do you?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, it's not their business.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, they should.  So the government,  so the Biden administration has put forth things  about like their AI Bill of Rights.  And part of it is testing for bias  and looking for like measuring the outcomes  of different algorithms and seeing who those impact  and publishing that data.  So I think that's actually really important  because then you can know like, okay, we tested it.  Now, how often they test it,  it's not like it's a static thing is a big deal.  But then you can say, okay, I've audited this.  It predominantly shows you white people,  white men in positions of power.  That's good to know.  That's like a little caveat at the bottom of your results.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here is Anthony Nielsen's alternative universe  of journalism professors,  two of whom are for no reason we know of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  wearing their mortarboards.  Jeff, do you do that?  Do you just wear them?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sure, sure.  Wear your mortarboards.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  May is graduation season.  Oh, okay.  Maybe I do it for you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  With my CPAP and the mortarboard.  It's a little messy, but you know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this is interesting because today,  this week, of course, Sam Altman and others  testified in front of Congress on this very subject.  Sam said, yeah, you got to regulate us.  He also said, I make no money from this job,  which I thought was interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, the worst thing he said was  you should license the producers of AI.  It was just frightening.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I really think that's a bad,  so this is, it's a difficult thing.  I understand that there's bias.  I think the most important thing you could do  is just get everybody's awareness raised  as to the issue of bias  and to get people who train these AIs  to do the best they can to eliminate bias wherever,  you know, not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They should have had the stochastic parents  papers authors there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  Not Sam Altman.  No, as if he speaks for all AI now.  Yeah.  He's the CEO of OpenAI, incidentally.  He's the next Mark Zuckerberg.  Which by the way, Elon Musk took credit for,  he said, I started that.  Of course.  Wouldn't be here without him.  Started it in left, right?  Wouldn't be here without me.  I don't know.  So Stacy, what do you think is the solution?  It's not, do you think licensing and regulation  is the way?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I think having some sort of oversight for,  okay, there's different places where AI is going to be used.  If AI is in a decision-making body,  I think every single regulatory agency right now  needs to have an AI bureau where they start evaluating.  So if it's medicine,  they need to be evaluating medical programs.  I mean, cause like when we say regulate AI,  I mean, what the hell are we talking about?  It's so broad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Didn't, wasn't this, I mean, remember the call  for ethicists in medicine and other areas.  And I think the medical ethicists exist  and some hospitals have them.  Insurance companies need them for sure.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  They have IRBs, is that what you're talking about?  Well, yeah, I mean, this whole notion's-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They also hire ethicists on staff.  But even things like, you know, the Homeland Security-

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Internet research.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, Institutional Review Board.  Oh, okay.  Institutional Review Board.  Thank you.  Did I say internet?  Did I say internet?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yes, I was like, your IRB is different than my IRB.  Jesus.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh man, every I stands for internet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Would it be adequate to do what we did  with medical ethicists to do that?  Should we have AI ethicists?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  No, I just think you need to create a regulatory system  that's part of every, like, that does the auditing functions,  that handles complaints.  So you haven't like a, like a weights and measures.  Like if you get it, if your gas station  doesn't give you the right amount of gas,  you complain to the states.  So if your algorithm gives you some crappy result  and you feel hard done by it,  then you have a place to go and seek restitution.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A Bureau of Weights and Measures,  because a leader is a leader.  It's a little bit harder to say, oh, that AI is off.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, you have to be, yeah, you have to,  so here's what we're dancing around  and we need to stop dancing around.  We need to stop thinking that AI is technology  that is neutral.  It isn't.  Then government needs to say, okay,  we also have to recognize that it's the government's role  to set parameters.  So we have to say, hey, as a government,  we actually don't want AIs that, you know,  disproportionately affect black people.  And this is a hard conversation.  This isn't easy, but historically we've been able  to throw the actual decision making over the fence  by saying it's a technology thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This isn't actually a technology thing.  This is why I brought up medical ethicists,  because instead of government regulation,  what insurers, and of course they have a big lobby,  so they went to Congress and said,  you better not tell us what we can and cannot do.  You know, health insurance, there's no standard  for whether they're gonna allow that procedure or not,  but that's why they said,  but we're gonna have these ethicists  who are gonna help us make the decisions  of who gets a heart when you have one heart  and two people who need it, that kind of thing.  You can't make, that's hard to make a regulation on.  In fact, I wouldn't want government to say,  well, these are the 23 criteria that you have to use  to judge who gets that one heart.  I'm not sure I'd want that.  Is that the right way to go?  No.  I'll give you another solution.  Yes, ish.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Or here's the- Yes, ish.  So the heart example is actually a really good one  because you have an ethics board, actually.  You have, I don't know who, like, I think for hearts,  and I don't know if this is 100%-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, you have transplant boards, yep.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  You have a transplant board who looks at cases  on an individual basis.  Now, here's what's important.  It used to be.  Sometimes the transplant board members are public, right?  So you can actually see if you're gonna investigate  a particular heart donation, you can actually see,  did that person have secret ties to them or not?  Or who these people are.  Right.  So there's an accountability metric there  at both who's on the, the board itself  is an accountability metric for the hospital.  We've reviewed this and here's the decision-making.  There's accountability for who's making the decisions  so we know what their interests theoretically could be.  I think that's important.  And having something for that, to evaluate an algorithm,  because they're gonna be in every organization  and throughout society, you need to have those stationed  in the appropriate places.  So a hospital review board, you need to have a review board  deal with medical AI and it would evaluate the outcomes.  And this is what's important, the outcomes of the AI  and see if those align with what the hospital itself  wants to promote.  Or maybe it's at the FDA level and the FDA is going to say  on a, it'll audit the AIs and say,  these are the decisions it's making.  These are not in line with the outcomes we want to promote  as the United States of America, right?  So we have to establish those at different levels  where AI is going to be implemented.  You need to have it at like maybe your,  I don't know, your attorney general,  your state should be looking at police and judges,  like AIs that are used in the criminal justice system.  Like, this is hard.  That's the sort of system.  I'm gonna suggest a few other things.  Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  One is, and you started to get to it, Stacey,  is that it's not about the AI, it's about the use, right?  We talked about this on the show a lot,  that if you use facial recognition to arrest someone  with no other facts, that's a misuse of the data and so on.  The other thing I was saying, I was about to write this up,  I think it's time for us to demote the engineers.  I think it's time for us to bring in other,  not just ethicists as the ghetto of ethics,  but to bring in the humanities,  to bring in anthropologists and philosophers  and sociologists and psychologists.  If you were gonna start a newspaper today,  you wouldn't put the pressman in charge.  If you were gonna start a TV station,  you wouldn't put the camera operator in charge,  though Jim or me would be a very good head  for the company I might add.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis, we've been saying this  for the last couple of years now, why hasn't that changed?  It's been put out there in the public that,  hey, the people that are in the business of training  these systems need more diversity within the departments.  That's been preached over and over and over again,  and it hasn't changed as of yet.  Well, I think this stuff,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  the stuff we're talking about today is still new.  We haven't seen this, and again,  we don't know, it so much depends on the use.  If you have this system that maps the relationships  of all words that we have available,  you could use that to query it and say,  what are the biases of society?  In that case, you don't wanna clean up the biases,  you wanna know what they are.  You wanna know what they are, okay.  Or if you say, I wanna use this to train children  on their career opportunities.  Well, then you have a completely different use,  and you're gonna judge the output completely differently.  So it's not about the AI is good or bad,  it's what was the intent, how was it trained, to what end,  and is the output beneficial and useful or not?  And then how do humans use it?  Do the police use it badly?  Do mortgage companies use it badly?  Do doctors use it badly?  The bad stuff is gonna come with misinterpretation  and misuse from the humans after the fact.  So it's not about fixing the AI,  it's getting the pen and pixel thing,  is the AI doesn't know the bias, society does,  or the training set did, or the prompt did,  or our own vision does.  And so Stacey's right, it's not simple,  but it also isn't limited to this thing we call AI.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh, you can't regulate AI, that's so stupid,  and I wish we would stop talking.  We have to regulate the use of it.  Well, aren't you saying, yes, Stacey.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, what's the difference between regulating AI  and regulating the use?  You're saying we should regulate it.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you have to regulate the use of it.  Already, we're seeing things where-  Like who uses it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Like you would say it's okay for me to use mid-journey  to generate pictures of professors, even if they're biased.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I'm not gonna, like, I would point that out to you.  I'd be like, look, you know-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's not gonna be regulated, I would hope.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Right, no, you can't regulate that.  There's also the risk of regulation of regulatory capture,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  and I think that's what Sam Altman wanted.  He would-  Yeah, but you know what?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Regulatory capture is gonna happen regardless,  and we see, like, they're just pissed  because if you have, like, the option of regulatory capture,  then they have to spend money on lobbyists.  I mean, I hate, I get that regulatory capture exists,  but I hate that as an argument for not regulating anything  because then you're in this, like, free fall,  like everybody does whatever they want, and that's-  Yeah, you just should pretend,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  just pay attention to who's asking for the regulations.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Right, you totally should, and then when you see the-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mono, who's benefiting from the regulation, yeah.  Right, right.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  But what we're talking, I mean, and Jeff, you know,  you brought up, Jeff is right in the sense that, like,  you have to regulate the use of it,  and when you see a use case,  and then you have to have regulations in place  so you can actually demand that those, like,  that a company is telling you  when they're using an algorithm to make a decision.  So there's two- Demand that you have access to it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's two whatabouts that I would raise.  One is, what about other nations?  What about China, for instance, who will not be governed by-  We can't do anything about China.  Well, but they're not gonna be governed by regulation.  They're gonna develop AIs.  They're gonna get increasingly powerful  while we are hobbling.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or they're gonna overregulate it,  which one of the senators was basically using it as a model.  Say, well, China regulates this output, maybe we should.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, yeah, we have regulatory capture as an issue here,  which is that the incumbents influence,  because they care, influence legislation  and it ends up benefiting them.  In China, the incumbents are the People's Republic of China,  the government, the CCP.  So they were gonna have it be influenced  in such a way that it's to benefit them.  So that's their version of regulatory capture.  But that's the first whatabout.  The other whatabout, which concerns me also,  is regulation can keep us from making progress  in tradition.  And this is one of the reasons  they didn't regulate the internet initially.  Maybe we should have, I don't know.  But because it was a new and exciting innovative sphere,  they felt that it's too soon for government to intervene.  And that could hurt our development of AI.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  So we're not talking about regulating  the development of AI.  Well, they were in the Senate, Stacey.  I know, I know.  You're not, I know, but they were.  So you're throwing your whatabouts in some,  I'm proposing concrete regulatory steps  that we can take to prevent actual harms from AI.  And then you're, in response to that,  you're throwing me whatabouts  that actually don't relate to that at all.  So if you wanna ask me, like,  what about regulatory capture?  I would say, yeah, that happens.  And we're gonna have to look out for it,  but that's not an excuse to not regulate.  If you're gonna ask, what if that stops us on innovation?  I would say, none of the steps in concrete proposals  I've made actually stop our ability to innovate.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Stacey, but now, put on your Senator hat.  I know Leo is normally the Senator here.  Now I would like you to be in the Senate  because the Senate is not a diverse body.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  So I should look like an old white man?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes, you should, yes.  Okay.  Or act like one.  So, I mean, as Lindsey Graham said,  outright, oh no, you gotta look grumpier.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You could be an old white woman like Dianne Feinstein.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, then you won't know where you are.  Okay, keep going, Jeff.  I'm asked, what am I asked?  Thank you.  So Lindsey Graham said, you know, should we license?  And Sam Altman said, yes.  So this idea that that's part of what I think  we're talking about here is not just the sensible things  you're saying, and I'm saying,  but where it's headed is the reflex was to say,  it'll be okay if we license this.  Now then it's pure regulatory capture  because then Sam Altman said,  well, just for us big guys,  because I can handle it, right?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I do not think we should license companies to explore AI,  if that's the question you're asking.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes, that's the question.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I do, that is a silly idea.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I don't understand the premise of,  how is that doable to license?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  You license, you can create a licensing regime to stop,  like I can't put up a nuclear power plant if I want.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can't be a barber.  All right, yeah.  Unless you go to barber's.  Well, independent.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You can, however, get a gun and kill lots of people,  but you can't make an algorithm.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Can't be a barber,  but you could also be someone that sells fruit  on the side of the street in front of a business  that had to go through all of their little regulations.  That's true, but I mean,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  if Queen Pruitt wants to be an aesthetician,  she's gonna have to go to the state board  and pass exams and take classes, pay a lot of fees.  That, by the way, that is another form of regulatory capture  because that keeps the number of estheticians low, right?  And actually, that's something Shoshana Weissman,  who's a regular on some of our shows, is very involved in,  is this whole idea of licensing  that really ends up just being keeping everybody out  so we can keep our salaries high.  Hey, you know what?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I introduced Shoshana to the network  when she hasn't been back on the show since the first time.  Well, she goes on the big show now.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  She's been in the big show now.  She's too big for you.  She's past you, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, look at, you know what?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, somebody's taking time off  in the next couple of weeks.  I can't remember if it's you or-  Me.  Stacey.  Next week I'm coming.  It's Shoshana.  We're trying to, I think we have a list of people.  We're trying to get Chris Messina, who said he would be on.  We're hoping we can get him on.  The inventor of the hashtag and one of the people  who was a real stalwart at Twitter,  who just recently said goodbye to Twitter.  He didn't work there.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh, Chris Messina's also an actor.  This is why I get-  Different Chris Messina.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Different Chris Messina, yes.  But Chris is a great guy.  I've been a fan for a long, long time.  Not the guy, not Danny Castellano in the Mindy Project.  Not that Chris Messina.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  He's in the new Air Jordan movie, the Ben Affleck movie.  That Christmas air.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I saw somebody on Twitter today  said they had deleted all of their tweets  and all of this and all of that,  that evidently Twitter brought back some hosting site  they weren't using and they were all back.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Twitter has so many bugs in the software.  Oh, you can't delete anything.  Yeah, you can't delete it or then you don't have any choice  or then you get it all deleted.  You just don't know what's, it's kind of,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you never know from day to day what you're gonna get.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The latest thing is they said they're gonna delete people  who have not posted in a certain amount of time.  So I'm watching.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Which is scary for dead people,  being taken over and then impersonated.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is a Google story.  Let's take a break because this is a Google story  I wanna talk about because Google has announced  something similar.  Yeah.  And there's some real concern about that  but we'll get to that in a moment.  I will argue for it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Okay.  Oh boy.  Oh, then I'll argue against it  just because that's what makes a show.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I will put on a striped shirt  and encourage you both to fight.  But first, a word from our sponsors,  the AWS Insiders podcast.  Have you heard this?  It's great.  Fast-paced, entertaining, insightful look  behind the scenes of Amazon Web Services  and cloud computing in general.  AWS is the dominant platform for cloud.  And I imagine there's so much to talk about  and this is not your typical tech podcast.  Not like us.  High production value, high energy, high entertainment,  and full of anecdotes and stories  from the early days of AWS to today.  The host, of course, Rahul Subramanianam is great.  Hilary Doyle.  But I'll call him Rahul if you don't mind.  Rahul and Hilary dig into the current state  and the future of AWS by talking with the people  and companies that know it best.  Rahul has been an AWS pro for over 15 years.  He's managed more than, get this, 45,000 AWS instances.  He doesn't work at Amazon but he works with Amazon.  He's known for pushing AWS products to their limits  and for believing AWS is a great platform  to push to their limits and for believing AWS  is truly, literally the operating system of the future.  So he's a great guy to hear and listen to  because he's got the vision for what AWS could become.  AWS Insiders is not just one-sided though.  It's full of opinions, takeaways, untold stories  about the challenges and innovations  and the mind-blowing promise of cloud computing.  How to avoid the pitfalls of IAC.  Season two, episode one, you're seeing it right there.  You're filling the cloud talent gap.  If you have a company and you're using the cloud,  staffing that cloud team is not easy.  Rahul and Hilary discuss ways to find, retain,  and level up cloud talent.  I was very interested in episode three  of this most recent season.  They talk about Moderna.  Did you know Moderna, which of course makes  one of the two very successful COVID vaccines,  Moderna was born in the cloud in 2010.  AWS was brand new, about four years old,  and it's one of the kind of secret recipes Moderna had  to become a premier biotech company.  It's episode three of the new season.  Moderna, highly recommend it.  If you're interested in the cloud,  you've got to look for AWS Insiders in your podcast player.  You can also just go right to the web,  cloudfix.orea.com, cloudfix.orea.com slash podcast.  We'll put a link to in the show notes at twit.tv slash twig.  But you know, the easiest thing to do,  get your podcast client and look for AWS Insiders.  I don't give a lift and shift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's one of the great episodes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  cloudfix.orea.com slash podcast or search for AWS Insiders  in your favorite podcast player.  And we thank them so much for supporting our podcast.  I like that.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I like doing ads for podcasts.  I like growing the podcast club.  Yeah.  All right, it's time for a blood sacrifice,  in the words of Logan Roy.  I will put on my striped shirt.  And in this corner, weighing in at 110,  it's Stacy Higginbotham and the red trunks  and the red hair.  On that corner, it's a professor of journalism.  You know what that means.  And now I forgot completely what you're gonna debate.  Oh, I gotta do the story first.  Yeah.  So Google announced and-  We can debate anything.  It doesn't matter.  We'll just start our-  Just debate, will you just debate?  Fight over it, fight.  Crossfire.  Google has said, and I think this scared me  when they said it,  that they are gonna start deleting accounts  that aren't active.  Kind of like-  Two years.  Twitter said.  But then, now so at first people go,  not YouTube, what about all those great YouTube videos  that were posted once and then nobody's still doing it.  And then I know that our friend,  the creator liaison at YouTube, Mr. Renee Richie said,  no, no, don't worry, we're not talking about YouTube.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you sure?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm gonna presume Renee has the insight.  Sorry about Gmail.  But they will be Gmail.  It will be, I don't care about Gmail,  I care about the public square  and I'm more concerned about blogger sites.  Because aren't there sites that have been active for years  that are still important historically?  Are they not on the internet archive at this point?  Yeah, but we shouldn't have to rely  on internet archive to preserve our history.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And it'd be dead links  and internet archive is incomplete.  So if only, but I'm afraid not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The great Google account purge starts December 2023.  It will slowly happen,  but for instance, if you've been inactive for two years  and you're already over that mark,  your account's not gonna be deleted immediately.  Google says you'll get lots of warning.  Don't worry about that.  I can understand Gmail, I guess.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  But why should Google be,  why should Google hold on to accounts  that were created by mistake?  Someone created an account  and forget the password within an hour  so they go and create a new account.  Yeah, no, I understand that.  Or not to mention the bot accounts  that were automatically generated.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they say if you wanna, if you have an account,  you wanna keep it active,  but you're signing once every two years, that's not a lot.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  That's not a lot, but that's enough to say,  I'm here, the light's on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So Stacey, you go ahead and defend it too.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Okay, the internet is not free.  There are resources and energy devoted to all of this stuff.  And if you're not using it, you should get rid of it.  Now, the best way to do this is to provide the warning  that Google says it's gonna provide, so yay.  Two, it should also,  I think this would be an awesome time  to either Google makes a big donation  to the Wayback Machine or the internet archive,  or we actually talk about creating some sort  of publicly funded or company funded infrastructure  for things of value, for the public square.  Maybe lives of Congress, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe that's what.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, our tweets are there, right?  So we should like. No, they stopped, unfortunately.  Yeah, well, I mean, but that's the thing.  We think the internet is free and it's cheap.  It's way cheaper than paper, but it's not free.  So, and then, I mean, if you think about  the environmental costs of saving all of this stuff  on these servers and even YouTube, y'all,  I know that there's a billion, like,  I don't know how many hours they'll tell you how many,  like more hours than one person could ever watch.  And I don't think it's wrong of them to get rid of it,  especially if they try to do it in a responsible manner  that's, you know, lets you know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know how responsible it's gonna be  because the blog post said, quote,  if a Google account has not been used or signed into  for at least two years, we may delete the account  and its contents, including content from Google Workspace,  Gmail, Docs, Drive, Meet, Calendar, YouTube,  and Google Photos, to which, of course,  a lot of people who said there's, you know,  one of my favorite things is five years old on YouTube.  There's a lot of tech TV stuff that somebody posted.  They're long gone, but that stuff's there.  I understand, Stacey, you know, it's a shame  that Google has to pay the freight to keep that up there,  but that was kind of the deal they made.  It's a responsibility, yeah.  In any event, Google then backed down.  This is why I'm not sure I trust them,  because then they said, oh, wait a minute,  no, not YouTube.  But it says YouTube.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  This is a dialogue.  They also, in their thing that they,  when they originally posted it,  they also said that it wasn't gonna,  that it would be discretionary or they would look at things.  So what I saw is it mentioned something about videos

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  having potential historical value, not just cat and mouse.  How are they gonna judge that?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  But you know what, if you want your five years of tech TV,  Leo, host it yourself and stick a link on the internet.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, let me try to argue now.  Well, first of all, I don't have access to it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that is in fact the only place that that exists  outside of NBC's vaults, and they won't let us access it.  We tried very hard.  So that is the only place that exists.  Well, NBC uses their YouTube accounts,

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  so it ain't going anywhere.  This is a good reason to talk about changes in YouTube.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's not official NBC accounts.  It's just somebody who VHSed it  and has put their VHS tape on YouTube.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  And literally recorded their screen with the camera.  Or whatever stuff, yeah.  Can I argue now?  We've lost, okay, yeah.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Can I just make one final comment?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So give me more to argue with, that's fine, yes.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  We have lost billions of records over the last millennia.  I mean, if we even just look at books that are out of print,  now yeah, it's sad, so sad,  but it's gone and we keep making stuff.  I'm not a sentimental person.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nobody expects a publisher to keep a book in print.  That's a good point.  That's a very good point.  So go on, Jeff.  But one thing the publisher doesn't do  is then burn the existing copies of the books.  They don't make new ones.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  That's what happens.  That's why the internet's so cheap, y'all.  I mean, this is what defines the internet.  Take Ku in our Discord says,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  how the hell is Elizabeth Holmes  gonna prevent her Gmail account from being deleted?  She's gonna go to jail for 15 years.  What is she gonna get when she comes back?  She can tell someone to log in for her.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  They'll have incarceration packages.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let me give you a few scenarios here, all right?  Incarceration package.  Include Twitter in this, right?  One is impersonation of a dead person, right?  Or someone who's-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, for instance, if Twitter kills my account,  there's nothing to stop somebody else  from being Leo Laporte on Twitter.  Exactly, so that's the first problem.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So log in every two years.  Well, you're dead.  You're dead, you can't.  I can't, I'm dead.  Oh, well then, you're dead.  I'm gonna take a dead relative.  Then you don't get your name.  Let me go now.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  What if there's another Leo Laporte out there?  Let me go now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Too bad, I'm Leo Laporte.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm the one, Leo Laporte.  There is a whole linkage to a Leo Laporte  that says that's a Leo Laporte.  That's Leo Laporte we know.  And Leo may rest in peace, was a wonderful guy,  sometimes grumpy, but we liked it.  We would like to say.  Sometimes.  And now along comes Jason Calacanis  acting like he's Leo Laporte,  which is probably what happened.  And so there's impersonation publicly, that's one.  Two, there's a business problem.  I'll use my father because he never had a Google account.  So DV Jarvis, may he rest in peace, is gone now.  Well, people know that  because there's obits and stuff out there.  And they know they can grab that email address  that existed in Gmail,  and then they can go around to banks  and all kinds of places and say,  oh yeah, yeah, I'm DV Jarvis.  That's where the password recovery is,  is at the account dvjarvis.gmail.  Send it to DV Jarvis.  Yeah.  And you can recover all kinds of stuff from people  who aren't gonna know that they're dead or whatever.  There's a business problem.  And three is, you're right Stacey about the expense,  but you have an obligation when you say  we're gonna be this repository of culture,  then you didn't make clear at the very beginning,  well, but only for two years, and then it's gone.  Then it's the problem of Google in general  is what can you trust?  Now you're right that culture is not everything.  Oberto Echo says that culture is what we choose  not to forget.  So I agree with that.  But there was a compact that occurred in the early days  of all of these platforms that said,  blogger, I mean, you're gonna be there forever,  WordPress, YouTube, and-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess that's the real question.  In Leo's case, is there an implicit promise  of eternal representation on the net?  I don't think there is really.  I mean, there's not a-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you lose tech TV, what do we lose as a culture  if people do want it, but there's no way to save it?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  That's too bad.  Life moves on.  Jeez, I love with their heads.  I love this.  The other thing to note is,  if you see what's happening right now,  Google announced this and already they're like,  not YouTube.  If that's the case, they're renegotiating the compact.  Look at it like, if you say we had an implicit agreement  back when the web was young, to me, this feels like,  yeah, I mean, you all do stupid things when you're young  and maybe you promise something.  You'll tell your brother, man, if you ever need a kidney,  I'll give it to you, man, cause I love you.  And then maybe your brother cheats on your wife or something  or cheats with your wife.  Where is this going, Stacey?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I actually think Stacey's right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can't be held responsible as life changes.  I'm gonna renegotiate your favor.  And what happens in pre-internet world is,  if something is valued by the culture, like Shakespeare,  the culture preserves it.  But you're absolutely right, Stacey.  Think of all of the things that we have lost.  Now, would I have preferred that the Library of Alexandria  did not get burned to the ground?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah, we all probably would have.  Who knows what we lost there?  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I think what Jeff's saying is,  this is the Library of Alexandria  and Google's about to light the match.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  The truth is the Library of Alexandria

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  is that every, I forget how many years,  papyrus would have disintegrated.  So you would have had to put the investment  into rewriting things and copying the scrolls.  Oh, so it's actually very analogous.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That effort is analogous to the money that Google pays  to keep the servers going.  This is mentioned in the Gutenberg parenthesis.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, nice.  But one thing though that's kind of interesting lately,  scientists, they've recovered a huge number of papyri  from Pompeii after the eruption.  You can't obviously unroll it.  Scientists are using technology to scan these papyri  and then using AI to reassemble the texts.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That was so Yale of him to use the plural of papyrus.  I think we know papyri.  Papyri.  Very good, very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's the plural of Pompeii?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So yeah, so I thought that was kind of interesting.  So you're right, Jeff, but I mean,  there is a loss to the culture.  Another example that's-  Tech TV being gone is a shame.  Well, yeah, let's not use tech TV because it isn't.  But-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want to see my dev doll.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'll give you an example that's kind of related,  which is video games.  These were artistic creations  that can't really be played  once the last N64 crumbles into dust.  And there is an effort to preserve these,  sometimes an effort that is thwarted  by the copyright holders of all things.  Yeah.  But we do want to preserve,  even the fact that it's digital,  if the Mona Lisa were a digital creation,  we would want to have saved that, right?  Just because it's oil doesn't make it somehow better  than a digital creation, yes?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  So I think there are two things that can,  like this is a good, this is like a good point in time  to say, oh my God, the internet doesn't work  quite like we thought, right?  It's not this permanent record of infinite cheap access.  So, and then also we have value,  there's value in preserving this access  that is protected under laws  that really protected things that were physical in paper.  So then two things we should cut, take away.  One, maybe we should create some sort of digital library  of Congress or funding for something that keeps us in  the culture that we. That might be the right answer.  Yeah.  And then two, what about our copyright laws?  Let's say we want to put something in this library,  can we rework copyrights?  Well, that's Google Books, right Stacey?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's exactly the challenge that came to Google Books.  But that was physical books,

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  but that's not video games or that's not.  But that's what Brewster Kahle is doing

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  at the internet archive.  In fact, he's archiving those video games  and creating emulators so that you can play them  after the N64 is long gone.  He did get a little bit of trouble for that, didn't he?  Of course, that was over lending those books,  scanning books and lending them out.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You want to see an analog for this?  If you go to ustc.ac.uk,  this is the universal short title catalog.  I'll repeat that.  It's ustc.ac.uk.  Andrew Pettigrew, who's a brilliant historian of books,  established this and it catalogs everything known  that was printed, everything,  whether it still exists or not,  between Gutenberg and 1700.  You search on something in the catalog.  Wow.  And then if it exists in a digital form,  you can click on it and look at it.  But even if it doesn't exist,  the fact that it existed is interesting.  And what Pettigrew says is that it's the things  that we used most that we didn't value.  It's the books that we didn't care about  that we left on the shelf that nobody took out  that didn't get ruined.  The things that we used every day and cared about  and mattered in our lives got destroyed through use.  So one of the weird things about this  is the things that you can't find  are the things that mattered most of the time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you have some standing because you,  I mean, I know you're a professor of journalism,  but really you're a historian at this point.  And these original documents are  the first draft of history.  You need this stuff, right?  Absolutely.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's fascinating, fascinating stuff.  And you also look through,  one of the things I love doing this,  and I recommend this in the Gutenberg parenthesis  on sale soon,  is that you look through  and you see the progression of print, right?  In the 1400s, there were no indexes or title pages  or page numbers and so on.  And then you see it, it lost its color.  It gained its standardization.  The fonts changed.  You see something that occurs.  And there was no, there was little talk.  Pedigree also has a book out called  The Library of Fragile History,  where the aim wasn't to preserve.  So what I want, Stacey, is,  just as we had Ephesus before,  I want librarians to be part of this discussion at Google.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think librarians are museum curators.  I mean, all of these,  I've been to dozens of museum exhibits that are all digital.  And so curators are already thinking about  how to preserve things over time  and as digital formats fail and protocols die,  blah, blah, blah.  So, I mean, again, I feel sad.  I don't think this is Google's,  it's totally right that Google said,  oh, I'm gonna start deleting stuff.  Do I think it's sad we'll lose stuff?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ruth Porat got ahold of the, you know,  the bill for the server and said,  well, wait a minute here.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  But why would you trust a private or public company  with your cultural assets?  With your stuff.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I'm not sure about the infrastructure side of it,  but what about accounts that are used  just for forwarding emails?  I saw someone in our Discord talking about it.  They had an old Google account  that they would dump stuff in it  to forward to their personal email  based on some type of filter.  Does that still count as alive?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Patrick Delahandy's dad,  who was a federal prosecutor,  I think he was Massachusetts,  I don't know, Patrick, you'll have to fill me in,  but he passed away a couple of years ago.  Patrick says he's been keeping,  Maine U.S. Attorney, thank you.  He's been keeping his Gmail account alive  for the last two years.  That's historic.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it's not a mail, but it's also an email

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  that a lot of people would want access to.  Right.  I mean, throw that open.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The right thing to do would be to have some sort of,  maybe Craig Newmark, instead of saving pigeons.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Pigeons and journalism, gosh, man.  Could save.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This would be plenty expensive.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, no, but I think it's probably  something a government should do.  Libraries, it's amazing we have libraries.  What a great contribution to our public wheel  libraries have been.  Thanks, Ben Franklin.  And thank you to all those state and local governments  and federal governments who financed this,  and taxpayers, ultimately, who financed this.  Until Florida kills them, but yes.  Yeah, but we decided that this was something important.  And that's, I think, what we need to extend  the concept of library to digital goods, I guess.  I mean, we already have a structure for that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, as Stacey would say, we need a discussion.  We need a discussion about what's important to save  and what the ethic of saving is.  What does it say to future historians, to our children?  And this is problematic because-

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Longest discussion ever, because no one's gonna agree.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, if you were alive at the time of Shakespeare,  would you say, oh no, that Christopher Marlowe,  let's save all his stuff, but Shakespeare, he sucks.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  And we don't know what we're missing.  We don't know.  That's the other thing.  We don't know what the good stuff is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, interestingly, Leo, about that,  so it's now the 400th anniversary  of the first folio of Shakespeare.  And what happened was there were a bunch  of really crappy editions of Shakespeare.  There's a really funny speeches  that were in awful printings of it.  And it was after he died, it was friends of his  from the stage who said we must preserve  the true Shakespeare, and that's why they printed  the first folio.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Interesting.  So there was-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Missed two in the Gutenberg Parentheses on sale.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, yeah, they curated it basically.  And Google's-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, they-  But contemporary, the point is-  It's an editing function too to fix the good stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The point is contemporaneously people recognized his value.  And that's probably why we have it today.  But maybe there was also another guy.  Oh, there was.  That wasn't recognized.  Well, Cervantes-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cervantes should have been.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Cervantes.  Cervantes wrote 40 plays.  He considers himself first to playwright.  Interesting.  And most of that is all lost.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We know him for Don Quixote, but-  We don't know where his plays are.  But he just didn't.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, like those Euripides, Euripidean plays,  the plays by Euripides-  Ask Leo, he'll know how to say it.  I believe it's pronounced Papyri.  But yeah, there's tons of stuff we've lost.  Like all of, like there are no intact Sappho poems out there,  but we're all like, yeah, yeah, she was amazing.  Great poet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  I didn't know that.  We talk about Sappho all the time.  None of her poems survive?  They do.  Well, I do.  There's fragments of them.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I was like, oh, it's like, okay.  No, I had no idea.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The poetry does not survive, fragments of.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  It's fragments of things that other people have reported.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly, her reputation is from the other people  talking about her.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let me quote, if I may, from the bad quarto of Hamlet,  the speech you all know.  To be or not to be, there's the point.  No, to sleep, to dream.  I marry, there it goes.  In that dream of death, when we awake  and born before an everlasting judge  from whence no passenger ever returned,  the undiscovered country at whose sight  the happy smile and the accursed dance.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's like some guy who went to the play  and then somebody said, what did he say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said, no, it was something like this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Fear not to be, that's the point I'm trying to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the point.  To be or not to be, that is the question.  Whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  of outrageous fortune.  Yeah, they're very different.  And it doesn't even mean the same thing,  which is hysterical.  No, it doesn't, exactly.  That's the point.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Maybe the guy who was playing Hamlet that time,  he forgot his actual name.  Maybe he didn't know his last name.  He's like, oh yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is a great conversation.  And maybe, I really think this is the kind of thing  this Google announcement should stimulate,  which is okay, fine, you're right.  It's not Google's job to maintain all this,  but culturally we want to, what should we do?  And I wish members of Congress  would think about stuff like this.  They won't.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, they won't.  This is why you have a private center.  I also want to write credit to the quote I mentioned before.  So it's Jean-Philippe de Tonac in a wonderful book.  He said, one thing is certainly said.  What we call culture is in fact a lengthy process  of selection and filtering.  Now more than ever we realize the culture is made up  of what remains after everything else has been forgotten,  which is a wonderful quote.  But the choice of what to remember is ours.  What are we gonna do?  Let's stop the conversation.  What are we gonna do?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh, I should let you know, by the way,  there are actual Sappho poems that exist in fullness,  but not very many.  And most of what we see are fragments.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I think that's not at all uncommon in the ancient world.  We don't know, like well, Aristotle, right?  We only know, or is it Socrates?  One of them.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  How about the Bible?  Do you want to use the Bible?  Well, the Bible we got, right?  But it's translations on scroll.  I mean, well actually finish making your point  and I'll see if that works.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I think there's a lot of people of the ancient world  that we only know by reputation.  Is that correct?  Yeah.  Um.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  This is far too much Google for a show  called This Week in Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I know, we should talk about Twitter.  Let's talk about Elon.  Actually I have other stories.  Good one, good.  I have other stories.  There's breaking TikTok news.  This just in, the governor of Montana  has signed into law the TikTok ban.  And it's expressed.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  So now.  And it's saying woohoo.  Now we know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Take your finger off the button, whoever's.  I don't have any audience.  There we go.  Thank you.  The ear people wanted me to hear.  So Montana is now officially the first state to ban TikTok.  Governor Greg Gen 40 signed the bill,  Senate bill 419 into law today.  You have some time.  But it doesn't go into effect until January 1st.  He signed the bill, he said, to quote,  protect Montana's person, private, and sensitive information.  Jesus.  From being gathered by China.  That's the key.  China.  China, that's the key.  The Chinese Communist Party using TikTok to spy on Americans,  violate their privacy, and collect their personal,  private, and sensitive information is well documented.  Okay?  Sure, sure.  I can't say that's not true.  Today Montana takes the most decisive action  to ban TikTok from any state to protect Montana's private data.  I wonder how they plan to do this.  That's the only thing I'm interested in.  How do you implement that?

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  When do they reach out to the likes of Metta,  Facebook, Instagram, what have you?  Well, that's another one.  About what they're collecting and sharing with everybody.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Montana Department of Justice can fine any app store  or bite dance, TikTok's parent company,  $10,000 for every violation,  and $10,000 a day for each day the violation continues.  So I guess it's Apple and Google will have to drop TikTok  from the app store in Montana.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  All channels.  So could you download it on your phone  if you left Montana and then when you came back,  you could run it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, because otherwise they'll have to go  to every internet service provider,  mobile phone carrier in Montana  and say you need to block TikTok.  That's not gonna happen.  I mean, I understand their concern.  In fact, there was a recent TikTok story  that implied TikTok was collecting more information  than we had thought, right?  Yeah, I saw that too.  Or that the company had more access to it

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  than we thought was gonna be more of the story.  And was happy to hand it over.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So.  Mm-mm.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sorry.  So I kind of understand, I'm kind of sympathetic.  I would much prefer to see legislation  against data brokers like Kochava,  which just recently got away with tracking your location,  because the judge said, well, what's the harm in that?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  So the FTC can come back and make a stronger case.  I hope they do.  It's unlikely to, but they could.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, the judge said you haven't proven harm.  Right, substantial injury is what the judge said

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  you haven't proven.  And if you come back to me and can show that,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  well, I'll reconsider, but I'm not gonna say  I'll reconsider, but yeah, we'll see.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  So we need someone who gets arrested  because they were near an abortion provider  or a women's healthcare provider,  and or someone who was beaten up by a stalker  after their stalker purchased data from a data broker.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now. Great.  The Wall Street Journal says TikTok banned sign in Montana  paving the way for First Amendment legal battle.  And I guess that's the question is who sues?  Does TikTok sue?  I think TikTok has some creators to sue.  Creators would be the right one, right?  Henry, if you wanna sue Montana,  I'll wear a hat and wave a flag.  Yeah, but that's the thing.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  TikTok has the data on the biggest TikToks,  the people from Montana who have  the greatest TikTok following.  Those are the people if you're TikTok, you reach out to.  You already got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's good.  Use that evil information to protect yourself.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Would it matter if someone outside of Montana  lobbies against this?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, the governor was lobbying to broaden it,  to your point, Ant,  so that it would apply to all social media apps  that provide data to foreign adversaries.  I mean, you can.  Oh.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  You can Google the top TikTok influencers from Montana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, just Google it, Google it.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  At Montana Tucker has 6.9 million followers.  Wow. Whoa.  About Montana and Ryan.  Oh, that's probably a lady.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  But is Montana Tucker saying anything about this?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh, Montana Tucker might be a lady's name  because do people named Montana exist?  Yeah.  Other than Ant and Montana.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She may not be from Montana is what you're saying.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let me search.  But TikTok can tell you who those people are.  Yeah, TikTok knows.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's see, here's Montana Tucker, singer, dancer, actress.  I think that's her real name.  Montana Jordan, Montana Coles, French Montana.  Oh, here's the Visit Montana account.  It's got 100,000 followers.  Guess you'd be shutting that down.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, that's the great, great gifts there, that third one.  I wanna see what that looks like.  That looks like something they could've.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Locally loved gifts in Montana.  Let's turn on the sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And back if you just come.  It's the perfect place for holiday shopping.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Gosh, I hate that voice.  Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great Gray Gifts.  Oh, it's a coffee.  They have lots of fun gifts for the whole family.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm not going to Montana.  This is so boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Come with us to Great Gray Gifts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay, Great Gray Gifts is not the most enticing of names.  How about Huckleberry Bear Claws?  You gotta try those.  They're from Pole Bridge Mercantile.  You had me at Fried Fridge.  Famous for its Huckleberry Bear Claws.  Sorry, Pole Bridge, no more promotion for you  on the old TikTok.  They should sue.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They should sue.  I mean, yeah.  I want those.  Oh, that looks very good.  Have you tried them?  No.  That's like a gigantic Ruggala.  It's a giant Ruggala.  It's an American sized Ruggala.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, you think it's like you New York types  would call it a Ruggala.  Yeah, this is kind of sad.  I don't know what to make of this.  My son, I'm gonna have breakfast with him tomorrow.  I'll ask him how he feels about it.  But I don't think he really,  he's not focused anymore on TikTok, I don't think.  I think Insta and other places.  And his book.  And his book.  In fact, his latest is Burnt Potato Chips.  Seems like he's given up on the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  on the whole premise of cooking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, actually, aw, little lobsters.  Aw, little lobsters.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, God.  Henry.  Cruel your son.  Henry.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh, is he making a lobster sandwich with kettle crisps?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, see, yeah, he crisped them extra crispy.  Three sticks of butter.  That's Henry right there.  Three sticks of butter with his lobster.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh, yep, it is a lobster roll.  That's what I have for Mother's Day.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I love lobster rolls.  And you put crunchy chips on it.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  No, you need chives, not shallot, Henry.  Bad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You lost me at shallots.  2.3 million followers on TikTok, all of whom.  I wonder what percentage, it'd be funny to find out,  like, well, how many Montana followers?  Like if you have 100,000, that's a loss.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'll ask him how he feels.  My guess is he's gonna say, what do you mean, I don't care.  He's gonna be like, what band?  Who cares?  What band?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, how many people live in Montana anyway?  Montana, California, maybe.  Probably more than Wyoming.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Weird document.  Amazon in the morning.  Oh, 1.1 million.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay, that's not insignificant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's almost as many.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Twice as many as live in Wyoming.  How many?  1.1 million as of 2021.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Yeah, Wyoming only has like half a million.  Wyoming has like half a million in the whole state.  Wow, and two senators.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Amazon launched new devices this morning.  What?  What?  Yeah, we don't care.  They're silly.  We don't care.  Even Stacey does.  I thought you would, I put this in  because I thought you would.  Yeah, I thought it was Stacey Bate.  This Echo, it's Stacey Bate.  This Echo Pop for $40 is an Eero Beacon  as well as everything else.  That's kinda cool.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  You know, I turned on the Eero Beacon.  I have been very dissatisfied.  So Amazon has a service that lets you  turn certain Echo devices,  if you have Eero routers in your home,  it adds that as another Eero router.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is one of them, the new Echo Pop.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  This could be one.  I turned mine on.  It is literally next door.  Like I have an Eero right behind me.  And then I have an Echo next door.  It never works.  It's always like, I can't get a signal.  This is frustrating.  And I'm like, nevermind, you suck.  That is disappointing.  These are 40 bucks.  It's cheaper.  They're cute colors.  If you want it, go ahead.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They just look like speakers.  That's the funny thing.  The dots were kinda ugly.  Looked like hockey pucks.  These just look like little speakers  and they're pretty colors.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, the dot is now a sphere.  It's a full-on sphere.  It looks like a little.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I kinda like this form factor.  Anyway, they snuck that out.  Let's see, what else?  What else?  Uber.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If Google tablet docking station  had had that functionality, you'd be happier.  I would be.  You could get a speaker on it.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  So Amazon can produce this Echo.  It's probably, I don't know if it's a loss leader  or just even.  40 freaking dollars.  And Google's charging me $129  for what is essentially a speaker  that only works if there's a tablet stuck on it.  Thanks, Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did you order one?  I ordered one.  500 bucks, including the dock.  We'll see.  I'm getting mine, what is it?  June?  Is that when they come?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I didn't order it.  I didn't care.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I have to.  It's my job.  June 21st.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  When it comes to tablets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A week after Father's Day.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  When it comes to tablets, what's your use case?  Are you a consumption person or productivity person?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I have an iPad mini, which is a really good size.  Little eight or seven or eight inches.  That I keep next to my bedside table.  That's my reading.  Consumption.  So that's pure consumption.  Although sometimes I'll text, stuff like that.  But yeah, pretty much pure consumption.  And then I have an iPad Pro.  And down the road, that might end up being  when you put Final Cut Studio on there.  And Logic Pro on there.  Yeah, they announced that last week, right?  That comes out May 23rd, in about a week.  That may end up being more of a productivity thing,  but right now it's basically a FaceTime.  I used to FaceTime my mom.  I use it as a second screen with my Mac,  because you can move the mouse over.  And so I'll have Discord running there  or some other messaging client or whatever.  And then I'll have it running in the background.  It's really a subsidiary device.  It's not a primary device.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But that's just me.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  You know, Kevin Toffle works on his iPad Pro quite a bit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we have people come in and do the show.  Harry McCracken's gonna be on Twitter on Sunday.  He normally brings his.  He'll bring an iPad.  That's what he'll be on.  Yeah, that's true.  It's just as goofy as people who only use Chromebooks.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Hey, I don't know.  The iPad has a decent CPU in it or chip.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It does.  It has an M1 or an M2.  I mean, those are pretty dang fancy.  I did note that the HP, the pretty HP Chromebook  is back in stock.  I thought I mentioned this to you, Jeff.  So you think I should get it?  I think HP makes pretty nice ones.  What was the name of it?  Maybe it's not here.  It's the.  The Elite or.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Elite, Chrome.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Dragonfly.  Dragonfly, yeah.  By Pro.  Now, the Dragonfly is beautiful.  Paul Therott said on Windows Weekly  he doesn't recommend it for Windows.  It's a little underpowered,  but I think it'd be fine for a Chromebook.  I mean, it's a really.  Let me see if I can find the Chromebook version.  It's a really slim and beautiful.  You gotta say Chromebook.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You gotta type in Chromebook.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you gotta type in Chromebook.  You gotta search for Chromebook.  Search for Chromebook.  Dragonfly, Chromebook.  Chromebook.  Papyri.  There it is, yeah.  Limited stock.  Hurry, last few remaining.  Yeah, I think these are pretty.  Look at the price, though.  A thousand bucks for a Chromebook.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a little heavy.  Yeah.  And the battery is not perfect.  Yeah, maybe not.  Though the original reports were wrong.  Kevin was very good about that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is he like these days for a Chromebook?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh, if you wait like 20 seconds, he's gonna tell you.  But he does say, Jeff,  that he has a review of the HP Pro Chromebook.  Yeah, I read it a few weeks ago.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yep.  Hang on.  Kevin.  He's typing right now.  I hang on your every review.  Believe me.  I check you every week.  And I also support.  Does it renew automatically by the support of Kevin,  or do I have to do it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ben Schoon writing two days ago in nine to five,  Google said the Dragonfly Pro is the best of Chrome OS.  The best.  So it's a flagship, but it's flagship priced.  That's the.  My current.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's been on the network a few times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ben Schoon?

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Schoon.  Schoon?  Ben Schoon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's Schoon.  I hate to tell you, Ben.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I think it's Papyri.  If he knows how to say Papyri.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  You don't sail around in a Schooner.  Then again, maybe I'm wrong,  but I know he's been on the network a few times.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I pronounce it as the original Dutch pronunciation.  I stand corrected, sir.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Okay, Kevin has told me he likes his spin 714.  He's still with the Acer.  He's still with the Acer spin.  He's a loyal man.  But for $1,000, the HP Dragonfly Pro is nicer.  He didn't want to spend the money.  Jeff would like the HP.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, because Jeff has loaded.  14-inch, we know journalism professors are very well paid.  That's why we get the houndstooth jackets.  The 14-inch.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I always wear black cheap Uniclo black t-shirts.  That's all I have.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  That's why his dinner is frozen food from the fridge.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The 14-inch 2560 by.  Did I tell you I had a Cacio e Pepe in Rome?  I did.  You did.  It's quite good.  The 14-inch.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So TikTok now knows that I like Cacio e Pepe.  So they're showing me Cacio e Pepe recipes constantly.  Maybe trying to get me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no recipe.  It's spaghetti and pepper.  Noodles, cheese and pepper.  Go down to Lines.  Noodles, cheese and pepper.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Noodles, cheese and pepper.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Lines 160 and 161.  Good job.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  160, 161.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You too could be a TikTok star.  You see variations on Cacio.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  160, good Lord.  There's something at Line one, oh,  this was going to be your pick.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that's okay.  I give it a big one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here we go.  When your Italian husband finds an authentic pasta dish  here in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you try true?  That's a pasta dish.  Are you crying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm not crying, but I want to cry.  That's the Cacio e Pepe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is he crying?  Fantastic.  He's actually crying.  Grazie.  That's the real Cacio e Pepe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Vero Cacio e Pepe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All it is.  And Italy.  Is noodles.  Noodles, cheese and pepper.  Cheese and pepper.  It's in the name.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  The next guy does a whole complicated thing.  I'm sorry Italians, please don't get upset with me.  I went to.  It's delicious though.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A wonderful, like 200 year old restaurant,  famous in Rome for its Cacio e Pepe and its Carbonara.  And the makers, and it'll make us sit in the window  rolling out their noodles.  Oh yeah.  Buttered.  So good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  While that's going,  we're making.  Grit cheese.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Pecorino.  We're going to put this stuff.  Parmesan.  Or of our blend.  Romano.  This is, yeah, he's, he's, he's, he's not.  Butter nice and foamy here.  Foamy butter.  Pepper corns.  You didn't mention foamy butter.  Butter.  You don't see pepper corns.  Not your pepper recipes.  Noodles.  Uh oh.  Slowly streaming.  Streaming a little pasta cooking water.  Oh boy.  That's how you get a nice thick of sauce.  That's the science here at the party.  Now we have a Karima sauce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dreamy sauce.  Between the pasta water,  the spice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what was in there?  Let's just review.  A near unbreakable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Noodles.  Maybe a little bit more cheese.  Grated pepper.  Cheese.  And pepper.  And pepper.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  He added a little butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Butter.  Oh he added a little butter.  He came from sticky.  Butters understood.  That's just to keep him from sticky.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Butter's always in there.  Nothing you can do.  It's either butter or olive oil.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So old I forget what Leo was going to talk about.  Where were you back up there?  You think I remember?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We were talking about dragon floss.  What was it?  14 inch, 25, 60 by 1600 IPS touchscreen.  And it's been shown.  1200 nits.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  You've been corrected by the way.  What?  It's been shown.  It's been shown.  It is shown.  Shown.  Oh shown.  That's really wrong.  Mr. Howell has corrected us.  That's completely wrong.  It's shown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's two O's.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's no way that's shown.  Shown is S-C-H-O-E-N.  That's not shown.  That's schooned.  S-H-O-E-E.  And you're lay-o for God's sake.  Shown.  I thought you were Leo.  1200 nits is very bright.  That's good.  This looks like a nice laptop.  Nice laptop.  And it's got I3 and I5 in it.  It's very heavy duty.  It's using the same delightful decks as been shown.  As was on the Elite Dragonfly, if that's his real name.  So this is what you'd get on the Windows machine.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What do you think about a haptic  instead of a real click mouse pad?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's fine.  If it's done right, which Apple does by the way,  you would know the difference.  All right.  Okay.  You would not, absolutely not know the difference  if it's done right.  And HP is gonna do it right.  It's got a fingerprint sensor.  That's nice.  Well, look.  Microphone on my Chrome machine broke.  It's hard to justify a thousand dollars for Chromebook  unless that's your main machine.  But it's for Chrome.  I did it all the time.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  For Chrome OS, just get an Acer.  Don't spend a thousand dollars for Chrome OS, sir.  What was it I got that I needed?  Don't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Kevin says it's done right.  Pardon me?  He says it's what?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Kevin says it's done right.  You should spend a thousand bucks.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Kevin's the expert.  I check in on Kevin every week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Believe me.  Are you in the mood for a new one?  Are you ready for a new one?  You said you're-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, my microphone's broken.  His microphone.  Which some people would celebrate that I'm silenced.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you could use the microphone  in front of you right now instead.  So here's a-

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh, the haptic track pad has done right.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is done right.  Oh, good.  So this is an i5, 16 gigs of RAM, 256 SSD,  all of this overkill for a Chromebook.  But that's exactly what Google would offer you.  If they had a Pixelbook, it'd be this price, a thousand bucks.  I mean, I wouldn't buy it because it's a Chromebook,  but if you only use Chromebooks, absolutely didn't get it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How many years now have I been doing this?  It's amazing.  When did they come out?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jesus.  Oh, I don't know.  It's been eight, at least eight years.  Yeah, I've been pure Chromebook that long.  Good man.  I admire your tenacity.  It's for the show, you know.  Uber had an announcement too.  They had their new, what do they call it?  They have a cutesy name for their Uber thing.  Let me see, here's the TechCrunch story.  Uber's annual Go Get event.  That's what it's called.  The Go Get event.  Who knew they had an event?  We didn't.  Otherwise we would have covered it.  Everyone has an event.  It was today.  Slew of new products and features aimed  at attracting a new set of customers from teens  as young as 13.  You can now, so this was always an issue for us  because we wanted our kid to take Uber.  He would take the train down to his high school  and then take the last mile.  We got him to call an Uber and we always had a lie  because he wasn't 18 yet.  And they wouldn't pick him up otherwise.  And it was unreasonable, I think.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's a tall guy so he could get away with it, right?  He could get away with it, that's right.  They never asked how it hit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They never asked how it hit.  Because he's also tall and good looking.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I've done it a couple times.  And it was like, oh, he looks older than me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It seems appropriate.  By the way, Chromebooks are 12 years old,  says Mashed Potatoes.  12 years old.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Shoot, I'm sorry.  Probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't have a seat at 28.  You have the mouth of a 12 year old.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  The mouth of a journalistic professor.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Stacey said it earlier.  I heard Stacey say it.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  It is true.  You should have heard.  I'm still sad about it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You should have heard Amy Webb,  who by the way says you hate her.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I don't.  She keeps saying that.  That's the only thing I hate is that she says that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Phil Libeton, and they were swearing up a storm.  Yes, it was so funny.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We were talking about AI and it was like,  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So we had to bleep it.  So if you listen to Twitter on Sunday.  It was so funny.  But at one point, I think it was Benito,  said don't worry, swear all you want, we have AI.  And AI was just.  So Uber now, if you sign up for a family account,  you can have your teenager age 13 to 17 request rides.  But here's the biggest thing.  Uber is adding a phone number.  If you want to use Uber,  but quote, aren't as familiar with navigating a smartphone,  you can call 1-833-USE-UBER.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Grandma, it's for grandma.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's not just grandma.  You know what?  It's not just grandma.  We've had people, I've had people ask me,  can you call me an Uber?  Because I don't have an Uber account or whatever.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, what if you don't want to download the app?  Or I mean, that's not an.  And some people don't want, I mean,  giving Uber access to as much as they want on your phone.  That's a commitment.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I went to this Grammarly event last night.  Grammarly is a sponsor.  It was a very interesting event.  It was fascinating.  It was in Brooklyn and it was far away from the subway.  So they offered people Lyft.  That's another thing.  I never done that before and it worked really well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's another thing Uber is allowing.  You can always buy a prepaid Uber ride card,  but now you can say when it should be delivered.  That's cool.  So you could say, Jeff,  I know you're coming to our conference on the 11th.  Here's your card will arrive on the 11th, that kind of thing.  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  With the Lyft, it also said it has to go here.  Yes.  Which is correct.  Yeah, no, no, that's right.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  They've had things where,  actually I think it was on Lyft, not Uber.  Cause I know I've had credit codes that they give you.  Like here's a credit code to get to the airport.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We've done that.  We used to do ads for Uber  that would advertise that as a feature.  That you could set people up with Uber rides as part.  You have a business account, I think it was.  Company did actually, interestingly,  not that I would have predicted this,  Uber's first quarter earnings  beat forecasts across the board.  Did they actually make money though?  Oh, that's another question.  Uber's gross bookings rose 19%,  31 billion in the first quarter,  revenue up 30%.  Okay, but did they profit?  No.  Yeah.  I'm sure not.  Have they ever turned a profit ever?  No.  Uber Eats has been very successful.  All right, let's see.  Revenue 8.82 billion,  gap loss.  Nope.  Narrower than expected.  Adjusted profits.  It beat the $761 million EBITDA.  That's profit.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh, no.  Is it in parentheses?  Huh.  Because if it's in parentheses, it's a loss.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  That's a negative, yeah.  It's negative.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No.  Is it in parentheses?  The adjusted profits came in better than the street rec  and $761 million in adjusted EBITDA  compared to the estimate.  Shares of the company spiked.  So, I guess part of this is Uber and Lyft  did not do well in the pandemic, right?  Nobody went anywhere.  No, no.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  And dinner's a mask.  Well, people ordered food.  Mandates and stuff too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But yeah, Uber Eats has really helped propel Uber's earnings.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Did they do any sort of reorganizing of their statements?  EBITDA is a fuzzy number in the sense  that you can do a lot to EBITDA to make it look nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Earnings before income tax.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Tax and.  EBITDA.  Depreciation.  Depreciation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Adjustments or something.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Now, they don't have a lot of assets to depreciate.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right, because they don't own the cars.  This is the poor drivers who.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  Don't they have a program where you kind of rent the car  from Uber, but Uber does not then have title to it?  I don't know.  I think they might.  Like a taxi cab.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Anyway.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uber announced results.  Let me just see here.  This was in February.  They announced the results.  Gross bookings, revenue, net income  attributable to Uber technologies, 595 million.  That's a 756 million net benefit pre-tax  primarily due to net unrealized gains  related to the reevaluation of Uber's equity investments.  So, you know, not from the operating of the business.  EBITDA of 665 million.  That's up 579 million year over year.  I guess they're profitable.  EBITDA or EBITDA?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I've heard EBITDA.  EBITDA.  EBITDA.  I say EBITDA.  And when you're on earnings calls, JC.  Just cause you got Pompeii.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  What did I say?  EBITDA.  EBITDA.  EBITDA.  Just cause you got Papyrus.  Like the wife of the Chilean dictator

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  or Argentinian dictator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't cry for me, EBITDA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I never loved you.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  The truth is I never loved you.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I don't know the song.  And it's named not EBITDA, it's EBITDA.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  You're pulling a bad quattro there.  All right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  Here's some parentheses.  Oh, but this was 2021.  So no, they've been profitable since last year.  That's really interesting.  It's not what I would have thought.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I didn't know that either.  We all assumed that they're not making money.  Why did we not know that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't believe you.  I have a picture of an Uber driver counting the bills  as he drives you to wherever you're going.  Thank you to our Discord.  We love our Discord.  Nicely done.  We love our Discord.  If you are not yet a ClubTwit member,  you can improve our EBITDA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Please and thank you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Like from negative numbers, perhaps to positive numbers,  by paying seven bucks a month.  It really does help us.  It seems like not much.  And we give you, I think, a very nice value for your money.  You get ad-free versions of all the shows.  You get shows we don't put out in public  on the Twit Plus feed, like Hands on Macintosh  with Micah Sargent, Hands on Windows with Paul Thurotte,  the new Home Theater Geeks, Scott Wilkinson.  By the way, you'll love our community manager.  He's a good-looking, fancy fella named Aunt Pruitt.  Not sure about fancy, but good-looking, yes.  Fancy fella.  And he has been putting together some great events  in our Discord, including Stacy's Book Club,  which is coming up next month.  The Terraformers, Annalee Newitz's new book.  Plus you get access to the Discourse.  That's where all those events happen.  I think it's a really good deal for seven bucks a month.  Yep.  It is indeed.  Twit.tv slash ClubTwit.  There are individual plans, there's family plans,  that's something new, and corporate plans as well.  And we like to promote it because I really think  it's important for our long-term survival.  And it's a friendly punch you say, come on in.  Come on in, says Wayne Brady.  Come on in.  Okay, what else?  Is it a democracy?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Okay, Uber lost money.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  What are your senses?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I'm looking at their financials for last quarter,  which were issued on their website on May 2nd, 2023.  And if you look at their net loss,  it was 157 million.  Well, that's getting there.  Now, their EBITDA was positive,  but, and I would have to go look at the actual 10Q.  No, that's not confusing.  That's how accountants get you.  It's because you don't look at what you're supposed to.  Always.  Because remember, they've lost so much money for so long,  they can actually budge the numbers and be like,  oh, we're not paying any, anyway, sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Net cash, 606 million free cash.  So they lost, yeah, I see this,  net loss attributable to Uber technology is 157 million.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  That's much less, though, than the same period a year ago  when they lost 5.9 billion.  Whoa, grief.  Whoa. Right.  So, doing a lot better,  but they still reported a net loss.  And their revenue is up considerably.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  That's impressive.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And their EBITDA is up 353%.  Which is a little suspicious.  How's Lyft doing?  Lyft just laid off a ton of people.  I don't know if Lyft's doing all that well.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Are you gonna make me look up Lyft's fund?  Yes, please. Yes, please.  Thanks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's the stocks in there?  You care about the facts, Stacey.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're just trying to keep us on the facts.  No fun.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, I trained originally as a financial reporter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I know, that's why we're making you do this.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Like none of this EBITDA nonsense.  Oh, these are their annual.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I actually use Lyft, I don't use Uber.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Revenue, one billion, net income minus 187 million.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So they're also improved over Wall Street's expectations.  So that's good.  Both of the ride sharing companies are doing all right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was in one last night from this Grammarly event.  Grammarly's a sponsor.  And the driver, I dropped off my friend Jay Rosen.  Then we rode uptown and started talking to the driver.  My friend Jay Rosen from New York University.  Yeah, I have friends.  Lyft has also reported a loss.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah.  Their loss was 190, or sorry, 187.  Similar, very similar, isn't it?  A million, so yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So the driver speaks Spanish.  He's born elsewhere.  Not only speaks.  This, by the way, I just want to say

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  that one of my favorite kind of stories  and anecdotes is Lyft.  His drivers.  Uber driver stories.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right, but he's spent 10 years  studying chemistry in China.  Wow.  Wow.  They're amazing, they're amazing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, my daughter takes a lot of Uber and Lyft rides  and I hear a lot of stories about Uber  because she gets in a conversation with every one of them.  She could be Tom Friedman.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  You should, as a journalist,  Jeff is doing the right thing.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Always talk to.  Stories, human stories are fascinating, fascinating.  The other shoe dropped,  Vice has filed for bankruptcy after 29 years.  It's chapter 11 though, right?  That's reorganization.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh yeah, they're having,  yeah, they've got a presumptive sale to the lenders.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Including the Soro.  Uh-oh, Soro.  Soro, Fortress Investment Group,  Soro's Fund Management in Monroe Capital  will buy the company,  which was high flying at $5.7 billion six years ago  for 225 million.  That's amazing.  About 4% of their peak valuation.  Unless they can find a higher bidder,  but I'm thinking that's probably not gonna happen.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Does this say Vice was overvalued back then?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's really a common, maybe not.  Any journalistic organization  of online journalism, right?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, no, no.  I think it's a common on stupid investors.  Yeah.  What were they laundering?  Sorry.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, you're right.  I also think, my argument is,  I was on CBC talking about just this,  that it's the last gasp of old mass media  seeking traffic for traffic's sake.  And they had new ways to do it,  but they had new competitors who came in  and there was no barrier to entry  and they weren't that cool after all.  So I don't think we've invented what follows.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did you, have you finished Ben Smith's book now, Traffic?  Oh yeah, I wrote about it on Medium.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You like it?  Top post on Medium.  Yes, I do.  I think it's very well written.  It's quite interesting.  And comparing Nick Denton's Gawker,  who I was a friend of Nick's  and was around much of that,  with Buzzfeed is really interesting.  And Ben's book is really good.  He goes on about this quest for traffic.  Realizing in the end, the traffic was a commodity.  And other, one I didn't include in my write up on Medium  was an interesting chapter he had on Jezebel  and how in his view Jezebel was really the,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  preamble to so much.  Jezebel was a print magazine though, yes?  No.  It was not.  It was a website.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Jezebel was a feminist blog that was owned by Gawker.  It used to be awesome, now it sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, well we've seen, it's been up and down.  It's been difficult.  I mean, you know, podcasting is kind of struggling too.  Yep.  It's just been difficult.  What I didn't know was MTV News is dead.  They just fired 25 staffers.  Another end of the line.  Although, was MTV News on MTV or was it just web only?

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I didn't even know it existed.  I know.  Yeah.  I thought MTV was just reality shows now  and not even music.  Yeah.  That's true.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A lot of people are trying a lot of different things  in the internet era to make news work.  Not just news, kind of informative content.  Is that fair?  Because I think we're not a news,  exactly a news podcast, but we.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  No, because then you would want to be right  about things like net losses.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, zing.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I said what I said, man.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We were right.  My goal is to be right eventually.  I don't expect to be right all the time.  I like to be right eventually.  Eventually, at some point.  And thanks to Stacey, I think we do pretty well there.  Yes.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I was gonna say eventually.  Keep it up, Zinus.  She keeps it up, Zinus.  She turned a profit.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Keeping this honest.  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.  I'm actually, this is a sad story  and I meant to talk about it last week and I forgot.  But I'm sure, Jeff, you have something to say about Deuce.  I followed her.  I loved her blog.  She was the first mommy blogger,  but that's really diminishing to call her a mommy blogger.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Not at all.  No, I don't think it diminishes her at least  because I think there were the stages of bloggers.  There were tech bloggers, there were political bloggers,  war bloggers, if you recall, I was one of those.  And then came mommy bloggers, women bloggers.  And Deuce was really a leader of that.  With a unique voice, she got fired for her blogging.  So that became a verb.  If you got fired for your blogging, you've been Deuced.  She was amazing.  She had a lot of trouble in life.  A lot of anxiety, a lot of difficulty.  And in the end, it defeated her really tragically.  She also kind of went off the rails in other ways,  but we've got to give her credit for what she built.  And I think there was a lot of talk about Jezebel  in the Ben Smith book, but Deuce was far before Jezebel.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She started blogging in 97.  So, Stacey, were you a Deuce reader?  Deuce blog started in 2001.  She was a, what I liked,  I didn't care about the subject matter.  She was a great writer.  Yeah, sure, she was.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, she was like Jenny Lawson.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  So.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And she wrote about her life  in a genuine, authentic, real way,  which in the early days of the internet was so refreshing.  Yeah.  Because-  Oversharing in some ways.  Yeah, but we were so used to this kind of polished  presentation of mainstream media,  and it was really refreshing to see people authentically.  Now we're tired of that.  Yeah, maybe now we want to go back to polish.  I don't know.  Influencers.  But see, that's polished again, right?  It's-  Oh yeah, what is?  Influencers, the stuff that's big now in social  is all, you know, YOLO,  you only see, you don't see their real life.  You don't see the unnamed face.  They simulate it.  I'll say they simulate it.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah.  They try to make it look real life.  Yeah, but it isn't.  And that's even worse.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because people go, oh, I can't live up to that.  And then it's, you feel bad.  Heather's life was all too real.  Heather, you never read her stuff and said,  gosh, your life is better than mine.  It's quite the opposite often.  You said, I'm not alone.  I'm saying that's what you said.  I'm not alone.  I'm not the only one who feels this way.  Eight and a half million readers a month at the peak.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Which is a time of a much smaller internet.  Oh, that was, at the time, that was huge.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did she take her life?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  People didn't go on the internet to show what she did.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  And of course, as we probably should always say  when we talk about such things, is if-  What is the new number?  Yeah, there's a new number.  If you feel like you are worried about yourself  or you need help.  9-8-H.  There's somebody to help.  And it is now 9-8-8, which is great.  The suicide and crisis lifeline.  There's somebody there who cares, who you can talk to.  And I wish she had.  Yeah.  I really wish she had.  Because that's a huge launch.  She was a precious voice.  She was a precious voice, yeah.  And I meant to bring this up last week  and I just, I spaced it out.  But there was a very-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's all those early days of blogging.  Yeah.  I interviewed Dave Weiner a week ago  and we were reminiscing,  which is the point of the interview for my book,  about the blogger cons.  This was pre-loving bloggers and pre-divisors  back in the tech and political days.  But it was a wonderful time.  It was amazing.  Oh, it was.  We disagreed with each other and we talked with each other  and we got along and what happened?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would say some of the same thing  for early days of podcasting in the mid-2000s.  There was really-  Oh, Leo podcasting's only been big

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  in the last two years, don't you know?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, but the same thing happened to podcasting  that happened to blogging,  which is the big publishers came in and said,  okay, we'll take it from here.  And then they got bored with it.  Yeah, and then they're bored, right?  For a while they thought, oh, we've got the formula.  True crime.  And every podcast was true crime.  I even thought, I thought we should launch  a true crime podcast.  If we really wanted to sell,  we should have at least two or three true crime podcasts.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  True crime and a companion podcast  based on whatever the hot show is of the month.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, the Game of Thrones session companion podcast.  I actually think that would do well on your social thing.  Pick a show and just get-  We tried that?  Talk about it each week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We tried that.  We've tried all of the obvious things except true crime.  I just never could bring myself to do scripted stuff.  But, and those are scripted.  You have to have writers.  Oh boy.  But nobody wanted anything from us  but tech news and information, help and how-to.  That was really what our-

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  That's because you're not as cool as like-  Well, you are a detective.  And well-rounded.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did I do something to hurt you recently?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Over the years?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Today or-

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He hangs his head.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I don't have my punch Leo button.  So now I'm just going for the verbal jabs.  You really don't need it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're hitting me-  You're a psychic button.  Yeah, you're hitting me where it counts.  Right up here.  Right in the old noggin.  Microsoft, this is weird,  has inked a deal to use Fusion Energy by 2028.  Now correct me if I'm wrong, Stacey.  You did talk about this last week.  Oh shoot, nevermind.  Yeah, yeah, you brought that up.  Screw it.  I'll correct you right now.  Screw it.  Forget I mentioned it.  Are you worried about lithium battery fires on airplanes?  Why suddenly is this happening?  Yeah, really?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  It's been happening.  Apparently we didn't even know about it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, so I guess CBS did an investigation  and they found out that there is on average  an incident every week on an airplane  due to a lithium ion battery  either catching fire or exploding.  And it's problematic.  Now we talked about this on Ask the Tech Guys on Sunday  and the guy who does the Airplane Geek podcast called in.  He's an airplane aficionado.  Oh, main man Micah?  Yeah, Micah from Maine.  Main man Micah.  He said all commercial flights now have bags  for lithium ion fires that are self extinguishing.  Oh, I was gonna ask.  So that's the good news is they are at least prepared  for this and this may be why we haven't heard  of any really terrible things.  This is why you don't put them in your luggage too.  According to, the other thing I learned is  there is something in the Department of Transportation  called the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration  or FMSA.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Say it again, FMSA.  And he knows how to pronounce things.  So we know that's the right one.  According to FMSA, from March 2018 through March 2023,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  five years, there were 5.3 incidents on,  5,319 incidents on all airplanes in the United States,  700 of them on passenger planes.  That averages to be one hazmat incident on a passenger plane  every two and a half days.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yikes.  And it's probably actually greater  because remember so many flights were canceled during COVID  and that was right smack in the middle of that data set.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A lot of these are not your laptop or your smartphone.  A lot of them are, in fact, it seems like-  Probably like e-cigarette things.  It's e-cigs.  It's the cheesy, cheap e-cigs that you buy.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, and they stopped letting you check all of your luggage  with the batteries and bringing your luggage  with the batteries in.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that was the stupidest thing  was the batteries building in the luggage.  That was just so dumb.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I remember when that law changed  because I had checked a ton of stuff with batteries  and I got pulled out of the airplane.  They actually came and got me and they said,  you need to take all of the batteries out of this.  I said, what do you mean?  They said, you can't put this-  It was UBU, you had about 47 of them, right?  I carry so many lithium-ion batteries with me.  Laptop, iPad, cameras, drones, microphones,  Insta360 cameras, probably a dozen lithium-ion batteries  on every trip.  There are companies working on batteries that won't burn.  That's one solution, right?  But the other one is to have airplanes prepared  and personnel trained when things start smoking.  And do not put batteries in the checked luggage  because you can't tell it's smoking.  And keep an eye on your stuff.  And if you see smoke coming out of the overhead bin,  immediately notify the flight attendant.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Let someone know, don't be a hero.  Yeah.  The staff and team are trained on that stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The good news is, as far as I know,  no planes have gone down because of this,  but it's certainly scary.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  You don't use water to put out a lithium-ion battery.  It's chemical expulsion, right?  It's like a grease fire.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  So these bags, you can see one right here,  these aviation sex.  I think they do have water in them,  but that's mostly to hold the smoke and stuff inside, right?  Because yeah, the problem is the lithium-ion,  that's Pete Buttigieg,  our Department of Transportation Secretary.  The problem is, so these are the bags, they put them in.  The problem is that the oxygen that supports combustion  is in the battery.  So you can't smother it.  All right.  Oh, okay, thank you for that explanation.  Yeah.  So it's a self-feeding fire.  And that's why they're difficult.  You know, we've heard for years about problems at recycling.  Pretty much every recycling plant ends up  having a lithium-ion battery fire at some point.  They get punctured, and once they're punctured,  exposed to air, they burn.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Cities are having this issue with like the electric scooters.  A lot of them are randomly catching on fire in cities as well.  Yeah, they're all over it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're littering.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they're cheap crappy things too.  It was a very bad, now you're gonna have to  look at the balance sheet, Stacey, and verify this number.  But according to Variety,  cord cutting hit an all-time high  January through March, 2023.  US pay TV subscriptions  fell to their lowest level since 1992.  2.3 million customers turned away from cable satellite  and internet TV providers.  Interesting.  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, I get it.  It's Bruce Lickman's data, right?  I don't know whose data it is.  And internet?  I get his, so Bruce Lickman does,  it's Lickman Research Group,  and he has been calculating this stuff  for the last 20 years.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this one is a report from Craig Moffett  of SVB Moffett-Nathanson.  In any event, they all agree,  because as Craig said, we're watching the sun  begin to set on the pay TV business.  Couldn't happen to a nicer bunch of people, right?  Wonder how this is gonna ensure  that negotiations.  So here's what.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  With the Writers Guild and all,  I'm wondering if those numbers are coming up  in their negotiations.  Oh, I don't know.  That's an interesting,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  because where are people going?  They're going to streaming, right?  I don't know why I'm pointing at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because your shirt says IT Pro TV and chill.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  My shirt says IT Pro and chill.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, the reason they say internet  is because of the streamers like YouTube TV and Hulu.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're also.  I thought that was the alternative.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the alternative is Netflix, HBO Max, Hulu.  Not Hulu streaming.  No bundle.  Yeah, no bundle.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  No bundle. Hold on, hold on.  So I'm just looking. Here comes the fact check.  I'm sorry.  No, don't apologize.  Actually, I'm not sorry.  No, don't be sorry.  So the pay TV providers,  this actually, so this is Leichtman's research.  So Moffett is a Wall Street analyst.  It says according to Moffett's calculations in here,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  in this variety article.  So what?  You know, she says different calculations.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I know.  And Moffett's calculations and Leichtman's calculations  are both based on the financial reports  issued every quarter by the big cable company.  So it's roughly the same numbers.  Okay.  Sorry.  So I'm just seeing,  because Leichtman also pulls out other like Dish TV  and sorry, other things like over the top things  like YouTube TV.  So those guys,  they actually also lost.  So the bundle guys like Sling, Hulu, Plus Live TV,  YouTube TV and Fubo also lost 394 subscribers this quarter.  So everybody's losing things because of,  so it's not just the cable guys,  which everyone is cutting the cord,  but it's also probably an economic issue too,  because people are.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Comcast, the largest pay TV provider in the country  dropped 614,000 customers  in the first three months of the year.  That's not insignificant.  YouTube TV was the only provider tracked by Moffett.  Nathan said that picked up subs.  They added 300,000 subscribers.  In fact, at this point,  it looks like YouTube TV is gonna be the winner  in terms of internet TV, live TV.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  They are the top one with 5.7 million subscribers.  UI is good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It says 6.3 million here, but that's anyway.  They netted over the past year, 1.4 million subscribers.  Hulu has barely grown.  In fact, they lost a hundred thousand subs in Q1.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  ABC is about to buy the rest of it.  Disney is about to buy the rest of it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, Disney, ABC, Comcast is getting out of it, basically.  Comcast owns a quarter of it.  Disney has the right to buy it off of them.  They're talking right now.  Comcast is happy to give it to them.  And Disney has said that we'll just roll it into Disney Plus.  It'll all be one streaming thing.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, because once they launched Peacock,  it really made no sense for them to have Hulu.  Right, right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Fubo TV lost 160,000 subscribers.  It's worst quarterly loss in record.  So it's a big change in the way TV works.  Pay TV for-  When did y'all cut the cord?  I still have the cord.  I am corded.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I can't remember.  It's been a long time, long time.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I think I did it in 2010.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  We're old.  I still have.  And the thing is,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Lots of cords.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gosh, man.  He's got a corded phone.  Hey, you know, it's like Battlestar Galactica.  If ever the Cylons come,  we know Jeff will still be able to place a cord pizza.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I would temporarily cut the cord.  I guess I should correct myself  because I would get back on cable for football season  and then call and yell at the cable company  and tell them to turn it off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Get YouTube TV and get Sunday-

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what I've been on YouTube TV for a while.  250 bucks for Sunday ticket for the new season.  I'm not doing that.  That's a lot of money.  That's stupid.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Anyway, according to Nathanson,  I'm sure your guy has other numbers,  but Nathanson, Moffitt Nathanson says the pay TV floor,  the bottom, you know,  the subscribers who will never quit,  50 to 60 million US homes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which is still, you know, okay.  There's still a lot of folks.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  So they still have, there's still 73,  so top, the big cable providers that we're just thinking of,  not the virtual internet guys,  that's 73 points, roughly 7 million left.  So we can still see 20 million drop.  Yikes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  US as of the end of Q1, US pay TV services  has 75 and a half million customers down 7%  year over year.  And everybody agrees that number's gonna get bigger  and bigger as more and more people leave.  I still have cable, I have YouTube TV.  I have, I subscribe to Hulu and-  And all the extras.  You get all the extras.  I got more money than sense.  And I just, I wanna watch everything.  And I don't wanna be told-  I'm gonna give you some sense for some of your money.  I don't wanna be told I can't watch something.  I wanna watch.  So I just watch it.  Damn it.  I think it's a bit of a thing,  but I think we are, Lisa and I are going back and forth  that we're probably gonna turn off the cable subscription.  YouTube TV scratches all of our ages.  It gets it done.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's gotten more expensive.  YouTube, oh yeah.  Why?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  It's a cable bill.  So yeah, so cable saw this coming.  I think I wrote this like in 2012 or 2010.  Cable was like, oh crikey.  Everyone's getting rid of their landlines except for Jeff.  Everyone's getting rid of the triple play.  Remember how we used to talk about the triple play?  And your bill for all of those was roughly $150 a month.  And now if you look at your broadband bill,  a lot of people are paying roughly that amount.  So that's all this.  It's just happened gradually that the price didn't change.  The mix of what you were paying for did.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But the other big thing that has happened here,  it is, and I write about this basically  in every book I do now, is it's the death of mass  that the huge audience that existed goes away.  Broadcast, linear TV is long dead.  AM radio is about to die as cars get rid of it.  Mass is what goes away.  And you have a lot of niches.  And I think that's more natural state for media.  It was a temporary state.  Yeah, that's what we are, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We've been a niche player since 2005.  Very happy in there.  It's not huge.  It's not 100 million people watching, but it's enough.  You don't want it to be.  But it's loyal. I don't want it to be, actually.  I don't want it to be.  I like having a kind of qualified small audience.  We love you all.  Everyone who's watching, we love you.  Yeah, we love you.  Well, I figure if they're watching us,  they're interested enough to watch us.  I think that's good.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  If you're listening later, we also love you too.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We especially love the ones who make it  all the way through.  We are amazed and happy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Our completion rate is about 80%.  You're kidding me.  No, that's freaking awesome.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Oh, that's great.  That's freaking awesome.  Wow.  That makes sense.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  It's pretty high.  Maybe it's tech people,  because the completion rate on my show is about 85, 80% too.  And I'm like, dang, you guys are...  You're not wrong.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think, you know what the difference is?  Yours more than ours,  but people are listening for information, right?  And so they're going to keep listening to the whole show.  It's not entertainment where you turn it off  when you're done washing the dishes.  And then you go to the next thing,  they're listening for content.  And I do prefer that.  I think we're a little less that than you.  That number would make sense.  Because we don't have much content.  It's mostly just our personalities.  And we go on forever.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  God, we do.  Hey, what's our next story?  Let's do this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's take a break and come back with your picks of the week.  How about that?  How about that?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Holy moly, we're not doing a change log?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No change log, no AI log?  Wow.  Sure.  Geez.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Freaking hate you guys.  My God, did we add an AI log?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just hate you guys so freaking much.  You're busting my chops here.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  We're just trying to keep us on track.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There were three AI stories.  We kind of did them already.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it was.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true.  That's true.  Let's see what the change log has.  I'll give it to you real quick.  Change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The theme is going to take longer than the change log.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much.  The Pixel 7a's free Pixel Buds and case offer  ends this weekend.  Buy your phone now if you were going to get one.  That's actually a good deal, the Pixel 7a.  I like it.  Although the 6a is even less expensive  and still a pretty good deal.  Google Docs is adding,  I put this in, I even put this in, collapsible headings.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You had it up in the main feed and demoted it.  I can't believe you even for a moment  had it in the main feed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook are sinking up.  Kind of.  Really?  Kind of.  Now this is a story for Mashable.  I didn't even know they were still in the business.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I got a question for you.  People send me calendar invites and they're at ICS  and of course I'm in Google and you can't import them.  Why?  You can't?  You can't open ICS?  You can.  You just click on it and save.  Yeah.  Yeah, you gotta go through all that McGilla.  You can just, whereas somebody who puts up a  save this to Google and you just click it and it's done  is so much better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well get ready, because on May 15th,  that was two days ago,  Google and Microsoft set it up to their calendar apps  allow for more integration.  They call it, get this, calendar interoperability.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Catchy.  That's awesome.  That's awesome marketing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Allows you to productively schedule time  and manage your schedule collaboratively  regardless of your calendaring platform.  Now people who use Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook  with the same email address can receive both  Google Calendar invitations and RSVP's in Outlook  for the same calendar.  Outlook will remind you about events created  in Google Calendar and recurring events from Outlook  will update on your Google Calendar.  So I think what it is honestly is they're starting  to support, ICS is the standard.  Google Calendar kind of did their own little thing  so it's a more automated.  It's better.  More AI in the workspace.  We kind of saw this at I.O. last week.  Gmail inbox, MeetNotes, slides, Soundtrack Maker.  All has AI now.  Android TV has a live tab with free channels  just like Google TV.  Those free channels.  Actually you know there's one free channel,  I don't normally, because I don't want to see ads.  Free V has the remarkable Jury Duty show.  Have you watched that yet?  Oh boy.  This is a reality TV show.  I saw an ad for it though.  Husband and kid are watching that.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I saw an ad for it though.  They love it.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  So it's legit, huh?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you know, I don't know if I'll watch all the episodes  because it's kind of repeating a little bit repetitive.  But the idea is, here I'll play the trailer for you.  This is an Amazon Prime thing.  But you have to watch it on Free V, right?  Their channel.  So the idea is, why do I have to mute it?  It's a trailer.  No, they're going to ding us.  Okay, don't ding us.  So the idea is, that guy, this guy here, is a real person.  Everybody else on the jury, the judge, the bailiff,  the lawyers, the defendants, are all actors.  Including James Marsden playing himself  as the biggest egotistical buffoon ever.  It's compelling.  But here's the thing that happened  that they didn't expect.  It's funny, right?  Because it's like, you know,  you're getting punked, right?  It's like candid camera.  He doesn't know, he's not in on it.  And so the jurors do all sorts of dopey things.  They hate on each other.  There's one juror who's like in the movement  of the enhanced body movement.  So he has one of those bags with water on it.  Oh, a camelback.  I can't like a camelback, but he says,  well, the idea actually would be  if I could have a bladder or some sort of bag  inserted in my body, I would never have.  And then he has another nozzle.  He says, what's that?  Well, that's a liquefied food.  He says, I have water and I have food.  And then he comes to the jury  with crutches strapped to his ass  because he doesn't want to have to sit down  or keep people waiting so he can sit down anytime.  It doesn't work with a jury box.  It's funny.  Like, and this guy, this poor guy  doesn't know it's all fake.  He thinks, wow, I'm the weirdest.  But here's the funny thing.  Here's the funny thing.  And the producers didn't expect this.  This guy is like a sweetheart.  Instead of getting angry or frustrated,  he like shows the guy with the sits on the crutches  and has the thing, a bug's life to show him  that you could be an outcast,  but really you're also an innovator.  He's like a sweetheart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's a saint.  Nothing throws him.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Outstanding.  And it's all of a sudden,  this guy, by the way, is gonna be a star.  He's all of a sudden.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My question is, did he have to like quit his,  did he have to leave his work?  He thought he was on a jury.  He thought he was.  Did he have to leave his work and not be paid  and then come to a jury?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And how did they?  Like you do in a jury.  What do they do to him?  The funny thing is Marsden is there  and he wants to get out of it.  So he stages fake paparazzi.  They come and they're at the door and stuff.  And the judge, instead of getting him out of the jury,  he says, yeah, I see judge is gonna happen all the time.  I should probably not be here.  Judge says, that's fine.  We're just gonna sequester you all.  So all of a sudden, they're all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're all staying in a motel together.  It's actually very funny.  Yeah, I would watch it.  I would watch it.  It's pretty wild.  How many episodes?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know, cause you know,  I'm just kind of losing steam on it.  It's certainly the first, the premise is well,  it's good enough the first few episodes.  I'll probably watch a few more.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I've been seeing the ads.  Okay, I'll give it a shot.  That's jury duty.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a really interesting concept.  And I think it got out of the producer's control  because this guy turned out not to be reacting.  They thought he'd be like all pissy.  And instead this guy's like a saint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Doing his civic duty.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The way, John's asking a good question.  Aren't the cameras a giveaway?  No, he's told that we are making a documentary  about jury duty and we have chosen your jury.  So they have documentary style interviews of the entire,  of everybody, the actors and the real guy.  They pretend everybody's real and they interview them after  and they have cameras and stuff.  So they're pretending, yeah, oh yeah, we're filming it.  It's for a documentary we're doing on jury.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But they have to go through hours of like real,  boring court stuff to prove that it looks real.  That's a question, I don't know.  The judge is always adjourning.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The judge is adjourning all the time.  That's enough.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I read once where they don't show that to you.  Of course not.  They'll do four hours of evidence.  Well, the case is terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The case is terrible.  It's a civil suit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This woman is claiming that this employee ruined her business  and her reputation because he got drunk  and urinated on all the products.  And the plaintiff has this really beautifully created  3D animation of what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the defense attorney got his nephew to make something.  Anyway, I'll leave it to you to watch.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's funnier if you compress it like that.  Anyway.  Have you watched The Diplomat?  I started and I thought this is so good.  I'm saving it for Lisa.  It's very good.  It looks good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Episodes six and seven, when they're off in a meeting,  it's at a place called Ditchley where I've been twice.  Ditchley in England, yeah.  Ditchley. Ditchley.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ditchley.  They, I thought this is like fake Aaron Sorkin.  Turns out the show runner is a guy  who used to write for the West Wing.  So there is a connection.  Yeah, it's kind of feels like that West Wing thing.  It does.  Finally, Pixel phones are gaining a new ringtone  inspired by Kenny G.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Shall I play it for you?  You go to sleep instead of answering the phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I wonder if it's on my phone.  Here, I'll play a little bit of it.  Will they take us down for this?  They will.  Screw them.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  This music.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  ["Pixel Phone"]

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I swear, you always know when it's Kenny G on the horn.  Yeah, it really has a sound, doesn't it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  ["Pixel Phone"]  Get ready for the name of this.  This is the Kenny Jing tone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.  Oh my gosh.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  And that is the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's the Google change log.  Oh my gosh, that's horrible.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  God.  Our show this week brought to you by our wonderful,  wonderful studio sponsors, ACI Learning.  Really, the reason ACI Learning wanted to sponsor this studio,  we're here in the ACI Learning studios,  is because they wanted you to know the name,  because ACI Learning, IT Pro is now part of ACI Learning.  We know you know IT Pro.  Since they started 10 years ago,  they've been a part of our family.  We've been talking about all their great training.  Well now, IT Pro is that much better.  By merging with ACI Learning,  they are now able to give you all kinds  of valuable training in IT, in cybersecurity, in audit.  They've got expanded practice labs.  They're now up to 7,000 hours of content.  All of this because the ACI Learning is empowered them  to do so much more.  In fact, thanks to ACI Learning,  the days of boring, archaic training methods  are finally over.  Lack of meaningful impact shows up as low engagement.  We were just talking about that.  That's suboptimal performance.  The industry training industry's completion rate  on their videos averages around 30%.  That's because people get bored, they drift off.  That's just not good.  ACI Learning is 80% completion rate.  I think the same thing.  It's entertaining, it's fun, and you are learning.  You are learning.  And what this means is your team is gonna love  the training they get from IT Pro and ACI Learning.  In today's IT talent shortage,  whether you operate as your own department  or you're part of a larger team,  your skills have to be up to date.  That's table stakes, right?  94% of CIOs and CISOs agree,  attracting and retaining talent  is increasingly critical to their roles.  These jobs are not getting filled.  There's a dearth of people with the skills they need.  This is why it's such a good time  for you to go to ACI Learning.  Whether you've got a team that needs to get up skilled,  that needs to learn more,  that needs to thrive and invest  in the security of your business,  or you're an individual who wants to get into IT,  you can keep your skills up to date  or get those certs with 7,000 hours of content.  New episodes are added daily.  They've got seven studios running Monday through Friday,  all day.  That's partly too because this stuff never sits still.  There's always new tests, new questions, new certs,  new versions of software you've got to keep up to date.  You do and they do.  And for training for your enterprise,  there is no better way to keep your team compliant  ahead of the pack.  You could choose an existing course  and let ACI Learning combine modules  for a tailored solution  or let them custom design a course  to address your specific needs.  Yes, they do that.  In fact, ACI Learning's private boot camp  will train your team alongside the most passionate,  the best subject matter expert certified  in the latest version of each individual cert.

It's time for Stacey's thing.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Okay, my thing this week is not a thing.  It's a dump your thing, burn your thing,  get rid of your thing, recycle it.  This thing is the Wemo Smart Plugs.  This week the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just bought those TNT peeling smart plugs  and I haven't even opened the box.  Those are different.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  These are different.  These are made by Belk and Wemo.  Yeah.  Okay, calm down.  Yeah.  Calm down.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You mean the ones that the serious vulnerability  was recently uncovered in?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yes, that was the one.  So here's the issue.  One, it's actually not that there was a serious vulnerability  although it is very serious.  It could be remotely executed.  It also allows the device to execute code  which means like someone who's not in your house  or has physical access to the device  could theoretically use this buffer flow vulnerability  to get access to your device, install code  that could then get access on the rest of your network.  So it's not great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But there's a but here, right?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Hold on.  It's not great.  So this is terrible.  And the researchers was like, this is terrible.  We should tell Belk and Wemo.  So they did.  And Belk and Wemo said, eh, they're not gonna fix it  because this device.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, so you're literally saying burn these.  Not buy them.  Don't buy them.  Burn them.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  No, I said burn, recycle, get rid of.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.  Nice pick.  How about those TP-Link ones?  Those are okay, yes?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Those are fine.  Well, here's the next part of this, right?  Belk decided not to do this  because the device was sold starting in 2019.  They're like, ah, it's close to the end of life.  We're not gonna update it.  This is actually the second  or possibly the third time Belk and Wemo has decided  when faced with a security vulnerability  to be like, eh, that device is old.  But they're still selling them, aren't they?  Yes.  To me, that says they do not care about you.  Do not buy.  I mean, this is exactly why I tell people.  Do not buy anything from Wemo, I think, right?  Right.  Belk and Wemo.  Don't buy.  They got purchased by Fox kind of a while back.  So now you know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yes, the TP-Links are fine.  And TP-Link, when faced with vulnerabilities,  has historically updated.  They patch them.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's funny, we were talking on security now  about a router vulnerability  and how most routers don't auto-update their firmware.  And I actually quote you all the time, Stacey.  You've always said,  do not buy any IoT device  that doesn't have auto-update capability.  And somebody wrote to us and said,  hey, good news, I have a TP-Link.  It auto-updated.  It fixed it.  It patched the vulnerability.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  I think TP-Link is a good company.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah.  A lot of the new ones do, but yeah.  So.  Yikes.  So yeah, Wemo.  Okay.  Don't ever buy their stuff, period.  If I've ever shown you them,  just say, Stacey, you were wrong.  I may have a culpa.  You didn't know.  I'm just knocking you down.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's not your fault.  You didn't know, but they are still selling them,  which is a little bit disappointing.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, when people show you who they are, believe it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's not Belk and anymore.  It's now Foxconn or?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, let's see.  Someone bought them.  I think it was Belk and Wemo purchased.  Foxconn purchased Belk and International  that controls Linksys, Wemo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, oh, oh.  Foxconn bought Belk and.  Oh.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, that was.  Oh, but that was forever ago.  Dang.  Belk and was always up and down because they would take,  they would basically relabel no name Chinese gear  as Belkin gear.  So some of it was very good.  Some of it was not so good.  I guess now we know they don't really care.  Nah.  Profit.  Thank you, Stacy.  Wow.  Jeff Jarvis, a number?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Next.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A few things.  I like rebranding the Wiener Mobile.  All right, I'll do that.  You can do that first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I vote for that.  I'm not getting off that easy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  After 87 years, the Oscar-Meyer Wiener Mobile  is now the Frank Mobile.  No.  That's terrible.  Of teenage jokes, is that what it is?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you know what?  Nobody calls them Wieners anymore.  I think that's probably the thing.  Is that what it is?  Oh, okay.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, I know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No one calls them Franks either.  No.  What do you call them?  Hot dogs.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Hot dogs.  Hot dog.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  It's a hot dog mobile.  You know, my family.  What do you call them?  It was never Wieners.  It was never Franks.  It was Wieners.  Wieners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wieners.  Well, I think the Wieners mobile  really is not gonna be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's not gonna work.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  So it was always strange for me to hear Wieners and Franks.  Wieners.  Beans and Wieners.  Beanie Wieners.  We used to have Beanie Wieners.  I like Beanie Wieners.  We didn't even say Beanie Wieners.  When I saw Beanie Wieners in the store,  it, that blew my mind.  You thought it was a family name.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I did too.  I mean, he's, when I was growing up, I loved it.  Baked beans and little, this is a hot dog.  Yeah.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  That's Franken beans.  Yeah.  See, that's just weird.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  But now it's Franks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's just weird.  Why are you eating Franks?  All right, so there's one, the Oscar, I like that one.  What else you got?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The other one is, so in 2016, I went to Google Newsgeist  and a friend of mine named Jochen Wegner,  who's the editor of a site online in Germany,  saw all us American journalists after the election.  Stop yawning, Leo, I can see it on the other side.  I'm breaking the fourth wall, the fifth lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been busted twice today now.  For off camera shenanigans.  This is the problem with Zoom.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We can see, you can see me now.  Your audience can't, but now they know.  Anyway, so Jochen said he watched all the journalists  in America going nuts after our election in 2016.  And he said, this can't happen in Germany.  I gotta do something.  And he created something called Deutschland spricht,  in which people answered questions at the end of stories  about their views.  And then they asked them,  do you wanna meet with somebody near you  who disagrees with you in person?  Oh God, that's my worst nightmare.  Is that, well, you're gonna have your chance in a second.  So I had the chance, one of them was matched with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's bad enough I gotta talk to Stacey every week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, Stacey and I have to talk most of the time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So now, and they now made it into,  I think it's Your World Speaks.  Is that what the world talks?  Your Country Speaks.  And people can do it in countries, individual countries.  Now they're doing it across the world  on a given date coming up in June.  If you go to the worldtalks.org and you answer,  if you scroll down,  you can just answer a few questions, very few.  Sign up, just hit sign up.  No.  Well, you're not gonna, don't worry.  Don't worry, you're not really signing up.  It's Germany, they believe in privacy.  Did you get here from a friend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.  Oh no, don't scroll.  Is the world a better place in the past?  The world better or worse place?  Answer the question honestly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  20 years ago, yeah, it is.  Okay, now you're gonna go to the-

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Is this gonna be like chat roulette  after I answer the questions?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Does hard work always lead to a better life?  No.  You're gonna answer these few questions.  Should climate protection be a priority  even if it means sacrifices?  Yeah.  Should all countries sanction Russia  for the war on Ukraine?  Yeah.  Should every company accept refugees?  Yeah.  Should state and religion be separated?  Yeah.  Should people of every gender have rights,  equal rights, yeah.  Well, who would say no to any of this?  Are older generations living,  oh yeah, at the expense of younger people, no.  Hell no.  Sir.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So then, if you-  You disagree, yeah.  Tell them more about yourself.  Yeah, what do you do for a living?  You'll be matched with someone around the world  to have a one-on-one conversation.  I am an agitator.  Just what Stacey likes all the time  is saying let's have a conversation.  Well, this is your chance, Stacey.  What are you doing in your free time?  Tweet.  Have a conversation with somebody

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  what makes you happy?  Tweeting.  What worries you?  Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tweeting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay, and then now they're gonna pair me up  with somebody who disagrees with what I just said.  Yes, yes.  Well, I got an ant right here.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I don't have to go around the world for that.  I put in here, what do you do for a living?  I put meathead.  What are you doing in your free time?  I put whiskey.  What makes you happy?  I put more whiskey.  What worries you?  I put no whiskey.  I see.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was gonna say too much whiskey.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No whiskey.  All right, that's cool.  That is at theworldtalks.org.  The world talks.  The website in Deutschland.  So how did the original German version do?  Did it do well?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So it did very well.  My favorite part of the story was that one woman  was linked by or matched by the algorithm  with her father-in-law.  Oh.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they had.  That would be my worst nightmare  if I had to be matched by my father-in-law.  Exactly.  I think they had a thousand people

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  who got together one-on-one in person  and there were no fist fights.  Nobody, you know, in America it might be dangerous,  but in Germany it wasn't.  And then they've done it in other countries since  and it's really kind of a neat experiment  that says, you know, you can meet people and.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's one of those ideas that sounds good in principle.  I know, but it's kind of worked.  I'm glad there are people who will actually do that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Just not. Exactly.  Yeah, I was debating whether to do it myself  I don't know what I can talk about.  Cause I'm going to get, no, you see,  you know what it's like to disagree.  I just get upset.  I just get upset.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's just upsetting to talk to people who don't agree  with my 100% correct points of view.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And the numbers you always present,  which are always fact checking correct.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did we disagree over whether old people  are living off of young people?  Yes, we did.  You think that I am abusing your youth.  Wait a minute, you're old.  I'm not old, I'm oldish.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, we're so close to the end, y'all.  There's a difference.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, me and Stacy.  I love having a host.  Stacy's getting over by the minute.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right, Ant, it's time for your thing.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  My thing, a quick shout out to viewbug.com.  Remember I was a judge for a photo contest with Viewbug.  It was their early morning photo contest.  It was 17,000 entries.  Thank you to everybody who participated.  They whittled it down for me to pick.  And I picked the list of photos.  Why can't you get in?  It should let you in.  You have to have an account.  No, you don't.  It was, oh, shucks.  I have to fix that link.  Does it mean I have to participate?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't wanna, anyway, I'll sign in here.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  There should be a public link there,  but viewbug.com, early morning contest.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, this is if I wanted to upload some photos, I guess.  Right.  Yeah, I wanna see the,  I wanna see the Explore Photo Contests.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Should be completed.  I have to fix the link for our show notes, I guess.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, no, the link was fine.  I clicked a button.  It was my fault.  Nice work.  Yeah.  Let me do that again,  because if the link that we'll put in the show notes  or tweak says this is it, right?  Yep, that's it.  See, I pressed view winner.  That was my mistake.  No, don't do that.  Don't press that.  Oh my God, that's gorgeous.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  That's a very, very, very nice.  Oh, wow.  I got a question to ask.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is that a real, how do you know that's a real photo?

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I pixel peeped.  That was real.  These are real. That's gorgeous.  One of them is actually an iPhone shot.  Wow.  That's the second run, the first run of it  and the second run.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  By the way, I said that  because the first photo is so amazing.  You think a computer made it up.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I was like,  I didn't know there was a place that looked like that.  And then I'm like,  man, where did these people find the horses?

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Well, they were camping in that first shot.  Really?  And they're like, yeah, we're opening our tent.  This is what we open our tent to.  That's why you camp.  Yeah, it's beautiful stuff.  This is also gorgeous.  Yeah.  Now the last one there.  I'm glad you chose this  because it's not a landscape and I kind of like that.  I made this one a part of the list,  but I couldn't make it a winner  because the file name says night train.  It's supposed to be a morning contest.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, well, if you ride the train all night,  the sun will come up.  The sun will rise up.  Yeah.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Isn't that what's happening here?  Yeah, maybe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a night train.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I mean, that's what I assume.  That's another beautiful one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's the people's choice.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  So what is Viewbug?  It's just another photo community.  Think of Flickr.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Is that the Malmo Bridge?  The one between Copenhagen and Malmo?  It looks like it, doesn't it?  Is that in Sweden?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like it.  That's pretty.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it is so pretty.  Oh, that'd scare me.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  That'd scare me bad.  My pick of the week next week is gonna be for you,  Mr. Jarvis.  I'm looking forward to it.  I've already picked it out.  Oh, and my other pick,  I wanna say don't leave home without it.  And it is as simple as this little $20.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is from a guy who spends a lot of time on the sideline.  Ha ha ha.  This is what you take to every football game,  baseball game, soccer game, lacrosse game.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Or just because you feel like sitting outside.  You know?  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's got a cup holder.  I had lunch today.  I've seen so many of these at the game.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Our Twitch sponsored lunch today.  I had it outside.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you actually took your hamburger and went outside?  It was a nice idea.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  And it's because I always have my chair with me.  Part of that comes from juice.  You keep that with you at all times?  Yeah, I keep an orange shirt in my trunk.  You keep it in your pants?  In my...  Ha ha ha.  My shirt, no comment.  I thought those thighs were large,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but I didn't realize you had a chair in there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, you know what?  These are like classics.  This is so good.  This is a classic.  You can't beat them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  We keep two of these in our car.  That's a good idea.  During the summer season for impromptu,  basically like,  oh, look, it's a festival or oh, look,  there's something going on going on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, you got it.  You need these all the time.  Yeah.

Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  So just buy one, 20 bucks or so  and throw it in the back of your car.  It's always there when you need it.  I use it for the...  Do you keep car clothes?  The only car clothes I have is I have my...  I have an orange sweatshirt or an orange shirt  usually in the back of my car.  Just in case I go in and go on a photo walk.  Car clothes?

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, so we keep car clothes.  We have a bucket.  It's not a bucket.  It's one of those cloth bins  and it's got a pair of sweatpants, hat,  Jesus.  scarf, a sweater, and a blanket.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You go to the beach and your clothes disappear and then...

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  No, it's cause I live in Seattle  and you drive like...  Yeah, you're like, now it's hot, now it's cold.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Neil, while you were gone,  these people both admitted that they packed  screwdrivers in their suitcase.  What?  He probably does too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't have a screwdriver in my suitcase.  Screwdrivers in their suitcases.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  All right, I want a tour of Stacey's trunk.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Screwdrivers.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  I can see how you want it in your trunk.  That makes sense.  The only other thing we have is the picnic blanket.  I mean, we have the chargers.  Actually, I do carry a multi-tool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I carry a multi-tool.  Yeah, we have a multi-tool.  In your suitcase.  Yeah.  You never know.  You never know.  Lately, before we left on this last trip,  I bought, Andy and Ako recommended these three LED lights.  They're like postage stamp size.  And I just bought them and I kind of scattered them around.  In case there's a fire, the lights go out, you got a light.  That's true.  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.

Speaker: Stacy Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh yeah, we do also keep two headlamps in our car.  Yeah, headlamps.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
