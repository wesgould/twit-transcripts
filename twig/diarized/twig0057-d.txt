Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello, Earthlings.  Via Trepani, Cecilia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good to have you, Gina.  Jeff Jarvis has the week off.  We've got a great substitute in the studio in Google, in fact.  He's inside the Googleplex.  Looking around for the black helicopters, Mr. Chris DeBona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, my name's Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Open source program manager.  He does have the goatee, so I think we're okay.  For Google, it's nice to have you, Chris.  Chris was the host for a long time of Floss Weekly.  And I've known Chris for years pre-Google.  He did open source and Linux stuff for us on the screensavers many years ago.  Yeah, it's a long time ago.  How long have you been at Google now, though?  It's a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been at Google for six years now.  When do you stop being a noogler?  You technically stop being a noogler when your noogler balloon deflates.  It's one of those mylar balloons that takes a while.  That's a good way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've got to start doing that, Lisa.  Can we give mylar balloons to what we call tubies?  Twiddlers?  Twiddlers.  And then as your balloon sags, then you suddenly gain in status as your balloon goes down.  So it's great to have you both.  Just to talk about, Google had an announcement today.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  Adding voice to Gmail.  That could be potentially huge.  That's very exciting.  Is there anything exciting going on in your neck of the woods, open source and public  sector manager, Mr. Kiboman?  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I took on this new group in DC doing sort of government-y focused things.  And it's all very exciting, like our polling locations API.  Yes.  And so if you're finding voting locations, we put in your address.  You find out where you can vote and stuff.  And then we also handle what's called Google Moderator, which was used by the president  for open for questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I keep saying I got to do more of that.  I think that moderator has a huge potential for us.  Yeah, it could be really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, because I can barely keep up with the chat.  I mean, it's like screaming by.  So I already apologize for not being able to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's all a tools issue.  We're going to talk about tools in just a second.  You know, we're doing, and I'd love you to come.  Jim O'Reilly has been big on government 2.0, you know, transparency, using tools to make  government more effective.  He's written books on it.  And we are actually doing a special Friday on this at 5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern  at live.twit.tv.  If you'd like to tune in some of this Friday.  And if you'd like to come by, we have a lot of guests.  It's going to be very interesting.  But I'd love to have you come on and talk about what you guys are doing.  Gina is also working with government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, actually, Chris has to do with Google Summer of Code, which is Google's program  that gets university students involved in open source projects, which expert labs, which  is where I work.  Well, that's great.  You're an expert now.  Yeah, it's for, you know, we're a mentoring organization.  So we had two students over the summer working on the project, which is Think Up, used to  be Think Tank.  It is now called Think Up, which is an open source project.  Good name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like the new name.  That's great.  Yeah, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.  Fiber to Firefox kind of moment.  Was that a user suggested name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think Up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a name that was suggested actually by, that was, you know, ideas were gathered by  the app.  We sent it on Twitter and the app picked it up and he's like, yeah, think up that that  works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's cool.  Well, we were glad to have you both today.  I guess there's we'll get to the Google Voice on Gmail in just a second.  But before we do that, I suppose I should mention the buzz thing.  My buzz kill post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that got a lot of traction here inside the company, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, God, it makes me feel really bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let me give you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me tell you what happened.  And then we could talk about my epiphany and Gina wants to talk me down.  So and I saved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, we were so late.  She's the angel on your shoulder and I'm the devil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should get right in the middle because you really look quite a kind of like the angel.  I need a halo and Chris needs horns.  You're both on my left shoulder, but I think we'll figure it out.  The genesis of this was August 6th.  I was on the road.  We were taking Abby to college.  And but, you know, I love buzz.  You know, I'm a buzz fan.  I'm a huge fan.  In fact, from day one, even in the face of the privacy issues that came up and and kind  of the lack of uptake, I've really I've wanted buzz to succeed because I miss threaded conversations  on Twitter.  I think buzz could be so much better.  So what happened was August 6th, I was on the road and I when I'm on the road, I always  use the buzz widget on my Android phone to post pictures and little, you know, little  just little things.  And I'm posting along and get to August 22nd, which was a couple of days ago.  And I'm seeing all this stuff when I go to my name, but I'm not seeing it in the public  timeline.  I think that's kind of odd.  And what the biggest thing that should have been a real red flag was I wasn't getting  much or any engagement a little bit.  That's why it was hard to detect.  There were one or two comments, but there wasn't very there were no likes and there  were very few comments.  And usually my stuff gets more than that.  So I started investigating and I realized we have a buzz can tweet, which has been very  reliable is not porting stuff over to Twitter.  So none of that got into Twitter, including show announcements from all of last week,  because I usually start a show by announcing it on buzz, which then ports to Twitter through  buzz can tweet.  So I was suddenly realized, well, there's something wrong here.  And after as I looked into it, I realized not only is there something wrong, but I can't  ask for help because nobody's seeing my buzzes.  So I managed to get the attention of Clinton, DeWitt Clinton and and later, Attawale out  of London.  And three days later, they said, yeah, you found a bug.  They said it's a it's a very rare bug that would only affect somebody with a lot of followers.  But the bug was that when somebody deleted their Google account, anyone anyone who's  following me deleted their Google account, suddenly I would stop being visible.  It's like they deleted me.  It's a weird bug.  I don't even it must have been difficult to track down.  And we did a lot of tests, postings and stuff.  And I apologize.  But they did finally figure it out.  And a couple of days ago, all of my buzzes went on Twitter, causing a little annoyance,  I must say, from my followers on Twitter.  And it seems to be all OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So no one deletes their user, their Google account.  And no one has as many followers as you, Leo.  These are the two things that I take from this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. You know, they said it was a longstanding bug.  It's the kind of thing, you know, that gets creeped into code and you wouldn't see because  it's a weird confluence of situations that happen.  Anyway, that's not important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That got fixed. So the part about your post that I thought was really interesting was  sort of the part that dwells on the ephemeral nature of a lot of these things and how and  how you felt like you were in the end, narcissistically speaking into the wind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I think I called myself a chatterbox onan spewing spewing my my little words into  the wind.  By the way, I wrote that one in the morning in a kind of a tizzy.  But but I was it was kind of an epiphany for me because I said not only did no one say  anything, but I didn't even notice.  So it was three weeks, almost three weeks of content that I was spewing that nobody  saw and nobody noticed.  Now, admittedly, that's a little narcissistic to assume that people are going to say, oh,  where's your where's your wonderful stuff?  So that's not kind of what I was saying.  I just felt like, you know, I really get the feeling that Twitter and and to a lesser degree,  but somewhat buzz and and even Facebook are just everybody talking at once and nobody  listening.  So what I said is, well, maybe I've misused these tools.  Maybe what I should be doing is posting stuff that I want that I want to be more than ephemera,  which can even be trivia like pictures from my trip that I take with my phone, my camera  phone on my blog first, then have them publish upstream to the comments.  Because what I think you need, I think you need two things.  You need the perm and we've talked about this, you know, with Jeff many times before you  need the permanence of something you own that you so you control the content.  It's yours.  It's in a place where you know where it is.  But you also don't want to force people to come to you to consume it or more importantly,  to engage with it.  So you also want to participate in the commons.  So you want something that goes in both places.  And actually Buzz turns out to be a perfect platform for that.  But in order to do that, you have to do the one thing that everybody condemned me for.  They said, but Leo, that's because you were just using a buzz as a megaphone.  You were just broadcasting.  And in fact, the lesson I learned is, yeah, you should just broadcast.  That's the right way to use it.  No, but I mean, I would engage with other people's posts or maybe even with my own posts.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I feel like social media is about conversations, right?  It's about conversations with your friends.  Like you could say the conversations were, you know, they're ephemeral.  They go away.  But I think it has to be there's a happy medium.  I think there's like broadcasting stuff that you've done.  Hey, here's this thing that I've done and it's in my database here and you have to come  here to look at it.  And also like, hey, how was your day?  What do you think about this?  Like I use Twitter, primarily Twitter, but other places to just kind of like post kind  of seeds of ideas and see what kind of reaction or response I get back and then grow that  into a larger piece of content that might go onto my blog.  But I do very much feel the same way that we've talked about this about, you know,  putting content into a place that you own, a data store that you own.  That's why I like hosting my own blog.  And that's why I built ThinkUp because I like the idea that all, you know, the idea that  I can't find all of my tweets via the API on Twitter freaks me out.  You know, it's been, you know, this place where I've been pumping content for a long  time and I want to have that database on my side.  So I built ThinkUp to kind of archive my tweets and Flickr photos and buzzes and all kind  of inputs into these different networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't you think Twitter's really rotten for conversation though?  I mean, it really wasn't designed for conversation.  It was designed to be a megaphone.  Let's face it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you're right.  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  And buzz is definitely.  That's why I like buzz.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I mean, so buzz is actually quite good at the conversations, but people  I think love Twitter for the megaphone aspect.  They get to say what they think.  Darn it.  And the whole world is listening or not.  Or not.  But they're saying it.  You know, and I mean, honestly, I'm not going to lie to you.  That's why I actually really liked Twitter when it came out and why I use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's a second reason is it's very easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's very easy.  It's easy to get.  It's easy to use.  Buzz is a little more and anything that has Jaiku, which I prefer over Twitter as well,  which I think is kind of was kind of the acorn that the oak tree of buzz came out of.  Really, I liked it because it was threaded conversations.  There was much more engagement and the engagement was tied to the original post.  But people don't like these systems.  Buzz, let's face it, Chris, buzz has not received much uptake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's a lot smaller than Twitter.  I honestly don't know the numbers.  I'd imagine it's smaller than Twitter, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I could tell you it's small.  It's obvious.  You know, if I post a link on buzz and a post a link on Twitter, 90% of the engagement comes  from Twitter.  Of course, I have 222,000 followers on Twitter and only 18,000 on.  Well, but I think that's all.  Maybe the order of magnitude for everybody and Lady Gaga.  Does Lady Gaga have a buzz account?  I don't know.  I think Miley Cyrus does.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And uses it.  Oh, I like swore off social media and said it was like a waste of life.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She snuck back on buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She did.  She snuck back.  Yeah, the problem is, but into the public eye, that's what she's doing.  The issue with buzz for me, and I had the same kind of experience with Google reader  is like, I just like, oh, God, it's like another inbox that I have to go through.  Twitter just feels very free and short and brief.  And it gives me that sense of sort of like ambient intimacy with folks who I don't talk  to every day.  I follow Chris on Twitter.  So and I feel like I have some sense of what's going on with them, even though we don't talk.  But without requiring me to mark items as read or like or comment or click on links,  it's just 140 characters and that's it.  And if there's a link, tweets that have links in them kind of bug me after a while.  I'm like, I don't want to have to launch this and do another browser.  I just want to know a little tidbit about your life.  It's one more tab of oppression.  I think it's just it's an inbox issue for me.  You know, just having all those on read items.  I don't need any more on read items.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't feel any responsibility to hit next page on that front page of people I follow.  I admit it. I do.  I do look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cedemona, you know, I like to read right all the way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's impossible. How many people are you following on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  About 1500 on buzz, about 120.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't follow 1500 people, you know.  I mean, you'll see the first couple of pages and they'll say older tweets are not available.  And, you know, you only go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can go a few pages back, though.  I mean, actually, with 1500 people, you can go more pages back because you have more content to follow.  I guess. It does seem like this is this is, I guess, the bottom line for me.  We all are putting a lot of energy into these social media networks,  and I wonder how much listening there is versus how much talking.  And it strikes struck me there was and I, by the way,  if you read between the lines, I'm blaming myself as much as I'm not.  This is not an accusatory of either the tools or the people who use them. It's myself.  There's a lot more talking than listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I hate to say, Leo, people tune into you because they want to hear what you have to say.  You know, less so for Gina and even less so for me, right?  I mean, your use of these tools is going to have more of a, you know, an outward effect than...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, how do you? Okay, so tell me what it looks like from...  Because you're very popular.  What does it look like from your end?  As you use them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it looks any different, and that's very deceptive, right?  So I follow about 300 people, and so I can kind of keep up with them when I have a few minutes to serve Twitter, right?  And I get I don't get as many direct messages as you do. I don't get as many ads as you do.  So that's where where the analogy falls apart.  But, you know, I use it because I want to I want to drive people to one website or another or something or another.  Or I just want to like, yammer, right?  And I'm yammering into the wind and I'm hoping people like me or whatever.  And, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is a little bit like... well, we said this before, Gina. It's high school, isn't it?  It's really a little high school.  Yeah, except for ice, it's a lot of high school.  But we all just it's all our little cliques.  And we just want people to like us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a competition for the cleverest quips. I mean, let's let's be honest.  Well, that seems awfully narcissistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is. As a writer, it's a really good way to get your lead down, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true. Your lead is everything. 140 characters. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, it's a really good way to get your lead down and to tweak it when people say, hey, that's, you know, what about this?  Or that's not right. Or you didn't get this right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I think that the irony is while people always are paying lip service to engagement and participation, it is a megaphone.  Ultimately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. And that's OK. There's nothing wrong with that.  OK. So to me, this is really bad about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really devolves down to what this mostly always does devolve down to is tool talk.  It's about the tools and using the tools appropriately, understanding what the parameters of the tools are, maybe not having false expectations that Twitter, for instance, is a conversational medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, someone in the chat room said Twitter's a cocktail party.  And it's actually a pretty good analogy.  It's a cocktail party where everybody's talking and nobody's listening.  And everyone's like three drinks into it.  And, you know, you hear your name out of the corner of your ear and you go, oh, they're talking about me over there.  I'm going to go talk to those people.  Or, you know, it's a cocktail party.  It's a good analogy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, I never liked cocktail parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's that drunk in the corner just saying crazy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's Randall Schwartz. Just ignore him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I think I think, though, I mean, Leo, do you engage with with folks on Twitter?  Do you respond to people on Twitter?  Do you at reply folks?  I do.  And you do.  And you do it on buzz as well.  But you but but you you do engage.  I mean, there are you can have conversations go back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's a great here's a great quote from Kara Fisher.  Hermes in our chat room says Kara Swisher says Twitter is like a library with all the books on the floor.  I guess that's my frustration.  So I'm going to actually in my tools in my tool segment at the end of the show, I am going to talk about a at least a preliminary set of tools that I want to use.  That will let me use the blog as the primary publishing point.  And I and Kevin Marks said this in a comment to me after after while all this was happening.  By the way, I just want to point out that blog post got well over 2000 comments on my blog via Twitter buzz Facebook, all the other social media being piped in using something called JS Kit Echo, which is going to be one of the things I'm talking about.  If you have the right tools and Pub Sub Hubbub and Salmon and all of these APIs that are being developed, in fact, it might be possible to have the best of both worlds, a permanent record and an engaged commons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, I'll talk about what I use.  So the only thing I would say is if the tool you're going to talk about is wave, I've got some bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't make Gina cry again.  It's not nice.  You are so mean, Chris DeBona.  Moving on.  Item two.  Big announcement this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Item two.  Turning the page.  What does that guy say?  Page two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's passed away, by the way.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Page two.  Hello, Americans.  Item two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it turns into a commercial.  It's always a page two is always a commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Google rolling out only in the U.S.  I'm sorry.  I should always say this because we have a huge international audience.  30% of the show is outside the U.S., which means a third of you won't be able to use this.  It is U.S. only because it's Google.  I guess it's Google Voice base.  Free VoIP calls to and from Gmail.  How does that work, Gina?  Have you been able to use it yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't been able to use it yet.  It's not in my account yet.  It's rolling out in the next few days.  But from what I understand, it uses Google's chat or Gmail's chat feature.  So you can do voice calls.  So you have to install the plugin for Google Voice chat and video chat.  And you have your headset on.  You're sitting at your computer and you can dial a phone from your computer.  It's basically Skype out.  But for free inside the U.S.  And you can call phones?  You can call landline phones.  Yes, cell phones, regular phones.  Free?  Free to U.S. Canada until the end of the year and cheap internationally.  So I'm not sure what's going to happen until they said, until at least the end of the year.  So I'm not sure what happens after that.  But for now, free, yes.  Wow.  And it's connected to your Google Voice account.  So if you have a Google Voice number, that's the number that will show up in the caller  ID to other calls.  And you can actually receive calls through Gmail to your Google Voice number.  So right now with Google Voice, you can set it to ring your different phones.  You can now set it when this is enabled, you have it in your account.  You can now set it to ring Gmail chat.  So if you're at your computer, you can receive a call as well as make one.  So this is the little video that Google prepared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  1876, telephone, 2008, Gmail.  There was a caveman segment a little earlier that we missed.  Chris, is there a whole department at Google doing this?  You know, I think there must be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're doing more and more great, I'm not complaining, great videos around this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in some ways, the comic book was like the forerunner for a lot of the people who  do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we could do anything.  We could do this crazy comic.  Yeah, love that Chrome comic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, that's a collector's item now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saved mine.  Do you have the Japanese one?  No.  So our Japanese office did a second one, a follow on, and they translated the first one  into Japanese.  Oh, that's so neat.  It's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So jealous.  So this is now it's interesting because, Gina, you mentioned a couple of weeks ago that you  no longer had to do that third party system where you call, you enter a number and then  Google Voice calls you.  It makes sense now in light of this.  So this is a direct call, right?  You just press a button and it makes the call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a direct call.  It's the way the Google Voice app works on your phone.  You just dial a number and it calls, which is the, you know, you enter your number and  then it calls you back.  You enter your number in the web interface, then it calls you back.  That whole thing was, you know, you'd have to do that like on the iPhone, for example,  because the Google Voice app isn't there.  So yeah, this is just calling a number straight from your computer.  And it's really, it's interesting.  I have a few thoughts on this.  I mean, the first obvious one is like, wow, this is going to, you know, this is a big  competition for Skype and Skype out.  The second one is like, I didn't have the plugin installed for Gmail, Voice and Video  Chat.  I just, I didn't use it.  Honestly, I went to Skype.  If I needed to do Video Chat, I went to Skype.  But this made me say, okay, I'm going to install this because this is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's who this is bad for, Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is bad for Skype.  Can you imagine doing Twig on Gmail?  You want to try it next week?  Should we try it next week?  It could be interesting.  Yeah, we should try it.  I haven't, you know, I haven't done too much video chatting with Gmail, but it's going  to give people a reason to install that plugin and really dive into chat for people who did  dive into chat.  Okay, Chris, so why does Google do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which part, the plugin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, what's, look, here's my understanding.  Here's our understanding, I think, of Google.  Google's always said it, the more you use the internet, the happier we are, the more  money we make.  Yes, yes.  And I understand that more web pages means more ads.  Are they going to put ads in this?  Where is the upside to Google on doing phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think it's one of those things that I think it's part of making a whole experience  out of Gmail and Gmail's contact manager and Google Voice and sort of bringing the whole  thing together like the rug in Lebowski, right?  It's like, it really brought the room together, man.  I think it's one of those services that kind of pays for itself with the, you know, because  we give you the $10 credit in Google Voice or whatever when you get started, but you  end up using it on international calls, I guess.  And honestly, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, you were about to make another point and I cut into you, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing that worries me is I love Gmail, right?  As far as I'm concerned, like beyond search, Gmail is Google's best product.  It worries me a little bit that they keep, you know, Google keeps rolling things into  Gmail like, you know, tasks and chat and video and voice and buzz and, you know, your contacts.  I mean, in a way, it's like there's a really good argument and the strategy is clear.  It's like you have all these different features and products and acquisitions and you want  to sew them together to make that complete experience.  At the same time, sometimes I get a little worried like, wow, Gmail has a lot of different  settings and capabilities and it's just becoming this, you know, it seems like if Google wants  to launch a new product, you know, they do it in Gmail because you have what, 160 million  users instantly.  I mean, this makes a lot of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're starting to bog it down.  You're hanging a lot of bags off the side of this Gmail engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Gmail isn't Gmail anymore.  It's like G communicates.  Amazing.  Yeah, many methods.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's funny, actually, I'm with Gina.  I get kind of worried whenever we try to do that whole sort of, you know, let's throw  this thing in a Gmail and then see if it works out.  It's like, well, you know, that's because you could say, well, if we'd done that with  Wave, would that have helped Wave out?  Well, you know, probably.  Would it have slowed down Gmail?  Well, you know, I think every time you add something to Gmail, you slow it down.  You don't want to put Wave in Gmail.  That would have been a mistake in hindsight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now this is a conversation that we had a couple of weeks ago.  You weren't here, Chris, so this is a good time for you to kind of respond to this.  One of the things that seemed to us that going forward, you don't need more programmers.  You need more social scientists.  It's no longer a programming issue.  It's more a user issue, a user interface issue.  Sure.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  So, so I don't know what a social scientist is in this.  Well, somebody who can look at how humans slow down.  We have lots of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  Human factors.  Somebody who's an expert on human factors is supposed to machine factors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're probably right.  I, you know, it's, is there any attention being paid to that at all?  Oh, no, no.  That's why I do think that there is.  I, you know, I personally, I have to admit that there are times when I just feel like  shutting everything off in Gmail that might slow it down, you know.  Well, you could use the HTML Gmail, right?  The Gmail, the basic Gmail.  Well, yeah.  You can use the pure HTML.  You can use the mobile interface.  You can force your way into that, you know, and then that's really crazy fast.  If non-optimal in a lot of ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you do that just by changing the user agent?  Is that all you have to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can do it that way.  There's, it's like a question mark.  I'm sure Gina knows this.  Oh, there's a command like a URL that you use.  Well, yeah, it's a URL that changes the UI.  Okay.  You know, much like you can change it to the HTML or shut off chat or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I do.  I've had chat shut off like for years just because I feel like, you know what, when I'm  processing my inbox and I'm dealing with email, like I just, I don't want to deal with chats  as well.  I'm just, you know, I use kind of a separate I am client for that.  Maybe I'm like purist.  I like Gmail fast.  I use a couple of grease monkey scripts that hide, you know, a couple of, you know, stuff  that I don't need.  You know, they send invites to your friends, chat spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And when the time I turned on the themes, you know, I think you'd love the themes.  You know, intellectually, I know it probably slows it down just a modicum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I get the mountain theme.  I, you know, I turned off chat because every time I showed my screen on T on the show,  somebody would say, Hey, you're hot or something like that.  You know, it pops up on there.  You have no privacy.  So I turned off the chat.  Actually it looks like it's on right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, the other, a couple of weeks ago they launched the Gmail redesign and it's got tasks.  The task link, you know, right at the top there, like above the compose mail link and  tasks at this point, you know, while it makes me happy that, you know, I felt like, Oh,  this is a little bit more of a commitment to the task product.  First of all, when you click it, it's just kind of a small little window overlay that  shows up on the bottom right hand corner.  And it's not the most mature Google product.  It's actually great.  And I like it.  It's kind of weak.  It seems strange that tasks showed up so high, you know, in the top left corner from user  interface perspective.  I was like, this is strange.  And then I just felt like, Oh God, I hope that Gmail is not going to become just the  dashboard for everything.  Google because, you know, Google just wants to put their product in there and see, because  that, you know, they know it'll get a ton of users instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What did you guys think of the new compose button up there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like that because I never could figure out how the hell to start a message.  I'm sure it's built into Gina's price.  You have a huge just use your type of key.  Yeah.  But see, it's not in my DNA because I don't use I don't use it all the time.  So the fact that you've got a nice big button right there, that's easy for me.  By the way, Nick has just sent me a note that he has the phone call.  So I'm thinking I could maybe call him.  So how would I do that from Gmail?  How do I how do I call somebody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just so you got to have a chat on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it's available to you, it'll be right underneath the chat thing.  Oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's so it's so it apparently is not because I'm looking at my chat window and I don't  see anything there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't I don't have it either.  Leo little compose tip.  If you hit shift, if you hold on the shift key and click compose it pops a little window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Little compose pop up with a shift works for almost everything to everything you think  it would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's nice.  We just you know, we just decided to move to Google Apps Premiere at Twitter.  So that's so we're going to use Gmail for all Twitter TV, corporate mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And how's that working for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't know yet.  I can't figure the damn thing out.  It's a little beyond me.  But no, we we had it all forwarding to to my IMAP server.  So now I have to I don't know what I'm going to do.  But it's nice because we we always use Google Docs here.  We always use for sharing stuff.  We use it like crazy.  And almost everybody here uses Gmail.  So but Gmail for me was always like a second address.  I've always had this older address that I use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Google Apps users are a little bit second class citizens like we don't know.  Google, I always get the new.  Yeah, but the buzz is that this new phone calling doesn't roll out to Google Apps users  yet. So you have to just be prepared to kind of have to wait a little bit to get the new  Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember, with the apps for your domain come certain service level guarantees that we have  to be ready for for the business customers.  You know, so so I mean, because a lot of people pay for that.  Right. So we're paying 50 bucks a seat a year, which is not bad.  Which is, you know, it's money.  But it's money, you know, in return.  And if we screw up our SLAs, we actually like we'll give you free days and free weeks or  whatever.  It's you know, we're pretty serious about it.  I mean, it's not that we're not serious about Gmail.  Right.  But in some ways, Gmail, we have a little bit more flexibility there if we screw up.  I wish I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting. So that's that's the main cause for the little bit of the delays for apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also some things businesses don't want, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So, you know, they probably don't want employees buzzing all the time.  Although I would imagine some businesses would use is there is there enterprise buzz?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fantastic. And then for the inside the company, it's just fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I could have I could have we could have like a private buzz.  Do you have to run a server to do that? How does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess, you know, I mean, let's turn it on for the for the enterprise customers when  when we're sure we can meet all the service level guarantees and then you can turn it  on as an admin in your admin console.  But yeah, because we've been testing internally for some time before we deployed it out into  the public. And and we're just enamored with it internally.  Although it can be a bit of a time waster, I have to admit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think I'm not a fan of I am like Gina.  I turn it off because it's it's an intrusive thing, but a buzz would be kind of a better.  It's like a static I am or like a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I think it's like it's almost like a thing where you have a message and  you're sending it electronically to many people.  Oh, like email, you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's more it's more it's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like a bulletin board system. It's like an old style.  That's right. It's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm happy and I'll let you know how it goes with the Google Docs because I mean,  the Google has well, yeah, I think it's going to go well.  You know, I think one thing that really helped is the ability to sign into multiple accounts on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google. That's hugely helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because now it's not done for all the apps yet, but it's it's getting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they get proof. But so we're all in agreement that it makes perfect sense for Google to  make phone to let you make phone calls from Gmail.  OK, I'm happy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Neil tweeted something like, great, they're going to couple the misery of a full inbox  with the whole whole voice man.  Back to having to deal with the phone ringing like phone calls and email overload.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's go team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to I have to admit that in some ways, my little tantrum was not just about social  media, but just about overload in general.  It's like everybody's talking at me.  I can't hear a word they're saying.  And, you know, it was just too much stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's time for an unsubscribe party, Leo.  I did that. And you know what I did for a while?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was unsubscribing from like a person I was following for every ex followers.  I was kidding on Twitter.  Oh, that's a good idea.  No, it was a terrible idea.  Didn't work.  No, it didn't make any sense.  And I'm like, really, is this why I'm going to subscribe to so many?  You know, I really like the one is even following three hundred and thirty people.  I can't keep up. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the 150 rule.  Paul Adams, a presentation about social networks said that basically, you know, you really  can't know more than 150 people.  I think 150 people is probably a good rule of thumb, a good guideline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And did you see you saw the comic about me?  Joy of Tech comic about did you see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was funny.  I couldn't believe it's Joy of Tech was still running.  They've been around forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, nitrogen snag your old friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've had it. This social media is just narcissistic crap.  Everything I posted for years has been an immense waste of time.  I'm quitting. And I bet no one will even noticed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who are you? I'm Clarence.  An angel. Wow.  Are you going to show me how dark and dreary the net would be without my comments and tweets?  That social media is not a shallow cesspool, the void of meaning.  And that I do make a difference.  And when I change my mind and start microblogging again, you'll get your wings.  No, I'm here to find out why you're not following me on Twitter.  I think that that said it all right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Colbert had a pretty great social media rant this week.  I linked it in the friend feed.  It was actually more about privacy than overload.  But it was it was pretty it was pretty funny.  He quoted Schmidt, actually, that quote about how people will have fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, boy, you must be so proud.  Does when Eric walks down the hall, the people go right on Eric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, so I try to keep it philosophical with Eric.  I mean, also because, you know, he's like the super boss.  But I try to think, you know what, if I if I was this high profile with him,  I mean, I think of some of the things I say, yeah, it would be like,  it's great. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's really true. You wouldn't. Yeah, exactly.  Everybody's watching your every word.  It's almost hard to there's no like that first one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was like, I don't know, like six months ago, he was talking about the Patriot Act  and he said something along the lines of if you're the kind of person  who worries about the Patriot Act, you should watch what you say  and you should watch what you do.  And everyone's like, watch what you say and watch what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's like, well, no, if you're never mind, forget, I said anything,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, and and yeah, so and it's like and then I guess the thing  recently was the he sort of I believe whimsically said  that, you know, people should be able to change their name or whatever  as they get older to sort of leave their old life behind.  I think that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think kids are seniors in high school are doing that.  Really? Oh, yeah.  My daughter told me this.  She said, yeah, what we do is we change our Facebook account to be something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, people delete their Facebook accounts.  So, you know, I don't know if you remember this, like a couple of years ago  was they would graduate from my space into Facebook.  Right. You know, for college or whatever.  And now people are like, and then they go from Facebook to nothing, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm back on Facebook and I'm going to talk about that  in just a little bit.  I'm shamed. I'm shamed.  I'm glad Jeff's not here.  Are you ashamed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't believe you're back on Facebook, Leo.  After all that, I want to hear more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a good rationalization and gird your loins, Mr.  Gabona, OK, because I want to talk.  The real reason we got you on, it's a little bit old news now,  but I would like to hear your take on it is Google Verizon.  And when we when we had that conversation, you actually  texted me or tweeted or something and said, hey, I'd like to come on.  We were in the middle of the show, so we couldn't get you on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's why you're ostensibly good that I didn't come on.  Because by the time I tweeted that, I'd actually finally gotten the story  and I finally got the information.  But I was still kind of hang on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good. We'll give you a chance to to lose your job.  Yes. Right after this word from carbonite.com.  You might want to know about this, Chris.  You could back up all your data before you lose your job, actually.  Probably a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Carbonite is a great solution.  I'm a big carbonite fan.  In fact, when we sent Abby to college, you put carbonite on the laptop  because inevitably either the laptop gets stolen,  the hard drive dies.  Probably the most likely she accidentally deletes a paper.  It happened to my wife, which she just right before her master's thesis was due.  She accidentally first time she'd ever used a computer.  This was some years ago.  Drag the file somehow got dragged to the trash can and lost forever.  She had to rewrite the whole thing.  That's not going to happen to Abby because I'm using carbonite.com Mac or PC.  You could try it right now for 15 days.  If you go to carbonite.com and use the offer code twig,  you don't need a credit card, no obligation.  You just the software goes on your computer, Mac or PC.  And whenever you're online, whenever your system is not doing anything else,  it'll be backing up encrypted using 128 SSL AES 256.  If you want to add further encryption for absolute privacy.  Now, here's the beauty part.  Actually, there's several. One, it's automatic.  You don't have to think about it.  Two, it's backing it up to the Internet.  So even if the worst happens, your backups are always safe.  Three, unlimited backup for less than 55 bucks a year.  That means every personal file on your internal drive, on your laptop  or on your desktop is safe.  You don't pay tiered prices.  It's just one flat fee.  So you don't have to worry about how much you're backing up.  And finally, you don't have to have your computer to get your data back.  You know, to me, the most important thing about a backup is  you shouldn't have to install special software  or do some special voodoo to get that backup.  And with Carbonite, you can.  There's a free iPhone app, free Blackberry app,  where you just log on to your Carbonite account from any computer.  And there's your data. There's your paper.  So if Abby loses her laptop, she's in the middle of a thesis.  She goes to the library, logs onto the account.  There's her file, complete, intact, backed up.  This is how backup ought to be.  It's a no brainer.  Carbonite.com. Try it free right now at Carbonite.com.  Offer code TWIG.  And after 15 days, you like it, you're satisfied.  And I always encourage you to try before you buy.  You get two months free if you use the offer code  or the coupon code TWIG when you sign up.  T-W-I-G. Carbonite.com.  You got to back it up to get it back.  Do it right with Carbonite.  So Chris, this was a few weeks ago, the Google,  and everybody knows I don't need to rehash this,  but Google and Verizon jointly made a proposal to,  in effect to Congress saying,  we ought to think there ought to be net neutrality for,  you know, landline for existing internet.  But when it comes to mobile,  maybe they ought to be able to do whatever they want  because it's a nascent technology.  There's lots of technical issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We articulated a hands off sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hands off means, you know, do what you want.  And a couple of days later,  there was a Google blog post that said, look,  we understand it's not ideal.  We felt it's the best we could get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I believe that that's true what they wrote.  And I don't know if in the blog post,  I'm pretty sure they did what I talked about,  the rules around the 700 megahertz band for LTE.  When we were bidding for that,  we were pretty adamant about, listen, we don't mind losing,  but if we lose, we have to lose to people  who have to confirm that they're going to support,  network neutrality rules, right?  And so I think we sort of passed on it.  We said, you know what, we can get a deal  for this proposal done for the wireline stuff,  which is very important.  I mean, and it's not like Verizon  doesn't have a horse in that race.  I mean, they own-  Oh, absolutely.  I think they own 51% of the Fios stuff  that's under the Verizon name in like Florida  and a lot of the country.  So, I mean, they have a horse,  they have skin in that game, right?  So it's sort of not,  it's not just a SOP for some wireless company.  You say, oh yeah, for our wireline stuff  that we have none of, we're cool with it.  So I think that we really, we wanted that.  And I think that we said, listen,  Verizon right now probably has the best network  in the United States for data,  if you're not like an international traveler,  it's pretty much the ideal one for you.  And if you couple that with the rules around 700 megahertz,  it's not really the end of the world  if we just have an hands-off policy and say,  let the market decide, right?  And in return, by saying that,  we were able to get this pretty nice promise  around wireline.  I think that that was a compromise  a lot of people didn't like though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now you're not speaking for Google, I take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I am and I'm not, right?  I mean, you wouldn't have me on  if I wasn't working at Google.  I mean, you might. Of course we would, Chris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know, and, but I'm actually just-  But you are working for Google and you are, you know,  you're a fairly high level manager at Google.  So I don't want to put you in a position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's shared at the couple,  Google for me, I mean, Google pays my bills.  They pay my rent, they pay my salary, you know?  I mean, I obviously-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I also know you as a strong,  I know you as a strong advocate of open source.  That's your job.  I know you as a strong advocate of net neutrality.  Yep.  You said, you know, you kind of hinted  you weren't real thrilled at first when you read about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wasn't very thrilled at first.  So, and I'm, I wish the wireless stuff  had been a bit stronger on the net neutrality side,  but I really liked the wireline stuff.  So, and you know, there's another thing about this  that a lot of people didn't notice is  we've sort of changed slightly where we said, listen,  we feel the network neutrality is about,  is not about opening the pipe to all protocols  at the same level of priority.  We said that, for instance,  suppose you have a video product like your Hulu  or your YouTube or something.  We felt that it would be unfair  for one to be prioritized over another  within the protocol space.  But at the same time, some protocols like voice,  for instance, need priority over less important protocols.  Right?  So email for instance, SMTP, it's stored forward.  It doesn't need, you know,  sub millisecond quality of service, right?  It can be a little delayed.  So, we've tried to articulate  that our net neutrality takes that into account,  our position, our neutrality takes that into account.  And I think that that was something  that got lost in the mix too.  But I'm going off on a tangent in a bit though.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about people who say there's in effect  a triple tiered internet now created?  The one landline internet that's free and open,  then the second kind of pay per view internet  where certain technologies over mobile,  you know, like Verizon's Vcast,  you pay, you have to pay for.  And then finally, this kind of third internet  where, you know, the guy, anything goes.  What, you know, if you decide I don't like Skype,  you just, you know, say, well, you can't use Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's funny,  so I've had machines and colos for some time  and it becomes very, very clear  that there's already a lot of different kinds of priority  on the internet, right?  You know, unless you're an extremely large provider  and everyone basically has to peer with you  so the traffic can flow,  there's really no such thing as neutrality of protocol,  if I'm to put a fine point on it.  So, you know, cause people are always going to prioritize,  for instance, voice traffic over, you know, BitTorrent,  you know, they're always gonna, you know,  prioritize, you know, YouTube and web traffic  over, I don't know, pick your favorite other protocols.  You know, even DNS is probably lower priority  than a lot of the voice stuff out there.  Right.  You know, so it's like, depending on which port you're using  and what protocol you're using, it can change.  And then you have things like Vcast,  which are a little unusual, right?  Because they're saying, listen,  you're basically by being on this network,  you're gonna be able to get this Vcast stuff.  And I don't even know how Vcast is sent off.  Is it a multicast?  Is it a broadcast?  It may not even be used on the internet.  Because once you start interacting with the spectrum,  right, which is much more restricted  from a bandwidth perspective, it's not like wireline  where you can just buy more and lay it down,  as if that's easy to dig a ditch across the country.  But it's one of those things where, you know,  some of the luxuries you get used to with, you know,  plugging in a wire in the back of your machine go away  because all kinds of things affect it,  whether it's the shape of the land,  the frequency you're using,  if you have really thick drywall  or maybe you have a Latin blaster.  I mean, and so you have all these really weird questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't blame your wall for lack of net neutrality.  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I'm saying?  We're mixing a lot of things together  when we talk about network neutrality  and especially network neutrality in wireless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But do you know what people are talking about?  What they're saying is we don't want us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to plant a flag on wireless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you did, but that's the thing.  Google did.  For years, in every form,  including this Spectrum auction,  fought the good fight.  And I think a lot of people,  Jeff Jarvis, myself, Gina included,  felt a little let down that Google,  it looked like, was waving the flag,  the white flag of surrender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think surrender's a strong word.  But no, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sort of an emperor hero, but it didn't help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we're not Czechoslovakia,  well, we're not France or whatever.  I don't know, whatever your horrible-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, but yeah, it's a terrible analogy.  But you're saying that the fight's not over.  And this is a point that is made,  I think, in several places by Google,  which is this is a temporary solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I would like to think that it's not,  it doesn't have to be a fight with Verizon.  So that's what I would like to think.  I would like to think that what'll happen is  maybe they'll see what goes on in wireline  and say, you know what,  if we adopt similar rules on wireless,  I think we'll be well-served.  And I think that sometimes Google will  go down the road with someone to help them,  that sounds paternal,  that we'll try to see if things work out like that.  And we're taking the hit for it.  You are.  Because people are gonna say,  well, Verizon's never gonna be good.  And so there's no point in doing this.  But I think it's okay.  Verizon's, the other side of this, I should point out,  Verizon's been a very, very good partner to Google.  I mean, they ship a lot of Androids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was a speculation,  is that maybe Google was paying more attention  to its pocketbook than its principles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think it's another way of thinking about this  is that we're also giving our friends a chance.  So we have a big pocketbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not really about-  I think the term our friends  is what people are a little upset about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the thing, it's like they say that,  but if you look at the customer service reviews of Verizon,  they're like the highest among the telcos.  I'm a Verizon customer, I didn't even.  It's like saying they're the most popular,  telco may not be-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The most popular kind of heart attack to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know, I mean, it says something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sounds like you're saying it's,  look, politics is the art of compromise.  And it's always very frustrating for the idealist,  and I will include myself,  I know Gina and Jeff feel that way too,  we're idealists, to acknowledge and admit we're compromised.  And I think that's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that you shouldn't have to make excuses  for your idealism.  So, you know, you should expect more from us.  You shouldn't expect less.  And that's why I was personally  probably pretty upset a couple of weeks ago,  but you know, compromise is gonna make idealism  feel pretty bad, or idealism makes compromise  feel pretty bad.  And we've always been a company  that's tried to hang on to our idealism.  So yeah, I get that, I get the disappointment, you know?  And I don't think it's wrong to be disappointed sometimes.  And what I hope, what I hope is that  we're proven to be right.  And if we're wrong, we just admit it and move on  and fix it.  Well, you know, in some ways,  I feel that this is what happened with China.  See, I'm gonna touch all the things,  and if I'm not working here tomorrow, you know what?  But it's like, you know,  sometimes our compromises work out,  and sometimes they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  China was an example where it seemed like  from the outside, there was an internal rift at Google,  there was a group that wanted to be in China  and maybe compromise the ideals a little bit  because it was important to be in China,  and there was a group that said,  no, we should never compromise.  And the names that got associated with the former  were of course Eric Schmidt and the latter were Larry Page,  but let's not say names, but is there-  It's all pretty complicated.  It's complicated.  Is there, would you say within Google itself,  as you walk down the halls,  that this discussion is also ongoing?  That there is, that there's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I would actually personalize it,  because you know, China was an example of, again,  I know people in China and they would tell me,  listen, when it came time to search the web,  and not the Chinese web, but like the web at large,  Google is the place they would go,  and it's how they would find things out,  it's how they would learn,  especially computer scientists I talked to,  which is mostly who I talked to.  And it's like, they really appreciated that they do that.  And that made the compromise, which at the time,  was the weird pseudo-censorship regime.  It made it be kind of okay.  It's like, listen, Google's not a government.  Google isn't, we're not presidents of the internet,  as much as people seem to think we are.  No, I am actually.  That's you.  Duly elected on Twitter.  Duly elected.  Yeah, it's true.  King of the internet.  No, no, just president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, I think my term is run.  I don't know.  Oh, your majesty.  Emperor would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was of two minds.  It's like, on one side, it's like,  we should give them the same results  we give everybody else.  And then you get on this thing where it's like,  I work for Google, so I'm gonna make mental compromises  that maybe I wouldn't make if I weren't here,  or am I being intellectually true to myself?  And it's very, very hard to know sometimes.  So I was of many, many minds on the China thing.  I'm pretty happy with where we are right now  with the Hong Kong solution, as it were.  I think it's a good one for us.  I think it's a little more true to our nature.  So, good.  And that might be an example of how this stuff can work.  I didn't quit Google when we did the China thing.  And it wasn't a financial decision, really, by that time.  So it's like, I obviously am okay with this.  And in some ways, I have to personalize it  because I can't speak for every single human being at Google,  much less Larry, Sergey, and Eric, right?  Because that would be ill-advised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I really appreciate your frankness, Chris.  And it's really, it's engineers like Chris  who have this conscience.  And you can tell these conversations happen at Google  and that these sorts of, the self-examination goes on.  I don't think that the evil conversation is just a story.  I think this really goes on.  And so I really appreciate you being so frank.  And it's good to know that you had second thoughts.  And of course, they're your employers.  And that is an important fact, but I do appreciate your-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, at the same time, I gotta tell you,  I've got this loyalty thing, or it's like,  you know what, Google's been really good to me.  So sometimes when I get upset about some decision  or some policy, I say to myself, you know what?  One, I don't have to like everything.  But two, these people have been very good to me.  Why should I assume that I'm right about this?  And shouldn't I give them a second chance, right?  So I've got that weird loyalty thing going on.  And so I don't know that I'm always the best person  to speak about this to an idealist audience, right?  Who are gonna say, listen, you're just bought and sold  by Google.  It's like, no, I'm actually loyal to Google,  which is an unfashionable thing to be nowadays,  to be loyal to a company.  But I feel that Google's been very, very loyal to me  and very good to me.  So I'm very emotional about it.  So it's, you know, I mean, I really love working at Google  and I don't wanna work at places that don't have idealism  inherent in the system, as it were.  And it's why I stay here, you know?  And it's why I wanna come on to Twig and talk about it.  You know, listen, it's like, you know,  when I saw the Verizon thing, at first I was like,  wow, are we abandoning this thing that, you know,  frankly, we were the only ones fighting for,  for like five years, you know?  Are we abandoning it?  And I was pissed off and I thought, well, wait a second,  let's just stop for a second.  One, there's no point in being pissed off.  But secondly, it's like, are we really gonna throw away  five years of work?  And if our changing our minds, how are we changing it?  Why are we changing it?  And if it doesn't work out,  are we gonna be the same company I think we are and say,  oh, you know, it didn't work out,  let's push this other direction later.  And that's why I sort of see it as being a compromise.  And one that I think that is,  what I hope will turn out to be good for,  for the internet, for you guys, for Google, for me.  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you, Chris.  I echo Gina's remarks.  It's good to, and you said the word engineer, Gina,  and that's what I love, engineers,  cause you know what?  Engineers are very binary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did a little bit of coding recently,  but I've been doing a lot of coding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got the engineering in your brain though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you've earned that title, Chris.  I think you're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, having said that,  there you go.  Having said that,  I do notice this article about Tom Talk.  Tom Talk.  Tom Talk, who is a Verizon spokesman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really, the Verizon spokesman's name is Tom Talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tom Talk, yeah, T-A-U-K, he might be talky,  but I think he should call himself Talk.  Well, I'm Chris Search.  How are you?  The wireless rules, says Mr. Talk,  caused a bit of controversy.  Of course, we indicated that transparency  should apply to wireless,  but we acknowledged wireless is different  for a variety of reasons.  He quotes physics, and that's true.  There are some differences.  He said really the future in wireless  is with managed services.  He basically said there's no such,  the wireless internet is not the internet.  It's just a combination of managed services.  So that's why I think in the long run,  I hope you will keep watching Verizon closely.  Keep your eyes on it.  Well, I mean, it's funny,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because if I were to put,  what does managed service mean?  Because voice isn't TCPIP on these phones, right?  Is it?  I mean, if it is, you want it to be on a sideline,  because you don't want it to be slowed down  by your downloading of some mail on the side.  You want it when you're doing a conversation, obviously.  So it's like, what does that mean?  So it's a question of, do we all mean the same things  when we talk about this stuff?  And we're all using different vocabulary.  And I have to tell you,  telcos have their whole other vocabulary for everything.  Where do you think being one thing  really means something else than they have for 40 years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good article.  I recommend in the law and disorder column  on Ars Technica today, a good article about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like Ars Technica a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a great, it's getting better and better.  It's become almost the journal of record  for the tech industry, if you ask me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they seem to know their...  They got good people.  Really good people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So a couple of, actually, as long as we got Chris on,  maybe we should ask about Android.  One of the things that.  I love Android.  Oh, well, who doesn't?  Everybody here loves Android.  I'm loving it.  Yay, open source.  Yay, open.  Okay, that's why I want to bring this up,  because Android is open source, open handset alliance.  And in a way, that's caused Google to lose some control.  And you have this really nasty situation  where companies, we won't name names,  Motorola, HTC, Samsung, are just kind of beaten up  on Android, putting weird crap on it and so forth,  and making it not a really great experience.  And this must be a little frustrating.  For Google, I know that's why you did the Nexus One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I don't know.  I mean, apps run on them.  All the ones you mentioned have phones  that are coming out that are 2.1 and 2.2.  And so the apps all run.  I'm using DroidX, waiting for 2.2, waiting, waiting, waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, which is great.  I understand Motorola's suing people  who put out an early ROM or something.  Really?  Well, they were mad, because the 2.2 ROM leaked.  Huh, that's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not good.  Yeah, obviously I have no idea what's going on there.  So don't say anything.  I gotta say, Motorola's been really good  about pushing out the updates, though.  I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Droid, of course, and Droid 2 are both 2.2 now, so.  Yeah, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the-  What do you use, Chris?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you still, you're still on the G1?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got a Nexus One over here in my bag, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every time I pick up my Nexus One,  I say, hey, little buddy, you're still one of the best.  You're gonna be, it's gonna be a classic.  Like, consider- It is.  You'll look back on it and say,  this was one of the great phones of all time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think most of them- It's the developer phone, right?  It's the engineer phone.  It's the, you know, the pure Google experience phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But not just for developers, it's pure for everybody.  While I'm using DroidX, because I like the big screen.  Yeah, it's gorgeous.  I gotta say, every time I pick up the Nexus One,  I'm thinking, I really should go back to this,  because this is elegant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I do a fair amount of international travel,  so a Verizon phone kinda doesn't work out for me.  My sister has the Droid, as does my brother-in-law,  and my father, and he know a lot of people.  So, yeah, it's, they're good phones.  Where were we going with this?  I'm trying to- Well, I was just talking about,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  is it a little source of frustration

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for the open source folks that this,  and I guess this is the duality of open source,  is that you do allow, it does make it possible  for people to change it.  What is the GPL though?  I mean, are the, can you just use Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it Apache?  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I were to put a picture of Android for you,  at the bottom is the kernel, and that's under the GPL,  which requires resharing of the code that you release.  And then on top of that is this huge Android-ness,  which is mostly Apache, and BSD, and a little bit of LGPL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Dalvik and all this stuff above it are Apache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says you can have this, do what you want with it,  and ship it, and we can't tell you no.  And you don't have to release your code

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  back out of the wild either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't, you just have to acknowledge  that you got some of it from us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the difference between GPL and Apache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it is, but the funny thing about the GPL is that,  in the context of phones, if you use the GPL,  the GPL Linux kernel, it's actually very, very easy  to share that software, and it hardly impacts you at all  from a change standpoint.  You can still change the heck out of it.  And then you just have to release your software  along with it.  Because what you're really expressing frustration with,  maybe, if frustration's even the word,  is that some Androids don't look like all Androids, right?  Or some Androids, they add on the Sense layer,  the Sense UI layer, or they have something else in there  that's unexpected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or companies like Verizon end up locking down  what was essentially an open handset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I guess it's, I don't remember which carrier it was,  but it was basically, you pay an extra $25 for Tether.  Right, that's Verizon.  So that's Verizon, yes.  And so they put a little bit in there,  and they turn it on and off.  And as a customer, you say, well, is that something  I'm okay with?  And people have to make that decision.  Other people, they go out and they buy PDA net.  And some phones are more locked down than others.  Some phones are not updated like others either.  That's the other frustrating.  That's probably the most frustrating thing for me.  Not really if somebody has a different UI,  or even if they charge extra for Tethering,  which from a bandwidth allocation perspective,  might be fair, depending on your perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, I don't have a problem with them  charging for Tethering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I admit, it bugs me way more when somebody ships 1.6.  Okay, that's what really bugs me.  Because we're finally clearing all the 1.6s  out of the pipeline.  And we've got some, and 2.1 is,  it's easy to ship 2.1 as it is to ship 1.6.  Right.  So it just baffles me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just wish they get two out.  And now Gingerbread on the road,  and the roadmap has now gone to H.  Yes, Honeycomb.  Honeycomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Honeycomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Honeycomb.  And that's confirmed.  Yay.  Oh, it is?  Sorry, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Chris just confirmed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or some other thing that starts with H.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pocket gauze.  A cruller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looked like Gingerbread was really aimed at a tablet,  a larger form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to tell you, you know what I wanted to call Froyo?  Because we were batting around names.  I wanted to call it Frangipan,  but nobody had heard of it before.  That would have been great.  It's great.  And they're like, nobody can spell it.  And I'm like, yeah, but it's really tasty.  And I'm like, well, it's like an almond paste croissant.  And they're like, just get out of the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should have taken everybody to Paris,  and then they would have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, on my special teleporting desk.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love these stories.  The stories behind the names.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't know Chris was in the room when this all happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love that.  No, no, I wasn't.  There's not like a secret room that I get to go to.  It's just whenever I see those guys,  like you should call it Frangipan.  And they're like, Chris, just be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, Frangipan, go away.  So, but no, Gingerbread, Honeycomb.  What will be, do we know anything about Honeycomb?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have no idea.  And if I did, I probably would have said too much  if I told you the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I said it.  Did he say it?  Let's rewind the tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The story that I linked to is that there was a rumor  that was called Honeycomb.  That was pretty much all we know about it.  I think the word is that it'll be a minor update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All the names have to do with pastry or dessert or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Honeycomb's so obvious  that of course that would be your guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's not obvious.  It's not obvious at all.  How is it obvious?  It's not like, hey, let's go out for some Froyo  and a Honeycomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How about Hamantashen?  That would have been good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that Turkish?  Hot cross buns.  Hot cross buns.  See, that would have been fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Man, I haven't had lunch yet, Leroy.  You're killing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other problem is we have to buy the sort of  the whole mini golf things  that we have in front of building 44.  That's right.  You have a Froyo.  You have the song.  The cupcake.  Right, and they're huge.  They're big, right?  They're the Froyo.  No, well, they're really big.  And it's from a company that makes them  for mini golf places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  So those are really mini golf, wow.  So sort of.  Do they have Honeycomb for mini golf?  I have no idea.  I can tell you one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're very creative people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They sure don't have Frangipan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's where I would have broken down eventually.  They've been like, Frangipan?  What's that?  What does that look like?  Croissant, a croissant?  What are you, what are you, great.  We don't make croissants here.  We could make you a windmill.  Can we put some whipped cream on a windmill  and call it a Frangipan?  Let's start a rumor, Gina,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that Google is starting a mini golf course  in front of building 43, 42, whatever it is.  Let's, a couple other stories,  then we're gonna get to our tool in tip of the week.  Tip of the week.  Tip of the week.  And if you wanna do a number, Chris,  we always do a number.  Jeff does a number.  If you wanna go search for a number, please do.  I don't know what your tool is, Gina.  A lot of these links are tools.  I'm not giving my phone number.  I don't.  No, no, no.  A number would be like, Google activates 200,000 handsets  a day on Android.  That kind of thing, yeah.  Oh, I like this one.  You know, we're getting ready for the social network.  The Mark Zuckerberg Facebook movie,  which by all accounts is a very good.  I love the trailer.  Yeah, the trailer's great.  David Fincher, great director.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love the whole kids against the establishment thing  going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aaron Sorkin, a great writer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Justin Timberlake.  Justin Timberlake.  Is Sean Parker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a JT fan, can't go wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A great, I don't know, and singer, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I like the kid from Zombieland.  He's great.  Is that the kid from Zombieland?  Yeah.  As Zuck.  He'll be good.  We should just call him Zuck.  I don't even know the guy.  Why would we call him Zuck?  Mr. Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Our friend Zuck, because he's 26.  That's why we call him Zuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was 26 once, it was a while ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So apparently, the next movie gonna be  Siegfried and Roy.  No, no, it's not gonna be Siegfried and Roy.  It's gonna be Sergey and Larry.  You know, if Sergey and Larry had a white tiger though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that would be really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'll be based on Ken Aleta's book, Googled.  And I'm sure that Jeff is pretty mortified  that it's not based on what would Google do.  It'll be the story of Sergey and Larry  and the rise of Google.  I think that'll be pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure.  I guess.  That sounds so boring.  It sounds like a documentary really to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The nice thing about Facebook is there's sex and drugs  in rock and roll.  I don't really see a whole lot of that  with Larry and Sergey, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't do any of that stuff here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a bunch of engineers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like all these movies are about these total dorks  like in their dorm room, like trying to figure out.  We should just be typing the whole time.  Yeah, just typing the whole time.  If it were true to life, it would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can you get me a Dr. Pepper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And a Diet Coke.  Why isn't that Micro Kitchen closer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, it's.  I got a bug here.  Pizza.  Funyuns, I want Funyuns.  Funyuns.  Who put Cheeto dew all over my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think about it, if Citizen Kane was just a guy  sitting in an office yelling at his reporters.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean.  Well, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if you have this as a tool or not.  We talked about it on Net At Night last night.  The fact that you now have 30 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that was my tip this week.  But that's, but it's also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I won't say anything about it.  It's a secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, I didn't give it away.  I didn't give it away.  I just said, you now have 30 seconds.  I didn't say.  You now have 30 seconds.  For what?  So you're not going to mention the fact that now  you have the ocean and Google Earth on Android.  That's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is kind of cool.  That's pretty neat update.  I haven't had a chance to play with it yet.  Have you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And now I presume they're going to add all the desktop  features, which means the moon, the stars and all that too.  I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we already have the Google sky as an app.  You can.  Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sky's already in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sky's out.  But yeah, it's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let's get a confirmation out of Chris DeBona on this one.  Oh boy, I'm going to get in trouble.  Real time search results that update as you type.  Tech crunch says.  Oh yeah, I saw this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, we always test stuff out online.  Does it mean it's going to happen?  Yes.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, so time we replace everything  with pictures of ponies.  Really?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've always liked Google suggest.  I mean, that's really cool.  And it's also a fun game to play just to see, you know,  what when you type my name, what do you get?  But is really good looking.  No, you don't get that.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If everyone searches for it, maybe we can make it.  Is it based on what people are searching for?  I honestly don't know.  I think it must be a mix of things.  It wouldn't just use trends data.  I mean, I might, you know, but.  So now they're going to update the search page as you type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo DiCaprio, Leo Laporte, iPad launch, Facebook, Twitter,  Kino Tech Guy quits Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like every episode of Twig devolves into one of us  Googling ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo Laporte space is space and see what happens.  Dare I?  Dare I?  Yes, you dare.  Oh, you are a man of.  Is a douche and an idiot.  There you go.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  That's not cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not nice.  Those are the two results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're neither of those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, why would somebody search for Leo Laporte is a douche?  I don't think you need to search for it  if you were confident about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, obviously, they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're looking for confirmation in their beliefs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, people always do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it could just be a test.  It doesn't mean that they're going to have real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We test unusual things all the time.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of wave like.  I feel like if they rolled this out,  everyone would be like, this is too chaotic.  Things are changing fast on my screen and I cannot crack it.  I do not understand.  I don't understand why the words keep changing.  Sit still, damn you.  I mean, seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I felt like before.  Do you remember when we ran the Pac-Man thing?  Yeah.  And there was all those tech support like.  People called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why is Pac-Man in my Google?  Is that what they were saying?  It's broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is it making sounds?  And it's like, you know, I felt kind of bad, you know,  because it's like, you know, it's  like whenever you get trapped behind somebody who's  driving and it can be frustrating.  But at the same time, I'm like, you know,  I would want somebody to be really patient  if I was the old guy, you know, or if it was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because we're all going to be eventually.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And like, eventually I'll be that old guy.  You know, and so I try to have a lot of sympathy for people.  You know, so when I like I saw those Pac-Man tramps,  I kind of felt bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, people calling up saying,  why is my computer making that sound?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it never did this before.  What is going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was it the fact that you have to press  a button that says insert coin kind of a hint?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, if you didn't do it, it would turn on by itself.  So when we first pushed it out, it automatically  started after a little while.  Right.  And so it started going, what?  And people were freaking out.  And they're like calling up their tech support  They thought they had like a virus or something.  And, you know, and then it became, you know,  and then, of course, all the mean people on the internet,  there's so many mean people.  They're like, oh, hey, dumb users.  And it's like, no, they're just, you know,  they're normal, unusual.  And they're they want to either stop it or they don't know  why it's going on.  A little worried because the computers don't always  perform so well, you know, because of all we geeks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  forget, we forget that there are normal more sensitive.  We should. It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's one of the reasons I do that and the huge paycheck.  I continue to do the radio show.  The huge fish that the huge fish know the reason I do  the radio shows because it really gets to me in touch  with normal people who call in and say things like that.  And I forget it's easy to forget if you don't constantly  talk to to normal users that our view is skewed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That someone would react with anything other than delight  at the sight of Pac-Man on their Google page.  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think it was cool we did it.  And I really like that.  But yeah, I think it's OK to be a little sympathetic,  you know, when people get confused by computers,  because, you know, we all didn't we weren't born with keyboards  in our, well, I was, but most people were not born  with keyboards in their hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good on you, Christa Bona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  It's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  K ship Ken Shepperton, our director of engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would not ship Pac-Man, though,  let me make it very, very clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, you got to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I ship it.  Got to ship it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just, you know, bear bear up under the brunt of calls.  Yes. Google does not have a tech support number, though, does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we do for enterprise,  abstract domain customers, yeah, because you really

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you really wouldn't want to be answering calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My search doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Where are these calls coming in anyway, Chris?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, these were like to like local ISPs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I see. OK, OK.  Gotcha. Yeah.  That's who gets that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who gets the calls?  Yeah. Google will not take.  All right. Time to get our tech tool tip and number of the week.  If Chris wants to come up with a number, he can.  But let's start with our tech tip of the week with Gina Tripani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a great number. Oh, good.  It's very narcissistic. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My tip this week is a Gmail tip.  One of the Gmail Labs features, which I absolutely love  and been using for a long time, it's called Undo Send.  So when with it enabled, when you send an email,  it will a little a little message appears across the top of your inbox.  It says, do you want to undo undo this?  You can call an email back.  It used to be that I think it gave you like five seconds  in order to make that quick decision.  Undo Send just got a configurable amount of times.  You can set it up to 30 seconds.  You have up to 30 seconds to pull back that email where you forgot  the attachment or realize that you're just too drunk  and it was too embarrassing.  So to turn it on, you have to have Undo Send enabled in the Gmail  Labs section, which is what Leo's looking at right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have enabled every thing, including Green Robot  and all sorts of weird crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the other a lot of Labs features are really good.  But then you have to go into Gmail settings and there'll be a new setting  which where you can set.  I think it's a drop down of like five, 10, 20, 30 seconds. OK.  So once I've enabled it, I have to now go to these settings.  Yeah. And then go and then go into settings, which is a little weird.  I would have expected the setting to be where you enable it.  But so it's two different places.  But turn it on.  And the first time you undo sending a message, you will be very grateful.  Yes, five, 10, 20 or 30 seconds.  You have 30 seconds to pull back that email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the reason it's not longer is because, of course, your mail  doesn't go out for that period of time.  So if you made it 20 minutes, people would start calling

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chris DeBona saying, where'd my mail go?  It's not going anywhere.  It's stuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's how come makes it only 30 seconds, only 30 seconds.  Because otherwise they'd be calling their ISPs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My mail is constipated.  It's taking 20 minutes.  I don't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chris DeBona, what is what is your narcissistic number of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I have two.  So the number of additional Twitter followers that came from the live broadcast.  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The fact that you even know what the Delta is is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I checked it, you know, before we got on.  It looks like I've gained about 40 followers.  Oh, we can do better than that.  What is your Twitter handle?  It's C to bonus, you know, Twitter slash C to bonus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we'll get a little more than that here.  There he is. And I'm following you.  Oh, really? I'm following you.  And he looks like Rasputin, the Mad Monk.  But don't let that disturb you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, if I looked at Rasputin, I'd be like it's skinnier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chris, is this your Google?  Is this your Google headshot?  It's a good shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is absolutely a PR paid headshot.  And my second one, as I was going to say, and I thought that it'd be really fun  to hear from you two from your main Gmail accounts, the answer to this.  So if you click on all mail in the upper right hand corner is a number of threads  in your Gmail.  Yeah, it's a very interesting number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So where do I go? So I'm in my mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All mail. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not inbox. All mail.  Is that some of it?  It's it's in your list of way down under.  OK, all mail.  And now what am I looking for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then look to the upper right hand corner.  They'll say one to 50 of X.  And what is X?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nine thousand eight hundred and ninety two.  What's yours, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is on your new one, right?  This is your apps for your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this is this is my Gmail because I don't use it as my primary mail.  Oh, OK. Well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm twenty six thousand three hundred and seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what are you, Chris?  Well, this is for my work email, not for my personal email.  And it's two hundred and fifty nine thousand.  Oh, so this might be my primary work email for four plus years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think it's more in your home or less?  Oh, I could find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I've got another 22,000 in my other account.  So like forty two thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought, wow, almost ten thousand.  And if you want to be really committed, we could bring up our spam folders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I can show you there.  There for a 30 day moving average.  All right. Let's see.  Spam. I have eight hundred fifty nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I only have eight hundred fifty nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seven thousand thirty four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My Gmail seven thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina. Yeah, I've got seven eight hundred in here.  Yeah. What do you have, Chris?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, let's see. I have to go to it.  So in my regular Gmail, I have two hundred and thirteen thousand six hundred  and fifty three threads in my all mail.  And then for spam, I have not many, actually.  This is not very many. This is two thousand seventy six.  But it's going through a primary filter first.  That's it's a weird number.  Um, so it's not so bad.  I feel I should have I should have more spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I'm feeling neglected by the spammers out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't say that. Like, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well, I have, you know, inadvertently, but if you've watched the video,  been giving out my Gmail or not, I mean, it's not like it's something  you couldn't guess, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I had the highest spam that Chris had the highest number of threads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. Well, you know, so you guys can apply to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can find it out.  I don't know what's worse there.  I think I'd rather have the spam because I don't want to have all those  conversations that I actually have to deal with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is that number? What is that threads number?  That means how many different conversation, not merely emails,  but conversations, conversations.  Yeah. So it's all all the cold.  All the emails with the same subject are collated into one thread.  Right. So you have many more emails than 200,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, probably a million. Wow.  But I am a riddle. There's just no way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, I bought a lot of extra storage on Gmail.  I think I have 200 gigs. Yeah. 207 gigs storage.  That's great. Because for PICASA, I web, you know, the photo sharing and  but I'll never fill that up.  I only have well, I have four point six gigs of email.  How much how many gigs of email do you have, Chris, if you have that many threads

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on my work one, it's fifteen and a half.  And then in my home one, it's not that many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google probably gives you the 25 that you get from Google Apps.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's 25 gigs for Premiere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It's the same thing. You have twenty five point six gigs.  You know, so. Yeah. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And my tip of the week, and it's really kind of a multiple tip of the week,  is how I think I'm going to plan my new flow with PubSubHubbub  and all of that of a content.  So it's going to start as I did today.  I I blogged that we were doing the show at Leoville.com.  So that's where that's where my blog lives.  And on Leoville.com, if all goes well.  And there is a plug in for WordPress, which I have yet to install  PubSubHubbub plug in, which will then pump it to buzz.  And then I use a program called BuzzcanTweet, which is people have sometimes  complained is unreliable, but I have found it to be quite reliable  in taking my buzzes and putting them on Twitter.  I mean, the speed with which BuzzcanTweet works depends a lot on, I think, Twitter  and how how Twitter is responding.  But it seems to do quite a good job.  You sign in with your Twitter account using OAuth  and has quite a bit of control over what goes to Twitter and how it goes to Twitter.  You can even say, you know, just certain hashtags go to Twitter.  So so that's kind of the publishing chain.  And then my real question was because Buzz has this great widget.  And I really one of the reasons I buzz so much is because I have the widget  on my Android phone so I could, you know, hit the widget, take a picture  or post a picture or even just post a simple comment.  And that's one of the things that I think I'm going to kind of mostly  mostly miss on my Android phone.  Let me see your Gina, you're there.  So let me switch my camera five down to this so you can see my Android phone.  On my Android phone, I still have that buzz post a buzz widget,  which I highly recommend.  But now I've found a WordPress open source WordPress  blog posting application that's free from the folks at Automatic.  And you can post directly from there.  You can even add media photos and videos.  So I think while it took a few more clicks,  I may be able to start everything.  This is my goal to start everything on the blog.  Using the and this WordPress app is available  both on the Android phones and the iPhone and even the iPad.  There's a very nice version on the iPad.  If you're using WordPress dot com, of course, it gives you lots more information.  If you're a Squarespace user, there's an iPhone app, too.  So I would say most blogs probably have something like this.  I am also using and I really recommend, although it's no longer free  commenting engine, there's two good ones.  Disqus.com I used for a long time discusses how that's pronounced.  Now I have to switch this back over.  Disqus is a system that takes comments out in the social sphere  and brings them back into your blog.  But the one that I'm using right now is from JS kit.  It's called JS kit echo.  It was unfortunately it was a buck a month, and now it is unfortunately ten bucks a month.  So they've recently raised the price, but it's very easy to install.  And I think it is really, really a powerful solution.  The nice thing about echo is the comments are in real time.  They come in from social media.  They get aggregated.  You can reply.  It's very powerful.  And if you if you go to the comments section on liavel.com, a really good example was  this buzzkill post, which got a lot of engagement in the real world  and got captured right back into the blog.  Now it's hosted.  Unfortunately, it's hosted by JS kit.  So I'll have to somehow, you know, some way to import it back in.  Let me see if I can find the post.  Yeah, there it is into my blog if I want to save them.  But at least for the time being, they're safe.  And I use services like Backupify.  Look at this.  What is the current count?  I don't know how many comments there are on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And most of them from Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, 2100 comments.  Well, that's the point is that this is a way to get the Twitter engagement  back into the blog respond there.  Now, the responses don't automatically go back to Twitter, which is kind of not ideal.  But at least there's at least there's a way to get this engagement back into the blog.  Because what I'm trying to do is kind of get the best of both worlds,  which is post on the blog where it's permanent and saved,  but have engagement in other places.  So cross post into Twitter and Buzz and Facebook and then capture the conversation  back from those social media sites.  So those are the tools that I'm using right now.  And there goes Christa Bona.  I bored him to tears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, how does the how does this plug and know that the response on Twitter  is to that particular tweet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It only works if it sees the link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, if it sees the link.  So the expanded link has to be to your to the permalink on the page.  I believe that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe so.  But it's but most people do that.  They do a reply to the original post.  Let's get Chris's call back.  There we go.  So but now this is just a very preliminary set of ways to do this.  And I would I would love to do is get some conversation going.  Maybe I'll I know what I'll do.  I'll blog post about how I'm doing this and get some conversation coming back  because I'd love to see other ways to do it, because the key for me is  it has to be easy to get that original content out.  It's one of the reasons I use Buzz and Twitter is one of the reasons you do,  Gina, it's easy.  You go, but it's done. Right.  So how do we get that kind of ease of publishing  combined with permanence and engagement?  That's my my ultimate goal.  Gina Trapani does her thing.  She's still blogging.  If you were in Pennsylvania now, you'd have to pay that three hundred dollars  blogger fee.  So weird.  Isn't that weird?  They want to charge people to blog as like a business.  Smarterware.org, that's the place because she's an enlightened San Diego.  She doesn't have to. Yes, yes, I am.  She does not have to worry about that.  And of course, her.  I don't know. Should I plug the book? If you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's OK.  No, no, it's OK.  We can plug the book.  It's a history book.  It's a it's a it's an homage to Google Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  That's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Enjoy it at complete waveguide.com because, you know, it's it'll be  it'll be in the Computer History Museum someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was this thing called wave.  It was the only manual ever written.  And let's plug this new fast company thing you're doing.  Can we plug that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, sure. That'd be great. Yeah.  I'm doing a new video series on Fast Company Dotcom.  It will start airing in September.  And Leo is making a guest appearance, which I'm very excited about.  And I'll I'll add the link once they start airing.  It's a cool kind of fun Q&A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like having Kirk show up on TNG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know where I am.  Good. That's going to be fun. Fast Company Dotcom.  Look for that.  Mr. Chris DeBona is always welcome here in the Twitch cottage.  We just we just adore Chris.  He's he's currently doing this Google thing, but, you know,  who knows what will happen tomorrow?  Open source program manager at Google for open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're invited to do because I don't know that I have the street card for that yet.  I think that we're just really getting started in a lot of ways.  Well, it's the Google's doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want to be a gas back.  You know, so well, I'll mention it.  And follow him on Twitter.  CDIB o n a.  I'm a Genovese, a couple of Sicilians.  What are you going to do?  Let's go have pasta.  We'll see you next time on this weekend.  Thanks, everyone.
