The show where we cover the latest news from the Googleverse, the Twitterverse, the Facebookverse, and the Snowconeverse.  Stacey Higginbotham is here. The Internet of Things podcast host with Kevin Toffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Fetaverse. I was ready for the Snowconeverse because I had lots of opinions about that.  Did I not say the Snowconeverse? Well I know and I have opinions to share about Snowcones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I mentioned it. We have Snowcone news and Feta news today. Both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cacio e Pepe made with feta cheese. Ruined Leo's intros. Stacey on IOT.com is the website. Hello Stacey.  Oh hello. Hello. I love your Pashmina. You have the best shawls and stuff. That's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's because I'm an old shawl lady now. Yeah. Because I live in a cold climate. My mom who's 88 and really is an old lady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, mom's getting the vaccine on Friday. I'm very excited. Yay. She's thrilled. She's in Rhode Island.  Are you getting yours sometime soon old guy? I'm encouraged because apparently we just bought 600 million doses.  So I feel like I'm in group 3 in California. We're in group 2 right now. That's alright. I feel like next month or two.  That's fine. I get dose 2 on Tuesday. Good man. I'm so excited. See what I mean? There's a light at the end of the tunnel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. There's something happening. There's a future. We can't get through these intros but good things are happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My mom, well the reason I brought her up is she's well beyond shawls. She's now wearing mob caps. She calls them mob caps.  Which I think is what they were called in the Revolutionary War. They're hats on your head. Like a toke?  No, they're tighter than that. I don't know. They hold your hair and they keep your head warm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you Google it, a round gated or pleated cloth bonnet. They're kind of more Revolutionary War.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's all into the mob caps and she's sending me some. I will be wearing a mob cap.  Hey John, I'm not getting the stream. You've got to put the stream in the monitor because I can't tell what you're taking a picture of.  But I gather from the laughter you're seeing this simple American bonnet in portrait by Benjamin Greenleaf, 1805.  Which is ironically the year the house I grew up in was built. So maybe that's where she got the mob caps.  Jeff Jarvis is also here. Wait a minute. Let me get the script.  The Leonard Tao Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, City University of New York.  Hello Jeff. Hello. Hello. Hello.  Vaccine two on its way. That's good news. That's I've really got a two week delayed reaction to vaccine one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, you last Monday. What was the reaction? Right. I saw it was 13 days after the after a word.  I suddenly got a fever and a aches and headache and all that. And I thought, oh, I got it.  So I went in to get a test and it was negative. I just think it was a delayed reaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My arm got sore two weeks later. Randall Monroe explains this in his XK CD webcomic from a few days ago.  If you could actually show this, the vaccine, it's an explanation, contains mRNA instructions for making the virus spike protein.  Weird. So the vaccines just blueprints. Yeah. Your body reads the mRNA, makes the proteins and has an immune reaction to them.  Why would my body attack something it made itself? Well, and so here's a little story.  Here are the Death Star plans. Thank you, Princess. These blueprints are from Princess Leia.  She's always giving us projects here. Take these blueprints to your construction crew. Affirmative. What is it?  No idea. Something the princess wants. Copy that. Soon. Hi, Commander. Construction crew B here.  We finished building the princess's big metal orb thing. Do you know if she wants us to park it somewhere or?  Is everything OK? Imperial Station. Battle. Battle. Red alert. Red alert. Get the fighters in the air. Kill it. Kill it.  Blow it up. Shoot it. Shoot it. The armor is too strong. We're not getting through. Keep firing. Can everybody please chill?  We don't even have that laser thing wired up. We. Hey, boom. I said we we can't get through.  We're running out of proton torpedoes. Send every crew to build more torpedoes. There aren't enough ships to build more ships.  The thing is just sitting there. Are you sure we keep building ships? Build ships forever. Destroy the orb.  What is wrong with you people? Says the orb. Definitely feeling a little sore. Yeah, they said you might have some side effects.  You lie down. I'll get you some hot tea and a blanket. Meanwhile, back on Earth. Die. Die. Die. They're trying to kill the Death Star thing.  I hate you all so much says the guy in the Death Star. What's that? It looks like a thermal exhaust port. I'm going in. Pew pew pew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it blows up. The poor folks in audio. This made no effing sense. You can read it on xkcd.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not done. I'm not done. Don't interrupt. Hold on, because this is OK. This is for you, Jeff. OK. Now. OK.  That was the yeah. Well, you'll understand once we so now we're back to Leia.  She says good work, even though, you know, they're a little frazzled and the patient back here on Earth. I'm feeling better today.  That's great. A few months later, cough cough. We have reached the rebel system, Lord Vader.  Now they shall witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational thermal exhaust port.  And when they blow it up immediately. And that's the idea of an MRA vaccine children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All of which we want to thank this moment. Dr. Kizmikaya Corbett, she is a PhD.  She pushed she in a weekend, worked on what is the vaccine that went into my arm.  And when Biden met her, he said a weekend. She said, yeah, a weekend.  And now was she the one who was originally profiled her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was she the one talking about MRA vaccines 20 years ago and got funding with Google?  Too young for that. OK, so that was the that was the woman by out by Hungarian woman.  Yeah. Researcher working at a university who, you know, came up with the idea.  But see, the thing about kids is interesting is and they did this back a year ago, right?  In April or something in March. Yep. They were able to sequence it very, very quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Literally weekend. Yeah. Literally weekend. So Kizzy PhD is her account.  She's just she's my hero. I mean, she's literally my hero.  She she because of her work. That's how we got the vaccine. Yeah.  And she's really something. Yeah. So she.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We would have had the vaccine sooner, but after they invented it, they had to test it for like nine months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is not we. Yeah. I was like, we're not going to actually argue against that.  You do. That's a good idea. No, no, it's a good thing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's pretty amazing. Well, what else do we have on the show this week, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And also joining us. With the battle for the Death Star, it's Ant Pruitt from Highlands on Photography.  Hello, Ant. Hello, Mr. LePort. Good to see you. You too, sir. Good to see you, sir.  So did anything happen in the last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no. I was thinking I was thinking last night I was this morning I was trying to read some stuff, put it in the rundown.  I said, boy, it's going to be a dull show. There's just nothing. And then then boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're going to have to fill me in because I was busy this morning doing another show.  Google did a deal with News Corp. News Corp. Or the devil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The devil if you're writing the headline in your Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A global multi-year line. I knew you'd see my deft touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like, oh, there's some editorializing in that headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I'll give you the news and you can explain to me why it's the devil.  Google and Murdoch-owned media conglomerate News Corp.  The three year licensing agreement ending years of dispute over payment for news content.  This is Laura Coyale writing in Politico. This is the quote from News Corp.  The landmark should do it in Australian. The landmark three year agreement also includes the development of a subscription platform.  The sharing of ad revenue via Google's ad technology services.  The cultivation of audio journalism. That's what we're doing right here.  Meaningful investments. We're fertilizing.  And meaningful investments in innovative video journalism by YouTube.  Do we know how much money Google gave Rupert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nope. They won't say it. Nobody knows. Lots of guesses but nobody knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you've been following the story, the deal in Australia really came from Rupert Murdoch  pushing the Australian legislature to demand a payment from Google to publishers for news snippets.  So does this change what's going to happen in Australia or Europe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No and yes. It's not a law yet. It's legislation.  So the person who proposed it, I read with him today, says they're going to go ahead with it because it's world first.  And Canada is going to copy it. The EU is going to copy it. Everybody else is going to copy it.  But what it demands is that the platforms negotiate with the publishers.  And so that has now happened. At least with a few of them.  And Google, I think to its end, would say, well we saved the problem here of paying for links.  We're not paying for links. We're paying them for news and they're shutting up about the political stuff and that's that.  Still I think it's a terrible precedent because it was blackmail. It was bribery.  Pure and simple. And Google just said, we don't really care. Nobody's going to read this news.  We got the showcase. Who cares? Fine. Here's a bucket of backsheesh money.  Here. Will you shut up now? Here's a little more. Will you shut up now? Okay. Now you'll shut up.  So it sets a precedent around the structure of the web still. It means that media blackmail works.  Journalists and media use their political capital with politicians without ever acknowledging the conflict of interest here.  Google did not, to my mind, sufficiently defend the Internet. It finally just said, I had a heck with it and did this.  The money I don't think is going to go to journalism. It's going to go to Murdoch's pocket or it's going to go to hedge funds pockets.  And so I was upset and angry. So that was most of the day. Twitter going crazy about this as I'm pontificating about this and where it's going to hit next in Canada and Europe and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then Facebook. Well, before you go to Facebook, let's finish this story because I know you have the final word, but I just like to interpose a little bit of a word in between.  Stacy. I'm not sure. We made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tell us about Facebook. I don't want to be. No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't need to be hamburger helpers in this equation. I was joking. Am I the macaroni?  I think this is actually exactly the way the world works, Jeff. I know you'd like to be a purist, but what happens is we have competing interests.  One you like, one you don't like. They have opposing points of view. One of them threatens and other threatens back. That's that's happened a lot of saber rattling and eventually a little diplomacy happens and they come to a mutual agreement and they resolve it.  And I think this is far better than any of the other possible consequences.  No, the problems I have.  Stop Jeff. Go ahead, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacy. No, I was going to say this is at least done as part of a legislative process and I know that doesn't make it.  I guess holier than now, but it does make it maybe a little bit more transparent like you can see this and if citizens really hate it, they can not vote. I mean, I know I know how you feel about this, Jeff. I really don't have strong feelings either way about it because I'm kind of like I'm a little with Leo's real politic, but it could be worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I kind of like the idea that doesn't always have to be legislative solutions. I agree with you, Stacy, that in theory a legislative solution is the will of the people. But in a way the legislative stick brought the two to the table.  You know, it's like, it's like the Camp David Accord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that legislative stick came from, here's the problem though. It came from Murdoch having politicians literally in his pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well that happens all the time, Jeff. I mean, that's, that's what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know, but what I did is it misused, I know, it misused the structure. If in any normal market, in any sane market, the publishers would have owed Google for the marketing that they received and the traffic they received and the potential customers they got.  It didn't happen that way because Google chose in its early days not to sell, unlike Yahoo, not to sell links in primary search, only in ads.  And so they never established a market value for that. And so the publishers whined and screamed and said, you took my picture. You stole my soul. You owe me eternity.  But in fact, Google was saying, no, we took, we took your headline for the purpose of sending the link to you.  We don't owe you anything for that. But they insisted that they use this PR angle with the politicians to say, Google stole our content.  And Google said, fine, we'll stop doing it. Use robots.txt. We won't do it then. There's a simple way. Don't do it. That's the way the deal works. That's the way the Internet works.  They said, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're going to insist that you steal from us so we can insist you give us money.  We're going to use all of our politicians and Google. It doesn't if Google found value in this news.  But when when I'm just jumping ahead to Facebook, let me just mention this.  I agree with you before you jump ahead again. I want to start.  I'm not going to have to. I'm going to make the point. Mark Zuckerberg said nobody's going to read this news.  We know that he was honest about that. Google hasn't said that. But nobody's going to read the showcase.  They're not going to read news on Google. This was done strictly to pay off the blackmail.  That's what I'm offended by. And they didn't defend the structure of the net. These are the proprietors of our net.  When I defend what I'm accused of defending Google and Facebook, I tell you that I'm defending the net instead.  Well, today, I'm angry that the defenders of the net, especially Google, did not defend the net. I'm very angry.  How does this hurt the net? Well, it's the net number one because God knows how publishers and others will use their political capital in the future to do whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they might hurt down the road. But how does this hurt the net?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This hurts the net because even though they're not officially paying for links, they're paying for links. That's what happened here.  And so there's no there's no rational market exchange going on here. Google said, OK, OK, well, we'll make a news thing.  And we'll put some news there and we'll syndicate it from you like the Associated Press used to work.  OK, and then we pay enough money. You'll stop doing that other thing.  But in fact, it is these guys saying pay us for linking to us.  All right. And Sir Tim Berners-Lee lectured the Australian authorities and said this breaks in a perfect world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In a perfect world, you make a very it doesn't break the web in a perfect world.  You make a very good case. It's a little hypocritical for news organizations who could just block Google's spider and not have to worry about snippets to say, no, no, no, we want to show up in your search results and we want you to pay us for that.  So that's that's hypocritical. I agree with you. That's you know, that's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Google could have had the freedom to say Google could also have the freedom to say, sorry, news organizations, we're not going to pay you.  So what happened in Spain? We'll just leave.  I don't think that then I think they were told that I don't think that's a good outcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is a better outcome. Google can afford.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you agree.  But Google was Google was told you can't even do that.  You can't you can't use your own freedom to make a market choice in your own.  It's going to force you to pay even if you don't get anything.  But I think you're talking about an ideal world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in this case, I think we've got a pretty good agreement that is not going to hurt the Internet.  I don't think this hurts the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, how do you feel about like Substack and newsletters?  Because there's no robot text for these guys.  So if I want something published or searched by Google, I put it online.  So there's there's an opportunity for people for the media business to not have their stuff accessible online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Versus is stuff behind a paywall like the Financial Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does that get spidered? No, that's still searchable and spidered.  But like newsletters like Substack and stuff like that, it's not.  So if I only publish to my subscribers, it's only those subscribers that ever get it and see it and know it exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that harms you in one respect because you don't have discoverability.  It's why Jeff publishes on Medium because he wants people to find his publishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It harms me, but it also harms the overall conversation.  Yes, I agree. As a journalist, I wouldn't like I mean, Google's not really taking money from me as a publisher.  But like it also like as a journalist, I need my work to be out there because otherwise I'm just shouting into the void and there's no fun there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. In a perfect world, there'd be a free flow of information.  There would be no paywalls and everybody be able to see everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, there has to be a way to make money. Yeah.  Hold on there. Hold on there, buddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, let's go to the Financial Times has a pretty hard paywall, which you can't get past because you keep on trying to go past it.  And and the Financial Times knows that in part from Google telling them this guy Leo, he comes in all the time.  Don't give him nothing. Just make sure you don't need Google to tell him that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I go to the Financial Times, they know exactly that I'm doing that.  But they will get various places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Google started subscribe with Google.  Google tells Financial Times when if I go through the mark, if I go through a Google News source to it.  Yeah, or you've got Google cookies for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, honestly, anybody who knows who's hitting the paywall without the help of any third party depends on you, whether you're doing it through mobile and through your browser and through your other browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google knows who you are all the time. Right. Right. Right. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Google is making sharing that with the publishers. I think no one I think could stipulate Google makes a lot of money.  They're very profitable. They're willing.  So does Rupert Murdoch. They don't. I'm sure they don't like it, but they're willing to say let's bury the hatchet here.  Have to have a pile of money.  Maybe and maybe Rupert gave them some. OK, maybe we'll do some joint development deals.  It sounds like that, according to the article, the sub that might benefit you as well and might benefit the open open net as well.  I think this is another problem I have. So you go ahead. You can do the next one if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm not going to. They were trying to rush me here. Oh, geez.  Oh, dear. Go ahead. So so.  So the other problem is this. And this is this is my routine as far as I'm going to be political here for a moment.  Pardon me. But as far as I am concerned, my opinion, not Leo's, not everybody else's.  My opinion is Rupert Murdoch ruined this country and my family and others.  And this is the time when journalists should be so what you really had about is Fox News.  That's part of it here, because because if you go to Sky News Australia, it is worse than Fox News.  Yeah, yeah. Murdoch and Murdoch. And so he's infecting them.  He's a good business man. He's also going into you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You stimulate the amygdala. Somebody in the chat room said you get lots of views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, that's that's that's it's worse than that. He created.  Do you think actually? And let me finish my point. Let me finish my point.  Let me finish my point real quickly. At the time when I think we in journalism should be making decisions and clean our own house.  We tell Facebook and Google all the time and Twitter, you clean your house.  We haven't cleaned our own journalism. So I want to bring journalists together and say, what do we say about Fox News?  What do we say about Breitbart? What do we say about these places?  Do we have standards or not? And if we do, we try to go to Google and say, you know, today when Rush Limbaugh died,  the number one story on Google News was Fox News is pay on to him.  Is that necessarily the best thing for them to do? Let's have that discussion.  Well, now we're not going to have that discussion because Google's paying Fox for this content.  And if we ever said that we got to a point where Fox got so bad that we said you should take Fox off, how do we have that discussion now?  How do we have that? And and so what happened here, what really upset me was the Guardian,  which went to Australia to be the Guardian angel against Murdoch and raised money for that purpose to be an alternative to Murdoch.  They played along with Murdoch in this case for their cynical money.  I'm profoundly disappointed and probably ruined my relationship with the rest of my life by saying this, but I'm terribly disappointed in them for doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you say Google News, you mean news.google.com? Is that what you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That that case? Yes. Of course, this discussion is more than Google News.  So that's not what I'm getting. I'm getting content anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not what I'm getting. I'm getting Los Angeles Times is the first article.  Then when I went to full coverage, it was earlier today.  LA Times, Fox News, Washington Post, CNN. I'm then getting.  This is hours ago. OK. I'm going to see the New York Times.  All right. But is it your is it your assertion that because Murdoch gave them money that Fox News appeared first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, it's my assertion that if we try to have a discussion with with them about maybe Fox News shouldn't be promoted, that's kind of that's what they detoured around that.  We can't really have that discussion now. Yeah.  They have endorsed Fox News. They have endorsed Murdoch's outlets by deciding to pay them.  And here's the other thing. Then you can go on the next one.  The irony of all this regulation, the paradox of all this regulation, is that every time they try to take power away from the platforms, they get more.  Talk about this before. Right to be forgotten. Google decides what we remember.  That's DG in Germany. Facebook decides what is hate or not legally.  Now, Google's in a position where they decide which news organizations to anoint with money and which ones not to under this legislation.  And so that puts them in a position of a much more power.  And my fear is that it's going to be a lot harder for any any startup, any wacky little site to get going here and get any of this benefit from the news showcase, from the promotion and traffic there or the money or anything else.  And so Murdoch won either way. If Google had left, he's got all the brands. He's fine.  He stays. They stay. He got a bunch of money and he gets to say, yeah, yeah.  And either way, that grates the hell out of me. That's all. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got it. We'll have more with the Jeff Jarvis show in just a moment, but we're going to take a break and then it's actually going to be the cured at all.  I don't think he cared at all. Not a bit. You know, it's just a very neutral observer.  And then I do want to talk about Snow Cone with Stacey, who's freezing.  But first a word from Linode. I love Linode. Managing your complex cloud infrastructure should not be hard.  It isn't with Linode. In fact, I've been a Linode user for I want to say a decade. I don't know if they've been around that long.  I remember I first became aware of Linode because, well, it's Linux hosting, which is awesome. Love that.  Linode makes cloud computing available to everyone.  Simplify your cloud infrastructure with Linode's Linux virtual machines and you'll be developed, deploying and scaling your modern applications faster and easier.  Eight hundred thousand developers use Linode for a number of reasons.  I picked them because they were fast and inexpensive, but a lot of people say the intuitive cloud manager and the full featured API is a feature they're looking for.  Linode has data centers all over the world. And the beauty part is you don't pay more or less for any one of them.  It's a simple, consistent pricing, regardless of location.  Just choose the data center closest to you and you're good to go or closest to your customers if you want.  The support from Linode is great. They're geeks like us and they don't care if you've got a big plan or a little plan.  They they care about getting the job done 24 7, 365 days a year.  No handoffs, no tears. You will immediately get somebody who can help you, who can who can get the job done.  So think of what you could do with leading price performance Linode.  I mean, look at look at comparisons. You can host your website, build an app.  I actually that's kind of what I do. I'm not an app developer, but I am a hobbyist.  And having a server or two or three or four on Linode makes it very easy for me to try stuff, to host my my password vault, for instance, things like that.  You could store a backup media. You can launch and enrich your developer applications, hosted services, web sites, AI and machine learning workloads,  gaming services or CI CD environments, launch and scale in the cloud with their virtual machines.  You could choose shared or dedicated compute instances.  And we're going to give you a hundred dollar credit, which you could even use on S3 compatible objects storage or managed Kubernetes.  You get the idea. Really anything you want to do, you can do at Linode.  Linode also is a great as I think this is kind of the open source model.  They share what they know. They share information. They have a fabulous free YouTube channel.  There's lots of video tutorials, security tips, just good stuff at YouTube dot com slash Linode.  L I N O D E. Take a look at the testimonials at Linode dot com.  Bryce Adams from Meteoric, for instance, from the start.  This is the quote. We were looking for a partner, not a provider.

Actually, before can before we talk a snow cone, I kind of want to talk about a few short things.  I kind of want to talk about a few short things.  There's some there's some future news.  He has things to say about that too. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have a lot of to say, but yes, tell us about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Google, according to nine to five, Google's proposing a way.  Fuchsia is their next generation operating system, which they recently open sourced and asked for contributors.  They are proposing a way for future to run Android and Linux apps natively.  So fuchsia is not Linux.  But wouldn't it be cool if you had an operating system that could run unmodified Android and Linux apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sounds to me running a shell of of no VM.  No, no, no, no. Natively to. Yeah. No, V.M. Yeah. No. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's all doing this natively.  And I think this is really cool because it's really interesting.  And I'm sorry, it's interesting for the IOT because a lot of IOT devices, they either run Linux or they run Android.  And there are pros and cons to doing each.  So but I don't know how it does it.  And that's what I was curious about. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this would be star next for a tiny, tiny, tiny group of people.  Even though we have all of this IOT stuff out there, having Linux capability running on your phone, I don't know how well that's going to make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Other way around. So imagine instead of buying a Chromebook, which runs Chrome OS and you can get Linux running on Chrome OS and you can get Android apps.  But instead of doing that, running some new computing device running fuchsia, not a phone, but it can run your phone's apps and it can run Linux apps.  And you're probably right. This is not an I don't know what Google's intent.  It's not consumer. But it's not an end user thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But cars, a lot of cars pulled in Android and like built things on Android.  A lot of appliance makers use it. Medical device makers are looking at it instead of Windows.  So so wait, this there's a whole generation of computing that's going to be coming online that needs an OS that can last for a long time that can that has popular support, but isn't like as proprietary as Windows, if that makes sense.  And this this sounds really compelling.  Maybe I mean, and the other thing is they've been building this. I mean, we first heard about fusion like 2011.  Is that right? It was a long time ago.  Long.  Wow. Maybe not that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is the other thing I think is important and interesting is this is one of the first contributions since Google opened up fuchsia to the general populace.  So this is a Google source.com.  And by the way, this is merely a proposal.  You know, here's the document.  This document proposes a mechanism for running unmodified Linux programs on fuchsia.  They're running a user space process whose system interface is compatible with the Linux ABI.  So it doesn't use the Linux kernel.  It's it implements the interface in the star NICs, which you mentioned star NICs, which is a compatibility layer.  So it's not emulation, but it is a translation layer, maybe more like wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's some sort of abstraction in there.  And I don't know.  And by the way, Jeff, you're right.  It was 2016 that we first heard about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, but the fact I think I think it's I think it's mostly I find this interesting because we're starting to see ideas come in from outside of Google.  This is this is I'm really curious what Google's intention is with this.  And they've said I mean, they did an interview.  What did they say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They said a couple of years ago, like in 2019, one of the people working on this said that they envision fuchsia for devices that are not phones or laptops.  So for everything else.  So that was the thinking there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that could be a car could be an IoT device.  It could be your.  Yeah.  And remember, they could I.  That's right.  And we talked last week about Google doing a deal with Ford for Android Automotive.  But maybe that's also what this would be.  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So so back in the day, you know, very early days of the web, I remember when Java came out and wow, you could run this application on various OS's right through the web.  This is this is like the inverse of that.  Here's an OS that could run applications from any number of other OS's right.  So it becomes it tries.  Does it try to become kind of a universal OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's mostly a bridge to solve the obvious problem of any new operating system, which is it has no apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, OK, I think it's more like but it but isn't it even but it sounds more fundamental than that.  It sounds like it could be.  It's like wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, when Linux, I think one of the reasons wine existed is because people said, well, I'm not going to use Linux unless I can run Microsoft Office.  And so wine was designed to scratch that itch.  And I think it's it's it is kind of a carrot or chicken and egg problem with any new operating system.  So what by the way, whether Starnix will happen is, you know, right.  This is this is just an idea.  This isn't even a code sample.  So I'm more interested in the fact.  Well, the two things one is because it does point us a little bit in a direction of what they might be doing with Fuchsia.  But also just that we're starting to see now because it's open a little more Fuchsia activity, which I'm glad to see.  We you know, it's always bugged me that we've kind of said, OK, there's you know, we've got we've got maybe four operating systems.  There's Windows, there's Mac, there's iOS, there's Android.  OK, there's four and then there's Linux and BSD.  So there's six. But there's no room for anymore.  The last operating system that had a shot at being commercial was BOS almost 30 years ago.  And then when Apple decided not to use BOS, but instead next step for their Macintosh is that was the end of BOS.  And it was those of us who liked BOS were really impressed with BOS.  It was really, really cool.  I'd love to see another look at a modern operating system.  I mean, there's things you would do differently now, particularly designed for security that, you know, in a more modern world, we have we have new newer needs.  Lots of and I presume future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What Apple is trying to do now?  Isn't that what Apple is trying to do now with its bit of a synergy between Mac OS and iPad OS and so forth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, when they announced iOS, when the iPhone was announced, it was they said it's really the OS 10 kernel in a phone operating system.  I think there's more in common between iOS and Mac OS under the hood.  I think you could almost say there's one iOS from Apple designed for different platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is there a legal issue these days? I'm going back to my early days as well.  So let's say that let's say that this also works with Mac OS just for the heck of it.  Is that is that if it doesn't use any Mac core logic, but it's still able to be compatible, is that a problem with copyright or trademark or patents or anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure Apple's lawyers will find a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, remember the Google Oracle debate was sort of over that whether Google could make a Java clone not by taking any of the code, but by just duplicating the interface, the API.  That's still to be determined, right? They haven't still not determined. Yeah, they haven't ruled on that yet, but it doesn't look good, to be honest with you.  I don't know. That's an interesting question.  Wine on Linux works not by putting any Windows code on Linux, but just by responding to Windows system calls in the way Windows would.  So when I and it has a bit of a tweaking for every app, but when an app is running under Wine, it's it's thinks it's running under Windows.  It's really running on Linux. And anytime it makes a Windows call, Wine intercepts it and says, oh, yeah, here, you want to open a window?  Okay, here. And that's, I think, an interesting way to work.  I don't know what the Oracle Google judgment would have, would have how that would affect Wine, because Wine is kind of doing the same thing.  It's it's it's imitating Windows APIs.  It's actually really more in imitating system calls.  So but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It becomes a different architectural world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember you said a few minutes ago with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you're a little latent.  And I don't mean anything bad by that.  But go ahead.  Keep freezing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead. Ask your question.  You said that Wine was sort of the way to scratch the itch for the folks in Linux.  And I don't know if it even scratched that itch.  I mean, granted, it could open a few things here and there, but just how functional was it to be able to get day to day done without jumping through a gazillion hoops of Wine in the configuration?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hated it. Yeah, I think it was a transitional technology.  And it is now not as important because there's Libre Office and there's all sorts of I mean, I think almost anything you want to do.  Linux has a great open source alternative to.  So did you try to run on time? Yeah, it took a long time, though.  Yeah. Did you did you did you try to run Photoshop on Linux?  Is that what you were doing? A Lightroom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I didn't try Photoshop.  Yeah, didn't try Photoshop. I remember just trying to fight with spreadsheet.  Oh, yeah, it was hard. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't think it's as important as it used to be.  Honestly, I think I don't ever feel like I can't do anything I want to do in Linux.  Probably in many cases better than I could do it on Windows.  But I'm a little bit biased in that regard.  All right. Let's talk about Snow Cone,  which is not necessarily the name of Android 12, but it is the right letter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I thought they decided it was Snow Cone. Did they announce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you decided Snow Cone. What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is what they say on XDA developers.  Google has ditched the desert themed names ever since Android 10 was released.  While the next version of Android has not been confirmed for its name yet, it's just numbers and logic at this stage.  However, with that being said, Google still continues to use the desert themed names in its internal code base.  Android 10 was sneakily called Quint-Tart.  Android 11 was Red Velvet Cake. But you never heard that in public, right? It was just internally.  And it's not clear if it's Snow Cone, but apparently XDA developers has found some evidence. Let me see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google, how can you rob the fun from us? Was that nice, Google? Was that nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of the development branches, XDA developers say, are prefaced with SC.  It was last time RVC for Red Velvet Cake. SC could be other things.  Anything else?  Shortcake.  Oh, yeah.  But XDA seems convinced it's probably Snow Cone. Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Strawberry cake?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Strawberry cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stretch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So anyway.  Sugar cookie.  Sugar cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, there's a winner. Yeah, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If one needs dessert names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can come up more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give us more. Give us more.  So there is a lot of information XDA developers about Android 12.  I feel bad. I don't care about Android anymore.  About what?  I really don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm right there with you.  When I saw that this information was announced or leaked or whatever, it didn't really excite me anymore because I don't know how much more innovation can be done.  Wait.  Wait a minute.  Wait. Wait.  So Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's just another notification that people are going to ignore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People are just going to ignore those notifications, wipe them away.  It's visual on screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's on your home screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it kind of Apple style privacy?  Let's see.  Let me find it.  Privacy indicators.  Here they are.  Here they are.  Privacy indicators and privacy setting changes.  The screenshots below show what looks like privacy indicators.  Users could receive a warning in the status bar.  See up at the top here, the little green thing.  I can't quite see it.  I guess that the microphone is on and maybe that's a camera on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you can then, according to XDA developers, tap it and it would tell you which apps are using the camera or microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Leo, can I try to answer your point about Android?  I think given this and the conversation we just had, I think it's operating systems you don't care about.  I care a lot about operating systems.  No, I care a lot about operating systems.  No, but what's really new?  They kind of work.  It's like the phones themselves are commodified now.  It's not a big deal.  We used to care a lot about these changes and new capabilities.  We really don't.  They're minor things that can be added any time.  The fact that they get added with the new OS, who cares?  That's where I am.  That's the OS that's gotten boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's where I am.  It's not much that we can do right now from an innovation standpoint that's going to impress me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, wait, y'all.  It seems...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hold on.  Stacey's found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no.  Bring it.  We're in this really cool area where we're shifting from just phones and computers to computers everywhere.  We're going to actually have a whole bunch of cool new operating systems.  Or maybe a bunch.  For computing at the edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  For computing at the edge.  For future, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's whole different areas.  If you're thinking about this, you've got to think about things like something that's  flexible enough to scale up and down for memory requirements.  You've got to think about power consumption, how to draw things back and down.  You also have to think about longevity of the devices.  A computer and a phone only last for five years.  Sure.  There's actually...  Then when you think about security, you've also got to have a cloud connection, but you  also have security on the device and some sort of tokenization that helps.  Or PKI, basically, that's going to give you a token that you check in the cloud and everything.  I know, Jeff, but it's going to get exciting soon.  I think Fuchsia's possibly a part of that.  I don't know.  Those are the things I'm looking for in these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or what I'm trying to say is, Fuchsia commodifies all the OSs if it can operate apps from multiple  OSs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually not what's bothering me about Android, and it's the same thing bothering  me about Chrome, which is not an OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Watch it, fella.  Watch it.  Watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I stopped using both because Google is an advertising company.  While Apple has said, look, we're going to give you app tracking information, and we're  going to let you know what's going on privacy-wise, I think Google's commitment to that in both  Chrome and Android has really been lagging.  Honestly, I don't have a problem with it.  It's not like there aren't at least as good solutions, if not better solutions, out there.  Just as I don't feel the need to use Facebook, I don't feel the need to use Chrome or Android  anymore because honestly, I think that I don't trust them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Van Boyen.  That's fair.  I would say I would like to see more effort from Google to make these phones a little  bit more useful when you travel internationally because it seems like whenever I speak to  people that travel internationally, the last thing they want to take is an Android device  because of the security.  That's not true for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, for security reasons, yeah.  But I always use Google Fi or T-Mobile on an Android phone traveling because it's the  most compatible solution.  Yes, but you're right.  From the point of view of security, I think that's what matters because I'm an iPhone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  really kind of matters.  I'm sure I'll be online if I was internationally traveling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess I can use Fi on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should travel with a burner phone with nothing on your device.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And really the risk, the privacy issue is not when you're, and security issue maybe  even is not when you're overseas, it's when you're crossing the border, the American border.  That's the real, there's the risk right there.  I don't know, I'm willing to be talked off this ledge, but I don't feel like Google's  commitment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, you're not.  Oh, no, you're not.  You like being on that ledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you don't want to talk me off the ledge, I'll stay up here.  But I feel like Google's commitment to privacy is half-hearted.  No.  And I'm not alone, by the way.  Apple's is accidental.  Apple's is accidental.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's accidental, but it is.  Apple's is accidental, but it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's marketing the hell out of it.  And I would also, and it's doubling down on it in as much as it can.  I do think people are, I mean, Kevin has dumped all his Google stuff and went over to Apple  and I never thought I'd see that day.  So.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he's just trying to de-Google-fy his phones and everything.  Even the Android phones he tried to de-Google-fy.  It's kind of the same for me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He dumped his Android phones.  He was running a weird something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, I am not happy with Apple's walled garden approach and its ecosystem approach.  I think that that's exactly the wrong thing.  I'm much more in favor of open stuff, but it does work better.  And.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You just want to use Clubhouse, I know.  Oh, there it is.  It's all about Clubhouse.  I was waiting for that.  You know.  It's all about Clubhouse, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I put Clubhouse, I got inundated by people like, why aren't you on Clubhouse?  They said you weren't on Clubhouse.  I put it on my iPad Mini and I still haven't done one, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Clubhouse is just the latest flavor.  I'm all over Pinterest now.  That's my new thing.  It's back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pinterest has never left.  I mean, I sit there, our house designer, when we were doing our renovations.  I mean, and these were like boring renovations.  Like the most exciting thing was replacing the floors, but the rest of it was like, hey, this bathroom toilet is falling apart.  You know, he's like, just put a bunch of the toilets you like on Pinterest.  And I'm like, yeah, toilets.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, it's a big deal.  My daughter loves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pinboard.  It's like a pinboard, sort of.  But it's it's or as we were talking about on Windows Weekly earlier, the reason it came up on Windows Weekly is because there's a Financial Times published an article saying that Microsoft was interested in  purchasing Pinterest for stand back, sit down, watch out.  Here it comes.  Fifty five zero billion dollars.  Dear God.  Which is an astounding figure.  Microsoft, you still wouldn't be cool.  I don't think they want to be cool.  It puzzled me at first.  And then I thought about it.  Pinterest is two things that Microsoft would love.  First of all, like Instagram, it's an ad magnet.  Because when you're when you're scrolling through these, some of these tiles are contributed by people.  But some of them are ads and they look exactly like it is hard.  It's hard to tell.  Just like Instagram.  And you're in there.  And because the second part of Pinterest is you basically on Pinterest, you just put stuff you're interested in.  And yeah, I was buying toilets stuff.  So you told you told Pinterest, I want to buy these toilets.  Given a signal.  Big signal.  Big signal.  And so I love it because my Pinterest is full of food recipes and diet advertisements.  So it works.  Works so well together.  It's a perfect blend of all the things.  So I could see I don't know if it's worth 50 billion dollars.  That's kind of a mind boggling number.  Given that Instagram was one billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think the numbers really mean anything anymore.  I mean, hey, look at their I'm sure that wasn't in cash.  I'm sure there was a large component in stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, well, and even WhatsApp, which was a very good purchase for Facebook, was only 22 billion.  And at the time we were like bowled over by that number.  This is more than twice that.  It's more than Microsoft paid for Nokia.  It's much.  It's more than Microsoft paid for LinkedIn.  Much.  It's more than Microsoft paid for Gita.  It's an astounding number.  By the way, the latest is apparently that those negotiations are not currently active.  But I think the Financial Times is probably a good source for this kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So meanwhile, I don't even know the demographic of Pinterest anymore.  You know, back in the days you would pull up an app and they'd say, hey, everybody's using it is between 18 and 30 or something like that.  And women.  And lots of women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the tech industry made so much fun of it.  Part of like very early on, there was a lot of denigration of pictures.  And I'm like, oh, it was actually something new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I follow Trey Ratcliffe on here.  He has a board of his favorite travel photos.  I mean, it's, you know, it's, it's got lots of good stuff on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of like an account.  And I don't remember the last time I used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, here are here, but I might get back into it.  I'm going to try it again.  It's there.  It's funny.  I haven't.  Or I could I could promote my wellness ritual.  There you go.  Do you have one?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you kidding me?  Yes, he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Eat casual hippie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But every other week, every other week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right, Stacey.  I'm good about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I said I was concerned about you, I was much relieved to hear that.  So my parents have power now.  Woohoo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they in Houston or Austin?  Are they in Houston?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're in Houston.  Houston.  Houston.  And my brother, who is outside of Houston in like a very not awesome area, he also got  power.  Oh, good.  So, yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's great news.  Did they lose water at any point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they're under a boil water notice, but I'm less worried about that because they  have lots of water.  And my parents, you know, they're I know that they don't think they have.  They prefer gin.  Right?  They're older.  No, they prefer single malt, single barrels.  Single something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Single malt.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Chromebooks, Jeff, outsold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just as you were dismissing them with Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Outsold Macintoshes worldwide in 2020.  Macintosh fanboy, take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that makes sense.  Mr. Jarvis, come on, don't don't don't gloat over this.  I mean, we're in a pandemic where people are not making any money.  They're going for the cheapest thing that they can find.  Yes.  Just to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they're discovering how wonderful it is.  And I don't think they care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All they want to know is can this thing get on Zoom?  Yes or no.  This thing get on Hangouts.  Yes or no.  Done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of kids, a lot of students.  You know, people realized if we've got a lot of businesses, too, I think businesses, you

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  think doing Chromebooks.  I think so just because people had, you know, they had the desktop at the office or they  had their office machine or whatever.  I think I think there was some of that, too.  I saw a lot of talk about I need 20 machines suddenly.  IDC.  Small business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  IDC, which includes desktops, laptops and workstations worldwide market share dropping  from Microsoft from about 90 percent to 75 kind of flat to dropping for Mac OS.  That's the green bar, the purple bar.  Nice steady growth for Chrome OS.  I mean, it's still under 25 percent, but it's good growth.  Windows is still 87.5 percent market share.  Mac OS 5.8.  This is in Q1 2020.  This is a year ago.  Chrome OS captured 5.3 in Q2.  Windows fell 81.  Mac OS grew to seven.  Chrome OS jumped to 10.  Q3 and Q4 of last year.  Windows dropped further to 79 percent for Q3, then 77 percent for Q4.  Mac OS grew for Q3, then back down for Q4, possibly because they had new chips coming out.  Might have slowed down the sales.  While Chrome OS had 11.5 percent for Q3 and a 14.4 percent share in Q4.  So big, big year for Chromebook.  And not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not a surprise.  Can I just gloat a little bit?  People made fun of me when I sat down on the keyboard.  And they thought I was ridiculous.  And they thought, oh, this thing won't last.  I'm not a radio.  And I've been on it for like five years and I've been happy.  Can I gloat a little bit that I'm not alone anymore, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So five years means that it has lasted, is what you're saying?  That's longevity to you, five years?  Well, it's not that old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's only about five years old, uncle, aunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, we just said that most phones aren't any good for about...  What do you want, the 30-year-old OS?  Most phones aren't any good for like 40 years or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, you really want to hurt Google.  Fine them 1.1 million euros and see them yelp.  That's like the interest from one second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's like when, I don't know, someone comes up to me and like asks for a dollar.  You don't even want that back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You're just like, yeah, take the dollar.  I'm not going to bend over to pick up that nickel.  It's not worth it.  Google Ireland and Google France have agreed to pay a stunning $1.34 million fine  after a probe found that Google's hotel rankings could be misleading for consumers.  Do you think the French are blackmailing Google, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they're just French.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That look on his face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Honestly, why even bother?  Do you think that's statutorily said?  Like that was the most they could ask for.  And Stacey is like me going, Stacey, I don't like you.  Give me a dollar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say it's like, hey, I'm short a little bit for the tip.  Do you have a buck?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure.  Take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're just, you went straight to, I don't like you.  Okay.  Okay.  Sorry.  I am never going to San Francisco again.  Waymo has just begun robo taxi tests in San Francisco.  It's terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a great time for robots.  Actually, I would think there's.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cause you don't want to get a car in a car with an Uber driver, do you?  That's actually a good point.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  So less traffic, no germs.  Jaguar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  That'd be nice to Jag.  Jag?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that a Jag?  Is that an I-Pace?  Let's see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're driving.  Well, it's either a Chrysler Pacifica or an I-Pace.  I think it's an I-Pace.  That doesn't look like a Chrysler Pacifica.  The I-Pace is not the Jaguar you're thinking of.  By the way, Jaguar has decided not to make the XKE or whatever its modern equivalent  is electric yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aw.  Aw.  I would like a fancy.  I would buy that so fast.  What's it called?  A fancy fast electric car that is like my Tesla, but maybe a little not like my Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I want, but I can't afford it.  I just got my Ford Mach-E last night and it's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh.  Holy jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what I would have.  I saw it when I left the studio today.  Isn't it pretty?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's pretty.  What I actually want, Stacey, and if I had your money, I would buy is the Audi e-tron  GT.  Yes.  Is that a beautiful car?  Yes.  You bought a good Audi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't looked at cars.  It's only a hundred thou.  But it's the same platform as the Porsche Taycan, so it's a nice speedy drive, but it  is like kind of a luxury.  Oh, that's so pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I can buy it, I buy all my cars used.  I won't buy a new car.  Well, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Next year you're going to use one of these because the rich people buy these.  They don't want to drive it for more than a year.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think the taillights are stupid looking.  Oh, it's all dusty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Muffy, buy another one.  Yeah, you're right.  I don't like the taillights.  I think you would actually like the Mach-E, but you won't be able to get a used one yet.  I just got a new one.  So you have to wait a year or two for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's okay.  I'm patient.  I don't really drive that many pieces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think now from this is the back view of those lights, of the rear lights?  Oh, they're better in the back.  Yeah, that's not so bad.  It's very Audi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The arrows were just kind of gimmicky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The inside looks nice.  I like the red.  It looks pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Red accents.  How does your new car drive, Leo?  Beautifully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Beautifully.  It has...  You know, I had a Tesla with not ludicrous, not the highest acceleration, the insane it  was called mode.  But in order to do the insane mode, you have to stop the car, push both the brake and the  accelerator all the way, wait a second, and then suddenly release them.  And then it launches you forward.  I used to take people on rides, but I realized I was getting, I was almost running out.  I was getting lightheaded from the acceleration and I thought this is not safe.  So I stopped doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A friend of mine took me on ludicrous speed and that is not actually a speed for humans.  It's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's dangerous.  It's dangerous.  So the normal acceleration and pepiness of a Model X or a Model S in Stacey's case, it  absolutely does that.  When you put your pedal to the metal, it goes...  And it has little propulsion sounds that make it, depending on...  You have three settings.  Depending on how aggressive the setting is, it can sound like an actual Mustang.  They actually pipe audio into the cab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could turn that off.  It's very comfy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was silent.  Yeah, I like that.  Not so silent, I killed squirrels.  No, no, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is where I think Ford has a little edge over Tesla because they've been making cars  for a while.  The cabin is very quiet, much more quiet than my Tesla was.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tesla's rattly and...  Does it have cup holders in the back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does.  Many...  It has cup holders.  This is weird.  It has cup holders in the frunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For your body that you're storing there?  No, I realized...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Allegedly?  This was a late addition to this design.  The frunk like you have in your S, because there's no engine.  There's a front trunk, aka a frunk, that's small, but you could put three grocery bags  in there or whatever.  You could also put a body in there.  I realize what happened is there's a law that requires that if you do have a space like  that, there should be an internal emergency release so that if somebody's in there, they  can get out.  Sure.  The Ford doesn't have that.  So as a last minute fix, they put dividers in there and a drain so you could fill it  with ice.  It's got a drain so the ice will melt and drain out.  It's for tailgating.  Tailgating.  And it has cup holders.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're going to take you to town.  Wine and beer can holders, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, some holders.  And I think the point of it is you can't put a body in there anymore because dividers make  it so you can't fit, unless it's a small body.  Smaller body.  You could put a very small body in there.  And actually the ice might be handy in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We stored Christmas presents in the frunk.  It was actually brilliant because I forgot the frunk existed and I'm notorious for  pirating through all my presents.  So, yeah.  See, Andrew is smart.  He could have like spent the frunk.  It worked for like two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Oh, you figured it out now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, only because I went to store Anna's Christmas presents in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder where they're doing this testing in San Francisco.  I know they've made a couple of infrastructure changes in San Francisco as far as some streets  are not drivable anymore.  They're only for pedestrians walking around.  I wonder what's been gated off to do this testing and what type of testing are they  doing to really push the limits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the things they've done, they've optimized, Waymo's optimized the, what they call Waymo  Driver, the self-driving software for San Francisco.  It has additional cameras to spot jaywalkers because anybody who's driven in San Francisco  knows people just wander into the street willy-nilly.  Yep.  If the driver, the automated thing, pulls up to a bus by a crosswalk, it will presume  that there's a bus, there's a crosswalk, people will be walking there.  If it's driving on a street with road work, it understands the traffic codes, cones and  signs are meant to guide it out of the usual lane.  So they've spiffed it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What about some of those Pacific Heights hills?  Wow.  Ooh.  Where you can't see over the hill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe it can because remember, these things have big stacks on the top with, you  can see it here with lidars.  They would probably do a better job than I would sitting on the driver's seat of seeing  over that hill.  Yeah.  Waymo's one of the few companies with a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission,  which allows them to provide passenger service.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it doesn't say...  Oh, you pay, I wonder.  Yeah.  It doesn't say where they drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't remember if it was the last CES you and I attended or if it was one prior to that,  but I was in Vegas down on the old side of Vegas near Fremont and all of that.  And I saw a couple of the cars just zipping around down there and I assumed they were  testing it.  I'm thinking...  They were, yeah.  It's a pretty good idea.  Instead of doing it out in the middle of the desert, in the middle of nowhere, you need  some obstacles around and you need a few people out there.  Hopefully they don't get hurt or injured when you're testing, but it's nice to have them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And remember, the Phoenix area where most of these companies have been testing it, Uber  hit a pedestrian a few years ago.  So this is the first expansion of Waymo past the Phoenix metropolitan area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder how Waymo doesn't fall again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, probably better than you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People are terrible in fog, but yeah.  Lidar is actually...  Well, I'm trying to think.  How much the laser would bounce off of water particles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In Waymo's recent disengagement report, this is a report all self-driving companies put  out, disengagement means a safety driver had to take over and the DMV in California requires  that they submit this every year.  The company reported 21 disengagements over 629,000 miles of driving in California.  That's a very good rate of .033 per 1,000 miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you're in a Waymo cab, there's no driver and it disengages.  Does it like, does it just stop on the side of the road and you're in the back seat and  you wonder what happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It pauses.  One of the things people in the Phoenix area kept complaining about with the Uber self-driving  technology is there were a pain in the ass to drive behind because it was like driving  behind an extra cautious driver who just paused for everything.  I'm at a stop sign.  They didn't like that.  They would step on it, speed around them, honking, flipping them off, shooting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stacy, we were stepping over each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's okay.  I was saying that LIDAR actually, original LIDAR does not work well in fog, smoke or  snow, but there are advances in LIDAR that send out more pings and more directions and  they do better.  Multi-echo return LIDAR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I shall ask Sam Abul-Samad about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this article is from 2016.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take a little break.  More of the action coming up.  Stacy Higginbotham from stacyoniot.com, Jeff Jarvis, buzzermachine.com, and from Hands  On Photography, our very own Ant Pruitt.  Great to have all three of you.  Our show today brought to you by privacy.com.  Whenever I use a credit card on the Internet, every single time for the last three or four  years, I use a credit card generated just for that purpose by privacy.com.  By generating virtual numbers, privacy does a couple of things.  It masks your real bank information so your privacy is protected and it prevents fraud.  You could do two things with a privacy card.  You can make a burner card that can only be used once, can never be used again.  No problem handing that credit card number over to a merchant.  They're never going to be able to use it again.  Or you can create a credit card number that's tied to the merchant.  So I have one for Amazon, one for Audible.  One for Target, one for everybody I buy from online.  And even if that number leaked out in a breach or was stolen,  it could only be used by some employee.  It could only be used at that merchant's.  And of course with privacy, you get a lot of reporting, including all the declines.  So the minute you see a card misused, you know it's been stolen.  You can pause it, delete it, create a new one.  The pausing feature is great.  I always use privacy.com cards to subscribe online.  Because you know how it is with subscriptions.  You get charged every month.  Sometimes you forget or they make it hard to cancel.  I just look through my privacy cards and pause any card I don't want to continue.  And they can't use it.  You can control your subscriptions and recurring payments.  So you're never accidentally billed twice.  You're never upgraded to another service without your consent.  You can also set a spending limit with the service.  So I know that subscription is $50 a year.  I could set it to $50.  They can't overcharge you.  And I wish I had this when I signed up for a gym membership about five years ago.  I canceled the gym membership, but they kept charging me for training for six months.  When I finally got around to calling the credit card company, they said,  we can only turn it around for three months.  So you're out of luck.  Had I used privacy?  No problem.  I just paused the privacy card.  No jumping through difficult customer service.  They just block the charges.  They'll also, of course, notify you if someone tries to charge over the allotted amount.  So you always stay within your budget.  It's easy to use.  You can go to the web page, privacy.com.  But there's also a Chrome and Firefox extension.  There's an app for iOS and Android.  The Firefox and Chrome extensions will fill out the credit card information automatically with one click.  You can easily share cards.  I buy my mom dinner because she's 88 and she's a little girl.  She's 88 and she doesn't like to cook anymore.  So I sent her a privacy.com card so she could use DoorDash whenever she wants.  You know, it's tied to DoorDash on first use.  The minute she uses it, it can only be used for DoorDash.  And I didn't have to email it to her or send her a screenshot or a text message that she had to fill in.  I just clicked the share button when I created the card.  I entered the email address.  Privacy handled the rest.  You'll love the account summaries.  Last year at tax time, it was very easy for me to put together all the information.  I had to put together all of my charges.  And by the way, it's nice.  You'll always know how much you've been spending any given month.  There's a summary page good for budgeting.  It can filter by date, by how much you've spent.  No need to guess where your money's going.  So let me explain how this works.  You tie it to your bank account or your debit card.  It's not a charge card.  You don't run a balance, which frankly I kind of like.  I just use it.  It gets debited out of my account.  That's that.  So it's kind of like writing a check.  But it's completely private.  It's amazing.  So it also preserves privacy.  Protect your financial identity online.  Protect your money online with virtual cards from privacy.com.  Go to privacy.com slash twig.  Privacy.com slash twig.  There's a free tier.  I actually, just a little pro tip.  There's three different tiers.  I use the first tier.  I use the first tier.  I use the first tier.  I use the free tier for a long time.  And then I realize if I pay ten bucks a month for the next tier up, I get one percent cash back.  And given that I use privacy so much, I make money on that one easily.  The ten dollars a month.  What?  You didn't know about this?  No, I didn't know that.  Go look at the pricing page.  Wait a minute.  That's a pro tip.  See, I'm telling you.  A little pro tip.  So the personal, which is probably all anybody needs is free.  You get one percent cash back.  And since I usually get fifty or sixty bucks a month back,  that ten bucks is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's well spent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's also a teams plan for people who have businesses  and want to create cards for all their employees and that kind of thing.  Privacy.com slash twig.  And I won't even charge you for the pro tip.  You get five bucks to spend on your first purchase.  Thank you, privacy.  I've been using them for long before they started advertising for years  and I just think it's the absolute best way to go.  Used to be credit cards.  Discover used to do this.  Myamex used to do this.  We would generate one time use numbers.  They all stopped doing that for some reason.  But even then, the way privacy does it is ten times better, in my opinion.  Privacy.com slash twig.  Okay.  I promised Jeff I would never utter the word Facebook on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  What you promised was you wouldn't bait me to try to piss me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One man's bait is another man's poison.  Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm fine to talk about Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook pulled the news feed out of Australia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, no, no.  It pulled news out of the news feed.  Oh, I misunderstood that.  Because they would be forced to pay for links to news, they said,  okay, then neither news organizations nor users may link to news in Facebook.  And it already is happening.  It'll put up a box.  I bet that makes Facebook better in Australia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I might move to Australia now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  So there's two interpretations I have.  The nice interpretation is Facebook stood on principles in favor of the link.  I could argue that for a while.  Not very long, but a little while.  The cynical...  Wait a minute.  Stacey's eating waffles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is not okay.  Did you bring enough for the whole podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I muted my mic and everything.  Yeah, but I happen to look...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are they sweet or savory?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They look savory.  Okay.  They look good.  The

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here you go.  Stila.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I think we should have a little theme song.  Now is the time when we strewp waffle on twig.  And we have a little song. We all have a strewp waffle.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Waffle dance.  Waffle, waffle, waffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Waffle, waffle, waffle.  Or you could hashtag waffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yesterday was Shrove Tuesday, which was pancake day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? That's so cool.  That's right. And then that means a Carnaval is next week.  Not happening because...  Today's Ash Wednesday, so...  Lent.  Oh.  Do you have to give up Carmel waffles for a lent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am not Catholic or a lent person, so I don't have to give up anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Waffle dance. Waffle, waffle, waffle.  Okay, Jeff, go ahead.  So, see, this is a problem with calling it...  So the cynical approach.  It's the problem with calling it the news feed.  That's what confused me.  Exactly.  The news feed isn't news of newspaper news.  It's news to you and your friends and your family, but it's not news news.  Which is good.  It's got now the news.  I would like it if Facebook were just the family news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the cynical view is, all right, we're going to use this as an excuse.  We're going to revert to parties and puppies and getting laid.  That's what Facebook started as.  That's what it's back to. Parties, puppies, and getting lucky.  And so, screw the news.  News is a hassle.  News is controversial.  News causes us to hire moderators.  News gets us in trouble.  So fine, we're going to use little old Australia for a tiny little test brought on by Rupert Murdoch.  That's the cynical view, right?  And so, you know, I get it.  It may make for a nicer Facebook.  It makes for a nicer life for them.  But when your Uncle Joe comes in and has his disinformation,  you know, if you just took hydroxychloroquine, you wouldn't need vaccines.  And you want to say, no, Uncle Joe, let me show you this news story.  Oh, I can't do that.  Right.  And so who knows what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So but but won't this allow the likes of the news stations to thrive a little bit more because they'll be considered a little bit more reliable if you have to actually go there to get the news versus third party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Aren't you an optimist, Ant?  You think people are going to go there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw an optimistic devil's advocate today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, the people who think they're wrong on the Internet, they have time.  They will go and get the corresponding documentation to let you know, Uncle Joe, you're wrong.  And here's like six New York Times articles.  Here's one from, you know, the Wall Street Journal.  Yeah.  Believe me, they will let you know and they will go and get the information they need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And to answer your question, a guy named Leonardo Puglisi, who's the founder of Six News, a U, an independent and unbiased news outlet in Australia, tweeted today, Facebook is actually banning news.  I can't believe it.  That's pretty much a third of our viewers.  If this applies to Instagram, we're really done for.  Oh, bad.  Because that's how they find their audience.  Go back to earlier discussion about Google, if I'm allowed to, where the value exchange here is that Google sends you audience.  It's not it's not Google uses your content.  Same for Facebook.  The value exchange is these places get audience because, oh, that's interesting.  OK, I'll click and I'll go there.  Remember, in a world where you're the destination, the New York Times had to reduce the number that defined you as a frequent user, wherein you would hit the paywall from like 10 pages a month to five.  If you hit more than five pages a month, a month at the New York Haffey and Times, you were considered a frequent user.  So no, I'm afraid your optimism is charming, but probably too optimistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah.  He, by the way, he just said, OK, doesn't apply to Instagram, I think.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But honestly, who's responsible for that situation?  I mean, it's not Facebook's.  Well, the situation that taking news out of the news feed hurts a public news publisher.  It's not Facebook's responsibility to drive him traffic.  Maybe he shouldn't have built his business on Facebook.  Amen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but they got used this way by the well.  But here's the problem.  Yeah, you're right.  We publishers also should have provided the mechanism for people to talk about the news and share it outside of horrible, poisoned comments sections we didn't care about.  We should have created Nextdoor where you could meet your neighbors and talk about what's going on around.  But we didn't.  So people went to Facebook and Twitter and Google with the news.  And Facebook then, whether they wanted to or not, I don't think they ever wanted to, but they found themselves, they had a role in the news ecosystem of society.  And it is a question as to whether or not it's irresponsible to just drop that.  Now, they've got a perfect excuse.  Hey, we had to.  The Australian law.  Murdoch made us do it.  But, you know, I heard from in each of these cases, I heard after the fact, I got an email from PR people at each of the companies after they had done it.  Not before.  And I exchanged with the one at Facebook, kind of said, well, you know, I see two theories here.  And they said, yeah, we're watching that.  I don't think they know what to think inside Facebook either.  It's a it's a gutsy move.  I think there's a way they separate themselves from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot of options for these publishers now, though, with with not having that that vehicle market is spending a lot on marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  But marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where?  Let's say this was supplied to Facebook and Twitter as well.  So what's what's the vehicle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  TV billboards, all old mass media marketing mechanisms.  That's when people demonize targeting to this.  Hey, I found somebody in this neighborhood who's interested in sports or interested in cameras.  I can send them my camera section to this guy named Ant.  Oh, no, can't do that.  Right.  So how the heck did they find you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, all right.  Let me.  So this might lead into a more interesting area, which is how do you find?  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That wasn't interesting enough.  I have no believe me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anything to do with Facebook?  I'm interested in.  I think Facebook's a blight.  And I think it's I think it's a pathology.  Well, the reason you don't want me to talk about is because every time I talk about it, I say what a pathological thing Facebook is.  And it's a pathology on the part of the news media to depend on Facebook.  I believe in the question is exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How else do that?  This is where our media ecosystem is right now.  How else do they do it?  Well, so that's my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you OK, I don't use Facebook.  So here's what I do.  You can build on going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're going to tell us.  Go ahead. Sorry.  Here's what I do to get news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I go every morning.  I go to tech meme.  Now it's tech news, but there are I'm sure other sites like this.  And I also use a feed reader, an RSS reader, although I find tech meme because it has editorial judgment.  You know, a gay, Rivera and team pick the top news stories.  Then I and it's all it's all right here, by the way.  And then I go to Nuzle, which in the case of Nuzle is actually still it's aggregating Twitter stories.  But I don't have to see Twitter.  I don't even have to see the tweets.  I just see here.  I'll quickly log in through Twitter.  So you can see the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The problem is you don't see what someone says about it.  They could hate the thing they like to or they can.  That's not true.  You don't know. So so actually I take it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's the story, which, by the way, number one story changes to sharing and viewing news on Facebook in Australia.  And it's it's what's nice is this link is to the direct link to the Facebook post.  And here's John Battelle's thought about it.  OK, here's Kara Swisher's.  Here's Kevin Roos.  So these are these are this tends to be less tech, but this is a good source.  It is I like it because it is pulling from Twitter.  So it is crowd sourcing the stories.  But I don't it's not I don't have to go to Twitter so much.  Then I go to read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Twitter didn't exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If Twitter did well, this is not Twitter.  So then I go to read it and read it.  Of course, there's a lot of crap on Reddit.  But there's also you know, you choose what you see on Reddit because it's not algorithmic.  It gives you exactly what was in that subreddit.  So I choose the subreddits that I'm interested in, including, as you can see, the Mustang Machia.  Yeah, anyway.  And then so then I go to read it.  Then I go to another curated site that I really like.  This is Y Combinators Hacker News, which is a place where geeks post stories they're interested in.  And then it actually is really great because the comments are fantastically probably a lot smarter.  Very, very smart comments.  They have some of the Reddit slash Twitter problem, which is the comments often the first few comments or the highest ranked comments.  By the way, they're ranked, not chronological, are usually valuable.  And then you get a little bit sometimes of insider talk.  But I find this to be a really good source.  There's another one and I wish I could get a membership to this, which is a hacker news, but it's hard to get a membership.  It's similar stories, but it's called Lobsters L.O.B.S.T.E. dot R.S.  And it's also geek stories.  Then the final thing I do is also crowdsource, which is the popular bookmarks on Pinboard.  So in other words, without a single stop at Facebook, I'm able to go and there's more.  But this I don't want to go on and on, but I'm able to go to half a dozen sites.  And get enough. I do this every morning and afternoon, which is pretty much what I do.  I get all the stories that we're going to talk about.  This works pretty well for me.  And I don't need Facebook to do this.  And I've you know, so I'm curious, Stacey, what do you do?  I'm sure you do a similar beat check or you you must have in your news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, yes, I yes, I have Nuzle.  I have I don't usually pop over to tech mean very often.  But you know, and then I use the financial actually up until like two years ago, I used Yahoo Finance because it actually still use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I still read that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You well, you can create your portfolio.  So I just get news on all the publicly traded companies is just right there on one page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually it's pretty good.  If Google has its own finance, I mean, there are other pages like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Finance is not as good from the news perspective.  And it actually wasn't good for a while.  And even like financial stuff, I was like, come on, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is a I think a really valuable way to get financial news.  You cover that more than I do.  Is there an IOT place you go?  Oh, we're getting being sued for securities fraud.  Wait a minute.  Oh, Keith Gill, the the guy on that hearing was tomorrow for him.  Oh, Federal Court in Massachusetts.  He's the suit said Gill.  This is interesting was actually a licensed securities professional who manipulated the market to profit himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What a short seller acting unethically.  So he was the face of the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the guy on the Reddit subreddit, the Stonks subreddit who got everybody to buy GameStop.  I just want that hearing was tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't know it was today.  Anyway, that's from Yahoo Finance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you do IOT?  Is there any IOT sources you you must come through?  There's a couple newsletters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But oh, and I also have a Google alert for various terms that are relevant.  But that's a good thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's not a lot of really awesome IOT sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, it's about an hour a day.  It's coming through.  Yeah, newsy things.  I pretty much spend most of my free hours not on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, pretty periodically checking all of these sources.  And there's a lot of you know, and then I you know, this is this is by the way, my news folder on Firefox.  And I have tech dirt, of course, and the Guardian and Wall Street Journal tech.  You know, this is a great site, forecast.com with a K.  This is a calendar of things like it says it's Ash Wednesday.  It's also Kosovo Independence Day and Random Act of Kindness Day.  So awesome.  Everybody do a random act of kindness.  So there I have a large folder with a lot of stuff and not one of them is is anyway related to Facebook.  And there's only what I was going to say is I was going to ask actually how you find your audience, not how you find your news, because that's what Jeff seems to be kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  That's what the publishers are worried about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I guess I'm a publisher.  Yeah.  I mean, Twitter is a place where you can find your news.  I'm a publisher. Yeah.  I mean, Twitter is a publisher.  I have a kind of unusual market go to market strategy.  I let them find me.  Because I'm a terrible marketer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am a terrible marketer.  I just did our survey and like, hey, y'all, thanks.  Like, thirty five percent of my newsletter subscribers come from Twit.  Oh, you're very welcome.  Twig. Sorry, Twig.  I should get the name right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what?  Get a waffle for that one.  That's good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I was like, oh, thanks, y'all.  Nice.  Like all of y'all.  All y'all.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  But it's we actually did some advertising on Facebook very early on and we did find some  interesting people.  We were.  But they didn't stick around.  So it's just basically like a growth game through word of mouth and Twitter and being places,  which is kind of sucky.  But it's kind of how you have to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We post on social media.  We have a marketing team, Jerry and Masako.  I am the marketing team.  Yeah.  They post on social media and stuff.  We buy.  We bought in the past.  I don't know if we still do it.  Google ads.  I don't.  I never did that in the beginning.  The biggest audience we've had, you know, was all without any marketing.  You know, I guess in a way I've market I got marketed by Tech TV for six years and that  was the marketing.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You had a nice army from the get go.  Yeah.  You know, so I brought them.  Yeah.  That's the key.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And yeah, because I pulled a bunch of people from like my gig at home in Fortune days.  Although some of those people are very confused by what they find.  Yeah.  I thought you wrote about broadband.  My question, you know, if you're looking at it as if this is going to happen, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  next month and we can't get our news from the social media platforms, how long is it  going to take to train society to not go to those platforms to look for the news?  Because there are people in this world, as you all know, that consider Facebook their  Internet.  I don't think those people really care about the Internet.  Yeah, I don't think they're going to go search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they just.  Yeah.  That's the point.  So Facebook, you know, when they reduced the news, it was from like five percent to four

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  percent when they got in trouble before because news was trouble.  Right.  And as I said, when they started NewsTab, where, by the way, before we, you know, Facebook  did pay News Corp for that already, about a year ago, more than a year ago, they were  Zuckerberg on stage kind of said, you know, we don't know if everybody's going to watch  this.  It's going to take a long time to get everybody to go to NewsTab.  So they know that they're most of their readers.  We're the odd ones.  We are the news whales.  They call us.  OK.  There.  There are the odd.  We're the weird ones.  No news whales.  I don't want to be a whale.  Where's the rim shot on that one?  How do you get news, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you do you you don't you don't have to do what Stacey and I do, which is generate content

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But do you have a news check?  Yeah, I mean, I start with Twitter.  I also I also go to my list.  I have my COVID list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have my Happy Place, which is my book history wants list.  I have a media channel that I've been working on for a few years.  I've been working on.  I have a two week online.  I have my book history wants list.  I have a media wants list.  I use the list.  I use Twitter a lot.  I go to Facebook, but not as much for news.  But I see that first and then I will end up looking down the New York Times page and the  Washington Post page.  So I do go to the destinations, which is what all news organizations want you to do.  But that's that's a really odd behavior.  Now, people don't go to the destinations.  They end up going there.  I'll tell you links and then they'll find something more and more and more.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you, I find it.  It's same thing with Twitter.  Not as information rich as the sites that I mentioned.  So after I've done all that, I might go look at the New York Times or the Washington Post  or the information.  But but but it's not as nutrient dense.  Same thing with Twitter.  And I do the list, too.  I have your COVID list of my I use tweet tech.  I've got your COVID list.  I've got Ohm's list of his top 25 tech reporters.  I've got a larger tech journalist list that Robert Scoble created long ago.  And so that's there.  But it's not as rich.  It's not as media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the other thing I do is every Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, I spend a couple  hours getting ready for the show.  Thank you.  I go and I go to but here's the here's the odd thing because Google News screwed this  up a couple of years ago.  I go Google thinks I'm an idiot because I go to Google and I search for the word Google  so I can then click on the news tab under that because going to Google News and searching  for Google doesn't get me anything.  Doing that gets me to Google.  So I go through Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Tick Tock and so on.  Then I go to my newsletters that I like, you know, my Benedict Evans and I subject you  to his essays and his EMA czar and others.  And then I go to Axios pretty regularly and see what they have.  And these are the ways that I feed into the rundown.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's what I use RSS for.  Again, I'm again, I'm really trying to not have to go to individual sites.  I'm trying to get the kind of a nutrient dense source of information.  So a newsletter I use.  This is in a reader, which I use.  So I have a tech news section, but I also have a blogs section.  And so this gives me a very quick scan of a lot of tech news.  But by the time I get here, I've probably seen every story.  I'm looking at this point for kind of the offbeat stuff like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, by the time I go to New York Times, I've seen half of what I care about.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like, for instance, the Charlotte Observer.  I don't know.  Boy, how did you find this story, Jeff?  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was it was my tick tock search on Google News.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't find a shortage.  Can't find feta cheese in Charlotte.  And aren't you glad you moved?  Boy, boy, am I.  Blame this tick tock trend.  Apparently there is a tick tock trend for baked feta.  It's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pasta is probably all in South Park.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, what?  Baked feta pasta?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you put in the tomato cherry tomatoes, salt and oil them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the fed in?  We're making some macaroni.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fresh basil and give it all a good mix.  Then add some of that cooked pasta right on top and give everything.  That does look good.  I would eat that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, good luck getting fed and the Fedaverse.  Fedaverse is out of Feda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to the Washington Post, the baked feta pasta dish first originated in Finland in 2018.  The fresh market told Charlotte Five, your Channel Five news in Charlotte, that since January 25, it's Feda sales.  Team coverage.  Team coverage of Feda sales increased by 45%.  Charlotte Five, they target that market.  They target that Charlotte market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, no, I'm saying they target that demographic, the people that are in that tick tock averse, if you will, doing those types of stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The fresh market in Charlotte obviously is very hip because they immediately made a video on Facebook.  Oh boy.  Of course.  On how to make baked fresh feta pasta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Washington Post says TikTok's viral baked feta pasta is worth the hype.  Oh, they put a lot more garlic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at that.  Garlic makes everything better.  You know what?  I'm making this tonight.  If I can find some feta.  That does look good.  I don't do the garlic like that, but that does look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cherry tomatoes right now, not in season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cherry tomatoes right now, not in season.  What else?  What's next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What was that?  That was balsamic vinegar.  Oh, balsamic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Baked 30 minutes.  Baked 30 minutes.  This looks really good.  Whoa.  See, if you have more than a minute, you can put more ingredients in.  Then you smush it all up.  They've got a little fresh basil in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That person's being very gentle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're smushing it.  Now you put the macaroni.  Or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That looks pretty good.  Take that, Cacio e Pepe.  Yeah.  That looks pretty good.  It's kind of basically Greek macaroni and cheese, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, there's tons of ... We make something called Stoplight Spaghetti.  That's basically this.  Stoplight Spaghetti.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute, I want to know about Stoplight Spaghetti.  Stoplight Spaghetti.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's because we have green zucchini and yellow and red tomatoes.  Okay.  So it's Stoplight.  Then it's just garlic, olive oil, basil, pasta, and parm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No worries.  You lost me at zucchini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't like the porch ...  I was out.  ... squash, eh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like squash at all.  No squashes?  None.  Really?  None.  No delicata, no spaghetti.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My family loves fried squash.  I'm going to ask the ...  How about grilled squash?  Grilled zucchini is okay.  You know, when Lisa makes her very famous ragu bolognese, her meat sauce, she'll also  make Marcella Hazan's famous 45-minute pasta sauce marinara, which is very simple.  Half an onion, stick of butter, can of San Marzano tomatoes.  You just cook it for 45 minutes.  It's a fantastic marinara.  And we'll make zoodles, zucchini noodles.  She likes hers steamed.  I like mine sauteed, so we split them in half.  And then we put that ... and it's a delicious, delicious dish.  You would love it, Aunt.  You come on over.  I'll give you the steak and I'll have the noodles.  No, Aunt, you know what?  That's much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those are zoodles.  Fried zucchini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Zoodles.  They're zoodles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're zoodles and I love zoodles.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Aunt, I got a friend.  Fried zucchini.  Breaded fried zucchini is basically french fries.  It's french fries with a vegetable center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yo, are we talking about food again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's get to the changelog, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was actually ... I will, but I want to talk real quickly with the journalists in the house  about the super micro story.  Remember, in 2018, October 2018, Bloomberg published a long, heavily anonymously sourced  story about a supply chain attack apparently from China that involved taking super micro  motherboards, which are on their way to the Department of Defense and many other places,  including our studios, and embedding a ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're so bored with what they find from you.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They listen in and they said, what is this?  He's talking about zoodles.  What is this?  They're talking about feta cheese every week.  Feta.  I thought, I don't get this.  Do they have any good Chinese recipes?  Anyway, they put a rice-sized grain.  These are multi-layered boards.  They can embed them almost invisibly on the board.  It looks like a solder.  Then it turns the computer into basically a spy machine for China.  Universally, Amazon, which makes the elemental systems that have the super micro board on  it, and that's what we've got in our rack, to Apple, to everybody else said, that never  happened.  It's a BS story.  Even security guru Bruce Schneier said, yeah, I don't think that happened.  Bloomberg on Friday doubled down with an even longer story, even better sourced, in  which they said ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it really though?  Well, that's the question.  This is some squishy sourcing and they didn't link to their original article.  There's so many things in this article that feel like ... I don't know how these guys  sleep.  I was sick to my stomach after the first story came out and everybody started saying, nope,  nope.  I was like, oh my God, these poor reporters.  Having gone this far without and then doubling down on this with knowing that their last  story was so vilified, questioned, I don't know the right word I'm looking for here.  You would think they would do, after what, two years, two and a half years, three, they  have some proof, hardcore proof.  If you don't have proof, you don't come back to the table.  This story is so confusing to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bruce Schneier posted an article on his blog this week saying, I think I was wrong.  This might be a legitimate story.  Then others, including a security researcher with a bizarre Twitter handle, which I've  forgotten, said no.  What does Steve say?  Steve has not yet looked at this.  He's not really an expert on this particular topic.  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like hardware security, not necessarily ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also nation state spying, hacking.  Certainly, by the way, something that does happen.  Nobody's saying that this happens.  We know the NSA has done it with Cisco systems on China.  We know we do it, and I'm not surprised to hear that China does it.  I'm interested to hear your take on it, Stacey.  They did add Lenovo to the Supermicro.  In both cases, they said neither company is likely responsible.  It's a supply chain attack as this gear makes its way to the end users.  They quote a lot of people.  What some experts have said is they've misinterpreted the briefings that the intelligence community gave.  I just think it's very interesting they came back to the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's interesting, but I don't understand why they came back to the table with this.  It's not like they're under time pressure, unless we're going to see some sort of news come out,  like the NSA is actually going to show us a board and they wanted to be ahead of that story.  That is something I'd look for, right?  Actual physical proof that some government is going to fail, which is why these guys pushed.  I don't know.  I'm trying to think of a good metaphor, but it's a weak sauce story from a sourcing perspective,  from even validation to their other one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matt Tate, who is a former GCHQ consultant and now senior cybersecurity fellow at the Robert S. Strauss Center  for International Security and Law and uses the Pwn All the Things handle on Twitter.  He essentially said articles like this are constructed out of parts.  There are a series of claims attributed to collections of sources grouped into an overall story.  He says, as far as he's concerned, it's a misunderstanding on the part of the sources on what they were told.  I'm not sure, but I have to say, I feel like the lady doth protest too much.  I'm not sure why he's taking on such a strong position on this when in fact there is absolutely no reason to doubt that this kind of thing happens.  Supply chain attacks like this are among the most dangerous faced by intelligence agencies.  I think I believe it. I'll be honest with you. I believe it at this point.  I think there's enough information in this new story to make it credible.  We know it happens anyway.  Why does he have such an interest in debunking this particular story when in fact this is something that happens all the time?  Really the moral of the story, as I said two years ago, is beware of your supply chain.  True.  How though?  Well, it's a very difficult thing to do. Look at the SolarWinds attack.  That worked because people trusted a security company called SolarWinds and it was widely used.  In fact, it was hackable and had been hacked. That's another supply chain thing.  I don't understand why Matt Tate is making such a big deal about this.  I honestly feel like it's suspicious. He used to work for GCHQ, which was very much denial of this the first time around.  That's the British government communications headquarters, their spy agency.  I think there's a certain amount of vested interest among some intelligence agencies to say this doesn't happen.  But everyone, we know it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess maybe we'll wait to see if some other shoe drops soon.  The accusations against Supermicro and the infiltration into Amazon and Apple are so inflammatory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're very careful in this Bloomberg story to say we are not asserting that Supermicro is doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but it is a hugely damaging thing to say that your gear was targeted for this attack.  It doesn't matter if they're at fault or not.  I was going to make an STD metaphor and I'm not going to do that.  Moving right along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have information to say it's true or not.  I find it interesting that Bloomberg, two years later, is back again with a similar story and more information.  Amazon denies, Apple denies, Supermicro denies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So once again, if it were true, what's at risk? What's happened? What could be, what should we start fearing tomorrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The real point is this is a very easy thing to do and it does happen.  We do it and it's presumed others are doing it to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can pull data off those servers.  The idea is by putting this chip on, you can undetectably, permanently, hack these companies.  Pull data off of anything off of that server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and yeah, it's not about hacking like ransomware. It's about hacking like espionage.  It's espionage basically.  Totally different.  Yeah.  That's why I'm asking the journalists and the working journalists in the bunch.  I don't have enough information to know whether it's true or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this story has confused me from the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't, I just, based on everything they showed me, I still don't buy it.  And it's not just because people are like, nope.  It's just looking at the, just looking at what they put in the story.  It feels really confusingly incomplete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I would say.  Like they should have a motherboard, a hacked motherboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They should have a hacked motherboard or they should have someone on the record who has seen and dissected, not dissected, who can say, I held this thing in my hands and this is true.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The closest thing.  You're right. To open it up again without that much of a leap.  I think that's a good analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or having like real named sources who are not just like who are directly, the sources are like third, third degree sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're third hand. Yeah.  It's people who were briefed by intelligence agencies.  But on the other hand, I wouldn't expect the intelligence agencies to say anything.  For one thing, one of the issues is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where are the technologists, Leo?  Where are the people? Like nobody who's in this industry.  Like I know the people who work at Supermicro, right?  You know the people, the sys admins who are dealing with this at Apple or if, you know, those people would confirm or help this person find the story and you don't see them anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Darren Mott, who oversaw counter and I'm quoting from the story, oversaw counter intelligence investigations in the FBI's Huntsville, Alabama, satellite office, said, and this is the third hand, a well placed FBI colleague described key details about the added chips for him back in October 2018.  Quote, when I what I was told was there was an additional little component on the Supermicro motherboards that was not supposed to be there, said Mott, who has since retired.  He emphasized the information was shared in an unclassified setting.  Nobody was nobody would ever say it was classified because then they'd be a prosecutable.  Obviously, the FBI knew the activity was being conducted by the China, knew it was concerning and alerted certain entities about it.  Mott said at the time he advised companies that had asked him about the chips to take the issue seriously.  So it's a lot of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so when those things come up, because I mean, I sit with people all the time who have who tell me very juicy bits of information.  And then as a journalist, you run through and sometimes you hit a wall.  Sometimes you cannot find the first hand person and you and I wouldn't expect the intelligence community to bleak on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's all it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, if you have the right sourcing, you should be able they may not leak on the record for you, but they will tell you they will point you in the right direction and help you get to the story.  I mean, read like read Lawrence writes writing about Syria, for example, or, you know, there are plenty of really good like national security reporters.  If you look at how they report it, this story does not mean the meet the sourcing and the level of knowledge that those people have.  And I think it's partially because I don't know about these reporters.  Are they national security reporters or are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're no, no, they're longtime security reporters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, well, then maybe they don't.  The other thing is maybe they don't understand what these people were talking about, although I think that's probably bogus because you could.  It's not rocket science.  It's just building a freaking server.  So I feel like someone who can cover national security could learn enough about that to understand, you know, boards and components.  So some people have said like they don't really understand tech.  I'm like, guys, it's not that difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so that's my question, because I don't think we can decide whether it's tech.  I mean, it's technically feasible. Right.  It happens all the time.  Whether this particular story is accurate is hard to determine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm more curious. Scooter X is pointing out this is this is actually true.  And I do remember this, that some of the people after the first story, they came in and really did a lot of detailed searching for these devices and talked about how they did that.  And, you know, presumably they did not find anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, including our father, Robert.  But I just don't know.  Anyway, it's interesting that I ask you another question for you.  Yeah. Bloomberg Business, which is a reliable journalist.  It's so weird.  You know, they took a lot of heat back in October 2018.  And the fact that they're willing to come back and do more with more information.  Let it lay. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or is it lie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  What's your question, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just the the the nothing the Seinfeld company.  One plus is car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Carl Pay from one plus started a company called Nothing bought Andy Rubin's the IP from Andy Rubin's failed essential phone.  Yes. And it's by the way, probably a home automation place.  Sir, Stacy, that's what I'm asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're wondering what the heck this is going to be.  Kevin and I almost put it on the show this week and I was like, I'll just stick in the newsletter because we don't have enough details.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But remember that essential did that failed phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they also had a smart home automation plan that was going to be intuitive.  Right. But we never saw anything tied to that at all.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did he buy just the brand or did he buy technology?  He bought all the intellectual property.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't buy all the IP.  OK. Yeah.  Although I think there's there's some question about the patents.  So I'm not sure what he got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Speaking unusual funding structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, is it?  I do sign up now.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I'm bringing it up.  So you sign up now and you can between 50 and 20,000 euro alongside Google Ventures or GV.  Oh, I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It says Carl Pay tweeted, we acquired essentials trademarks, which is.  Yeah. Yeah.  You're right. They didn't get the team.  Not if your company is called nothing.  Right. Now it's called something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you. That's where I was going next.  Look at look at the team.  Steve Huffman is still CEO of Reddit.  He's on the team here.  He is Casey Neistat.  Yeah.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this sounds you know, I'm trying to Carl was a good was a finger to the wind about marketer more than I think more than a technologist.  OK.  He says we're building a ecosystem of smart devices will start with simpler products, wireless earbuds.  We're going to have multiple products throughout the year, not just audio products eventually want to build it.  So these devices talk to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's like this is per your interest or make you per your BS scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Honestly, when he was CEO at one plus, they got a lot of heat for their marketing campaigns.  They had that, you know, invite all weird way of selling phones.  Oh, yeah.  They abandoned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I fell for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I fell for Andy Rubin's essential phone.  So so there's that one last story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just wanted I wanted your finger to the wind.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One last story before we get to the change like that's next.  There's so many stories we still have to cover.  But I should mention we talked about this yesterday on security.  Now there is an Android app called Share It.  It's still on the Google Play Store.  More than one billion downloads, one billion with a B downloads.  It contains vulnerabilities.  It has for the last three months.  The manufacturer has yet to fix them.  The bugs can be exploited according to a security analyst for Trend Micro to run malicious code on smartphones where the share it app is installed.  Wow.  Including a man in the disk attacked, which is a kind of insecure storage of sensitive app resources in a location in the phone storage space shared with other apps where they can be deleted, edited or replaced by hackers.  Sure, it has not responded to requests from ZD net.  It is still on the Play Store.  Google hasn't pulled it down yet.  Last time I checked.  One billion downloads.  So you might want to take that off your Android phone.  And that's kind of one of many reasons why I'm not exactly Android guy anymore.  What I don't understand is this has a billion downloads.  So this is clearly on the Android radar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Google should know that.  Yeah.  What's taking it so long to have this investigation?  Hey, let me just check and see if it says.  Yeah, it's still on the store.  What does it do?  It's a way to transfer files from one platform to another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kind of like I think it's like kind of like AirDrop.  Got it.  But I don't know.  I've never installed it.  Thank goodness.  I know.  Yeah, I never installed it either.  Never installed it.  Verizon's bid $6 billion to buy track phone.  Which bothers some people because that's a way that poor people get a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I love this guy, Aaron Epstein.  He bought a quarter page ad in the Wall Street Journal.  Bitch, I'm going to go to the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  He bought a quarter page ad in the Wall Street Journal bitching about AT&T's poor...  That was awesome.  AT&T's poor internet service.  He was getting three...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Next day, knock, knock, knock.  Hello, Verizon at the door.  That was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a lot of money, $10,000 to buy that quarter page ad.  But I guess it worked.  An open letter to John T. Stanky, CEO, AT&T.  D. Merist, dear Mr. Stanky, AT&T prides itself as a leader in electronic communications.  Unfortunately for the people who live in North Hollywood, California, 9-1-6-0-7, AT&T is now a major disappointment.  So AT&T responded.  They gave him fiber.  But apparently did not give the neighbors fiber even though they implied...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, that is so AT&T.  See, that's what is wrong.  Just bonkers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For $10,000, you could...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They'll get to it by the end of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think he must have had the $10,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he must have had the $10,000.  It was a principle because he also, because AT&T was so terrible, bought cable internet from Spectrum, which is also available.  So he now has a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They also said this is the headquarters of a lot of creative people in Hollywood and you're screwing this up.  They can't get on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anyway, it's a...  He should have taken to Twitter.  There'll be a movie.  There'll be a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was it Mike Arrington?  Wasn't one of the early, early cases of using Twitter for customer service?  I think it was Mike Arrington.  I think it might have been AT&T.  I can't remember.  People hate AT&T.  They were out there the next day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I'd like to do next?  Eat a waffle?  Before we eat the waffles, we're going to have to do your change log.  But first, a word from Nareva.  This is actually a great solution for classrooms, conference rooms.  Anywhere you have a number of people who have to keep socially distant,  but want to use Zoom or Google Meet or Cisco WebEx or some sort of conferencing software.  The problem is they're all facing different ways.  They're all far away from the microphone.  It just is a mess.  It sounds terrible.  Nareva solves this with something I'm calling.  They don't call it this, but I think it is.  Computational audio.  We've all heard about computational photography.  Taking kind of a weak signal from a smartphone lens and turning into a beautiful image.  That's what Nareva does with audio.  In fact, they have four patents for what they call their microphone mist technology.  Now this isn't a beam forming microphone.  If you've tried these, you know that they're complicated.  They have to be set up and adjusted by a technician that costs a lot of money.  We're not talking about a tabletop system and the mics required,  which have to be sanitized between meetings and don't work with, you know,  you have to put a sticker on the table and say, sit here, face this way.  Not with Nareva.  Not with Nareva.  Nareva Audio is designed for distancing.  It's the first socially distanced mic system.  They look like sound bars.  You can mount them yourself on a wall.  It's easy.  Turn it on and the microphone mist technology takes over.  It fills the room with thousands of virtual microphones.  You get full room coverage.  People could be heard from anywhere, no matter where they sit,  where they face or how they're distanced.  No technicians. You can do it yourself.  You can install each microphone and speaker bar right there on the wall.  It automatically adapts to any room configuration, which is great,  because it means you can move things around.  You don't have to somehow calibrate it.  It just knows.  No wonder they've got four patents for their microphone mist technology.  Named the top new technology at ISE 2020.  That was the Nareva HDL 200 system.  The HubSpot folks have a Nareva HDL 300 system.  Jimmy Yan, their principal collaboration engineer, says,  we were so impressed with the sound quality, the ease of install,  and the ease of use of the HDL 300.  It was a no brainer for us to adopt it.  Sound better with the magic of computational audio.  The microphone mist technology.  Very, very cool.  If you're watching the video, you're seeing the images of the Nareva at work,  but I want you to, if you're not watching the video or just anyway,  go to nareva.com slash twit.  You'll see a demo. You'll see what it looks like.  You can figure out which ones are right for you.  It's an easy thing to install, and boy, it makes a big difference  in your space.  N-U-R-E-V-A.  Nareva.com slash twit.  Nareva.  Thank you, Nareva, for supporting this week in Google.  And thank you for supporting us by using that special URL.  They'll know you heard it here if you go to nareva.com slash twit.  N-U-R-E-V-A.  Boy, there's a lot of stories.  Let me get the changelog, because it's a big, long changelog.  It's time for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess not. I guess it's not the time for it.  Crickets. It's time for crickets.  It will soon be the time for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Waffle time. Waffle, waffle, waffle.  Waffle, waffle, waffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's time for finding that button. Where'd it go?  Want me to do it again?  It's the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they say it in there. That's why.  It's time for the Google changelog.  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so funny hearing Jammer B in the background.  He was waiting for me to say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What kind of artist blames his tools?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was blaming me for not saying the Google changelog.  But it says it there, so I thought it's time for...  And then he would say, the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm on Team Jammer B on this one.  Okay, my fault.  That's his cue. That's his cue.  That's his cue, and he's sticking with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Actually, the truth is the trumpet guys were all having a cigarette break.  We had to get them rushed back.  They were admiring your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't wait to get into it.  A new video editor plus enhanced editing features in the Google Photos app.  This is great.  I think this is the one that was on the Pixel  and is now available to all Google One members, right?  You have to have a Google One account.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do enjoy being able to have the simple video editing capabilities,  just the trim and stuff like that for people trying to put things on social  just for quick marketing without having to go through the likes of a power director or Adobe Rush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got some other things though. It's got stabilization.  You can rotate your videos.  You can crop, change perspective, add filters, granular edits,  including brightness, contrast, saturation, and warmth.  There are now 30 controls.  So there's quite a bit you can do.  Yeah. And you don't have to leave Google Photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I started playing with this. It's out now, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought we talked about this last week, but I guess this is more.  No.  No?  No, sir.  I'm so confused. I do too many shows.  The new video editing features are already available in Google Photos and iOS.  We'll be rolling out to Android users in the coming months.  Oh, here's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no. Then I don't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well.  What was I using?  There you are. I don't know.  And then I did mention last week the new features with the Google One membership,  which include blur portrait, light color pop, and the like.  Google. No, that's the same story again.  YouTube TV will add 4K streaming and more simultaneous streams,  but you're going to have to pay.  I'm going to have to pay. Who's going to pay? The content guy?  Or do you have to pay to get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's actually time I look at YouTube TV again, because football season is over,  so I'm not watching any live sports and don't have to feel the need to pay for live TV.  And I just changed my Hulu package,  but it's probably time to look back at YouTube TV and do another comparison.  But I still remember hating the history button on there that showed up in my regular YouTube use from my TV use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is really more for kind of, I would say, future.  The future? But 4K is common.  OK, YouTube is long invested in latest visual technologies.  We now support SD, HD, 4K, VR, HDR, and live video on nearly every device with an Internet connection.  It's mind boggling. From desktops to mobile and gaming consoles to VR headsets.  Wow. Later this year we'll redesign the YouTube VR app homepage to provide navigation accessibility and search functionality.  They're really, it's good. They're busy.  There aren't a lot of broadcast streams in 4K, but if there are one, YouTube TV will be adding support for 4K streaming,  which would be nice.  And they'll be, this is an add-on package, so yeah, you're going to pay for it.  The new add-on bundle will also enable offline downloads of recordings on YouTube TV.  Oh, because you have a DVR, so now you'll be able to download what you've DVR'd and take it on the plane with you or whatever.  And finally, this add-on package will also give families the ability to use YouTube TV on more devices at once.  Right now, you're limited to three devices at a time, and if a fourth one gets on, it kicks off one of the previous viewers.  It's kind of, how convenient.  Yeah, a little Russian roulette. So it's not, there's no price.  You were already paying 65, 65 bucks a month for YouTube TV. That's a cable. That's what cable bill used to be.  Exactly.  So frustrating.  50, count them, 50 updates for Classroom, Meet, and other online education tools.  I'm not going to tell you all 50 of them.  What are you, crazy? What are you, yeah, yeah, waffle time, waffle, waffle, waffle, waffle.  Later this year, blah, blah, blah. I'm not going to read all of those. There's a lot of them.  If you're using Google Classroom, Meet, and Education, read about it.  Material Design is coming to the web with a WordPress plugin.  Okay.  Okay. Okay.  So if you're using WordPress and you want to be material, you want to be material, you can do it.  Google Maps will now let you pay for public transportation and parking in the app.  That's really annoying when you get to a meter and you have to download the app for that little town's meter system or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that is this very cool to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. This will require, obviously, the cooperation of the parking folks in your place.  But you tap on pay for parking. It's a button that appears as you near your destination.  Enter your meter number, the amount of time and tap pay. Goes right through Google Pay.  It will be built into Google Maps. 400 plus cities, including Boston, Cincinnati, Houston, L.A., New York, Washington, D.C., and more Android users will get the feature first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No Petaluma?  Don't see Petaluma on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dag nabbit. You can also buy train tickets or transit tickets. That's cool.  Are there buses in Petaluma?  Yes.  Yes, they are.  They are natural gas buses.  And we also have a smart train, a light rail that goes from here to nowhere, which is great.  The train is fast.  It's not exactly nowhere. San Rafael. It's not exactly somewhere either.  It is fast. It's nice.  The train is fast.  If you're going to San Rafael, it's great.  Don't go but. It will also go to Santa Rosa. It goes right next to our favorite steak place in Santa Rosa.  But the train stopped running at 6 p.m. so you're going to get stranded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the steak place? I hate to derail but I had to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, man. We can't take you there. But someday we'll take you to Starks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Starks. Okay. I've heard of Starks. Okay.  Santa Rosa.  I haven't tried it yet but I've heard about Starks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. We're going back to the food thing again. I wish we were.  Oh, sorry.  But it's good. They have, besides an amazing porterhouse, lovely lobster.  The porterhouse, the guy comes out and it's like for a family of eight. Covers it up for you.  They also, the bread comes in a frying pan in which it has been baked with butter and garlic.  And it's a pull apart roll. And you might as well just eat that and not buy any steak.  Because it's good. And I always say I'm not going to have any of the bread and I always do.  Sorry for derailing.  Google Play Store can now share apps and updates with nearby devices.  Google Play Store can now share apps and updates with nearby devices.  Another kind of like AirPlay thing.  This is the nearby sharing feature which Google has talked about before.  It's going to start. Open the Play Store. Tap the three line menu button, aka the hamburger menu.  In the top corner, tap My Apps and Games. On this page you see a handful of tabs along the top.  One of which should say Share. If you don't see the Share tab, try waiting a few minutes.  Okay, okay. Fine. Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why isn't it a pancake menu?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could be pancakes. Could be three pancakes.  Who decided it was going to be a hamburger menu?  Three silver dollars. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh. Well, because a hamburger has like a pancake menu.  It should be uneven then.  Okay. Yeah, I don't know.  The hamburger is narrower than the buns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was waiting to see how she'd justify it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was like, you don't always get three pancakes in a stack.  But you got three things in the hamburger.  It's not a waffle menu. Three waffles would be a little too much.  That's a lot of waffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You made me get up in the middle of the show and go into the kitchen to see if any stroop waffles were left.  Stroop waffles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To be clear, I was not eating a stroop waffle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but it made me want a stroop waffle.  You put it top of mind though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fitbit smartwatches and trackers are now sold in the Google store.  Because Fitbit is now owned by the Google.  So, yay.  Is there still a sense of upset over Google's acquisition of Fitbit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure some people are upset over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get mostly the impression no one really cares anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, because Facebook is doing a smartwatch now.  We've got Amazon's got a smartwatch.  Apple's got the smartwatch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazon doesn't even bother with a watch.  They just put a tracker in a strap.  They just went straight to weird surveillance and emotional blackmail on your wrist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You sound angry.  Also, you're fat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, the new Amaki has wireless AirPlay.  So I just get in the car and my AirPlay starts.  There is a bug apparently which causes a boot loop with Android 11.  I haven't tested that yet.  But I might want to see if I can use my Android Auto because you can now create custom Google Assistant shortcuts.  So you don't even have to talk to the damn thing.  You just tap a button and here's one for closing the garage.  Here's one for arming the house.  And I would guess others could be make a phone call or navigate home.  That kind of thing.  Custom buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if this was discussed on Smart Tech today with Mr. Cassinelli.  He's all into shortcuts.  Yeah, he loves them on iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Google Assistant unofficially comes to Windows and Mac OS with a custom client.  What?  Melvin Abraham has written this custom client.  It's on GitHub.  So this isn't really part of the changelog because it's not from Google.  But boy, you might want to check that out.  It's GitHub.  Melvin-Abraham.  The Google Assistant unofficial desktop client.  And by the way, Jeff Jarvis, it comes in dark mode.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Yes.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Finally, the last story.  I can't even parse this sentence.  Google prompt 2FA UI on Android gets much needed dark theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, your prompt for two factor authentication is now in dark.  Dark?  Dark mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  And that's the Google changelog.  Log.  Parler's back, but none of the parlays are there.  So I had to invent all new parlays.  But I did log in and it's back.  I don't know who's hosting them now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it was thinking one woman who downloaded everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the old parlays are somewhere else's servers.  They're not on parlors or servers.  SkySilk.  SkySilk.  Are they Russian?  Are they Russian SkySilk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  LA based.  LA based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good.  Good, good, good.  Professional cloud hosting services.  Now it's time for the lovely Stacey Higginbotham's waffle.  You should do this.  The waffle of the week.  Wouldn't that be good?  Today's waffle combines savory feta cheese with honey from the South Carolina Hill country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd have a waistline of the century.  I did make grit waffles once.  That sounds terrible, but they were very good.  Out of how many grits?  Yeah, how many grits.  And you pop that in your waffle dough and it makes like a cornmeal waffle.  Oh, the whole grit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not the little ground up grits, but the whole hominy.  I bet that's called that.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The little ground up grits.  Oh, the little ones.  Not the big hunk of hunk.  Not the hunk of hunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's like Pozzoli.  Yeah, hunk of hunk of burn and hominy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so today is not a thing.  It's an app.  Yes.  Because I am very excited about mountains.  I think it's very important for you all to know that because otherwise this makes no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know though, I hear there ain't no mountain high enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we're a valley low enough.  So this app is called Peak Finder.  This is not going to be good for you if you don't live near mountains.  But if you like to visit places with mountains, it's great.  It does cost money.  It costs $4.99, but I found it very worth it because I am constantly looking like when I'm on hikes or just, you know,  there's a lot of mountains around me and it's beautiful.  And I'm like, man, is that Mount Baker?  I don't know.  And now I know because I downloaded this app and it uses your location.  You just scan.  You turn it.  You open the app and you see like camera basically and you scan and you're like it.  It just shows you little tags for every single mountain.  It tells you what they are and you can take pictures and stuff like this.  Again, this is a very niche app.  I'm not going to lie, but it works so well.  It does such a great job.  And even when you can't see the mountains, it knows where you are and it will tell you the mountains that are behind  that bank of fog.  It's very exciting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's cool.  It's super cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And like, I don't maybe I think I might be weird, but that's okay.  No, what makes you think that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're weird.  You can also take pictures and share the pictures with the names of the mountains on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can be like, haha, friends, look at me.  And it even works offline.  So when you're hiking and there's nobody near you, all the data is down there, you know, in your geographic area where you are.  And it will still tell you.  So that's it.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to get we talked about news gathering and I think when I left out one of the steps that I think is really important, I use a bookmark tool whenever I'm reading a story to bookmark it so that there is a central place where people can, you know, our producers can find the stories I'm interested in covering.  I have it automatically set up with Zapify to populate a spreadsheet for them makes it easier for them to work.  And I want to give a plug to this because I've been using it for some time.  It's called Pinboard at Pinboard dot I n.  I used it.  I started using it when delicious was acquired by Yahoo and started to fall apart.  It was years ago.  Yeah, years ago.  It supported the delicious API.  So it worked with a lot of tools I use.  It's just been rock solid.  And at the time, the creator matches chug lousky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, is that how you say his name?  It's how I say his name.  Say it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I may be wrong.  Machach ma ht a chay machay, which is a archaic Polish form of the word Matthew.  And I'm guessing chug lousky or chug lousky.  Anyway, he's a really cool startup guy.  He founded Pinboard many years ago and he did an interesting thing.  He said, the sooner you buy in, you'll get a lifetime membership and it'll be and the price will go up as more people use it.  So it was kind of incentive.  And I think I spent twelve dollars literally ten years ago.  I got an email from Macha and I'm sure a lot of us old timers did say, you know, way back when you paid me twelve bucks and thank you.  But it still cost me running to run this.  And, you know, you don't have to, but it'd be nice if you, you know, subscribed.  And he gave me a lot of different levels.  I actually chose the donut level so you could see next to my name.  There is a donut now.  That means I am standing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you click the donut and nothing happens.  But I was hoping I'd get a donut anyway.  But I just wanted to not only mention it, but also encourage those of you who, like me, were early pioneers and signed on early to this.  Look for your email from Macha and who is a great guy anyway.  His blog, Idle Words, is fantastic.  He's been writing a lot about Hong Kong, the Hong Kong protests.  He hasn't written since October, probably, you know, doing other things.  But still, he says I want to be really active on Twitter.  Yeah, he's great.  He's just really great.  I wouldn't know that because I don't follow him.  He runs a suite of alternative candidates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can donate to.  He researches political candidates, actually.  And so he does he does quite a bit.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've asked him to be on many times because I love what he says in Idle Words, his blog, and I think the world of him.  But he doesn't want to do podcasts, I think.  So that's fine.  He's got other things to do.  But I did I did fork over some dough.  I got it.  I bought a 10 year membership because I only want to pay him once every 10 years.  But fair enough.  It's a really I just want to give him a plug.  If you're not a member, join Pinboard.in is the best.  I can go on and on about all the tools.  Look at the how to.  There's all sorts of stuff.  There's lots of very powerful tools.  There's bookmarks.  There's privacy.  You can you can save websites in a database.  So, you know, even if they go down, you'll have them.  They have a bookmark by email.  They have, as I said, the full delicious API.  It's he's he's a rock solid.  It's just rock solid.  I've never had a problem with it.  So keeping bookmarks is a nice thing.  And you can follow my bookmarks directly because it's public Pinboard.in slash you for user colon Leo Laporte.  And so you'll see all of our stories.  And I've been doing this for a long time.  All the tags and all the stories there.  Pinboard.

Transcript:  Jeff, a number, a number of because I now have media calls coming in.  I'm doing ABC Australia.  I'm doing CNBC.  Yay.  I'm doing.  Yay.  We love seeing you on the BBC.  Pepe.  I'm not going to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you mean you're going to have more.  More.  You're going to have stuff after this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is what happens.  You have an opinion, Jeff.  I know.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See what happens.  I found it interesting that according to the Guardian, the oversight board at Facebook has received so far nine thousand.  Comments in their public comment.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nine thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where did I?  There was a was it the Post somewhere had a good series of articles on the people on that board.  I can't remember where that was.  Yeah, I think so.  Mr. Ant Pruitt, what's your thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, my thing is something that it's piggybacking off of my days of being in the band and whatnot and what some people don't know.  And I know I didn't share with you all previously.  I said that I played saxophone, which is true, but I also dabbled with playing around with the snare drums when I was in the marching band and I got fairly good at it.  But I just liked the right to that.  I just love that motion and the sound and the art of it.  And this weekend I was watching YouTube on TV as usual and came across this apex channel where they share one of their members trying to reenact the drum line and movies, drum core competitions.  And I thought it was quite fascinating because he goes in and breaks down the technique, but he's not a snob about it.  You know, he talks about how they're holding the sticks and so forth.  And he dives into the rhythms and cadence of it all.  And it's pretty fascinating to watch.  And if you skip to like the 16 minute mark, he gives you the actual full playback of him going through it.  That's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he does the whole breakdown of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now he's trying to memorize it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Turn on my sound if you don't have it up, John.  Here we go.  You ready?  Here we go.  Were you in a drum line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I played here and there for our band, but most of the time I was on the saxophone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't have, I don't think we have drum lines as much here in California.  I actually was the announcer on a drum and bugle core competition some years ago and it was so much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to love watching DCI drum core in the national on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't remember where it was, Fresno or somewhere else, because there are a bunch of high schools that do some of this stuff.  But we're too cool in the Bay Area, I think.  But I love this.  He's got it down.  The thing is, he's doing what every one of these kids learned in this movie.  I mean, they're doing it.  Yeah.  So good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a lot of discipline, a lot of hard work, a lot of rehearsal.  And then you have to be letter perfect.  They are judging you.  You are being judged.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like I said, he stops a couple of times in his attempt to memorize this.  He says, wait a minute now.  It's hard to do.  He shouldn't be holding it this way if he's going to make it sound like this, make this particular sequence.  Well, it is a movie.  You know.  And he calls it out.  But like I said, he wasn't a snob about it.  He sort of had fun with it.  That's really cool.  But he nailed it.  Man, I really enjoyed it.  And I'm sure I'm going to watch more.  Is this a good movie?  Should I watch this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never seen this movie.  It's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got a lot of drumming.  Yeah.  The competitions are where it's at, though.  They have three different presentations in that movie.  And they are stellar.  I was not a judge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was just the announcer.  He goes, you know, and now from Fresno High School, the marching Cougars.  But it was so much fun.  I really dug to him.  It is very, very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you talk about the discipline.  I was speaking with someone.  I can't remember who, but I was speaking with someone online and they were giving me a hard time about my affinity with sports.  And I told them that sports changed my life.  It helped me to be a better human.  And it helped me to look within, if you will, and help me with discipline and things like that.  But also band.  My band practices were just as rigorous.  And if you messed up, you had to pay for your mistakes, if you will.  But it taught you just to be disciplined and pay attention to details.  And then it also taught me the love of music.  You know, granted, I don't always listen to hip hop and all of the bass and bumpity bump music, but I enjoy listening to some Hans Zimmer every now and then, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you just call it that bumpity bump music?  Bumpity bump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bump.  Grandpa Hans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bump, bump, bumpity bump.  You kids with your bumpity bump music, get off my lawn.
