Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cartoons next Leo's never said that to me on the oc. No, I haven't so there was a story  Who does Tom Hanks and George Clooney and oh, yeah people in Germany died  So it was really interesting to me that you had a voiceover guy was a star enough to do obits on and  Big stories around so people knew that he was dubbing the voices of those superstars. Yeah. Yeah Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's actually they have to find like ten other people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. I  Thought that in most civilized nations they use subtitles  I thought they mocked us for in the United States because we had to have dubbing  But we don't think that much we don't like dubbing we like subtitles, right?  Maybe I got that's only if you're an art, you know an art house. No. Yeah, there seems to be a division some people like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Prefer to have dubs even if they're bad and some people prefer to have subtitles

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just hate dubbing because it's like a two looks so phony. It's so much better when you're watching

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm gonna age myself here got a young kid  So musical comedies are like Disney movies all the singing has to be redone for translated and that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Totally a voice actor right there. Yeah, this is only barely on on topic. But did you see?  spirit of liberation dot de  No, evidently a new cache of World War two color film  I go nuts on color from that age because it just changes your worldview so much. It doesn't look so old for one thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you're like anything happening before color. It was all in black and white, right? And so it's Normandy invasion

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Berlin being destroyed, you know and so on but it's it's it's amazing to see it in color. I just and this is a German site

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting. What is the you're you're up on how the Germans feel about everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, just not me. They like me, but that's all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is the attitude? Well your sneakers as a real insult to speak? Yeah  No, they know it's not but they did so they did a story on Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead to tell the story Jeff. They did a story on I want to speak in Augsburg and they said what was it?  He talks freely and wears sneakers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And has apparently a dial telephone the bat phone  Hello, mr. Jarvis, I have a call for you person to person. Will you accept the charges? It's Leonid Bresna  So they don't mind they enjoy these

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Old-timey there's a fascination with history Lord knows yeah  And with the Berlin outside which is where I found this does all kinds of great things where you look at  You know, I could've seen then and now that slightly  I saw one of those of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Paris and Berlin and this photographer  Overlapped new photos with yeah historic. It was fascinating. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so but you have to pay it looks like you have to pay for it  Oh, here's let's look at the trailer we probably could show that safely

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that just amazing right there  It's so real in a horrible way. Yeah good color, too. It's amazing. Oh, it's original color, but it's  enhanced  In resolution

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't  Wasn't that long ago really and so it does kind of give you a false sense of oh  This is our ancient history when it's in black and white. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it feels longer ago  Yeah, I mean look how vivid that is. That looks like real people

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right exactly. It's amazing how our brains, you know, if we still had black and white TV, we would think the world looks that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is what from the Donald Trump campaign is this  I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that  Jeff Jarvis, what the hell happened?  You not want to talk about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not for very long

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I won't spend a lot of time but and I missed it and I apologize because I would have immediately tweeted in support  But I was walking home  And I found out about it after the fact after Esquire had already pulled it down, but Esquire  Unaccountably and inexcusably published a piece  That was said by professor Jeff Jarvis. It wasn't  It was kind of but it wasn't even I get I gather I didn't couldn't read it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it wasn't even particularly funny. It was a parody. Well, cuz it's a parody of a parody  Vanderhai had written a  Wall Street Journal  Zuckerberg should run for president president, right? So so this guy who I who's been torturing me now for four years  So this is the Twitter guy. It's the Twitter guy. Okay, I wrote a piece and and and Esquire did a horrendous job  They did not label it at the very top. Did they know it wasn't you? Of course they did  of course, then it's inexcusable that only only at the the only way you can see this was at the  Very very bottom of the piece and we know nobody scrolls these days  In the ITAL ID at the very end of that is said not at Jeff Jarvis as if anyone should be able to figure out  Which ones which and then later after your complaint they added  Then Jake found this in a search only by searching for the word satire on the page at the very very very bottom underneath all the taboo  Crap and all the other crap and all the other crap and all the other crap  There was a whole big gray list of tags in there. It said satire. That was it  That was the only effing label on the thing. I  I got up terribly upset. I got really really really upset because I just I just had it  I've just absolutely had it this guy has attacked people using my name. That's it. He's just not at Jeff Jarvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if this would be even somebody sophisticated, and I think some people who are sophisticated were fooled by this  Thought it was you because nobody's really gonna do any forensic research and certainly nobody doesn't know you is gonna assume  It's you it's unconscionable for Esquire to do this and I you know for one  I'll defend you as my friend and blah blah blah, but it's the larger issue of  What's to stop this from happening all the time if you don't have a journalistic institution of any sort should never try to fool its readers

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's unethical. It's wrong. So I ended up on Twitter with the apparently the assigned editor  He asked me to email him. He never gave me the response of the respect of a response then I then I'm in a very privileged position  I know people at Hearst at the parent company. I went to my email list  I went to very high people at Hearst  I can do that because I'm connected here and I'm a professor in New York and I know people  You know the average schmuck who got in the situation couldn't do that  But I used that privilege to email them and executive email back very nicely included to others  They then put a label in that said it was worse in a way because it said  By at professor Jeff Jarvis a  Soterical whatever I said that's they've read that sentence that says that I a guy named professor Jeff Jarvis a tearful Twitter  Oh, I said listen that first  I was very angry and I said take it down take it down take it down then I said listen  You take my name off of this. I'm collateral damage take my name off this in any way and you can do whatever the hell you want  I'm not you know fine, but then a higher executive came in and said and apologized  Because I think they're exposed I frankly think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on no no no no no you can't do that they get you know, you're you're a public figure  I'm a public figure if somebody starts publishing stuff over my name that I didn't write I would sue the hell out of them  well, and you should I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I asked for a lawyer because I didn't connect with one but and people's always threatening  It doesn't yes. It's defamatory. Yes. I believe it's actually not even that it's confusion

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know the biggest the biggest awards in in the trademark confusion  the you know trademark awards and I know this because I talked to attorneys about Twitter because Twitter was named Twitter after twit and  So I talked to attorneys, but are we protected etc etc?  And they said well if you wanted to pursue it the way to pursue this is trademark confusion that people would assume as they do  The Twitter that I copied Twitter not vice versa and I would think that this would be a this would be a similar issue  This is confusing people about you damaging to your reputation use its use of image and and name

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they took it down I knew what would happen I knew exactly what happened then I get smashed all of the trolls  Travel in packs so certain trolls that left me alone for years come back out other trolls come in  Attack me on Twitter, you know calling me a well, and that's the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the Streisand effect if you fight

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what are you supposed to do you supposed to sit back and just take everything?  You're not supposed to take that point. No you as my son said you pull the band-aid off  so I went on medium and I posted saying this is what happened and  And then I heard today from a reporter at Gawker of all effing places  Gawker trying to act haughty with me, you know, huh? Hello little hard to look haughty from the sewer fellas  So I also responded to that and put that up and just put it there and let it you know  Let the let the snow roll off  This guy has had his fun for four years now four years ago two years ago  It's not about this promised to change the name. He promised Jason Potten of MIT Media Review who intervened he didn't do it  He just said on Twitter that oh, it's just not a priority. Yeah, he had two years  BS fella BS. I've had it. You've had your fun. I  Avoided this because I didn't want the crap, but I've just plain had it  I got so upset last night my literally my anxiety attack was going for the first time in two years  I felt like I was gonna go into a fib and I said for this stand up in the hospital

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, you shouldn't but so that's it. That's the story and we don't need to belabor it  But I think it's damaging to Esquire's brand very damaged

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think I know that I think this is this is what I asked them for again and again and again  I said, what is your policy?  I want your policy so I can write about this and I never got it and I suspect they don't have one  I suspect they will now because the basic rule every journal every had journalist a enterprise should have a rule about this  This is unacceptable. The bottom line is you do not fool the reader  That is the worst thing a journalist can do in any possible world  You don't fool the reader and the effort of this guy and the Esquire in this case was to think oh, we're all clever  And we're gonna fool the reader  No, that's unethical. It's unjournalistic and  And that was it. So I just I want to move on now  And thanks for the support Lisa. I did a nice tweet today about this as well  And I appreciate that I appreciate lots and lots and lots of very supportive tweets very good friends who came in people who mean  a lot to me Dan Gilmore Zanab Tufesky  Neil Dash a lot of people just really were very very very nice Matthew came on I saw came in today  And I and that really means a lot because it just you just give the junk people come after me  I put one bad tweet  Show on the air in the piece and you just get tons of that junk  Which which by the way is convenient because now I can tell all the jerks and I just block them  I have blocked another hundred jerks and my life will be quieter and that's nice. So thank you. That's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just kind of shocking I know it just doesn't  And I think it's not just about you Jeff. I mean  we're already in a kind of a loosey goosey environment in terms of internet journalism and  The last thing you want. I mean what you know, what if somebody wrote a  It's fake Steve Jobs said fake Steve Jobs  You know Dan Lyons wrote that for a long time, but there was never any question that wasn't Steve Jobs exactly  Exactly. I don't know that Steve Jobs was pleased about it, but at least I'm sure he wasn't  But it wasn't pretending to be Steve Jobs and this is pretend to be you and if somebody wrote a piece under over George Clooney's name  You could bet they'd be getting sued like crazy. I mean this that's a that's a brain. It's  I'm shocked frankly that they would do that and it really talks to Twitter Jeff about about him changing his name or forcing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Him to change his name on Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know the problem there though, they allow parody accounts. I did last night. Oh finally  And I don't know what's gonna happen there  The the problem is Matthew is that it's the it's the strisand problem is that if I caused the account to be killed  Then you know what the guy took down his account own account down  Explicably a few months ago and and there were story there were news stories that I caused this to happen  can you get a life and do real news no, I didn't cause it to happen and  So no, but this point I am over the edge some people are trying to intervene and just say listen you've had your fun  You've had your time just change the name. Yeah, just he said he said for some time. Oh, I'm not really making fun of Jarvis  I'm making fun of this type. Well, then change the name  Very simple, you know call yourself. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jarvis I've got a fake Matthew Ingram

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why still you why still involve me anymore just just take me out of just take me out of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've had your time for years four years a brand around it though. I mean, that's that's what he does

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So but which is really sad, you know, it's a really sad thing  This guy doesn't have you know, he wanted to write his parody piece put it on your own byline  Be proud of it. Wasn't very good. But fine be proud of it. Maybe that's the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's trying to he's writing bad he's not good enough to write it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's wants other people to suffer dry Stacy exactly and and so that's exploiting me at my

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's one thing to do it on Twitter  It's another thing for an Esquire to do it and I just really  Really know it they apologized. They apologize. Well, at least one executive there is permanently damaging. Sorry, Esquire  Well, then Gawker put it up of course, yeah, well see I wrote them off ages ago  I'm do they still have reporters. I thought what are they doing?  Paul I got politics. I guess not. I guess not. Yeah, exactly  They can't they do you know what once you taste blood. It's very hard to wean yourself off that flavor  Yep. All right Facebook results are in  It seems so bloodless to talk about but Twitter results  Not so good effect Apple not so good Microsoft not so good a lot of a lot of a lot of not so good results  Facebook crushed it though. Actually Facebook was the one win, right? Yeah. Yeah, it went yes significant analyze, please  You got three people I should be sitting back enjoying my tea listening

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook beat every estimate I think on every metric as far as I can tell

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are them? What are the things that we look at to see how well Facebook's doing mobile engagement mobile ad sales?  Mobile right how it's doing in mobile. Yeah. Yeah, that's an advertising based company

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah an advertising. I mean, I think 79% of their revenue was from mobile ads. I remember not that long ago  People writing think pieces about will Facebook ever figure out mobile. Yes  Yeah, two years ago it was like Facebook doesn't get mobile Facebook and now  79% of their ad revenue, which is massive. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Having a billion. Is it a billion five monthly active users? I mean once you get a billion daily, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They said I think a billion daily so q1 revenue  Five point four billion. That's a single quarter  79% of that from mobile ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I think the difference here too is is they have more data about us and about content than I think than Google  I you know, we can have that discussion which has more but I think you can argue Facebook has more opportunity  To target in a relevant way at a higher value and performance  Google bought up a whole bunch of the ad infrastructure that puts it in the rest of the ad business  Facebook is doing this entirely on its own platforms

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think one of the key differences  Google has lots of data  Based on you know, just the volume of people doing things Facebook has a lot of data based on other  Aspects of your behavior. So clicking liking commenting sharing  Google doesn't have access to any of that stuff except through Twitter which kind of deal with  You know, it has some on Google Plus which I think was the whole point of launching that was to get that kind of behavioral  Data because that stuff is gold to advertisers if you can kind of draw multiple vectors between  You like this and you commented on that and you shared this and therefore you're gonna like this specific car or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We know you who you know and we know what they like and we you know, yeah  And and again, I have no problem with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you guys is there a different way of  Valuing the advertising for something like Facebook which is kind of more entertainment and kind of downtime versus Google which is very information oriented  Because that's kind of the way I think about how they great question Stacey great question

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, you know what you just hit your your finger on put your finger on put your face  That  The question of direct response versus branding advertising  You're right Google is direct response and they're brilliant at that and they can target trouble terribly well to that and so can Facebook  But what Facebook really has is this this familiar?  intimate place  And I think you I think you may have hit something that the opportunity for branding advertising which media are dying to hold on to  Now can go to Facebook and in a way good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in a way Google's sort of  You know made its own bed. I mean it it pushed  Programmatic direct response to the point where that's a significant proportion of all the advertising you see online and the and the  Money they and others make from it is miniscule. And so you have to massive massive scale  So they're very very good at that type of advertising but not so good at lots of other kinds of advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you advertise any of the shows when you start? Yeah, we do anything to you. So what do you find about about I don't know  I don't I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Indulge in all that stuff. I try to keep seriously. I try to keep myself distant from incoming and outgoing ad dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want to know anything about it. The other thing about Facebook is that it's really subtle  You know understanding how you you're getting the ads that you see it's both like they're amazing at their machine intelligence  But they're also on the back end. I'm shocked at the inputs I can put on Facebook to reach  It's amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Annularity it's incredible if you've looked at any of those sliders that you can choose  We when we were running a conference Toronto, we had a guy who who dove deep into Facebook and there's just so many things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can target by I'll give you an example. Jason. Kelly can I said here's what you should do  Jason of course knows all this stuff  He said what you should do is you've got a newsletter  You got a mailing list now what you do is you feed that mailing list to Facebook and you say I want people like  These people yes, because they already know everybody's email. I want people like these people  So you don't even have to say what these people are like you just know these people are active viewers  So they wanted the mailing list so we're not doing this by the way you feel just telling you you could and then  Facebook churns those numbers and says good  I have another ten thousand people who are like those people but not not subscribed to your mailing list  Would you like to buy that ad and of course, that's who you want right? It's more of those engaged  Viewers that's of that kind of granularity is amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so if you think about like I think about this from a sort of media point of view if you're a newspaper  Or a magazine or even a TV station for that matter  You know basically diddley squat compared to Facebook about your users  And I know this is something Jeff's talked about as well. You you know kind of hazy  General vague things about the group of people who consume your content Facebook knows  People down to you know their height like they you can so you can leverage it which is interesting  All you need is their email address and Facebook says well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We know all about that guy right and if you're an advertiser

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You get to say I want a woman between 32 and 37 who lives in these specific  Geographical areas who's who likes these TV shows who's voted for these things who's probably pro-choice like that  This sort of death here's the question you can do is mind-boggling is that offensive given that it's anonymized

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not first if I buy that list. I don't even get to see who those people are that match

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right Leo and in fact I can go to  Data warehouses right now, and I can buy a similar list where I do get the list  I do get to mail it out myself. We're on Facebook Facebook becomes a shield

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Between the advertiser and so easy to invasion of privacy. They're anonymizing. They're not giving that information out  I don't  think so do real

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think it's a little questionable. I mean we face that actually I'm building an IOT newsletter right now and  We debated do we stick the address as we have in there and get that there's why I don't do that because of perception  Not because of reality so much but perception. Well, I think it is iffy and there's also the question of  There's no accountability for how good Facebook is and that kind of black box element right is really scary because  If I look at my list right now, it's it's mostly guys guys who are like, yeah  but  There are lots of women and moms out there who would love to know about connected  I don't know light bulbs and everything that I care about  But they're probably not seeing it, but I don't know that and that's kind of  That's the black box approach that kind of frustrates me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So here's my favorite story that all probably cool in second and one other issue, of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You give your mailing list to Facebook. There's no guarantee that that's not adding to Facebook's information  Right. You're you are giving your your subscribers  Something about your subscribers to Facebook another another quantum of information  I'm sorry, Jeff. Go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I don't know if I've told the story on the show before a reporter called me about privacy some time ago  And he said that to his friends and family he was talking intimately to them  About how he was feeling and this happened that was weird and that happened was weird and this happened and that happened  And then he saw an ad come up on Facebook for multiple sclerosis treatment. I ignore I ignore this stuff because this is all anecdotal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's a lot of this kind of anecdotal stuff and  People are really good at finding coincidences in the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  maybe but I but I think that there were symptoms there and the point here was actually a benefit because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He did wasn't diagnosed. He didn't know what why he was feeling. So did he just did he find out that he had MS?  Yeah. Oh wow. Yeah  Holy cow

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Argument well, but but yeah, you don't want to be diagnosed by your Facebook posts, but that's knowledge, right?  And knowledge is not a bad thing. We keep on demonizing the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff it's who it's shared with okay, it's who it's shared with so now Facebook says oh this guy has all the symptoms of MS

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We might want to we might Facebook didn't do that. No, they didn't eyes are the advertiser asked for certain keywords

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I understand we think Facebook didn't do that, but that's what Pete that's what privacy advocates are most worried about  Is that database will then be sold insurance companies will deny that guy insurance?  But they didn't do that or use it as a as a pre-existing condition. I guess and actually to be fair

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I think far more than Facebook we need to be worried about all the data resellers and packagers that are already out  They all know there there are a couple of huge companies. That's all they do is build basically data files  I'm doing it for decades without your knowledge. Nothing new, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think that the change is the internet makes it so much easier  we're putting so much stuff on there and the the algorithms and the models for  Deciphering the stuff we put out is just so much better and cheaper to get to  What's freaky is that Facebook won't just have it your insurance company if they wanted to they could probably you know  Do a deal with Watson IBM's Watson and start like filtering through all your social media posts. Yeah, I mean that's  crazy at an individual

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis, this is your local FBI  agent  According to Facebook you're about to commit a crime  You probably haven't committed it yet, but I just want you to know we're watching

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pre-crime pre-crime. I mean just tell him as professor Jeff Jarvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saw a story recently where there are  Intervention programs to try to identify people who could be young people especially who could be vulnerable and they use various signals to that  It's just data. It's just information and and in this case, yes  There's something we're going after you but they're stopping you from life of crime and intervening to give you services so that you won't and  What's wrong with that? Oh, no, they're suspecting me. Well, they're trying to improve your life because they recognize you're at risk

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a topic when I was talking with the people who are building  machine learning algorithms at Facebook  They actually brought this this concept of hey, we could probably look at what you're posting and  See someone who is likely to commit suicide, but  Do we have an obligation should we?  Step in and that's that's something they actually think about  Which yay for them for recognizing that that's kind of creepy but also a benefit and I just don't think it's society  We've gotten to the point where we're like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yay, the problem is the the benefits and the disadvantages are so  Entwined, you know, you don't get the benefits without the disadvantages. It's a little like the internet itself  It's simultaneously the best thing ever and the worst thing ever so you can't trust anyone who's trying to sell you something

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's I mean, that's part of the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you can get benefits from it. So the the target example where target sent that  Family  messages about their daughter and her pregnancy and the father didn't even know she was pregnant but target knew  Because they had looked at all the things that she bought and determined that she was probably in her first trimester  That's a horrific story in a way because the dad found out from target that his daughter was pregnant  But that was a misuse of the data. Yes, right, but you can you can also see examples where?  Finding something like that. I would actually be a good thing  It might not be the way you want to find out whether it's a diagnosis of MS or cancer or  It's information that could be useful to you  The question is how you get it and who else gets it and then what they do with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not even who else gets it. It's who else can put those pieces together because they're everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and we're and we're leaving them voluntarily all that data smog or whatever that we leave behind us ourselves  I talked to a guy actually whose company is designed to  for marketers so he tries to  Kind of build behavioral profiles for marketers and brands and he said he was approached by  Insurance companies and they said so here's what we'd like you to do  We'd like you to do exactly what you do  For the brands except we want you to focus on people's behavior. That is a breach of their insurance  so if they've filed a claim a back so name and you see them sharing photos of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We would like you to this is the first time I've heard a verifiable case of that  This is the the the example everybody brings up  But I've never ever heard this actually proposed. So I think that that's really interesting  So I've always said hey insurance companies don't care because you when you fill out a form  Saying I don't do any of that stuff  They hope you'll do that stuff because then they can and then they find out about it and then they can not give you insurance

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in this case there they've already paid out claims. Ah, they're trying to  Back  So they're they're trying to show that the fortune could made the claim  Yeah, is basically lying about whatever was wrong with them interesting. So that's true. In fact this company this guy said he wasn't sure  He felt sort of ethically  That it was a little questionable. He wasn't sure whether he was actually gonna do it for these companies or not. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, okay, I'm gonna make myself unpopular  But if someone did lie in their insurance claim insurance fraud is a big deal. It costs everybody huge deal  you know  Figuring that out would be yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For everyone, but it's one step removed from the next step, which is to nine insurance, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is you posted photos of you eating hamburgers, so we're not gonna have a heart attack. Yeah art claims, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right and that yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am or your friend with symptomatic not with diagnosed with MS  But because once you're diagnosed thanks to the Affordable Care Act, then they can't they can't deny it  But if they could get pre-crime  pre pre diagnosis  Bingo, that's it's gonna happen. I guarantee you that they're trying to figure out how they could do happening right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's I mean, this is one of those things where we meet we need better regulation  I'm not I'm not a huge fan of getting the government involved, but this is not something we can solve

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You still have your British roots. I can tell  Come to Canada we got all kinds of regulation you can say it's been a century but no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alright, let's take a little break.

What do you think honey?  The better way to do it would be get a mattress and sleep on it  For days and nights and weeks and months and then decide and that's what Casper lets you do  Live the dream the perfect mattress and by the way sheets and pillows, too  I love my Casper pillows can be yours  Direct from the factory these are great mattresses obsessively engineered mattresses made in the USA  Sold direct to you, so there's no middleman.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I work all the time  Like do you know how much time it's I spend on my house keeping everything operational. Yeah, I do know actually I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's tough especially if you have the iot stuff that stuff will bring you down all the light bulbs in the oven  That talks to you and stuff. Actually you have your most recent podcast is about  Ford bought a tesla at a great expense. They you know on retail and tore it down apparently  And uh, I have to listen to this. What did ford learn from the tesla?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll give you the sneak peek since we're about to publish next week's episode. Um, they learned about updates that the big  Learning they had over the air updates over the air updates and how to how to communicate that with drivers and  I feel like something else, but that was no, that's huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had a ford mustang for a long time and I never updated it even though there was an update process  But it required going to your computer downloading software putting it on a usb stick bringing it to your car  Going through the menus which are arcane at at best

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And uh, I never did it for that reason I remember being at uh, actually it was a giga home conference  That stacy was at i'm trying to remember which one now and I was talking to someone. I can't remember who but  the ceo of some big  tech company it might have been  Sonos. Anyway, I can't remember if stacy was there but we were talking about tesla and the over the air updates  And he said that he I think he was living in  Europe or something and he said the car kept grounding out on the cobblestones  Because the ground clearance was too low suspension problem  So the air suspension. Yeah, so he emailed elon  And elon said i'll fix that and the next over the air update his car car's ground clearance increased brilliant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But more than that, I think this is an internet of things issue as well  And we've talked about this on our security show  Um when you start putting all these devices in your house and there will be security flaws  I think of the ring doorbell which had a security flaw somebody could steal your doorbell and to do and from it get your internet  Uh, you know your wi-fi password and your access codes and that would be a problem  So before that was even published  Ring updated it over the air and nobody even knew that they had this capability  And if anybody's going to build an iot device if they don't build in over the air updates  Yeah, don't buy it don't buy it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The the four guys we talked actually about their security of the show  But there's kind of two things to think about with over the air updates in the automotive world for the longest time  They were verboten because they didn't have the security measures in place  And they didn't want to leave basically. It's not an open port, but the equivalent of a greater surface area for attack  the other thing is  For over the air updates to work just in general  You have to actually build your device a little bit differently and this is like what's been happening with all the old school routers  You have to make it so when you update the air and updates the software  That the device doesn't have to be like turned off and rebooted and all of that  And that's actually something you have to decide like at the very beginning. So  We're going to see more of it  But you know the security stuff you've got to think about you've got to think about it from a design when you're building this stuff too. So  It'll be a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I guess the president's limousine probably doesn't have  Over the air updates which would explain how it got stuck  On a ramp in ireland. Did you see this video? Did it? No. Yeah watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw them do a like 10 point turn in the middle of a road here comes this thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's armored so it weighs like 18 tons here comes the beast they call it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Grounded out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stuck

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was gonna say it's armored in the back that guy behind him pushing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It weighs like what happens though what they do, uh, let me let's show you again because it's just funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, I guess the president got out and hitchhiked and they figured it out  Um, have you ever done that I think you get a tow truck is what you get

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was gonna say do they have a special tow truck just for the presidential limo?  Because that thing's like you said, it's heavy. Yeah, 40 tons. Everybody's getting out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They should have those shock absorbers where they can inflate them or deflate them or an ejection seat

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure they have an injection seat potus has been a little drastic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm gonna keep watching to see if he suddenly flies out of the room

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The pr department steps in and has this man van move in front, um, yeah, yeah, because they don't really want any more pictures

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here comes potus. Uh  That is quite embarrassing. Yeah, let's just uh, let's just block the view and uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody usually they usually they drive those routes in advance, but I guess maybe they didn't account for the ramp

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't account for the president being in the back seat probably or maybe he's got an advisor who's a little heavier

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chris christy was joining him for that particular. That's right. Oops. I wasn't gonna insult any particular person

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know I was rude. I'm sorry. I apologize. You're nicer than I am stacy. I i'm very nice  Hey, uh, they are continuing by the way as we speak they're continuing the facebook, uh, earnings call is going on  Right now and as they do the earnings call we're learning some more information. Uh  The total uh monthly active users is even higher than we said  1.65 billion. Whoa  1 billion monthly, uh date 1 million daily active users on  mobile  That's not everywhere that's mobile according to mark zuckerberg more than 1 billion people have been using facebook daily on mobile  The average slightly below that  They are also restructuring. They're adding a c class of stock because mark wants to give away money  And he doesn't want to dilute his shares and the attitude of the management is look you like how we're running the company, right?  Well, if you want us to keep running the company you have to have this new non-voting class of stock  Otherwise, we're gonna dilute mark shares  He says I won't sell more than a billion dollars worth of stock a year  Wouldn't that be nice me neither me neither. Wow, you got that pledge

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's been amazing actually this is something a lot of people don't  Pay attention to I don't think but from the from the minute facebook went public  Mark Zuckerberg effectively controls that company single-handedly. Yeah, so not just through the stock  He controls the board as well because he's got proxy votes from a bunch of other co-founders  So he and of course, he named people to the board. So it's not just control of the stock. It's effectively control of the entire  company going forward

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And as anybody who watches silicon valley, which is the tv show where I learn all about how this stuff works  You can get just like that. Let your board. Yeah, it's just like hooligan. You don't want to get  By the way nucleus he closed. Oh, i'm sorry. That's a spoiler never mind  Uh, they also said, uh, the game of thrones 360 degree video that was put up on facebook last week has drawn more viewers  Than any video they've ever shown before

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also, uh said that they will be they gave an advice an advisory just as apple did last quarter  That they can't continue to grow at this pace  Because pretty soon everybody will be a member of facebook  Yep, um, but they said this is a way off  This is a way of video watching on instagram up 40 percent year over year. This is sheryl sandberg  Coo now on the call

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's incredible net income  1.5 billion  Was double what it made during the same period a year  Wow, that's kind of company that size. Yeah double to double that's  To double. I mean apple's the only one I can think of that's done that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It really is mind-boggling the addition of leap day this year, this is how this is how much money they make  Added two percent to this year's returns

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One extra day a year

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In relation to last year, so, you know, yeah, we made more this year, but there was leap day. Don't forget  Uh average this is a big one the average price per ad up  Five percent in the first quarter alone impressions  up 50 percent

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whereas I remember google's  Price per ad has been going down falling. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that branding versus  Tactically exactly you're on to it programmatic. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So leo have they reached out to you to offer to pay you to do?  facebook live

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How no, I know jeff you've been you're all in on facebook live. How about you?  Oh god pay me. No, of course not  They don't have to pay us. We'll do it anyway because we're yeah publicity whores  So I did buy that mevo camera that you talked about jeff and we shut we saw that at nab last week and uh  What you think of it in person?  Going to be pretty interesting  It's from live stream. These guys know what they're doing. Uh  And uh, you know, I think it's I haven't got it yet, but uh, the demo is very impressive  You can use an ipad. This is the camera that has 150 degree  view 4k view but streams 1080p that means you can use any  Portion of the screen as the current screen so it allows with one camera that doesn't move  Not only can you  Switch and you switch on an iphone or an ipad, which is wild, but it can also do face tracking so you can move around  And it will it will look like there's a camera operator will pan. Yeah, how much is it?  Uh three nine now three nine. Yeah, so wow, that's amazing breakthrough breakthrough. I'm telling you  telling you there's uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook lives are very interesting. Would you would you use that for for not for shows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think facebook live lends itself to the kind of shows we do well with that with that camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um  Well, that's another discussion because that's interesting  I think I think there is a chance for interactivity through facebook live and and new discovery and new audience  And the live part  That you've discovered, you know as just one element, you know a small element but an element of the show  I think also works on facebook live, but this is a different question  Is the output of that camera? It's designed for facebook live, but it didn't have to be facebook live  No, no, in fact, you could stream the live stream as well  Right, so only those two record it and and so the question is it becomes an incredibly cheap location talk show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe right. Yeah, we'll see i'll have to use it. Yeah, I know we'll see but it'll be it'll be really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah for my students  To be able to produce a show just using yeah, I mean I wasn't focusing on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I really think the most interesting thing is facebook live itself as a platform for broadcast  Uh, and you know, it's funny because twitter in their quarterly results talked about the  Periscope  And uh, I think I'll have to look at the numbers, but I have a feeling I seem to remember that that isn't particularly holding  up very well  Facebook's gonna eat them alive and it's funny because they had the first first mover advantage twitter did with periscope

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but they just don't have the scale. Yeah, they don't have messenger. They don't have daily users. Yeah messenger

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whatsapp, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are getting ad revenue twitter is getting ad revenue out of periscope. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What if facebook came to you leo and said we'll pay you 250 grand  I think that's their current offer to some content creators really to use facebook live. Would you do it in in well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You mean exclusively?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it's exclusive  It says 250 000 for 20 live video posts per month. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who's getting that they're paying a lot more than that to buzzfeed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, maybe they are. I don't know  for the watermelon videos

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  Oh man, if if if I were facebook, I would I would really be reluctant to pay anybody anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The argument is they're they're um  Mimicking the revenue that they presume to get right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh because you can't put ads in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not yet when they figure out advertising they believe that  These these producers will end up making more and it's the way to get a critical mass

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that would be an audience that would be a problem for me then because i'd be replacing existing ad revenue, right?  Well, yeah, that's for that for that. So I might create a new show  I know you were thinking jeff of doing the the new show which by the way is currently in beta the dot nyc show out of  the cuny  Studios, it looked great this morning. I the video quality was superb

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the other guys did a great job don't ask us to pay you a quarter million dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So for the rights to stream hey, hey  If yeah, let me put it this way if facebook comes along and does off you that take it

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Take it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's 20 shows a month. Those a lot. That's four shows a week. I mean five shows a week. That's a daily basically a daily show  Could just be a post well  Yeah, so tell I can't imagine people going into their facebook page and sitting for half an hour to watch a show. Can you?  I think it's better for short form more personal stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's I go a couple things one is facebook allegedly is going to like to leave a leave a video screen on your screen  All the times are you how they do it? Well, i'm not sure but second  I keep on going to the story of jorge ramos from una vision  who  Uh did four  Broadcast from the new hampshire primary adding up to 75 minutes four and a half million views  Now how long there were I don't know good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But people well and there's also the issue of how facebook counts views right a view is three seconds  A view is you scrolling by it  Three seconds so I just viewed this uh this video by scrolling by it  I just viewed this video by scrolling by it. Did I get anything out of it? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But imagine if there was a sort of video player sitting up in the corner  You could watch a show and be scrolling through your feed at the same time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, you know our experience is that people we make all of our shows or video can be streamed live or watched  As video later. It's still a fraction of the total audience unless the show is particularly visual  Most people have time for audio podcasts  But not for video

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a especially with gadgets. There's a big opportunity though. I mean well look at what fox or look at fox is doing right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because that needs video you're right you're right stacey because you want to see that  Yeah, right, but here's the difference if you put a gadget video on youtube  You're going to get such a huge amount of traffic from search  Will you get the same traffic on facebook from search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it depends on who like if you've got if you're a page that has  A million people then probably yes. I mean I can  we just launched a facebook page for my stuff and  The amplification is really impressive. I mean and we're starting from a teensy itsy bitsy base  So if you're like the new york times or someone I gotta think that you can do super well  What you don't get though is the data you don't get your user data and you don't know who's watching it again  You're basically sacrificing all of that information

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we're gonna get great promotion within facebook. Yeah, and we don't the only reason we want data is we want numbers for advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I gather we wouldn't  Although they've said this is the vox blog circuit breaker. It's it does have a presence on the vox  on the verge home page, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stay there for a second stay with us because I I read that vox was going to do a facebook-only blog  I got all happy, you know, let's try this out folks in media  I've been arguing to media companies to try this vox is ahead of it  They do it  So then I look at it and I click on something and it goes to a web page on on and I get all upset  I said what's that? What's the big deal? But of course, I'm an old fart who still uses the laptop  If you use a mobile no, it is fully in instant articles  It's here's the funny thing. I had a long conversation with john herman  Now the new york times and twitter about this trying to get my head around this  Where the problem is I think with the architecture of instant articles right now, correct me if i'm wrong  Is that it was basically an rss feed there has to be a web on mobile, but there has to be a web page  For the old farts and so you you don't really experience it totally on facebook  Which I think is kind of silly at facebook. I think they should create something  but  The short term that answers your question at least for that kind of content leo because you end up having to have a website and that has  um seo then

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but they said the focus is basically facebook but it's straight from facebook, right custom video that will only exist on facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it streamed from your from your website or is it streamed from facebook stream from facebook, isn't it? Yeah, you post it  so what you don't get is  uh  numbers that have  You get facebook numbers is all you get is whatever facebook deans to give you  Which to my knowledge so far is nothing so that wouldn't be any help at all in selling  Uh advertising for us even if they allow it and apparently they do allow it right or is circuit

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is there ads are there ads? Oh, yeah, there's ads there and and you keep 100 of the revenue if you sell it  And you can do ecommerce as well. You can do affiliate links  And you can do video ads there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's fairly try and imagine try and imagine the facebook's nine billion video views or whatever  Imagine when they do turn on  Video ads just i'm trying to picture that now  What is going to happen?  I mean the ban of ad revenue is going to be mind-boggling. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, you'd be nuts not to take advantage of this platform, but you'd also be nuts not to protect yourself because  It isn't your platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right, right, which is which is the the sort of  tension that media companies are wrestling with a  Everyone wants to be on there because you've got access to billions of people  But it's a black box facebook gets to control who sees your content and when the algorithm runs in ways that  We don't understand  Um, so this is a this is a show that was live

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Essentially a video podcast. I don't see this kind of stuff doing very well. I agree with you stacey if you're showing me  Which I don't see them doing a video of a product  You know like a marquez here. Here's one a marquez brownlee style review. This is a phillips hugh stuff and they're doing it right  the uh aj style  Captioning even though I don't have the sound turned on  all of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, kevin and I are looking at doing something like that for like as an adjunct to the I would  Yeah, because we talk about all this stuff. It's just I gotta learn to edit video. This is non-trivial video production. I should point out, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's fancy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But some of that's phillips b-roll

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you need oh sure it is but still you have to you have to edit it and put it together and put captions on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I don't even need to go for a sort of sham. Wow kind of thing you and kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Low production values, I think I fit totally in the sham. Wow mode. I'm like, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is what I kind of think this  In my opinion what would fit this meet you have to make your content fit the medium, right?  Is I mean these should be short. They should be punchy. They should be emotional and interesting like viral videos in general  Certainly anything the kind of content I do is not well suited to this at all if you ask me  I don't care if this persistent video screen or not. That's not what people want on their facebook feed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They want viral hits, but it might become what they want. Yeah, I mean, it's hard to tell what people are going to do  with video  I mean I look at things like  snapchat and  i'm constantly kind of  Reminding myself that I  Suck at predicting what people are going to do and that's true  And so I look at things like snapchat and I think no one's ever going to do that and then as it turns out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hundreds of millions of people are going to do that if I were facebook and lord knows i'm not that lucky in life  um  Versus that you know google did its its european blackmail fund in media  I would I would uh do an investment fund where facebook doesn't own the content because you can't do that  I really believe that but that says well, this is basically a venture fund come start a new media property on facebook entirely  You won't have to do production. You won't have to do you know, who did that sales? You know, who did that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube how did that work? How'd that work for you? Exactly. Remember that 100 million dollars  Yep  Remember that they went to brands. They had the youtube studios. They didn't work out. They gave out 100 million dollars different

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right. That was that was going to big brands trying to do this. I would say that wasn't just big friends. It was geek and sundry

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh a lot of people my size, uh did it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the problem was that youtube didn't have the social layer, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's facebook has well people use face people live on facebook  They don't well, maybe people do live on do they live on trolls live on youtube leaving horrid comments  I don't know my kids live on youtube, but they know what they're looking at. They're looking at music, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, mine's watching minecraft videos or minecraft. Yes, right mine is too. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, michael our 13 year old will watch minecraft videos just auto play through. Yeah. Yeah  That's his tv. He never watches tv. I've never seen him watch tv  Yeah, my kids only watch tv

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Years after it's been on tv. So they're currently watching I think the office like the first year. Oh, how fun I envy  So it's like everything is  I mentioned it in at the journalism thing in perugia. It's like everything has become unstuck in time. So time  Has no meaning anymore. They're watching shows and videos and listening to music that it might be from  Six months ago. It might be from five years ago. It might be it has no  Time has no impact

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  no  That's okay. I'm going to take it back to twitter just because I feel obligated to but that's kind of one of the downsides with  Periscope on twitter is it only lives there for 24 hours. So  you're like, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Crazy, I wish I could have seen that. Yeah, but it's over. Well, isn't but okay. Facebook's a stream too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean you don't go how far down do you go on facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't spend a lot of time on facebook. I don't know how long their video their live videos last

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they last but they they scroll off like just like twitter does they?  But you can find them but the algorithm shows them too. I don't I would be willing to get you could find them in other  I mean, I guess you could find twitter stuff too or you go to the person's page  Yeah, no, they're okay. If you go to their page, then there's less noise but still scrolls off  I I feel like that's not how people are going to use face spell again. I i'm probably as bad as you know  You're guessing that we're all use anything. We're old  But I think that they my guess would be that and this is what we learned on twitter  By the way is you don't try to see everything you just go and you you dip in and you dip out  And then whatever's there is there and whatever's and and facebook and facebook knows this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why they spend so much time curating the algorithm. I'm terrible at that. I actually you read try to scroll back  Try to scroll back. That's because you're old  Yeah, you're a complete and i'm kind of a complete  But like I missed something. What if I miss you haven't gotten over that yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's like matthew's value add though. I mean if you follow matthew on twitter, you're gonna know exactly what's happening last week all the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's back  My daughter is following me again. In fact, don't we get angry when we see stuff?  We already saw on facebook. That was last week's meme. What are you talking about the dress for?  Or no one from four months ago. That's even worse. Yeah, but seriously so that confirms what i'm saying, which is and that's you want the latest

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry, go ahead. It's like a glitch in the matrix like it's the algorithm is yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Glitching somehow. No, it's because some of one of your friends reshared

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what does that mean for anyone who's trying to I mean  I'm just thinking about like creating a gadget review on that, you know, how then do people find the gadget reviews?  That's what i'm saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why youtube is a better platform for that and there and get and the seo on gadget reviews on youtube is very good  You should you know, you should do reviews the philips hue lights  You won't believe what happened when we turned them on  And and and the seo and actually the seo doesn't matter about you won't believe what happened what that's facebooky  What matters is the cue that the the um keywords of hue lights people search for  Because on google you go to google and you say I want to know about the latest sony  a7  Uh s2 camera and you're gonna see youtube videos actually i'm not but  Normally, you would see youtube videos in a carousel right at the top  And that's how people find their gadget reviews. That's why gadget reviews on youtube are so strong right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But facebook you're at the mercy of the algorithm they decide  Who whether they show people your clip or not based on criteria we don't understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just proved myself completely wrong because it's not working  You're you picked a really esoteric. Okay, I guess so I guess so, you know, I know what it is htc 10  Review how about that?  Because that's what people would search for now. I get the guardian and there's youtube

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No carousel though. No carousel. Well, that's just weird  But but seriously that's very likely where you're gonna go. I don't even care who that is  I don't even I may not even know who did this review  It's not about brand at all  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and in a way that's kind of the problem  Broaders broadly speaking with media right now as a whole a lot of it comes through  Platforms like facebook and google and twitter, right? That's why a lot of people have no clue  Right who the person is  What like why they created it? What else they do these these bits of content just show up?  And there's no context and there's and maybe they enjoy them or not  But they enjoy them on the platform and they don't click and they don't go to where the thing came from. Why do you think we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do youtube, but we don't spend any it's we don't count on it at all  Because that's not for a brand like ours  That's not where the traffic is going to come from it's going to come from people who  Seek us out by brand  Which is probably so old school that will die any minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's coming back though. Like it's so old school  That it's probably coming back. I got some rides like 80s fashion. Yeah, I got some great. It's like  flood pants and because because the only way  For people to find your stuff  Is is through something approaching word of mouth, right and maybe that word of mouth comes through other platforms, but the content consumption  Can't all happen on those platforms or you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Effectively get nothing and that's why I am always really kind of nervous about the power that google and facebook wield  in this space

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well in in the lineup, I think there's something about  Amp pages showing up in the google news carousel gotten worse and worse. I'm you know, what jeff's not worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's that's that's better  What we need is amp stuff to start showing up in the carousel  Still bothers me what I want to see is amp showing up for the blue links  That anything in news the amp should should like it shouldn't no no, we don't want jeff your misunderstanding

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't want that you did what this is is google is continuing to do what I was very worried  They would do which is favor amp content. They favor fast content. No, they do not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The that is another favor I am that's a die because of the right hear me out here  They've the problem is that the carousel favors amp content. Well now google news favors amp content  Well, that's another carousel. They just another carousel right? Fortunately google news doesn't is important at all, but  Is is that is that is that any fast content should be favored including in blue links? Well google even says

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fast is nice, but it's not a huge signal for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I've said that to them. It's clearly a huge signal because they're not favoring fast they're favoring amp  Yeah, and they said I had this discussion and I defended google against that charge of just favoring amp  But then they say oh we don't but de facto the carousel is and amp is promoted the carousel is promoted ergo  Yes, google promotes amp  Uh, especially and they've got to fix that and now they're doing it news

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which you know was exactly the thing I was worried about frankly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On the phone roll out to next step so they're gonna also gonna roll out the blue

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, it must be doing on the phone. You're right stacey because I don't see it on my desktop, but  Who uses google news on mobile then? I mean it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but i'm just thinking about  In the google google now the stories they promote right those aren't amp yet and most people aren't looking  They will be the web no i'm saying most people aren't looking on the web

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So no no google now would be a really good place to put it wouldn't let me just see if we're getting amp

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, i'm not getting it there. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I don't  I don't see it there t r u and how long before google does that right?  That's my problem. Well, here's what's really gonna happen with amp leo. It's it's again. I've said this before it's not about news  it's about a faster web  And amp is going to spread past the news business and past google news and past everything and it's going to become a standard for faster web

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Period I hope so. I hope so. I mean the best part about amp is that it's open  I mean that to me that's not just a sales pitch  You know, that's that is one of the benefits compared to say facebook instant articles where so I have a very fast web

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I don't have any ad tech on my web page at all and we've done everything we can to optimize the web page  blah blah blah  Should I I have to now go amp just because I want to be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Priority on google. That's what that's what i'm saying is that well, that's bs  Yes, I agree google has to set a speed standard as a monopolistic attitude and however you reach that speed standard. Oh, that's fine  Oh, yeah, but that's not what they're doing. That's what i'm trying they should do. I'm trying to i'm reading this article

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not clear on whether they have changed it  Originally it was just  Based on speed and so if you achieve that speed through your own tricks or you achieve that no not in the carousel  Then you get preferred. So this is specifically amp

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is amp yes because because matthew I defect because because the accusation was made they were going to favor amp and I went to google  I went to jingras and he said no we favor speed  Right, but that didn't count the carousel because the carousel was there in the beta days to showcase what amp could do. Oh fine  But now amp it's the sole  Structure for amp and that's that's not good  That's not what it should be it should be a standard for speed  That you can meet multiple ways and amp is one way to meet it and then i'm fine with it  And and it needs to be a truly open standard with open governments, which they're getting say they're getting to but the sooner they get to it  the better

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, congratulations because  according to ronan who is at moby forge  The average web page is now bigger than the download for doom  The original install file the original install for doom which was uh, what?  2.2 megabytes that can't be right must be 22 megabytes  Is now the average web page has increased in size  This graph goes from the beginning of the 2011 to the present to the point where it's crossing that that the doom line

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see  The guy also pointed out the average web page size is shrinking so it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's not  Growing that chart you just scrolled past shows it's now shrinking and it's actually getting better the gray are top 10 sites

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's getting better in the top 10 sites, but the yellow  This is by alexa rank, which is a questionable ranking, but the yellow is all sites. So  Only it's only getting better on the top 10 sites, right because they're paying more attention  I think uh  He doesn't say but I think it's 22 megabytes. Does that sound right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That sounds really well really large actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, wait a minute, let's see why doesn't he say what the average size uh in kilobytes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  2250 2.2 megabytes which fits because oh that's better. Okay, right ago. You're better at math than I am. Thank you hard zeros

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate zeros

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's I mean that's epic when you think about like mobile data consumption. Yeah, and everything  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that is kind of depressing news

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now you understand some good news. Yes, you want to talk about the comcast data cap expansion cheer me up  Sure, because today comcast said that they're going to raise their data cap  They hate when we call it data cap, but that um, it is  They're gonna raise it to a terabyte from 300 gigabytes from 300  When they introduced it in like 2008 it was 250 and then  People kept consuming more internet and they were like we're not going to move it  We're not going to move it and then they got kind of in trouble for some  Streaming practices, so they moved it up to 300 and we're like we're going to try a bunch of different things  and now today the day after the fcc was like  Yo charter time Warner table merger. No no data caps for you  So this is big i'm excited

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and a terabyte is probably enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guarantee in a year people will be complaining that a terabyte is so the issue really is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Comcast is in the business of selling you premium content over cable and what they don't like is people buying  downloading premium content over the internet  Right, and uh, so you can still do it along with this. They raise the cost of unlimited data  And they raise the well, actually the overage fees are still ten dollars for each additional 50 gigabytes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, and you it was 50 for unlimited in one of their trial markets

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, it was uh, so it says after the june 1st change  This is the arts technica article by john broadkin after the june 1st change fewer customers will need to buy limited data  But when the unlimited data, but when they do it'll cost them 50 bucks a month to do so instead of 30 or 35  So what's happened of course is that the cost of internet access has gone up?  In a clear attempt to make it the same in revenue as buying premium content over cable  So that it doesn't matter and you're a cord cutter, right stacy. I am does it save you money

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, it probably doesn't  No, I guarantee you it doesn't if you watch anything  Well, we don't watch a lot of tv  But I was just thinking that we're with google fiber and everything coming to austin  We're actually getting not competitive rates on broadband  But they're tossing in over-the-top tv for like 50 to like 50 to 60 bucks a month additional  which  Buying a hulu amazon and netflix. I mean amazon prime is kind of you would do that anyway  But buying those plus any other shows is kind of like, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you so you are buying the netflix you are buying some over-the-top streaming

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hulu  Netflix and the amazon prime so I get amazon video and i'm actually looking at doing like a stars or hbo

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now or yeah, so then won't that all be the same as cable seems like it would add up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've got about 30 bucks a month now in over-the-top fees

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right, but  Yes, and my husband subscribes to mlb live, which is like that's really expensive like 300  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if you really I mean nobody wants to do this math, but i'm i'm sure there's an actuary at  Comcast who was doing the math and told order for sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you I mean if you buy like shows, but i'm one of the i'm like your kids matthew  I watch things out of stream out of time. Um, I even go to the library and read dvds. It's crazy  I know old school  But i'm cheap

This is like my favorite panel on a long time. It's really fun. Thank you all for being here really great  Our show today brought to you by texture if you like magazines  I used to love magazines. In fact, there was but the problem was it's very it's an expensive habit and it clutters your home  Uh, you know, I there pretty much is always one article every month in  I was going to say s square, but there's never anything I ever want to read in s square. However in rolling stone  Or wired, you know, there's always one article. I always want to read  And then you know, there's the you know, sometimes I like to look at the gossip magazines  I don't want to really buy one  But you know if you if you buy rolling stone and wired and vanity fare every month  That's going to cost you like 15 20 bucks. It's expensive. Oh, you're going to subscribe  Well, the problem is you're you're subscribing to this magazine for one article a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do  Yes, you do use I do. Yeah, I do too. So  Android tv does that and now ios has an android tv remote app, which is nice. I also use the apple tv remote app  It's much better on the phone than the app is  And sometimes you lose the remote  But you never lose your phone. You always know where your phone is  I have remotes for every I even have remotes for like my ankyo ar  av receiver I have  All sorts of stuff in here  I like my remotes  Also, I have a whole folder remote software  Oh, wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know that's great though because then you've got to get your phone. You got to get your software

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or the folder I'll use the I know I'll use the remote if I've got the remote there  But but it's nice to have kind of a guaranteed access because there's nothing worse  Than getting up and changing something. Yeah, don't you hate that? No, there's nothing worse than wanting to get up and change something and not being able to  Right, you're stuck watching what's on because you can't find the remote  That that's a real problem  All right. I watch a lot of tv, please don't judge me  I i'm i'm not channeling my internet. I love the culture

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey I was gonna ask you about um, I think this is in the lineup when  When nest said it was gonna deprecate the was it revolve the revolver? Yeah  Oh, yeah, do you have any thoughts on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you not read my medium post?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, I want to hear what stacy said I did read your post

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so I think  I think it's a black eye for the industry. Yes, I think they could have handled it much better  Uh, I I talked to a bunch of people to find out how they sunsetted their devices  The options out there right now are creating like escrow for your code and open sourcing it  They did that for oh, I can't think of the device right now  They've done it for a couple devices and then you've got these like diehard engineers who work with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they'll keep smart things smart things did that they moved to a new hub, but they didn't kill the old hub

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They didn't kill the old hub smart things is kind of a wacky situation right now because they had some issues  but  There there's also  There's a couple things they they didn't communicate well with their users. They didn't say hey  We're sorry. This is going to happen when they originally did the deal  They didn't say they were going to shut it down when they decided to shut it down. They didn't actually tell everybody  I I had a revolve as a review user  And I actually didn't get a notice from them until like two days after all the kerfuffle started so  Whatever notification they were doing was really wretched  Which is why everyone was pissed?  And  I understand why they had to kill it. It's just the way they communicated it the way they  Refused to open it up. All of those things are kind of  Just stupid it's arrogant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I the other thing I liked about this piece is it revealed that stacey has a bizarre penchant for weird connected devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like the burg printer. Oh, that was the one that was open sourced if you go to jiffy. They're still  You can if you have a bird still use it  Theoretically, you have to work really hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you have to know how to use git?  Get that's the only problem, but if you can clone a git rip depository and build from source  You're golden. Well, there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They actually there's a couple people who are really very helpful on the little printer chat board  I was looking at them and i'm like, wow, they're walking like  Like 30 year old people who have no tech experience through this and what is this burg little printer? What is this thing?  So burg was a design consultancy and they built this thing  You basically went in online and  You filled out like oh, I want articles from the guardian. I want instagrams  I want this this and then like every day it would print out those things. I'm like groceries

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ribbon

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's yeah, it was it's totally like a wallpaper kind of thing like in terms of I kind of like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish I had one. I like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you probably could buy one real cheap

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it still works because they open see this is by the way  What revolve totally should have done is they should have open sourced the server and let somebody run the server

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what's the japanese word for  objects that are  kawaii kind of useful but  a kind of dumb  I'm trying to think of it. But so this fits like that  That word would fit kind of bizarrely fascinating. I mean, it's sort of useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was it was a concept but so this is kind of an interesting issue and I bet it's going to come up again because  Staples which actually launched their own hub  I think in 2013  I'd have to double check when they did it  but they're actually  about to make an announcement about that hub and i'm really curious how they're going to handle it because  they've got  probably  The last I saw they had about i'm going to say about 50 000, but that was at like ces in 2015  So if you think 50 000 staples connect hub customers are suddenly about to be to hear the fate of their home hub

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so what happened what happened with the revolve that last we heard we talked about it a few weeks ago was  That nest was going to give kind of refund some people their money

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was on a case case by case case by case  They didn't sell a lot of revolves they sold less than 10 000 of them so  They were expensive though really expensive  um  So that that was kind of the thing  that's the last we've heard of it other than the mean I don't think it would be so hard to keep a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Server running for let's say a thousand

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The issue there. There's a couple issues because it connects to so many other devices  When someone else's integration changed  Some person would have to go change that and from a security perspective. They've got to keep right  I mean, it's it's this is a huge issue for the internet of things. I mean revolve  I'm sad nest had a chance to really show the industry how to do something and they just screwed it up and haven't fixed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the words, right  I found the japanese word  It's it's chindogu chindogu. That's what it means. So chindogu. It means useless accessory  Oh, so it's a cool object that does something but is mostly useless

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are so many chindogu things in this business. I have so many of them like in my house. I want to make a note

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  note to self the chindogu podcast  the chindogu show  This work is working

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How long how it takes five minutes to come up with a word?  I think I think it's called age

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I  Know matthew's been googling it since he mentioned

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's it's just a it's just a simulation for what you're going to go through an older age matthew. It's like japanese

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wednesday actually I may be too late. There is an official  chindogu society  Yeah, it's a big deal. Uh-huh  Home of the international chindogu society  They even have the chindogu of the day  The hay fever the hay fever hat it's a great concept

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't I don't know why the image links are broken

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But apparently uh, this would be a great thing to have come out of your burg little printer every day  The chindogu item for the day. So there's one I just found one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a helmet that you wear on the subway and it has a suction cup that sticks to the window  And so it keeps you from falling forward when you fall asleep

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would I would need that for the airplane. That would be great  That would be amazing like velcro on the back it actually looks like a plumber's friend in the back

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The american version is kickstarter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kickstarter is the chindogu society of the united states  Absolutely. I bought for instance perfect chindogu the floating bonsai tree  I wonder if they got funded. I think they did because I think they took money out of my account  Uh, this is fun. So it's a it's a yeah, it's called air bonsai  It uh, it is a bonsai tree that uh uses it floats in the air  Very good stacy has obviously spent some time in the world of chindogu  Uh  It is a magnet  Powered device and thank goodness here. They are floating bands bonsai trees. They are now  a reality  And of course speakers made in japan  I'm so excited about this mine should come any day now  There's a good one that's one I have I own that's the one yeah, i'm the ostrich  Pillow the show the ostrich pillio. Yeah. Yeah. I have it  Okay, one little note it if it leaks and it did spring a leak  That's not good  Tiny little that would be bad tiny little staticky foam pellets just  Now what could go wrong though with a floating bonsai tree? I think that this is  This is going to be a good forever  Okay, just rotates in space  What a weird place what if it grows off the taxes?  Shut up  Don't don't bring up problems that don't exist  physics  damn, you physics  Um  I'm trying to buy we're all distracted now. I'm on ebay trying to buy a burg little printer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, i'm looking at chindogu

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If we're distracted what's our audience doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're like show us more weird crazy gadgets, yeah, i'm telling you the chindogu show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This should be the chindogu show. I want to do that. I think it already is  I think it's devolved a little bit a little bit anything to say about twitter. Uh  Yeah, I mean the verge's article kind of said it all nothing twitter is doing is working

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the weird thing though. I I didn't write about it  But if I had written about it, I would have said  Some things worked so they added users for the first time. That's right in like a year five million new users  That was the last thing that everyone was beating up on them about including me  Yeah, but it's only figured out five million. They figured out how to add new users  But then so it's it reminds me of people someone's spinning plates  So they get one plate going and and then another plate falls to the ground and they have to start it again  So they got new user growth working, right?  But now revenues falling off the table and next quarter revenue will be substantially lower than they thought because they're moving people  Like their advertisers are moving to video ads and so they're not getting as much revenue from things like promoted tweets  So it's like the target keeps moving, you know, the the goal post keeps moving

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and  Periscope continues to shoot sideways video which really didn't help

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The earnings call well, it was upside down last time if you remember the last earnings call it was upside down  So it's actually getting better  It's gotten one sort of rotation. I was like next time it'll be it'll be right next time. It'll be perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's for it's 45 degrees better every time  And that's and that's all we care about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually thought it was a joke the first the last call when it was upside down. I thought someone was pulling my leg  It was just holding their phone right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're literally holding it wrong  This is a good line from jack dorsey  Asked about facebook dorsey said we've been doing live for 10 years. We believe we have leadership potential  He meant  Leadership position, but maybe that was a freudian slip could have been a katenda

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He had potential I could have been somebody  Instead of a two-bit bunk, which is what I am

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Talk about their deal with um the is it the nfl i'm not a sports ball person

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, so did they talk about how that worked? Oh, no, they said they want more of them though

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're going after other sports as well. It was a remarkably good deal 13 million dollars for 13 wells, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah, because they're effectively just rebroadcasting right? So this is very clever of the nfl  the nfl effectively sold the same rights  That they sold to two broadcasters. They sold them again right to twitter. You know what we say. It's incremental income  And I don't understand so  We were talking about facebook live and whether that's the way people are going to use facebook  Is someone going to watch a whole football game streaming on twitter? Yeah, it's a link

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a link. No, it's not only watch it on it's well, but but you know what i'm saying? It's it  That's the equivalent of what it is  It doesn't it doesn't fit into the experience of twitter in a way that you might as well you just takes over your screen  You watch it. How is that twitter? It could be so awesome though for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if they did tools for like instant gifts or like  Being able to chunk segments out like almost editing. I don't think the nfl is going to ever do something like that  But that's like that would tie into how people share things right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Definitely. Yeah, definitely and you know, that's the same thing is you got to be native to the platform  That's what I was saying about facebook doing that so giphy I wrote about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Giphy raised a bunch of money there. They've effectively created a content studio  They're the ones who who do a lot of that's interesting for sports leagues and for first tv shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're effectively gififying everything. It's a you know, it's a consumer product because it's a keyboard but it's all free  It's uh, you know, you can embed gifs on various various messaging platforms  But but the money like buzzfeed the money is in making gifts social gifts

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For brands so they have teams of people who go  And help the morons who run the oscars create gifs of their content  And now they're effectively building a content studio that will just gifify everything. I bet you producing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  movie stars would pay them  To make you know, like here's the channing tatum. Can I at least give you an awkward hub gif?  Very useful right and that's that's that's an ads evergreen, man

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I gotta think like jimmy fallon has like a gift master right just pulling stuff. He's got to sure. Can we talk about talk show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, let's talk about talk show but let's take a break and then talk about talk show. How about that?  Sounds good because uh, we're getting up on the two hour thing and I don't I don't want you to turn into pumpkin  But uh while i'm doing this ad stacy you might want to run and tell your daughter  To dust off the gear vr because you can now play minecraft on the gear vr in three there you go  Look at that. Oh, baby. Actually, I can't wait. I'm going home and doing that. That's what i'm doing tonight  My wife gets mad at me when she thinks she sees me wearing the gear vr. She thinks i'm watching porn, but i'll tell her no honey  i'm mining  i'm i'm uh, i'm  Harvesting my my wheat it's minecraft porn  It is kind of that's awesome. You have to buy it though. It's an additional seven bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can't get out of here. I'd buy it instantly. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will i'll go home and buy it tonight  Of course galaxy phone not not not included  Our show day brought to you by zip recruiter if you're in the business of hiring whether you're a sole proprietor  Or you're the hr person  uh, you it's you have the  You know you have my respect you have the most important job in any company is is  Building the company putting the company is made at the people  Who work there and it could be a great thing or a bad thing depending on who you hire  it's also the most challenging because  How do you find that right person?

So talk show is uh is an interesting idea  Uh, I don't know if I would ever use this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was my question for you guys. Yeah, y'all seem smart group chat sort of a public group chat

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it comes from the the insight that what you see and you see it on instagram and facebook a lot you see people's  Private text conversations which they've screenshot and put on there like here's as an example  This is from the sippies medium article a chat between taylor swift  and ed sheeran  Okay, this the fact that you can look over the shoulder and see what tatey and ed are talking about is cool  And then it's so cute  Let's go to sleep. I'll talk to you soon says tatey ed says in a bissel swizzle  She says like you said ed  He says that's okay tay and then the punchline you think for multi-platinum lyricists. We'd do better  That's on instagram  on taylor swift's account  Well, imagine  if you will  a messaging app that simplifies the process of  Saying funny things and then making them public

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that is what this is that's what this taylor and ed sheeran ever do that well i'm sure they're hoping

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're they're publicists might have them do it if it's a big deal. I mean  That's but that's what i'm curious about i'm like, who is this aim dad?  Is it like snapchat and i'm just too old to understand why this matters?  Could you because they talk about it like it's a  A talk show not a talk show like a podcast kind of thing just these quick moments. You would have a show. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't I mean so it feels to me as though  I mean that happens on twitter, right? We see people having  conversations or arguments mostly on twitter and we all get to watch  That's kind of I think what this is right? This is it but it's invite only right?  So then only some people would be able to see it. No, no, you share it publicly if you want you share it  Yeah, and it's ios only though so far. I think so anybody on the app would be able to so if you go to the home

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Screen of the app which I I don't I haven't installed. I don't have an ios device here  Somewhere. I must have one. Um, you will see just like periscope. You will see promoted  Okay talk shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean it feels to me as though  unless you're gonna get  A bunch like unless Taylor swift and ed sheeran and a bunch of others are going to start using it. What is  What's going to pull people into that network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're already 15 different sexing different chat apps sexting how long before it goes to sexting public sexting? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll be like the chat roulette. Yep. How long before that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, everything gets there sometime. So i'm not saying it's not interesting. I'm saying is it going to be no  A service that people will actually use

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't feel like i'm not I think the only reason it's getting any attention is uh,  Because of michael sippy, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, I was very curious about he was with twitter. Well, he was vp a product

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Guy and and it's it's well designed from what I can tell i'm just not  Clear on how the use case is different enough from lots of other things

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so so you know a trend is any two things that we see but i've seen a  Company in stealth so I can't talk about it but from you know an old friend  That also tries to fix twitter in interesting ways  You know, I think that's that's a  Really interesting that that there's something about twitter that's out there just not working and twitter is not fixing itself  And so are there opportunities to start a new twitter and fix it not to remember branch field. Yeah, I don't mean that branch  Well, it was a similar idea. It was to take conversations

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Into a different place because twitter wasn't the best place to do that. That was a little high

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Brilliant guys was a little highfalutin. You know, let's have a serious conversation here as opposed to uh,  Hey, k

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This feels kind of like vines but it also feels like not organic at all which texting feels  So like a conversation is kind of organic. So do you like I mean am I like matthew?  Hey, let's do a talk show about the industry

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right, right exactly stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean again going back to my  Inability to tell whether something is going to be dumb or massively huge  I mean this could be it could actually fit some sort of  Market desire it could fit a need that people have to to do something  quasi public  that's like chatting but  You know, not just them. I I don't know to be honest. I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, dude facebook actually didn't they just add like a group messenger or something  I just got stuck on like this. It's like being on conference call or something awful  Um or a group text. See that's the downside

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean you get added to those things. I got added to group dms  randomly and uh, yeah, it's horrible. Do you think so that uh people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Children younger people who grew up typing on a phone  Not us obviously because it's only a few years old but  Uh are more comfortable with typing on a phone than we are. I mean, I find that just a very painful  Communication, but maybe they love that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's all my daughters do right and snapchat and texting  Is my in fact our youngest who's 18 was  snapchatting me  Responding to a snapchat that she had shown me that was of her mother  So it's like meta levels of snapchat  Are happening simultaneously and then other people are texting her on snapchat about the thing that she just shared  So I can see if messaging is  Becomes the sort of main way in which you interact period  Then maybe maybe something like talk show makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, I think it's a non-starter  But for serious, I don't think anybody paid attention if it weren't sippy  Okay  Jeff you want to feel old?  The verge is going all squee about this 1993 hd footage of new york. It's just like being in new york in 1993  Ancient time. Oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's like these people didn't have a web yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Looks just like today they look like it too. Yeah, they look bored

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  um  They're all looking forward instead of at their phones. Look at that. Oh, that's oh, wow. That's a good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is a very good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not looking at each other and there's the world trade. It's new york. They're not looking at each other  Let's not let's not assume there's any intimacy involved now. Thank thankfully they have something to look at instead of just staring

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's wtc5. Wow, jeff knows that area

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This looks like battery park i'm not sure anyway fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean like the verge is like stacy hit the right observation on this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yay, have you seen the uh, have you seen the historical photo?  um, the caption is I hate this modern technology that's getting in the way of people communicating and it's  Men on a on a train car reading the newspaper  And everyone's reading a newspaper

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  uh jeff you spent some time on the uh, you said you spent some time on the train I imagine that you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Used to read the newspaper way back. Oh, that's what you pick up when your phone battery dies, right? Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah  So back to stacy's point have you seen the story from augsburg germany where they're putting  Stop lights in the sidewalk so that if you're looking down at your phone, you're gonna see

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They should they actually should have it like using like google's physical web or something  They should uh beam it to your phone. You get a notification walk now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The technology is getting there. Oh, yeah, they could just do it in the phone  Who needs uh, yeah that way I don't ever ever look up exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Didn't someone there was a there was software you could get that would effectively  Make your phone transparent it used the camera and showed you right what was behind the phone reality  So that you wouldn't walk into things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here it is. It's not really traffic lights. It's just and it's so people don't walk onto the train tracks  So actually that's probably which is probably a good idea. Yeah, it could use that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it turns red when you shouldn't walk right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  God if you're looking at your phone and walking on a train tracks  That's done when it's work. I think that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think maybe that's the germans are the germans the most amazing about the germans is is how they really don't walk. They don't jaywalk  No, there could be no car in sight not for two years. Nobody's gonna. I don't care. They're very orderly people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
