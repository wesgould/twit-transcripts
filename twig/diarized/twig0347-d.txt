Sure, we cover the  latest news from the Google  verse, Google verse, the  Facebook verse, and there's  gonna be some Facebook today,  some Twitter, maybe even a  little medium thrown in.  Joining me right now, my good,  my good buddy and professor of  journalism at the City  University of New York. It's  Jeff Jarvis. Hey, hey, hey, hey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twig. Hey, hey, hey, hey,  Facebook Live. We're trying  something. Facebook Live. You're  only hearing half the  conversation here, but what's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wrong? They should be hearing  the whole thing on where we have  the room bleed on here. So if  you go to Facebook Live people,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want you to watch me because  I have. No, watch me. I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  both audio streams. I want 252

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  viewers. I have 826 viewers.  Your fingers are longer than  mine. So this is the new this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they turn this on today, right?  And Mark Zuckerberg did a live  feed of it. Chris Cox did two

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  live feeds. He I see he was just  on on with Jorge Ramos and he's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the guy behind it. I think  Chris Cox is yeah, Craig. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and much, much, much, much credit  here to Fiji Simon. Seymour, who  is the head of she does all  kinds of product stuff,  including new stuff, but she's  been really absolutely no  to the grindstone since she got  back from maternity leave on  video. Now you might say this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a job with this. It's just a  me too product. I mean, because  this is mere cat and periscope  kind of did this too. In fact,  Facebook even did this Facebook  mentions, which was available  only to the who which camera I  should look at this camera.  Facebook mentions, which was  available only to the didgeridoo  for some time and then was open  to the public. But you had to use  a separate application. Then  they put it in Facebook. But this  is different. This is more like  mere cat or periscope because you  could see we've got comments  going scrolling up here and I can  I can I can do a thumbs up on a  comment. We also have up here  account and it's live. And I  should point out I'm doing this  on an iPad because you need IOS  to do it. It's not available on  Android yet, but it does work on  the iPad. And I should point out  that it's rock solid. If you saw  I mean, even periscope and it was  working for you too, right?  Well, show show. Yeah, show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you have your feed laptop  screen. Yeah. So go to your laptop  screen. You get me as if I'm on  compare the quality of that. Now  go to me on there. Now look how  much better the you look better.  Less pink I am and more human and  flesh colored on Facebook Live  than on Skype. Now what are you  using? I thought you didn't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  an iPhone. Right. So I'm using my

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  my Nexus 6P. The front face is  also it does work on Android. I  have using mentions. Oh, because  you're using the old the old  product, which has been upgraded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Looks like yours. It looks like  yours. Yeah, they've upgraded it  then. Yeah. But yeah, Skype is so

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  much worse. But because I'll tell

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you why, because Skype's doing it  in real time. In fact, we have to  use Skype so that you and I can  converse true in real time. This  is not a conversation medium.  There is about five, 10 seconds  groups. If you go to the post

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that announces all the new  features, one is they're going to  allow at least at least you can do  video to a closed group. I don't  know if you can do group talk or  not. So that's the this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  competing more than with just  Periscope and Meerkat. This is  also competing with Facebook's  Hangouts. If Google's Hangouts,  I'm sorry, Google Hangouts. Wow,  that's very interesting. Thanks

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so live for groups and events. So  maybe it's just to well, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  who's using it right now. It's kind  of timely. Loic Lemur, who of  course, says good friend,  entrepreneur, founder of Seismic,  which was, you know, video  messaging. He he did a conference  for years called low web in Paris  and he sold that he's now doing a  new conference called leaders le ad  er le ad dot r s. And he's he's  been streaming today from his  leaders conference in Paris with  some big names to read Hoffman.  So the week it's an interesting  way to do a conference, isn't it?  It really is. It really is.  Especially since he charged like  800 bucks to go see to go in  person. But you'd probably prefer  to go in person because you got a  chance to network and meet people.  And this I think is a great way to  promote an event. We've I mean,  look at everybody's now doing that  Google streams most of bio face or  Microsoft just stream most of  build. Of course, there you still  have an incentive to pay thousands  of dollars to go and do it in  person. But if you can't,  but if you can't, this makes sense  for conferences. He had Phil Libon  on the founder of Evernote, who's  now become a venture capitalist  that was earlier today. Pretty  impressive. You could also

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  broadcast just to a group. So like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a closed group you can invite

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  group on Facebook events. You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  why they do that though? They do  that for family, right? I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  imagine. Also companies. Don't  forget Facebook for work. They're  trying to push that. You know what

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Loic is not doing this as leaders.  He's as part of his leaders  conference. That's not till next  month. This is promotional for his  leaders conference. So he sat down  with Phil and they're doing a teaser.  And he's used he used mentions for  this. So is it I mean, look at  Meerkat went went bad periscope. I  don't see a huge adoption. I don't  see a lot of periscope videos on my  Twitter timeline. Why is this better?  Why is this going to do better than  that? Or even Hangouts? Google's  hangout power of Facebook. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right. I mean, I think I think that  these are people my friends. I'll  get a notification. I'll see what's  what. Um, the fact that they can do  it to a group. I think it's  interesting what I do this. The  problem is this is not Hangouts yet,  but it's not gonna take much for them  to do that. And then you also saw  they have a Facebook live map  journalistically. If something  starts going on in the world, you  know, you can go and find people who  are broadcasting live from events in  that location. Journalistically, that  will be huge. If you go to the post  Leo, the Facebook post first mentioned  down the page, you'll see the Facebook  live map. Oh, that's interesting.  And that that's not live. I don't  know how live it is now. They don't  promote every video that's on. They  just promoted some videos. Well, that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  was one of the cool things about  periscope is you could see a map of  all the different periscopes and you  know, join other people's periscopes  and so forth. If the idea is to build

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a community, I click on you. I click on  what looks like California. There you  are, Leo. Hey, California. How are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good to see you. But it's telling me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that you're live now. Yeah, I could  click around the world and go to  different live. That's kind of fun to  Elmas Cara is now live. That's  periscope did this to triplet is now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  live. But I wonder, I think one of the  cool things about this is I remember  when I was a kid, I used to listen to  shortwave radio. We've come a long way  in the intervening 50 years, but I was  so cool. I could listen and hear I'm  listening to Moscow. And now it's  yeah, I can watch a video from somebody  in St. Petersburg showing, you know, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  mean, and it's not as El Huff is live  right now from Senegal. Wow.  Stefano Procida is live right now from  somewhere in the middle of Spain, along  with Aline Giuseppe. How long?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How long? It's amazing. How long before  Facebook puts this in the right hand  column where it shows, you know, trending?  I know. So mouse over any one of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  dots. You'll find you on there. There I  am. There you are. And it's showing all  the people who are watching you and  where they're watching from. That. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  look at that. So it's drawing a line.  That is. Oh, man. Two people are watching  us in Hawaii, South America. Wow. We are  getting a hello. Hello, Southeast Asia.  Look at that. Wow. Australia. Three people  in Australia, one in Perth. Wow. That is  really cool. That is really nice. Now,  where do I find the map again? Go to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to the Facebook post to go to Facebook  live map. It's facebook.com slash slash

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  live map. OK, Facebook dot com slash live  map. Wow. So this shows the power of  Facebook really, because they can.  They've got the servers. They've got the  the community. They've got the network.  They've got everything and they can put  that together fairly instantaneously,  right? She's should they worry about the  content? Um, you know what I'm saying? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  mean, oh, yeah. Well, let me show you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo. No, please don't. Yeah, of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they're going to and I wonder what  they're doing about that. I don't think  we asked Chris Cox about that today. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the real names thing is going to help a  little bit, right? Yeah, because they

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yeah, if you if you if you mock up notice  I use an M there sort of right face.  Mock up. Yeah, they'll kill your account.  Right. Yes. So you don't want to you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  want to use this in a responsible  fashion. What there would be no  advantage. I'm still streaming, by the  way. I'm still streaming to the poor

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  people. By the way, if those of you who  are here all 271 on the base Leo, this is  the twig broadcast. You can go to  twit.tv slash live. Yeah. And you'll see  the real show. I'm just showing where it  won't be as much fun. Well, they're only  hearing me now. So they hear long  silences than me. So incidentally,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  somebody in the chat room. Thank you.  Carlos Contreras says the live map is in  the left column under apps. It's the  very first app listed. So you can that  with just another shortcut to go there.  The funny thing is there's a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  people if you look at the dots. Yeah.  With zero zero viewers. Well, yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they're not as famous as we are. No,  but wow, I just I feel like this is  really interesting technology. It's  fast. Yeah. So now I've got around the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  New York area. There's something called  Iraq News, and they're live with 253  viewers, tons from Iraq. Imagine I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is the beginning of a new medium  almost a new broadcast medium and in a  way that even though Periscope pioneered  it or more mere cat or, you know,  Justin dot TV pioneered it. This is this  is so easy and so many people are on  Facebook. I can only imagine what the  impact I mean, would CNN start using  this? Well, yes, they will. In fact, a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  lot of broadcasters if you go to the  Facebook live page at the bottom, you'll  see broadcasters been using it all day.  But the best story about this is  Jorge Ramos from Univision when he  covered, for example, the New Hampshire  primary, he did three broadcasts that  added up to 75 minutes, right? So there  were long broadcasts and he got four and  a half million viewers that. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, he's been using Snapchat and  all these media. But I think the  advantage of this is now I presume  after I'm done, this is saved on my  Facebook timeline. Yes, it is. This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  going to be a lot of really long,  boring video on the Facebook. My case  because it's one sided, but you don't  hear the people want to hear you and  all they're hearing is Steve Saylor,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  who's a good friend from the Toronto  area says we started using it at the  radio stations he works for. Makes  sense. Yeah. Um yeah, we'll use this.  Okay, so we're going to be at the  somebody asked. Are you going to be at  any be with this? We're going to be at  the National Association of  Broadcasters Convention next month.  In the live you booth. What is live  you? And it's a company that sells or  leases some very expensive hardware  that last you to live stream from  anywhere using the cell network. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um, wow. This is impressive. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chris Cox and Stephen says it's not  reached. The live map cannot be reached  from France. I don't know why that  would be, but but it's interesting  because in general this is a global  rollout, right? I think what do they say?  190 countries or something. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because people if you look at the map,  they're using it from everywhere.  Everywhere. Wow. Iraq weed is live now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is amazing. That is really  fascinating. We live in interesting  times. And then I guess the oh, I see  the reason you saw that is because it  had a pulsing blob. Yes, and that is  that is music from Iraq. Yeah, they're  featuring it. Maybe that's it. I guess  that's showing connections. I'm seeing  some featured stuff. Here's one from  Thailand. Um, 308 viewers. I hope it  doesn't devolve though to attractive  young women. You know, getting all of  the feeds but people especially males  being. Okay, well, Leo, that's that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's the difference, right? Why? How  are you going to discover a video in  general? You're going to discover it  because it's somebody who's already  involved with your feed in some way,  right? It's a news source that you're  following. This is another reason to  want to follow a news source. You're not  going to get it just because unless you  go to this map, even then it's so random  the map. I think it's a way to sample  what if you hit a few? Let's just watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what's happening. Okay, here's a  Anja Jackass born song from was that she  here from Wiesbaden. She's got she's in  the car. It looks like no, she's just  sitting in our living room. She's  speaking German or I presume so let's  she's smoking. Yeah, she quit smoking.  Put a comment in. Yeah, 372 viewers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm saying there Leo. Rauken ist

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  verboten. Rauken ist verboten. Okay, how  do I do that? Type that in. R-A-U-C-H-E-N.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got a comment somewhere. Yeah, somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She sneezed. I don't see how I comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Where do I comment? I can like it. Maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's over. No, it says live. Tell Karima  I've been told by people like Chad  Johnson people who work on Twitch a lot  that the key to success in at least  Twitch videos is to interact with the  chat room. Yes, I think I've learned that  for another venues. This is amazing. Yeah,  not a lot from Africa, but I don't know  this map. I don't understand. Obviously,  this isn't all of them because there must  be many, many more going on right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is brand new. I'm not so sure  it's no I don't think people discovered  yet. But since we've been on, the US has  gotten denser in the East Coast. You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  what I find fascinating is Facebook's  move into publishing basically. And  another story that broke today, Medium  has announced that if you want as a  publication to start using Medium as  your content management system, they'll  support you with ad monetization,  publishing to AMP or Facebook.  Instant articles. Instant articles. And

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  membership structure as well. So you  can have members and more of a community.  And I noticed they got the all move  there immediately standard and the all  both moved there. I think about 10  moving there. I'm going to a I guess a  press conference thing tomorrow here in  New York on it in the afternoon. Why? So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  first of all, of course, and we say this  all the time, I say it to you because you  publish a lot of Medium. If you don't own  your platform, then you're you know, at

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  have Williams Mercy. Well, but you know  what, Leo? So fine. You can have the  exact same conversation with The  Washington Post and Facebook. That's true.  Right. Because where are they getting  their audience? They're getting their  audience on Facebook. So where am I  getting my audience? I'm getting on  Medium. If I put some on my blog now,  what happens? Three readers and a bunch  of nasty comments. So the destination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't you rather have more comments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And better ones. Yeah. You know, I  put something up this week about about  artificial intelligence and journalism.  So I put it up on Medium and I put it  up on LinkedIn, which I don't do enough.  And I got, you know, different comments  there. And yeah, that's that's that's  that is life in publishing. Now you're  no longer a destination. People are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  trying somebody in the chat rooms trying  Victor notice trying to see if he can  get your screen up on one device and  mine screen on another. There is a  problem because I don't think the audio  is completely synced. So it will be a  little bit disjointed because there's  we're not in exactly what you can do.  You can you can get your Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  screen and put me up on the screen next  to your to your screen. Right. You can  do that in the studio. Yeah. Yeah. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to be have another way of doing  that. It's called a thirty thousand  dollar Trikester switcher. Dan Fouts  said that his phone alerted me that I  had gone live. He had liked my page. So  and he says his phone alerted him that  I had gone live, which is, of course,  that is huge, isn't it? Because  everybody wants to be a notification.  Well, remember this? What a mess that  was on Instagram a couple of weeks ago  where that when they added the, you know,  notify me that somebody's posted on  Instagram and all you saw for a whole  day or two was people saying, add me up  here, put and my notification. And  Facebook just does it with live video.  So medium. Tell me about this medium  platform. By the way, John Louie  Guiseis Monday Note has moved there.  Why would you I guess why would you  bother with using a WordPress or  block spot blog when you just put your  stuff on medium? There we are. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well, here's the larger way to look at  it. Right. Yeah. If you're a content  maker, that looks pretty damn good.  But the sink is bad. It's better than

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Skype. But that's because it's not it  doesn't have to be as good as Skype. Oh,  wow. Yeah. I mean, it doesn't have to be  as real time as Skype. Pretty filter on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  now got Vaseline on this lens. Doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  work. But they could do hangout styles.  You know what? If they did hangout style  streaming, that would be another nail in  the coffin. I mean, that's one thing  hangouts could do. You and I could be in  a Google Hangout together and broadcast  that we used to do that. Trey Radcliffe  did a show that way on the network a few  years ago. But we didn't we didn't we  didn't stick with it because we didn't  feel the quality was as good as it is  with what we're doing. Well, this is  pretty good. But it's still not I mean,  you know, you don't do can't do lower  thirds and all of that. Oh, Diane says it  came up on her Facebook News Feed. Would  that make sense? Say again.  I'm sorry, Jeff. No, I didn't say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. I thought you said say again to  somebody. I said say again to you. I'm  talking to you. I'm just nobody else  we're talking to. I'm talking to you.  Just you and me today, baby. So so so  medium. So basically, we thought our  business in the past in publishing was  that we had content, we had distribution,  right? We had production, right? We had  marketing, sales. Yeah, right. Yeah.  Basically, what it gets down to right  now is that we're not the best at  distribution. We're not the best at  marketing. We don't find audience for it.  We're not the best at ad sales because  we don't have critical mass and data  that we need. And so do you get to the  point where you just hand over your  business to these platforms? I went to a  I spoke to the board of the board this  week. And and there was was Jake from  Mike and one of the founders of Mike and  he told me something fascinating that  when he went to cover the refugees in  Europe, he made himself a calendar. And  the first day he said I'm going to all  periscope. I'm making up the specifics.  Next day, I'm going to all Snapchat and  have conversations with people. Next day,  I'm going to all Instagram and capture  it photographically. And and which gave  me a fright because I said are we  training our students to do that, right?  But it also says that what he's done is  is that he's reporting appropriately to  the medium to the audiences on those  media. The same, you know, big story, but  he's reaching them however he can best  reach them and doing it multiple  platforms. That's where we had. It is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  little bit of a compromise, though. So  I reminds me of the difference between  in a stereo system having components  that you carefully hand select to  integrate together or buying on all in  one unit or on a computer having like an  iMac, everything built into one unit as  opposed to different components. Your  sack, it's not the may not be best in  class. Probably best in class in  community building, certainly better  than what you're doing because you're  reaching out to others. Maybe ad sales,  you're sacrificing a little bit of  control, customization and probably  profit. Well, but hold on. So in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  instant articles deal, right, the  publisher, the publisher sells publishers  own ads. By the way, La Repubblica has a  great looking Italian guy. He's just so  perfectly Italian. Now you're distracted

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because you're watching Facebook Live.  Now I understand. I am. I was looking

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  around here and it's great. This guy is  just this, he has a lot of pasta. We had  in studio yesterday, we had 20 people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  from Italy from the Italian Chamber of  Commerce. They were going around to  businesses and they came to ours to  watch a tech news day and to a person.  They were gorgeous. All the guys, all the  women, they were put together. They were  well dressed. They were gorgeous. And I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  was not gorgeous, but he's but he's got  a look. He's got a look. It's a look. It's  a look. It's a look. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  I was distracted. Where were we? Oh, so  so is it articles? Yes. So if the  publisher sells publishers ads, publisher  keeps 100% of the ads. If Facebook sells  the ad, you get 70%. Which do you think  is a better deal? Say that again. I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to do the math in my head. If the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  publisher sells the ad, keeps 100% of the  revenue. Yeah. Facebook sells the ad, the  publisher gets 70% of the revenue. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wouldn't it be 100% of be a better deal?  No, because Facebook has sells better

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  data about the users, far more scale, can  sell at a higher value and more targeted.  I don't know this yet. I haven't had any  publishers who give me data yet, but I  can well see that the 70% could beat the  100%. Here's a radio show. Woody Woods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you guys. Smiley. We're watching him  at 98.7 the beat. By the way, I think the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  problem here is I can't comment on my on  my laptop. I'll bet you could comment on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  mobile. I can comment here. No, it says  write a comment. Yeah. Oh, okay. Oh, there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it is. There's a good back. So I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  know. It's maybe a little flaky because I  couldn't comment on the other one. Yeah.  And look, it puts puts more videos by him  down here. Man, if I were in radio and I  could dance like Woody. All right. You  know what? I'm going to you know what? I  have to stream my radio show now, don't I?  Boyman, I already do. God tickety. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  here Leo, here's a question. Here is a  serious question, right? Yeah. You have  sponsors. You have everything else. Why  would you not while we're making the show  forget doing it on the on the phone on the  iPad? Why would you not feed this direct  feed? Oh, can I do that? Yes, you can. Sure  you can. Your ads are John. Let's get on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that right now. Let's figure out how I  could I how could I feed our feed into  this? I think we just pointed a TV set.  But what would the what's the value add  there? Value is extra audience. Oh, because  they they stumble on it on Facebook. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now it's it's a it's live and then it's  archived. But your ads are still in there.  Yeah. All right. I see Alex Gumpel running

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  over to John. They're conferring by the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  end of the show. I bet you're going to be  the feed of the show will be on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is and this is they love a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, they're all excited. You watch Zucks  video, right? Maybe want to show again  because we did that before we were on  here. That ain't from a phone. He's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wait a minute. I'm being handed something.  What does this do? Does this? It's a  video cap. But what remember what I want  is this this stream into the iPad. I need  video capture. Oh, OK. I don't know  if Facebook's smart enough to take video  from anywhere but the built in camera.  That's the problem. Right. I think you  have to aim the camera at a TV if you're  going to do that. But see, it's all going  to come down to this. By the way, kids,  little tip. Don't eat these little  silicon packets. OK, so this is going to  do it. Huh? Well, you're right. There's  no way there's no. This is the key. Oh,  wow. That's a weird shot. All right. Go

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  back to the map. OK, back to the map. We  go back to the map and then go to the  bottom of the page. I've completely lost

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  every every control of everything here.  We have the world is changing too fast.  It's time for me to retire. Go to the  bottom of the page. I can't go down

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  earlier today. No, it's not scrolling  earlier today. If you scroll down like  our people broadcasting from Antarctica,  they know it had it had promotions for  others who were on early. So they had a  lot of TV station people on. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because TV people, but see the real value  of this is is is not for me or even radio  stations. Both of them have us have our  own distribution medium. It's for people  who don't who merely have a phone. Why

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  would you not also exploit it? Now we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  cooking with gas. If I could figure out  how to get this into here, I don't think  it's so this is USB. No, I can't get that  into an iPad. I can't get that into an  iPad. OK, back to the drawing board.  HDMI to USB. HDMI to USB TV. But I don't  think yeah, but see, I don't think that  the I don't think that Facebook on the  iPhone will take its video from the USB  port. I think it's wants it from the  camera, right? But you know what? Mark  Zuckerberg, Mark Zuckerberg, you're  watching Mark. Mark, there's an idea for  professional broadcasters, but this isn't  about professionals, is it? That's what I  was about to say. Well, because he

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  probably doesn't want to ruin it with,  you know, boring professional broadcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. You want real people who for the  first time have a broadcast studio that  can reach one and a half billion people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Amen. But you know what? If I'm sitting in  my office and I can suddenly watch a show  I want to watch on Facebook, why wouldn't  Facebook enable that? I want to watch,  you know, morning Joe. Can I do this with

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a PC? Somebody saying you can do it with  a PC. Can I do it with a PC? No, I don't  think so. I can't go live. I thought it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  only broadcasts on mobile device, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right? Am I wrong? Yeah. So, but again, I  want to underscore the importance of this.  When we were on Tech TV, we spent in six  years more than $600 million, more than  half a billion dollars, in order to get  our signal into 41 million homes. Half a  billion dollars in 1998 to 2004 to get  it into 41 million homes. And by the way,  as a result, Comcast paid $300 million for  Tech TV to get those 44 million homes for  themselves. Right. I can now, with a phone  and an internet connection, I'm in one and  a half billion homes for free. Right. Jorge

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ramos, 4.5 million. So I just went wandering  around the map, because I'm not paying  attention to you. I'm paying attention to  the world now. And there's something from  like Arizona. That's my deepest, deepest  fear, by the way. I know. T-Mobile Arena is  live now, somewhere, right? And this looks  like a camera feed. Where is it? I lost it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sure we'll figure out a way. But I  think that that's not the point of this at  all. You don't want polished. You want real  people talking about stuff. It's like  podcasting, right? Oh, I just see Mike

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Elgin doing it from Cuba. Of course. If he

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  does, I'm mad now because we try to get him  on the show. You notice no signals coming  out of Cuba right now. No. Boy, this is  another way that people who don't have  broadband access are disadvantaged, right?  Now you're not merely being disenfranchised  as somebody who can get information. You're  losing your voice. You don't have a voice.  Who's going to be the first person to pull  a Justin con and just leave it on all the  time? All that will happen. I wonder whether

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there's some limit to what Facebook wants  you to do. I'm just gonna leave this on  forever. I have 938 viewers. That's enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for me to just keep doing things.com is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  live now. They're making bubble tea and  milk and Astoria. Now, people like Andrew

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Keene would say, yeah, okay, this is great.  We have now used these cream of modern  technology to put absolutely stupid,  trivial content. No, to see the real people

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because who cares about that snot Andrew  Keene? A favorite snot. I don't mind. Tom  Anderson is saying, how can I share your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  broadcast? I think you can share it. Yeah,  you can share it. There's a share button  just like there would be in Facebook. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yeah, please do. In fact, yeah. Wow. This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so media. Okay, so again, back to the  medium thing. So if you so now if I wanted  to do a mess, this is the same thing, isn't  it? If I want to do a magazine, right? I  don't need printing presses, trucks,  marketing teams, ad sales, technology  departments. I just need content. Technology  departments. I don't. Yeah, I don't even  need a CMS because the content management  system is provided and it, by the way, is  an excellent right? You use it. I love  writing on medium. Beautiful. So was this  F. Williams plan all along? You think? No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think I think as with Twitter  would say, I don't know what this is. I  know it's something. And don't forget, he  just got rid of his own publications. I  think that's part and part. So he's not  going to compete with these people now.  Yeah, he's going to sell them and becomes  a great platform for publishers. And you  still own your own copyright. So you want  to post it on Huffington Post 2 or you  want to post on your blog too. That's fine  as far as I know. But why would you bother?  And it looks good if you go to Pacific  Standard Magazine. They're entirely on  medium. If you look at it. Well, but even  better, you publish it on medium and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  remember we made a big deal about this  whole post once syndicate everywhere posse  concept. Kevin Marks was talking about it  with any webcam and how I have my known  site and I can, but that's what this is.  You push a button and you're getting  AMP content and you're getting instant  articles. So you... Did Tonya try to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kevin today? This would be a perfect topic  for him. We did. Yeah. I think we

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  came up dry. We tried everybody. We just  came up dry. Interesting. Very interesting.  By the way, not the biggest story. We're  going to take a break and come back. We  will talk about a story that's making me  see red. And to me, both of you are  going to see red. And I'm going to  talk about a story that's going to  make me see red. And to me, both of you  are going to see red. And to me, both  of you are going to see red. And to me,  bodes poorly for the future of Google.  Google is going to cave on this.  But we'll talk about. Oh they already have  They've already started caving in. Yeah  they have started, but not sufficiently  revolve the subject when we come back.  Or as somebody put it,  Google just sold me a can of hummus  and there's not even any hummus in it.  That was on Medium by the way.  That was on Medium by the way.  I do find them reading more and more  articles on Medium that I just see them more.  Become a real platform.  Should I be writing? Should I?  I have blogs on Squarespace.  I have blogs at Withnone.  Should I just shut my blogs down  and just put everything on Medium?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think what you see is the beginning of it.  Medium will put it on App and put it on Instant Articles.  One of these is going to be  I mean, and this is what Kevin Marks' vision is.  Right. It's just that you  write once, publish many.  Which I agree with in general.  But the problem with that is  that you then do what's inappropriate.  If you can publish from Medium to Snapchat  that would be really stupid.  Because it would be the wrong thing for Snapchat.  And even the idea of Instant Articles  I think that's so  egocentric of us in Media to think  oh the world wants my article. They want my 600 words.  My 800 words. Well no.  No. Do what's appropriate to Facebook.  That's why Facebook Live is so fascinating  to me because it does enable a conversation.  Hi people.  And notice I'm not looking at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Daniel Horton says don't write for Medium.  You'd be writing for someone else's platform  and benefit not yours. But that's not quite exactly true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the way the world is now.  And it's not about the platforms.  We tend to look at this. I had this argument  with Emily Bell  in Distance. And that's the first show  the first pilot we're going to do  for the New York Twitch show is me debating  Emily Bell about this.  Because we don't have everything  ready to do it right. So we're just going to do a debate  as an experiment.  And the  issue is  that we in  media as an institution tend to look at Facebook  as a competing institution.  What you should see when you look at Facebook is a billion  people. You don't see Mark Zuckerberg.  You see a billion people.  And the problem is  we can't see the trees for the forest.  Right? So  no it's not that you're giving  Facebook something. No you're going to serve the public  who you want. And that's where they are. That's where they choose  to be. What are you going to do? Say no, no, no.  You have to come to me.  Not going to work anymore. Sorry.  How we make money on this?  How do we, you know, my argument is  and oh I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well what you don't want to see  is a key experience  gift, Jeff Jarvis. Is that we have

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to have relationships with people. And it's going to be hard  to maintain those relationships across multiple  platforms. And how we do that is going to be a major  skill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also worry about, and I think  this is one of the concerns I'm seeing in the Facebook  comments. I now have two comments sections,  two chat rooms.  Is that it's a  it's a  a condensation  of the total platforms.  Right? We're just going to get, what if we just got  Medium and Facebook and a handful of other

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  platforms. The opposite is happening. We're getting  competitors. Well right, so that's the other argument Emily makes  is that all the media is now in two hands.  Right, that's not good.  Well, no, but hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just reading a book.  That's Killed Radio is the four companies on all the  radio stations.  Julia, what's her name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kara? She's the wife of  Piketty.  Piketty? Piketty. Thomas Piketty  who wrote that book about  so it turns out  that  in the United  States, 0.12%  of the active population  are journalists, are active journalists.  You're just not paying attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  0.12, I'm just trying to get you in the chat.  0.12 is not a lot of  active journalists, but that's going to change, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My point is, that was what we held  control of in the world of media.  Right? And now what Facebook  and Google and Medium have opened  it up to many, many, many more people.  So more voices.  The lack of our control.  We're losing control of media to the  people. Well, I celebrate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the YouTube thing. And I guess  there'll be enough platforms that  it's not going to be, it's not like  you're going to have William Randolph Hearst  controlling the press.  Actually,  here's the substantial difference.  Hearst  decided who  got to speak. He didn't  merely own the platform. He also  completely controlled who got to speak.  Why am I hearing  audio from something else?  I'm hearing my audio.  Okay.  I'm hearing me.  So the difference is,  yes, you might have a few  oligarchs controlling these  platforms, like Mark Zuckerberg's, but  what they have done is they've made democratic  platforms. Yes, they have.  So everybody gets to have a voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are issues that  have to be discussed.  And I've said this to Facebook's  face, and I've said it to Google,  and we've got to have discussions about this because  there are higher level issues.  Journalism has a role in society to inform a  society. Journalism should ask  the questions that aren't being asked. They should say unpopular  things. They should be able to protect  sources.  And Emily's  speech, which is a brilliant speech,  and Emily's brilliant, and it's amazing,  but she,  as many do,  complain about the, well, the Facebook, you've complained about this  often, the algorithm is not transparent,  to which I respond, well, if it were transparent,  then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, Megan is streaming us, streaming that,  streaming you.  Oh, man, it's amazing.  You should put it on Periscope, that way we'd reach more...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's look at the  latency of that clap.  We're still waiting.  Go ahead, I'm sorry.  Okay.  Right, where was I?  It's distracting.  It's wonderfully distracting.  So, there are journalistic issues to be dealt with.  And, you know, Facebook does that,  but Facebook is not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know where the power is? Is not in  constraining who has a voice, but in promotion.  So, Apple, for instance, has huge...  Apple doesn't control podcasting  by any means. However,  they have huge weight by who they feature  in the podcast listings.  That  is the single most important signal  for success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Every podcaster I know is afraid to death  of ever offending Apple.  They are nice to that one person, and it's not an algorithm,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's a person.  So, that's not good.  And so, that's how these platforms could be nefarious,  is not that they control who has a voice,  they let everybody speak, but they do...  And, of course, they want to, because their users  are saying, give us some curation, there's a million voices,  who should I be listening to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, there's also an argument that  then the algorithm,  what it is an algorithm, and Facebook should be made transparent.  Well, the obvious first problem with that is  that it'll be gamed.  And it'll be gamed, by the way, by my colleagues  in news media. We'll do everything we can  in our old business model to get more page views,  and we will mess it up.  So, what I argue is perhaps what  the platform should do, perhaps what Facebook should do,  is to say to Marty Barron,  the legendary now editor of the Washington Post,  Marty, we trust you.  You're important.  We will give you an allocation of attention.  You gotta do something that's important,  and the audience has to agree with you in the end.  But if you do,  then fine, you can tell the world what's important,  and we'll let you do that.  Well, it's not even we will give you.  Just as there are more voices,  there are more curation voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so, we'll have to do that.  And so, we'll have to do that.  And so, more people will emerge  who will be curators,  and if you like Marty or Bright Bart,  whoever it is that you like,  you will follow their curation.  And that will be...  But what I fear is that...  The iTunes example is really pernicious,  because they really control success in podcasting  through their iTunes recommendations.  Now, the only solution to that  has been to diversify the platform.  And the good news, at least for us,  is that it's a platform that's been created  by people who are not listening to us.  And the good news, at least for us,  is that our iTunes listenership  went from 90% of all of our listenership  to less than 50% over time  as there are more podcast apps.  One of the reasons we want apps, right,  is because we want to do our own curation and promotion.  We don't want people to find us  merely through iTunes.  But this happens on YouTube,  it happens on Facebook.  Those platforms have huge power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's a proper discussion to be held  about the ethics of this.  And I don't know where that goes,  because Facebook will remind you, too,  their primary job is not to inform society.  Their primary job is to connect people,  their secondary job is to entertain us,  and then, by the way, they also do happen to inform society,  but that's a come-along.  That's not a primary goal  that they have as a business.  And so we have to keep that in mind.  They want to have people have a good time on Facebook.  That's their job.  That's what they do as a mission.  They have a role in giving people who don't have voices.  Here's an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said that about Google, too.  And then you've given me the counterargument,  yeah, but they're a business, so they shouldn't have to worry  about their responsibilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they end up with responsibilities.  I'm disagreeing with myself, I guess.  I don't know if I said that.  No, they do have responsibilities,  but they kind of didn't ask for them.  They're not replacing us in our function.  So there has to be some discussion.  Here's the example where it comes,  is anonymity.  When Facebook  has outlawed anonymity,  and people who are using Facebook,  who are oppressed, who are trying to use this platform  to connect and to be heard,  which is what Facebook wants,  then how does Facebook deal with the ethics  of protecting a vulnerable person?  That's a question that they have  to ask with their role. It's not a question,  you know, when we did it in media,  we'd say, we'll say an unnamed source,  we keep his name quiet because we're just going to hurt him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I hate to rely upon  the kindness of strangers.  We always have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Always have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We kind of don't have much choice.  And ultimately,  all of that aside, it still is democratizing.  I mean, it still gives  somebody in Iraq a chance to make a live stream,  and for others  to tweet it,  which is a completely independent platform,  and point people to it on Facebook,  and on and on and on, and so it's completely  possible for somebody to find an audience.  This map,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  this map is just mind-boggling.  Right now,  there are so many dots around New York City,  I can't zoom in any farther,  they all mush together.  Evo Maya Maya  is live now. Hola!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Daniel Horton's saying,  I wish Facebook would make mentions live for everyone,  and not just the site, the elite chosen few.  That's just what happened, Daniel.  That's what you're seeing. You can do exactly  what we're doing right now.  There is still some elitism  because...  Well, because of us,  and because I've  been doing this for a long time,  or whatever reason, we still have more clout  and more ability to promote.  But Daniel, if you did some amazing stream  that everybody said, this guy is incredible,  he's playing the ukulele like  on fire, he's like the air  collapsed in the ukulele, I bet you would get an audience.  And that's what's really interesting.  Your content has to be good.  Very, very interesting.  This is so new, it's hard to imagine  what it really means, but it's pretty clear  just from us doing this now,  there are more people, I should point out, watching this  on Facebook Live than are watching it  on our live stream. Bingo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bingo!  That's this!  That's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the promotional  platform of Facebook,  you have to know about us to find  our live stream, you have to know where to go.  Nobody's Googling, where could I watch  a conversation about Facebook Live?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, generally, what proportion of the audience  watches live?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  5%, 10%. It depends on the show.  So that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  as you pointed out, for discussion  we're going to have a different context, but that  changes the feeling of the show.  But is  maybe Facebook Live should be the  live platform for the show, if you could  figure out how to get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's actually roughly equal. We were just showing  the Ustream feed, there are  4 or 5 feeds, so it probably  is still more on our feed.  But give it time, and you'll find

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  new audience. Have you heard this Leo Laporte?  He's on now!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think I should do  more cleavage if that's going to be the case.  Okay, here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here we go.  You're not going to show that we go yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice, Jeff.  I don't know if that really is going to  increase the audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your radios are going through the ceiling, man.  They're going up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, you know, to be fair,  success in television, it's a visual  medium, has always had a lot to do with attractiveness  as opposed to content.  Well, I break that rule.  I said  success, Jeff.  Hey, you were on Moonlighting.  It didn't mean nothing.  As somebody who wanted to  burst my bubble once said to me,  you're a minor celebrity on  an unknown tech channel.  And I said, yeah, you're absolutely right.  I prefer demicelebrity.  You're a second  rate, I think she said  you're a third rate celebrity on a  minor tech channel.  Was that the person you were negotiating with?  No, it was a woman.  She deflated me entirely.  I won't talk to you.  We're going to take a break, come back  and talk about Revolve first, though, and  let Jeff watch the map. Go ahead, play with the  map, Jeff. I'm going to go run down the hall for one second.  Okay, that's also okay.  That's why we need three people  on the show, because when am I supposed to run down the hall?  Our show today is  brought to you by FreshBooks, the  super simple cloud accounting software  that changed my life  way back when I was a freelancer  going to Canada every month for a week  doing a TV show there. I had to  bill them for travel,  for food, for my time.  I had to bill them in Canadian dollars.  It was such a pain.  It literally, one  six month period, I did not invoice them at all.  Now, sure,  that saved me a lot of time invoicing.  In the end, it wasn't  a good idea, because of course, when you don't invoice,  you don't get paid.  And when I finally did get together and say,  well, I better send them these invoices,  the accounting department called me up and said,  what are you doing? If you ever do this again, we're not paying it.  You need to bill us monthly.  That's when Amber MacArthur told me  about FreshBooks, a local company in Toronto  just starting up in 2003.  And man,  they changed my life. It made it so easy to do  the invoices.  Just an email them out, and by the  way, right there,  on the invoice is a button for your client  to pay it. And I got to tell you,  people hate paying bills  as much as you hate sending bills.  It's not about the money, it's just a pay,  it's a chore, it's something you don't want to do.  So if you make it easy for them, you're going to get  paid faster. FreshBooks says on average, five  days faster when you use  FreshBooks. They've also got  features that will make it easier  come tax time. Those  reports that they generate will make your  accountant, or you, if you're doing your own  taxes, a lot happier.  Because you could take pictures of the  receipts, no more cardboard shoebox,  you know, and organize them for later.  You can actually,  using the automatic, get your  mileage into  FreshBooks automatically.  I mean, for a lot of people, the best  part about FreshBooks is that feeling of  zen. Ah, the calm  you have when tax time comes  around. Ah, I can  breathe. If,  you know what, do we have that  EMV card reader? That is so cool. They just released  this thing. It's Chip and Swipe  card reader that goes right  onto your iPhone using the FreshBooks  app. So if you go to  people's houses,  to do work,  like if you're an installer or an IT  person or, you know, a computer help person,  you just go, you can use the  FreshBooks app to give them an estimate, to give them a  bill, and then they give you the credit  card, you swipe it, all done  there on the spot.  Ah, so nice.  Getting started is easy, too, even if you're  not a numbers person, especially if you're not a  numbers person. I want you to go right now to  FreshBooks.com slash twig and try it  for 30 days. It changed my life.  Saved me. It'll save  you. FreshBooks.com  slash twig. I can  promise you that after I started using  FreshBooks, I didn't mince a miss a month.  I got those invoices  out in a prompt fashion. They looked good. They were  professional. I had my logo on them and everything.  Make sure, though, if you  take advantage of this free offer, FreshBooks.com  slash twig that you mentioned  this week in Google in the How  Did You Hear About Us section.  Make sure that Jeff gets credit for this.  FreshBooks.com slash twig.  Okay.  The map.  I think they should put the map on the wall  in your newsroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, plus what you'd see  suddenly, too, is why, oh, why is there  an interrelation activity  there? Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  another thing I'm just going to mention.  There are four more women  watching on Facebook than watching  on the stream. Yep.  Well, that's... Hi, Barbara.  Hi, Cynthia.  Wow.  Mine died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I just restarted mine. Well, I've been going an hour.  And 1,100  viewers. Oh, shush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Show off. That's amazing.  I'm going to go to the  show. That's amazing.  It is. Yeah. It is. Yeah.  Okay. I got to figure out  I should do a different thing.  Like I could do a cooking show or something. Like something  that I don't do here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think you should do that, too.  Yes. But I also think that you should take an existing  show. Oh, I got an idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just got an idea. Brilliant. This is my  new show. Hot Tub Tech  Machine.  Live from Leo's  hot tub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well done. Well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't drop that  iPad, Leo.  All right. This revolve thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then the waterproof phone. Yeah, the waterproof  phone. So this is not... I can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  do this on Android right now. I have to use an  iOS device. With mentions. Mention you can.  Oh, with mentions. Okay. I have mentions on here.  You know, I have to say, I think  more and more this new iPad Pro, the little one  on which I bought, is the ultimate  media tool. I can make podcasts. I  could do blog posts. Now I can do a TV  show. This thing, this little thing  which fits in my backpack  and it has all the  everything. I even put Ethernet on.  This has everything. This is like a media  creation tool. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which, which, which...  And by the way, I guess I'll eat crow  here. Because remember when I reboxed  the iPad recently?  It's because I said it was not a creation tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it wasn't.  It wasn't then, but it is now. It has become  one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, and my battery also went  flu-y. Oh yeah, apparently it's a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  battery drain. Oh yeah.  So if I have Robert Scoble come out, we'll get  in the hot tub together and we'll do...  Ooh. Ooh, forbidden visual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now  a couple of middle-aged fat guys  in the hot tub.  Ooh. Ooh.  Revolve. This is pissing  me off.  And I really think Google has  blown this big time. First of all, I know they're having  trouble with Nest. Nest is not living up  to its expectation. They spent several billion  dollars. They only had half a  billion in revenue last year.  Executives are leaving like rats,  leaving a sinking ship. They're even fighting.  There's infighting. Remember, Nest  bought DropCam and then the DropCam  founder started saying to  Tony Fidel, you should stop blaming us for your bad  results. We were doing  great until you bought us. It was the biggest mistake  I ever made. Oh, what a mess.  This is what Alphabet  hath wrought. Because  once you spread these, you know, get  these guys' financials out of the Google financials  and it's in public,  suddenly they're  eating their young.  Oh, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Of course. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the latest thing is  Nest bought a little company called  Revolve. They made a smart home  hub. It was  it did look a little bit like a  jar of hummus.  And it, you know, it's  not just that the hub cost a couple hundred bucks  and that on the  box they promised lifetime  support.  But then people probably went out  and bought other things to work with it.  Right? In fact,  some people had spent thousands on lights  and locks and all this stuff.  There was a great medium post.  This is where the hummus came from  by a guy who had  used this to  completely automate his  house. And  that  time, Tony Fidel,  he writes, this is Arlo  Gilbert, sold me a container of hummus.  This hummus  cost $2.99. Tony Fidel  sold me a $299 empty  container of hummus. He didn't even get the hummus.  But he, but this is,  you know, this is, he'd really set  up everything to work with this thing.  Nest has  announced that they're going  to shut it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not just shut down the company, not just shut down  the product, but  the service. They're going to brick  well, not even the service, they're going to brick his

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  device. The Revolve app will no  after May 15th will no longer open.  Hub won't work. Is my product  still under warranty? It says on the FAQ  on the Revolve site, no.  Our one year warranty against  defects in materials or workmanship has expired  for all Revolve products.  Now I understand you can, you can  stop making a product. I understand, but this really  highlights, first of all,  the vulnerability of  Internet of Things machines. For instance,  Google's on Hub router.  You know,  Asus doesn't need to provide any services  to my Asus router, but the  on Hub needs services.  The Revolve needs services.  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there's a contract, there's an implied contract  that when you buy it, you can keep using it.  And for them to cut it off,  you want the definition of what's  evil? This is evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so. Arlo  says, hey, if I bought a Dell computer  and then Dell said, oh, your  computer will not work after the warranty  period,  there's the warranty,  but then there's also this kind of,  as you say, implied contract. Now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there's a caveat emptor to the extent  that, oh, we're going to stop  supporting this. We're going to stop making new things  for it. You're stuck with it as is, but  you know, hey, you can go ahead and use it.  Okay.  Right. But you paid for it.  Unlike, let's say, a subscription service where we stop  making entertainment weekly and you just stop getting it.  But a magazine company has to give you  a refund or another magazine  on your choice.  This case, you bought a product  with a presumption that it would work as long as you could keep it  going. And to then brick it and turn  it off, that's just wrong.  Now, however, Google has come in. And if  you go to the, I think it's two links down on  the rundown, Leo, I put in the latest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they've kind of sort of...  This is not  what they need to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They need a mea culpa on top of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the mountain. No, they just keep the freaking  servers running. I'm sorry, it's not that expensive.  Or refund everybody.  Well, that's expensive. That's $300.  It would not cost $300 a user  to keep some server on some  Google guys desk  running so that this would work.  And here's the real  problem for Google, besides the PR  stain.  Google's already got a wrap of discontinuing  stuff people love. Google Reader,  Google Wave, and Google Buzz, and Google...  I mean, on and on and on.  And why am I not going to buy another Google  product if Google could  just lose interest one day  and turn it off?  This is a business killer.  This is horrific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm driving down the road in my Google  car or it's driving me and suddenly it just stops  and says, sorry, you're not supported anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And to refer as Revolve  has in its page, which is just  jaunty and disgusting,  to, well,  you know, nothing  lasts forever.  We're shutting it down. It was great.  We thank you for your support.  Thanks, Tim and Mike.  Screw you.  Just, I...  Oh, you know, we're sad for the end of Revolve,  but this isn't the end of the connected home. This is the beginning.  Yeah, you know what? It might  not be because you guys  have demonstrated to everybody  the real vulnerability of Internet of Things  stuff if it needs a server  and the company, for whatever reason, decides  after a few years, yeah, it didn't work out  so good, you got a piece of hardware  that doesn't work. That's not like a computer.  It's like a, my smartphone  will continue to work even if Google goes  out of business. It may not get  updates, but that's not what I'm saying.  To brick it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they're  bricking it.  Well, plus, it feels like, even though it's the servers  that are turning off, it feels like they reached into your home  and turned something off. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, we got our money.  Google bought us. See ya.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is not a Google-y thing to do.  This is, or it may be an Alphabet-y thing to do.  It's not a Google-y thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm telling you, Alphabet has to swallow this.  I know Nest is  hemorrhaging money, blah, blah, blah. Alphabet has to  swallow this and just keep the  server running. That's all they have to do.  If they don't, and you know what? Eventually  the last Revolve user will die.  Or find  something better. But if they don't,  it's not about Revolve  or Revolve users. It's about this strong  impression that's given me and many others, I'm sure,  that Google is not in it  for the long haul.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google is, and here's the other point  about this. Google is a  personal services company.  Full stop. Google knows you as an  individual. It gives you services, whether that's Gmail  or Search or Maps. It knows  you as an individual. It has an individual relationship  with you. That is the strength that it has versus  mass marketing and mass  distribution companies. Well, that  means that you can't F over  those individuals. Google, that is  the basis of Don't Be Evil. Right? It says  if we are evil, we will lose business. Well,  that's evil. This is going to take people's faith away.  Now, somebody might have said  in there, some cold-hearted Scrooge might  have said, ah, Revolve, hardly, you know,  what is it? How many  could they possibly have sold? It was tiny.  It's not the point. But it has an impact  on your reputation. Yeah, that's the reputation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  damage. And  not just to Google, really, but to the Internet of  Things ecosystem in general.  But here's the takeaway  we should all keep in  mind. Maybe this is time to remember that  you want to use a product that services  are open, that other companies  could support, that  you could run your own server if you  had to. Or, you  know, if Revolve were more open,  somebody could step up and say, well,  you know, it's too small a business for Revolve,  but I'd be glad to run this  server and you give me a couple  of bucks a month.  There's, you know, I have a friend  who made a lot of money  with payphones,  of all things.  He said, AT&T, tired of  payphones. They didn't want to run them. They didn't want to maintain  them. It was too small a business  for them. So he bought the  payphone business from them. It was a billion  dollar business for him.  Because there's still payphones  in a lot of places.  He modernized it.  He put money into it. He made a ton  of money.  But AT&T's happy.  Because they got  rid of it. That's, I mean, maybe that's what Google  should do. But,  and I would submit, if you're going  to, going  forward, I've certainly learned my lesson.  Let's not rely on,  let's not buy things that rely on companies'  goodwill to keep them running.  You know, open.  Your TV still works if other, if  NBC goes out of business.  Pick an open standard.  Yep.  The guy who lives in the van in the Google  parking lot could do it, says Reverb Mike.  Right? Yeah. Just have him give him  an old PC, an old Dell.  Probably, I mean,  how much money is this costing them?  I mean, that's the point. They sold, maybe they sold a thousand of these.  How hard would it be to keep that server for a thousand  people running? Nothing. Nothing.  Right.  You know what? They will back down.  I guarantee you. This is too bad.  The press is terrible for them.  And Tim and Mike, shame on you.  Glad you got a good job.  Screw you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.  Let's go down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much does Google  really know about you? We already know that.  Is that the dashboard that they're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We already know that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the mirror finally figuring it out.  Australians, here's something we know.  Australians Googled for  522 million hours last  year.  That's why, to keep the Revolve server is  de minimis compared to that.  This is  Roy Morgan Research.  A sample of  50,000 internet users indicated an estimated  16.9 million Australians  older than the age of 14  visited Google at least once during a four week  time frame.  1.9 million Bing, 1.8 million  Yahoo.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean how much time do you spend  on Google? Not that much. So  it's like that's a lot of seconds.  A lot of 20 second chunks aggregated.  Is that your number?  I hope I didn't steal your number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nope. Nope. I put that in the rundown.  No I didn't.  So my phone died.  Oh because you were streaming?  Yeah and I had it plugged into a  not to a regular plug plug but into a  USB on a  strip. I guess that wasn't enough power.  It was going faster than the power could go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a good argument for doing it  with an iPad.  Because, or hey the  Pixel C with mentions.  Because that's got a big ass  batter, a big old batter.  Sorry. Can't bleep  the feed.  Well you don't need to bleep.  See but this is good. Mark Williams says, well now I know  about your twit feed. Thanks Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Right. See  it's, it's. There's some value to that.  When we have our little discussion about  live, this is going to play into it. This is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  different view of live. Yeah that's interesting.  Blackberry. Poor Blackberry.  I really like the Blackberry Priv. I bought one.  My son has it. You're weird.  I am weird. I sent it to my son in Barcelona.  He lost his iPhone on the first day in  Barcelona. So I sent it to him and he  said,  I think I have an old iPhone 4 somewhere  in my drawer. Could you please send me that instead?  I mean this is  nice. This Blackberry Priv. It's nice.  Android. They only sold 600,000  in the last quarter. That's down  from the  expectation of Wall Street. They'd sell  850,000 even below the  it's actually down 100,000 from the  units that sold in the preceding quarter.  So it's basically a long, slow slide  into the night.  Android did not save Blackberry.  I feel bad about that. But  that's what happens.  There are now, this is interesting.  This kind of runs counter to  what I've been saying, which is that there are  a handful of YouTube people making money  and the rest of them are just  working on YouTube's farm, helping  them get rich. According to TubeFilter,  there are now  2,000 YouTube channels with a million  subscribers or more.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that low to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's high. I thought it was  500, 100. I didn't know.  That's  kind of impressive. Now are all those  people making money? Is a million subscribers enough  for you to make money?  Let's not say  $20 a month. Let's say  $20 a month. Can you make $5,000 a month?  That would be enough to make  a living. Can you make $5,000 a month  with a million subs? I don't know.  I'd like to know that  number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Marcus Brownlee. Love him.  Love him. Great guy.  I just saw a picture on his Facebook feed  with keys and an empty office.  Is he starting a business?  He probably graduated.  But my point is that he was  of the size to make money on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I would hope so.  I should ask Marcus. We tried to hire  him a year ago  or so, maybe a little more.  Made him an offer and he said, you know, I just want to finish  college, finish my  schooling.  But I think there'd be no reason why he  would need us at all.  At all. At all.  This is interesting.  Twitter bought the rights  for Thursday Night Football.  And they paid less,  a lot less than some of the  other offers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is, this is, this  boggles my mind almost as much as Facebook.  Who's going to watch an entire game on Twitter?  Twitter as a distribution platform  for long form?  If Facebook can be, I guess Twitter can be.  They paid $10 million

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to stream 10 games.  That was, the NFL said, not the  highest bid. It's thought that  others were offering as much as $15 million.  Why would the NFL  do a deal for $5 million less?  Well, because the amount of money, $10 million,  is minimal anyway from the  NFL's point of view. They clearly  feel like putting it on Twitter  is more valuable to them than Verizon or  Yahoo or Amazon, the other bidders.  But you're right.  I can see why Twitter would do it, right?  It's going to drive traffic to Twitter.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I see why they do it.  Well, they do it, I don't. It's so counter to the  experience of Twitter.  Well, it's not counter to moments.  Unless they invent some kind of new thing where I have a conversation about the  game with other people who are there.  Unless you really, really reinvent the experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. From the NFL's point of view,  this is all prelude  to the contract negotiations  coming in 2021.  The big  broadcast contracts expire in 2021.  And the NFL needs  to know where else  they could go to make a ton of  money.  And what the digital rights are worth and who  the players are, who would want them.  And so this is all research.  Verizon does broadcast, right?  If you're a Verizon customer, you can watch NFL  on your phone.  Yeah, it's only of use if  you're on the way home or you're in the subway  and you don't... Once you get home, you're going to  watch it on your big screen, I would think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well,  again, I think the opportunity is to have  a conversation about the game. But you can do that  on Twitter without having to have it on the same  application.  You can watch it on  TV and then have the conversation on Twitter.  I get the  second, third screen  angle to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do they put it on Periscope?  Maybe.  I don't want to watch an NFL game  in portrait mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get it in the sense, from  Twitter's point of view, it's just  it's great PR.  Right?  It means we're a media company.  I don't know why Facebook didn't bid for it.  That would make more sense.  We were talking  with Brad Sams earlier on Windows  Weekly. He's in Cincinnati. He just got  Amazon's same day  delivery prime  now.  And he said to try it out, I ordered a bag of  fertilizer.  And he said, I may be interrupted  in the middle of the show.  Same day  deliveries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just got the food service, the Amazon food service  in my area. Did you?  Which is pretty amazing. I haven't gotten it yet. I haven't actually  used it. How is it different from the other food

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  services?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The other foods, it's  a $4 a month subscription.  Or $4 a week, I forget.  And that's your whole  delivery cost. And that's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You really have to want what you're ordering  on Amazon because Prime now  gives Amazon Prime members a free  two hour delivery.  But $8 if you want one hour delivery.  And that's in Manhattan.  And you have to tip the courier.  I've never expected to tip the courier.  It's in over 20 cities  including Tokyo, Milan,  London.  It's  perishables too.  Milk and eggs, bread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I like about it is the potential of having  paired meals.  So I just tried to install  mentions on my  other phone.  The one that's running Nutella.  Oh, it doesn't work with Nutella?  No, it ain't working with that.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A number of things don't work very well with Nutrol.  I've noticed. I usually complain about  libraries.  Instagram still runs but it  complains about libraries.  That's an easy thing to fix.  I can't remember if I have mentions on here  on my S7 or not.  I think I took it off because I was  worried about battery.  But I bet you mentioned, no I don't,  mentions I bet is better than the regular, the full  Facebook app because it doesn't have  ads or anything.  Amazon  dot is arriving  now around  the country.  A number of people have talked about it.  I saw, who got it? Anthony Nielsen  got his dot.  It's like they cut the top off of an  Echo. Small speaker  on it still but not much.  But in every other respect, it's just  like the Alexa, he says.  So, I'm sorry, the Echo.  Gosh, I shouldn't say that word.  Just like the Echo.  And I love this idea because I can hook it up to some  decent speakers for a change because I use the  Echo but I have to put up with the speakers.  And by the way,  it works with Bluetooth as well.  So you could put the new  dot on your  bedside table, Bluetooth it to speakers  across the room, talk to the dot  and have it play  on your stereo.  I can't wait to get mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So,  will it operate on its own  without a big pop of Echo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so but the speaker's  crappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if you want to just talk and do functional things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess if you wanted to ask what time it was,  that'd be fine, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, have you heard of  Sam Lesson's  new company? I think I have heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have and I'm very intrigued. I mentioned this before.  Finn. I got an invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you? Because I've been trying to get one.  Well, maybe you have mine.  It was in the list. I was just in the list.  It cost $150  a month. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, forget it. So it's  an intelligent assistant.  What's interesting about it, not only  is it just for your phone, it works on the Echo.  So it could...  Okay, platform, right?  Now the Echo's not going to work if Amazon decides  to pull the plug on this but at least  anybody can write Echo  skills. And  Echo skill can be apparently pretty sophisticated  because this is a lot smarter  than the woman on Echo,  the A-L-E-X-A woman, or  Siri. It does a lot of things.  You can say, you know, what do I need to do tomorrow?  And the way you do it on an Echo, you'll say  ask Finn  you know,  or I think you have to give it a command  but I can't remember what the command is.  So it's a... That's expensive.  So what it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  made me sit down and think is, I mean, you know,  for a month, you know,  you probably do it for a month, right?  But do I have that many questions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. And  is it doing anything $150  better than the Google Now  or Siri or even

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Echo itself? I'm sure it's doing  some things better. I'm sure they've thought it through. Sam's a very,  very smart guy. Oh, I love  Sam. Yeah. But, but  yeah, it made me  think, oh, OK, what's the value of this?  Now, on the other hand,  you know, when  I wrote my books, my  editor, my agent both got after me because I was  so disorganized.  You know, you got to hire an assistant, you got to hire an assistant. I said, I can't afford  to hire an assistant. You didn't give me enough money. I don't know.  For $150 a month. The one time I had an assistant  when I was at EW, I didn't know what to do with her.  I had lunch.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  do need help. I do need organization. I do need  services. I do need things. I'm the absent-minded  professor. I come by that title quite honestly.  So,  you know, I could imagine a service  that would indeed take things over for me. But  the thought of trying to shift to  working in some  system is exhausting to think about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But who knows? Well, that's why  I think speech in the long run is going to be what's  because if you can get natural language  working so that we don't have to learn  interface. Right now, even for the,  you know, I was giving you an example  when I was saying, well, there's some syntax you have to  use with Finn. I shouldn't have to remember syntax.  No.  But that's coming, I think.  WhatsApp just turned on strong encryption  for 1 billion  users. Not just text messaging,  but video and audio.  Oh. My  stream just ended.  Well, I don't know. It went dark.  Maybe it's just sleeping.  Maybe the battery died.  No, it's still at 50%.  What's going on?  Oh, it's kind of  blurry and weird.  I think the application  broke. It's still something there.  Is it hot? It looks like  you can see me still. You guys can see me, right?  Oh, really?  No, it doesn't need power, John. It's got 50%.  It's just, I think  it's a bug. Or after  an hour of streaming, it says,  you should really stop now.  Or maybe  I ruined  my eyes.  That's weird. Is it still working?  It looks like it is. Kind of, yeah.  It's still working.  That's strange.  It's doing some blurry effect on the screen.  It's not hot.  Oh, I didn't pay my Facebook bill.  I hate it when  that happens.  Alright, I think we're done.  By the way, we should mention  Sam Lesson created  a really great little tool that I like called  dropio, D-R-O-P.io,  allowed you to share files.  Facebook bought it, put it out of business.  Another one of those. But he designed  the Facebook timeline, worked for Facebook for a while.  His wife Jessica Lesson runs the information.  He took a little time off, and this is obviously  his next thing.  Do you want to talk about Yahoo!  at all?  Is there anything to say?  For Yahoo!  Wow!  16,600 viewers.  Congratulations. This is your most  live... So it did  shut down. Look at this.  So you know what it was doing? It was saving it out.  Well, that's over a period of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many are on the live stream right now on the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not that many.  So 16,600  people watched me live. The replay  of your live video has been posted.  Save the video to camera roll? I think not.  Upload higher quality  video, 1 gigabyte.  Yeah.  So that's an interesting  switch. I'm allowed to...  So they streamed that, obviously, to  Facebook to do it live, but now I can upload  the actual video from the  iPad so that when you  watch it, it'll be better quality.  Nice!  Yeah, interrupted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pretty impressive. Very impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. 16,600.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That really is.  And how many of those people  are new to us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't think it would be that high a number if I hadn't done it  live on the show, right? If I go home and do it,  it won't be 16,600.  Yes.  It's Hot Tub Tech Machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the pass along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hot Tub Tech Machine.  I'm telling you, it's going to be  good.  Can I do Hot Tub Tech  Machine?  My wife says no.  It's going to be awesome.  It's my new show  from the Hot Tub.  Fitbit Blaze  and Alta. I wear a Fitbit Blaze.  The Alta is a more  attractive version of the same hardware.  First month,  1 million units.  Wow.  Great success.  Probably on a par with  maybe not quite on a par with the Apple Watch, but  close.  So, I'm sorry, we started talking about  did you read the Vanity Fair article about  Marissa Meyer versus  Kim Kardashian's behind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I started. I just  I do feel for Marissa. I just don't  know what you would do with Yahoo.  Yeah.  The stake was taking the job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because I think she knew it was  going to be tough and she thought  it's a  challenge, but why not do something?  I've made all the money I need to make. Why not  do something interesting?  There's the risk of fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the problem remains. The question has been  before her time, the last three CEOs,  what is Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It remains.  So, supposedly,  they're selling off the parts, but I don't  see any movement in that direction.  The real problem is you've got these  investors, these  activist investors who are yelling  at you and they have  unboarded seats. It's just a mess.  It's just a mess.  Yep.  Her tagline  was, we may not be the biggest technology  company, but we are the biggest technology  company that understands media.  She said that at a Bloomberg conference last summer.  Is that true? Do they understand media?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They understand the old business of media, which is  selling volume advertising.  But to create a new business of media,  they clearly didn't.  BuzzFeed understands a new vision of  media, whether you like it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the explanation of the  title is  the home page on Yahoo! is  the killer on all of this.  It generates hundreds of millions of views a month.  And so none of the verticals  had a chance unless they got  on the home page.  And the guys who could...  And the gatekeepers who controlled  the home page  said, look, I don't care what you put on there.  Kim Kardashian's butt is going to always drive  10x the traffic.  So it doesn't matter.  And it's kind of in a way, it's a statement about  not so much old media, new media, but  the kind of the...  What drives traffic on the internet.  I clicked on Kim's butt.  But I also  did other... I read  David Pogue's stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.  You wonder what happens to  the contracts they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's wrap this up.  All righty.  All righty.  I don't know what I was going to do  for a tool. Did you put a thousand dollars down  on a new Tesla?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you know, here's...  My never-ending song, my car is about  199,000 miles. It's about to collapse.  I  want four-wheel drive. I want Android Auto.  I don't want to spend a fortune.  And then I got  interested. I thought... So I read in a review.  I wish I remember who wrote it.  I can't remember who wrote it.  Sorry. That's...  That favorably compared the Chevy Bolt

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to the...  Yeah, I'm interested in the Bolt. And the Bolt does

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Android Auto.  As Android Auto says the technology  in some ways is more interesting.  And I thought, okay, well, I'll be cool.  What's cooler than buying a Tesla?  Buying a Bolt.  You know, just...  A Chevy?  Yeah. You know, just be different.  Same price, same roughly same range.  I tweet this, and somebody says, well, no, man,  you've got to live in California. Who knows what's coming to the East Coast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, really? They're only selling  the Bolt in California?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Somebody said in my Twitter feed, I don't know.  There's no sense of  when it's coming out or anything else.  But the problem is, I looked from  where I am to my daughter's college  is 190 miles.  And the Bolt's supposed to be 210 miles.  You can't get home, though.  Well, yeah, that.  And then do I safely get there?  And then how many hours it takes to fully charge?  It's still not practical.  It's still kind of ridiculous, including the Tesla.  It's not practical.  Did you put down a deposit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because I have... Remember, I'm sitting on a  deposit on a Model X, which I may never get.  I don't know if you've been following the  coverage of that. Apparently,  some real trouble making the Model X.  The Roadshow now  is reporting that a new email  sent to a Tesla Motors Club forum  user, I'm on the Tesla Motors Club,  contains language  that could be seen as concerning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because any chance they'll just skip the X  and say all the money is obviously  in the three?  Sorry, folks.  We changed our mind.  At least you don't have an empty hummus container.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They said...  The letter came from Elon, I think, but they've only  made 2,000 Xs, right?  They had hoped to make many more by this  time.  Saying...  They said, for instance,  we often take proactive measures to ensure  the best driving and ownership experience possible  for our customers.  And maybe we showed  them hubris in adding far too much  new technology to this  car.  A bit of humility.  Severe Model X supplier parts  shortage.  And hubris in adding far too much new  technology.  Uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're going to like  the bolt, Leo.  When does your lease run out?  September.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I may be driving a pickup truck  in September.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google self-driving  bike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chat room is  speculating, I think they're probably right,  that the reason that the iPad  stopped is I'd reached the limit of  the memory that it could store  of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, so when it said upload the video, it meant  upload the video.  I don't know if it's...  Why would it store it locally?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it has to. What is it going to do?  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yeah, no, you're right. It doesn't have to because it could just stream it.  But there's an option to save it.  So, um,  that's why. So anyway, it's on there.  By the way,  Lisa liked yours but didn't like mine.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I see she didn't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She enjoyed it, but she didn't  like it. She liked you.  She re-shared you. So,  1,600 views, 1,300 comments.  And it really was  kind of not a very satisfying experience,  I'm sure, for those watching because it was just  kind of one side of the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, didn't you get... They could hear me too.  Couldn't they? Sort of, yeah, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not great. And I rearranged  the monitor so they could kind of see you and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  all that. And the people on this side couldn't  hear a thing. Right. They could hear me every  90 seconds. I'm telling you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hot tub tech machine. Later this  afternoon.  It's a hot day here. It's like  80 or 90 degrees here. Oh, shut  up. It's 22 degrees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know. I heard you get a second winter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Second winter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You lucked out so much  in the weather when you were here. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was really pleasant.  Really pleasant. And I think we lucked out seeing  Hamilton too because come  July, the old gang's going to  break up. They've got a truck tour coming up  that will start in San Francisco. They've got a  Chicago show they're building now.  There was a good article  in the New York Times about the  producer. They call  him the CEO of Hamilton.  And what a business. A  hit hot Broadway show can make more money than a hit  movie. In the  long run. They expect. Yeah, in the long run.  They're making  half a million dollars a week.  On  just that box office. Of course, when they open the other  shows and all the  soundtrack and all  of that. It's really interesting.  Ladies and gentlemen,  let us wrap this up with a  number of the week. Okay,  what should I do here? You've got some good

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ones. Yeah, I'll just  to one just for the record is that an 85  million dollar patent troll suit against  Google they lost in  the lower court was thrown out on appeal.  So just ring the  bell for the good guys.  Good.  Do you know?  Oh, no, I forget. Hold on.  That's all right.  Was it, you know, is that basic Texas  court case where Tyler, Texas.  Yep. Yep. Old Tyler,  Texas. It's taken  forever to come up. That's all right.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It was  a 1996 desktop  notification system.  What?  And the higher court said the lower  court basically didn't know how to read  a  patent. Wow.  So that's good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody's telling me that the  other number of the week should be seven  and a half billion dollars.  That's  the Model 3 preorder  totals so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many of those  are going to be in the  stock market?  I mean, you know,  if you're a  big stick, you know, if you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Elon, what do you start to plan for?  Because you're going to have to go borrow a  hell of a lot of money now to feed  that supply chain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but he can because he has  276,000 orders.  It should be easy to go to the markets

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and say, give me money.  Right. Yeah. For some amount of that.  And then you have to go to the  market and you have to go to the  stock market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so that's a good news.  So that's a good news.  Well, I mean, I think the  people who are watching the show  on the news, they're watching the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  headlines and they got so many in  such a short time tells you that  there is a lot of demand for this.  My wife laughed at the because the  mall here in New Jersey, short hills,  had a bad they had local TV and it  was a very bad thing.  I'm like a bagel bagel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He beat me to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't  think I have a tool this week. I was.  I mean, I have a few tools. I have been  playing Facebook Live.  Facebook Live is clearly the  tool of the week.  I've been playing a little bit more with  Linux and things like this revolve  thing. What Microsoft has done  with  the Windows 10 forced  upgrade.  Apple's kind of clear  indifference towards its desktop  platform. You know, it's all about the phone  has kind of made me think I  really probably should start looking at another  operating system. You know, the best  desktop the  without anybody knowing it, the year  of desktop Linux happened  with Chrome OS. That is Linux.  And it's if you can't really install  anything on it. No, but it's really gets you  most of the way there. It is Linux  and a lot of the merits of it are based  on the fact that it's based on a Linux.  So people  and Android is Linux as well. So Google's  done a lot to put Linux in the mainstream. But I thought  I wouldn't mind finding a desktop  Linux  that would give me all of  the stuff I get  from OS 10 or Windows. Now  actually just as I  start engaged in this process,  Microsoft  announced that they're going to put the bash shell  in Windows  10, which is really good news for web  developers. Anybody who's used to the  the Unix toolchain  and most developers want some sort  of Unix toolchain. That means Windows  is no longer, you know, out of  the question. A lot of people bought Macs.  A lot of web developers use Macs just because that  because they have the bash shell. They have a command  line. So I was shopping around  and with lots of help from our chat room, I've tried  a lot of different distributions. Of course, your first  one you go to is Ubuntu. A lot  of people say Linux Mint. That's the most popular  distribution right now on Distro  Watch. But there's security reasons.  I'm not sure I want to go with Linux  Mint. They block some of the upstream updates  and so forth for compatibility reasons.  Ubuntu also  in a way kind of gets out of date  fast. If you do the stable release, you're  going to be out of date on a lot of stuff.  Then I looked at Debian, which is  what Ubuntu and Mint are based on.  And that's a pretty nice operating system.  If you use the Debian stretch  version, they have Debian as it right.  They have a stable version that tends  to be older but is very rock solid.  And then  somebody told me, oh, you should use Arch Linux.  That's a build-it-yourself Linux. And I did build an Arch  system. You have to be a Linux guru  to do it. And finally, somebody told me about this.  This is Antergoth.  Antergoth is from Spain.  And it is a Linux  distribution  that is Arch,  but it's pre-configured to be  very easy and friendly to use.  And actually, I really,  really like it. I've put it on two machines  now. And I think anybody  looking to get both  a rolling updated Linux, a Linux  like Arch that is constantly up  to date, but a user  interface that is agreeable,  easy to use. And remember, you've got a full  free  office suite, LibreOffice.  You've got a lot of the tools that you use.  If you put Chromium on it, that's identical  to Google Chrome. In fact, you  log in with Google, and you  sync it with your stuff and all of your,  every one of your Chrome  things works.  I mean, this is a really,  you know, your Chrome extension works. This is a  really friendly, nice Linux. I've been  very happy with it. Antergos  and like all Linusies, they're free, although  they have a Patreon.  You can be a patron, and I decided to be a $5 a month  Patreon supporter for that.  Everybody will say they have  their own favorite, but I  think this is pretty impressive.  And then I also wanted to mention that  one of the founders of  Opera  has released his new  browser. It's been in beta for some time,  but Vivaldi is now out  at Vivaldi.com.  And this is a  interesting browser choice, very  customizable.  I don't, it's not going to replace  Chrome for me, but  it has some features that you  might kind of like, including gestures  and quick commands,  a better management of tabs,  a note-taker  built in, and  it's compatible with plug-ins.  I think it's compatible with Firefox  plug-ins. I'll have to check on that.  But you might, you know,  there's always room for a new browser.  Vivaldi 1.0  is now out, and it's also  like Linux, it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  also free and... Yeah, it's good to have more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  competition to push the feature sets. I  agree. There's some really interesting  features in here. When was the last  time you used Firefox? I  try it every once in a while. I just, I can't,  Chrome is so perfect for what I want.  It is. I really like Chrome.  Of course, I can't use anything else. Yeah, because  you're on a Chromebook. Yeah.  So,  a couple of picks, but I have  to say I've been very, very happy with  Enterogos, which gives us kind of the  build-it-yourself features of Arch  with a nice kind of set of  pre-configured starting  points. And you can choose from  Cinnamon, which is the Mint  desktop, if you want a real Windows-like desktop.  There's Gnome, there's KDE,  there's Mate, there's a lot of good desktops on it.  Alright.  I think we can wrap this up.  Jeff Jarvis. Have you typed it?  Always a pleasure.  You'll find Jeff at BuzzMachine.com,  which is his  Medium feed, and  on Google+.  It will be soon. Yeah. Are you going to  move at all to Medium? I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  tempted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm tempted too.  Are they doing an event tomorrow night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, something here. I'm going  to let you know what they say. I'd love to know next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, we'll do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So next week is F8.  I think what I'll do is rather than trying to come up,  I think I'll actually try to, oops, there go the lights.  Find a place to... Maybe settle?  Do it from there. Okay, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Boy, F8 should be interesting.  It's no accident that Facebook released  Facebook Live just the week before  F8, is it? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Rumors of the bot store next week,  and Messenger, the fact that the  Messenger is now encrypted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're so way ahead on the platform, on the  messaging platform. I would love to see some sort of  integration between WhatsApp and Messenger too.  There's got to be something there.  We'll find out. We'll be covering that.  Facebook F8 keynote, that's their  developers conference, live on Twitter.  And we'll do, of course, we'll talk a lot  about it on Twig next week.  Thanks for being here.  We'll see you every Wednesday,  I hope, 1.30 Pacific, 4.30 Eastern  time, 20.30 UTC.  Watch live  on Facebook or Twitter.tv  slash live. I don't know if I'll do  the Facebook thing again next time.  And you can always get on-demand versions  after the fact on Twitter.tv slash  TWIG or wherever you  get your podcasts. There are lots of podcast  catchers. And of course, every  platform has a Twit app or two or three  thanks to our great independent developers. We thank  you, fellas and gals,  for doing those apps for us.  We really like them.  Thanks for being here. We'll see you next time  on this week on Google Live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
