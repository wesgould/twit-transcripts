Transcript:  It's time for Twig, this week in Google.  Stacy Higginbotham is here, Jeff has the week off.  No politics, I'm sorry.  We're in Newcomb, the Maker Guy is here also.  We're gonna talk about CES there.  Stacy found so many interesting, weird, cool,  and useless gadgets at CES.  We've got a long list.  What's happening to Hangouts?  Where is Google Voice going?  And Waymo has made it Waymo less expensive to buy LIDAR.  Yeah, that doesn't really work, does it?  This week in Google is next.  Netcasts you love.

It's time for Twig this week in Google,  the show where we talk about the latest  from the Googleverse.  I have to give you a disclaimer every single week  because I still get emails.  You know, you spent the whole first segment  of this week at Google on Facebook.  Yeah, it's not just Google despite the name.  It's the internet, what's going on in the world  with Jeff Jarvis here.  It's often about journalism  because hey, that's changing too.  It's really the show if anything is about  how the world is changing thanks to technology.  Jeff is not here, he's traveling.  So we've got Aaron Newcomb filling in.  It's great to see you, Aaron.  Hey, good to see you, Leo.  Regular appearance on this network on Floss Weekly  on the new screensavers all about Android.  He's a maker, runs the Benicia Maker Space.  Good friend of the network, it's great to see you.  I don't know, have you met Stacey Higginbotham?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, yeah, we've been on before I think,  a couple of times maybe, yeah.  Stacey's here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I get excited when Aaron's on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yay!  Stacey's here from the IoT podcast,  iotpodcast.com and Stacey on IoT.  She's an IoT guru, a journalist going way back  and just back from CES.  How was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was awesome.  And I'm gonna apologize to everybody because I have a cold.  So I might be less coherent than usual,  but still excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just as enthusiastic, I'm happy to see.  A lot of people came back,  we were just talking to Paul Theron on Windows Weekly  and he's so grumpy about CES and everybody gets sick.  You did, I noticed you have a cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I was, so, okay, I don't get grumpy about a lot of things  because I'm pretty darn cheerful.  This was not a CES where you saw lots of new things.  I didn't walk through going,  holy cow, my world is rocked.  This is amazing.  But I did see a maturation in IoT.  I saw a lot of really interesting hardware startups  that are actually pulling together  some really important pieces.  And I also saw Qualcomm has this amazing glance technology  that is doing computer vision.  Eee, itty bitty, itty bitty, like that itty bitty on a chip.  And it's sub two milliwatts,  it consumes sub two milliwatts of power,  which means you could have computer vision on a sensor.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wah wah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  It is, it's pretty game changing.  It's not real yet though.  That was kind of part of the CES vaporware,  except Qualcomm usually does try to bring these things out.  They're giving it to their partners to experiment with it.  And as a note for people who care about computers,  who care about computer vision,  this is only gonna do limited models.  So it's only gonna be able to tell the difference  between like a few things.  So it's not like Facebook style,  it will recognize your individual face,  but it would recognize like people versus trees and dogs.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Qualcomm story is actually kind of interesting.  They've gone through several cycles.  In fact, they were a real hot stock for a while  because they made what the CDMA chips  that all the phone companies were using.  And then.  Verizon.  Oh Verizon, one of the other.  And Sprint.  Yeah.  But it seems as if, you know,  through acquisitions and through kind of  a little bit of pivoting,  they've now become like a chip maker to rival Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's been going on.  I think the,  as the mobile evolution revolution happened,  people were like,  oh look, Qualcomm is the Intel of the mobile phone.  And they were, and part of it was because  they had their applications processors,  the brains melded to the radio.  So it was cheaper.  So you had this massive Qualcomm silicon package  and you were like, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they were originally a radio company.  And then. They were.  And then they just adapted arm architecture  to make them a multi-purpose chip, a system on a chip.  And that's what really propelled them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They saw that we were going to do,  that we could shove more computing into a small phone.  And they were like, hey, how can we do this  with maximum efficiencies and lowest costs  for smartphone people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also did a smart thing when it wasn't clear  who was going to be the next generation.  They chose LTE over WiMAX.  And that turned out to be a very good choice.  And they become the LTE radio provider, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They actually bought a WiMAX company, Flareon,  and they got the patents associated with WiMAX,  but they were like, that's probably not going to be it.  And then all in on LTE.  So they actually did a little hedge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I didn't know is that they own Atheros,  which is probably the number one Wi-Fi chip maker as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Three years ago, that was like an IOT buy.  And then they also, so you see them,  like I always follow Qualcomm because they usually,  right before something gets super hot  is when they make their investments.  So they actually bought AMD's graphics division  back in the day before everyone was like,  hey, I want to watch videos on my phone.  They did Atheros, they just did, what did they just do?  They did some drone deals.  And now they're going to be bought by NXP.  No, they're buying NXP.  Who's buying whom?  They own-  Maybe it's a merger.  It's a merger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Qualcomm and NXP merger, huh?  That's interesting.  They own Surf, which is the big GPS chip company.  They really, if you look at what they own  and their portfolio and what they're doing,  and now with this 835 chip,  which they also talked about at CES,  which is not merely a server chip,  but like a super chip,  the first 10 nanometer FinFET technology,  they're actually at the point  where they're eclipsing Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No?  Okay, so there are more companies  because they've built everything on ARM architecture,  which isn't a bad plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of other ARM manufacturers though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly, there's a whole nother ecosystem at play here.  So Intel was the only x86, so there was no competition.  Even Intel wants to make ARM now.  I know, they do.  But like Cavium has a server chip for,  a server chip for servers,  an ARM-based server chip.  Applied Micro has one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they're not the only player in the ARM space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they're definitely the largest and most credible.  They have a deal in China to make servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're making, and again,  they're making systems on a chip,  which is a more, you know.  So Apple makes ARM processors.  They don't make them,  they create their own ARM-based processors  for their iPhone and iPod.  Samsung is a big ARM manufacturer.  The Exynos chip is based on ARM.  But ARM is hot.  I mean, Microsoft announced Windows on ARM  a couple of weeks ago.  How's it big?  A lot of people in Apple land are convinced  that Apple eventually will move off x86,  the Intel architecture, and move everything to ARM.  Of course, not just the iOS stuff,  but the Mac OS stuff as well.  Aaron, I mean, you must be following all this too,  because as a maker, you're playing with chips all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, and a lot of the boards that I use,  use Allwinner.  They're another player in the ARM space.  And you can develop an ARM SOC fairly easily.  The standards are out there.  And ARM is getting faster and faster all the time.  Yeah.  So there's reports out about all the new phones.  It's like, wow, when is ARM going to move past Intel  in terms of performance?  It's not quite desktop class yet, right?  It's not desktop class,  but there's a lot of processing power there.  And there's things that you can do with it.  And all of the libraries have been written,  compiled on ARM now.  So when you're using an ARM system,  it feels just like you were using any other system,  a BSD or a Linux or for that matter, a Windows.  So yeah, the ARM is huge in the maker community.  And because the systems don't need to be as big,  they're smaller, they're for hobbyists,  they're easier and cheaper to produce.  For all of those reasons, ARM is just really becoming,  and it's different, you know?  It's different.  It's a different sort of architecture.  So it doesn't necessarily have to compete with Intel.  Right, it's low power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So both in terms of power usage and in terms of abilities,  but that's changing a little bit  as it gets faster and faster and smarter and smarter.  And ultimately, IoT is driving us  towards this distributed computing model  where no one computer needs to be that fast, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, well, I was going to say ARM doesn't think about,  I mean, okay, they think about processing,  but you see this even with Intel  when they're talking about things,  processing power is not the game it used to be.  Now you're looking at performance per watt,  you're looking at battery life  if you're not talking about servers.  So I think, again,  now if you're actually thinking about investment  or the future, an important thing to think about  is a lot of ARM, one, ARM is licensing its technology.  So it's not a one-to-one to Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ARM doesn't make chips.  ARM is an architecture, not a manufacturer.  They're a fabless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're fabless.  Fabless.  I'm sorry.  But two, a lot of these embedded chips,  they sell for like five bucks or less.  And Intel chips are like, what, 130, 200?  I mean, they come in an armored truck  when you see them coming into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's the point.  Intel comes from that mindset  where you have one big thing, one big expensive computer.  ARM comes from the idea of having lots of minimites  everywhere, right?  So we used to go to CES every year.  We'd always be in the South Hall  by the home automation alliance,  the Zigbee, the Z-Wave, all of these people.  I visited those booths.  Oh, remember the Zigbee Pavilion?  And it was always, every year I'd go  and it was like the land that time forgot.  There was just very little progress made  over a period of 10, 15 years.  Are we finally making some headway here  with home automation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Things look cleaner and prettier.  So there, I saw over a dozen companies  with full on smart home automation suites for sale.  And they range from like service providers,  like Deutsche Telekom has one.  I can't think of it.  It starts with a Q, Cui-Vio, Cui-Vio, anyway.  Comcast actually was there for the first time  showing off Xfinity Home.  So this was their first booth.  And then you had like a lot of very viable Chinese companies  coming in like Zimando had a very pretty,  well-designed products that I'm actually gonna get  copies of, I'm gonna get versions of so I can review them  because I was actually really impressed  at what they were showing.  And so that feels maybe not progressed,  but it feels usable for normal people.  It doesn't feel like a bunch of people and programmers  and CDA guys hanging around those booths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They felt like real people could be there.  Where it always was hobbled was by the kind of  Tower of Babel of all these different protocols,  none of which talked to anything else.  And then we went through the hub era, which was smart.  We're still in the hub era.  We're still in the hub era where people like SmartThings  and others would create a hub that spoke many languages  and the idea was, well, we can control it all.  But it's always been too complicated for consumers,  too kind of fragmented to invest.  I mean, you would be very reluctant to invest heavily.  Oh, I guess you had to.  If you went Crestron, well, you're all Crestron now  or you go Zigbee, well, you're all Zigbee now.  And so Apple came along with HomeKit.  Google's got its home play,  although I don't know what to call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those are all too early.  It's too early.  I talk to people three to five years  till standards don't matter,  till the protocol wars don't matter.  And I was like, well, what do I do?  Do I buy my light bulbs today?  And they're like, sure you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They said that three to five years ago, they said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No one is, so what Zigbee got together with the Thread Group,  these are two wireless protocols that run,  both run on 802., oh, I'm going to screw it up, 15.4, I think.  The Zigbee radio basically, Thread runs on that too.  They created dot dot.  So now we've got to be thinking dot dot  is the application layer that goes over it  and talks to things.  It's called dot dot?  Yes, dot dot.  Just dot dot.  The goal is eventually that will run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds like a Dr. Dolittle kind of animal.  I got a dot dot here.  It goes two ways at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's, and that'll compete with Intel's backing  something called Iotivity.  Oh god.  Oh god.  I know they're awesome.  All the good names are taken.  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Iotivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So last year it was all joined in Iotivity.  And Iotivity 8 all joined.  So now that's part of Iotivity.  So now your two standards wars are going to be Iotivity dot  dot, and I'm going to say Weave from Google.  Okay.  Yeah, hopefully.  Hopefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do you like Weave, Aaron?  Why would you like Weave to be a player?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mostly because I guess I trust Google to manage it.  I don't think they have a huge stake in it.  Their stake is different than everybody else's.  They're not necessarily trying to sell devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, if anybody were going to unite,  it would be Google because they're not in the hardware  business, particularly they're in the communications  business, I guess.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And yeah, intelligence business or data business.  Data business.  And so for that reason, and also because in order to get  these devices to work, you need code that is fast,  is simple, and Google's really good at doing fast,  simple code.  I mean, that's their bread.  They have to do that.  That's how your searches on Google show up so quickly.  And that's how you can ask Google Home to do something  and it responds almost instantaneously.  It is kind of amazing.  And so if anybody can make that happen,  I think I'd like Google to,  I wanted Google to win with things like Google Plus.  And there's a whole string of things  I've wanted Google to do. I think that's over.  Yeah, all of those things, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that one's over.  I hate to tell you, Aaron, bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Plus. That's the downside, right?  Is there's things like, you can go back  and there's a whole history of Google Buzz  and all these things that were cool,  but Google kind of fell down on it.  And so I'm hoping they don't this time.  But if it becomes a standard and other people start using it,  then that's what happened with Android, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is they- What does Google need to do  to make Thread and Weave succeed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How big is Weave?  That was one of the-  I don't know how much memory you need to have to run it,  because in IoT, you need something  that runs on a super small footprint.  That's where IOTivity is weak right now.  Google's Brillo is too big,  but I don't know where Weave is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I know. Yeah.  Brillo is Android Things now, right?  Did that change that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, sorry. Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's hard to keep up with.  We talked about- The only reason I know  is because we talked about this on the new screensavers  before the break.  So yeah, so they just redid that.  And in fact, you can download that  and run it on a Raspberry Pi.  But again, that's full stack Linux, right?  I'm running on a Raspberry Pi.  It's not microcontroller firmware  like you would want to run in these devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can see why this is,  A, so annoying and complicated to consumers  that they just throw up their hands and say,  I'm not gonna-  This is why it hasn't caught on.  And B, you could see why journalists-  I'm having a hard time covering it.  It's, I mean, this is your beat, Stacey.  You picked this.  Are you nuts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love it.  Okay, I used to cover semiconductor manufacturing.  Okay. So, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm like, I used to write about low K dialectics, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, there you go.  All right, so let's talk about actual things then.  Yeah, let's talk about fun devices.  That you saw.  I mean, one of the things, from a distance,  it was clear that Amazon Voice Services  really was one of the big winners at CES.  They were everywhere, weren't they?  Dozens of devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  She Who Shall Not Be Named was everywhere.  She was in these, even in Echo-like devices.  So, we saw Lenovo's prettier, better speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just looked like an Echo with nice fabric around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it a better speaker?  It is, it has better.  So, the big complaint against the Echo  is it's kind of not enough base.  This has, boom, boom.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's 20 bucks less.  And it is 20 bucks less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Amazon doesn't care, because they make money.  They're kind of an interesting,  Google-y kind of position in all of this.  They make money if you use it,  because most of the time people buy doll houses  and they finances the whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, can we just talk about that?  Just for a brief two seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody knows this story by now.  We've talked about it before,  but a station in San Diego  did a story about a six-year-old  who inadvertently, or maybe even advertently,  bought a doll house using her parents' Amazon Echo.  And apparently, they listened back to the recordings,  because as you know, Echo saves the recordings.  And she just said, oh, let's play, nigga.  And then apparently, four pounds of sugar cookies  and a doll house arrived two days later.  So, they did the story, and then the anchor said,  gee, I wish I could say, Echo, buy me a doll house.  And people, according to the news, all over San Diego,  their Echoes suddenly ordered doll houses.  That's got to be apocryphal, right?  Is that what you're about to say, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the first part, I can see how that happens,  but you have to confirm a purchase.  I can see how a kid playing would be like,  yeah, yeah, whatever.  And you have to give it a pin.  Well, no, you don't.  So, when you said, I do.  So, when you set up your Echo,  you are automatically opted in to buying stuff,  but you do have to confirm it.  So, that's step one to avoid this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the pin is not there by default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Two, you can set a passcode,  and I highly recommend you guys do,  even though it is the least secure thing to give,  because she asks you, what's your passcode?  And then you're like, it's, you know, one, two, three, four.  And then your kid who's sitting right there  now knows the passcode.  So, I'm kind of like, is this secure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I suspect that's what happened.  I have heard conflicting stories.  I've asked my audience if the pin is on by default or not.  It is not.  Here's what my guess is.  It was not earlier on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it is now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I believe it is now.  And I don't remember ever putting a pin on my stuff,  but it does have a pin.  So, I think they changed at some point is what happened.  But I may be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, because I was in that initial December,  and once you buy one and set it up, you're stuck forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, I've seen actually online terms of service  that say a pin is required.  I'm not sure.  So, here's the thing, I'll ask the chat room.  Has anybody bought and installed an Amazon Echo  or a dot in the last month?  And does it have a pin or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These people are saying no.  They're saying it's not changed.  They just looked at the registration page.  Okay.  Somebody in your chat room is excited about RISC-V.  I'm gonna talk to them later.  All right, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't even, you mean RISC,  reduced instruction set computing?  Yes, it's an open source computing project.  And there's a fifth-  I'm reporting on it right now.  The fifth generation.  All right, so-  No, no, don't, yes.  CES.  So, it is possible, it is possible  that people all over San Diego,  the news anchor ordered a dollhouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is possible because if you don't have the pin  and you could, but okay.  But you still say,  are you sure you wanna buy this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or do you wanna buy this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  So, that's, that was my thing.  I'm like, God, news, we're so credulous  and stupid sometimes.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, and we, but see, we've known this  because our audience are early adopters.  They all, many of them have Echos  and we've had this problem for a year.  At least.  Yes.  That we can't say the A word.  So, we've known about this for a while,  but I think it's probably, it was an overblown story.  Nonetheless, very, everybody loves it.  It's a cute story.  So, all right, let's take a break.  I wanna talk about more hardware.  We could talk about RISC-V if that's what floats your boat.  Nope, nope.  Anything you're in a mood to.  This is our first chance to talk IoT at CES.  You're the expert, Stacey, so.  And it's actually nice-  I'm going through my things.  It's nice that we have Aaron here  because of course as a maker,  he's deals with a lot with these chipsets  and with his technologies all the time.  So, and you've built quite a few IoT,  handmade IoT devices, right, Aaron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, from scratch, we showed those off  on the new screensavers as well.  I'm working right now actually on a simple relay.  I call it a simple internet of things switch,  which has a small microcontroller on it and a relay  and you can program it easily and, you know,  stick it in your wall behind your thing  and you can program it yourself  to do whatever you want to do.  Now, of course, you know, it's not going to be  for an average Joe user, but at least it gives you  an option to do something different  or to conform to whatever API you want to conform to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like that even with all the progress we've made  in the consumerification of IoT,  really anybody who's trying to integrate all this,  everybody's got one or two things, unintegrated,  you know, things, but the people who are integrating  this stuff are more like Aaron where they're,  well, I've built a little device here that I've plugged in.  I mean, it is not yet a consumer, easy to use technology,  even with the hubs, I think we still have a way to go.  Yep.  Let's talk about robotics,  because one of the things that was announced and shown  for the very first time at CES was Curry.  Did you get to see a little Curry, the real live robot pal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't it cute?  It's so cute.  It's not coming out till like November.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, I know.  But I'm, you know, and we're trying to get them  to bring one up here.  This is our new sponsor.  That story is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.  I will come to the studio to play with Curry again.  I know you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, you should bring your daughter  because it's exactly your daughter's size.  The kids love Curry.  Curry's just a couple of feet high.  He, it's a he, I asked them.  The company that makes it, Mayfield Robotics,  has been doing this stealth for about three or four years  now, they completely sneakily created this robot.  But I found out that they're owned by Bosch,  the big German industrial company.  So there's some big bucks behind Curry.  This is not, you know, somebody in their garage.  And they've done something really interesting.  In fact, this was a trend, I think at CES,  because they've made Curry, it's not humanoid.  You wouldn't confuse it with a human, but it's appealing.  It's cute.  It's got eyes, it blinks.  It's got, it's just, it's like your little robot pal.  Curry learns your home's floor plan, where the stairs are,  which room belongs to who.  It learns the rhythm of your household.  It can wake you automatically.  It can wake you in time for work,  greet you when you come home at night.  Now don't worry, Curry is not,  Curry's not gonna talk to you.  Curry just beeps and boops,  which makes, I think is part of the charm of Curry.  Here's what Curry sounds like.  Here's, that's the, and then there's, this is yes,  and that's no.  Yes, no.  It also blinks.  Does that, I think that was inspired.  Instead of having it, giving it a voice, it's friendly.  So it connects to your Curry app.  You can, it does listen.  One of the things Curry does is kind of cool.  If it detects an unusually loud noise,  it will go check it out.  And Curry has cameras and he'll send you,  on the app, he'll send you pictures  and sound of what's going on, which is really awesome.  You can also use Curry to, like,  is the dog in the couch?  Go look, Curry.  And Curry, when you're not home, Curry will check for you.  It'll check if there's somebody at the door.  You can listen to songs, audio books, podcasts.  You can say, Curry, go into the kids' room  and read it a story, read the kid a story.  She'll connect to any entertainment hub  you have in your home.  I really love it.  Adorable Curry wants to be your friend,  and you can pre-order it right now.  Curry will be $6.99, but if you,  you can do a refundable pre-order of $100,  pay $5.99 on shipping.  So you're not on the hook until Curry ships.  As you said, Stacey, later this year,  find out more about Curry at the website, heycurry.com.  Hey, Curry.  Let me do that, what I just did again, Karsten,  because this is kind of cool.  We're gonna look into Curry's brain.  Hey, this is the CAP touch sensor,  capacitive touch sensors, let it respond  to the human touch.  It taps.  This is smart.  So if you touch Curry on his head, I'm sorry,  he'll look up at you and chirp in a nice way.  He'll say hi.  I think it's smart to do that,  because I think what happens is like with a pet,  we anthropomorphize, and we give Curry more personality  if it doesn't have as much to begin with,  you know what I'm saying?  It's got HD camera, video and stills.  It can nod.  It's got what they call gestural mechanics  with head and eye movements that look fluid and natural.  I just can't wait.  Yeah, we'll get one up here and we can play with it.  It's got array mics, a little heart light like ET  that can light up.  So I mean, they've been really thinking about this.  Nice speakers, sounds good.  Did you see Curry when you were at the?  I did.  Yeah, really cute.  So here's the deal.  Heycurry.com, H-E-Y-K-U-R-I.  That's how you spell Curry, K-U-R-I.com.  Check out Curry, pre-order, $100 down.  It's refundable by the way.  When it's time for charging, he, I keep wanting to say she,  goes right to his little charging pad and takes a power nap.  So he's always ready to go.  Your little robot pal who's fun to be with.  Hey, Curry, H-E-Y-K-U-R-I.com.  I really, when they called and said,  you know, we'd like to do some ads  cause we were really excited about this  and we want to kind of get the word out.  I said, are you kidding?  This is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I want my, it is awesome.  I want my robots to have arms because until my robot can,  you know, do laundry or put dishes away.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see the laundry machine,  the folding machine that they had?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I went and looked for it.  I didn't see it, but you know,  two or three of the smart homes had Pepper.  And I don't know if you've seen Pepper.  What's Pepper?  She's, she is from, it's the French robotics company.  It starts with an A.  Aldebaran.  Yes, Alder.  Yeah.  It sounds like a Star Wars planet.  Aldebaran.  So Pepper was everywhere demoing  inside people's smart homes setups.  And I was so excited cause I thought Pepper was going to  like do things, but she was just to attract, like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is why, yeah, a robot.  This is why I think that Curry's smart not to have arms  and a big voice and stuff.  Cause it promises more that can deliver, right?  Right.  This just does, you know, this doesn't do anything.  It looks like it should do something,  but all I can do is, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does things, but yeah, it's not as cool as you would think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not anything useful.  It doesn't mix you a drink.  That would be useful.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think that as we start these things off  in the early days, it would be better not to do,  not to imply you can do so much.  Here's some more video of Curry from the IEEE Spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, no, that's Pepper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's an expensive, oh, I'm sorry, Pepper, not Curry.  That's an expensive toy, if you ask me.  Well, even their smaller one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And when you guys were talking about Curry,  I didn't want to bring it up during the ad,  but you know, this same company also makes the Now,  and NAO robot as well.  It's been out for a while, but I still think even that one,  which is about the size of the Curry,  I think it's like five, $6,000 or something.  But it does have arms and legs.  And in fact, I saw the Now,  I went to Cirque du Soleil in San Francisco,  and as part of their pre-show,  there was these robots up on stage,  and they were doing all sorts of stuff.  And I said, that's a Now.  I tell my wife, and my wife didn't care,  but I was like, hey, that's a Now.  They just put like silver paint on it and stuff.  And we had one of the reps for them come out  and do a demonstration at our makerspace.  They are pretty cool, but they're cool.  They don't really, like you said,  they don't fold the laundry, they don't provide healthcare,  they don't, you know, anything that you might want  a robot to do.  So I think we've still got a long way to go  to get to that point.  I think these are just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Now is greeting people in a Hilton hotel.  Wow.  Their demo, okay, it might be a Hyatt.  It's a Hilton or Hyatt, it's a deal with IBM.  So Now stands up on the desk as in Czech.  Hello.  I am Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Welcome to the hotel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, in Westworld it ain't yet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  I'm okay with that though.  Yeah, I'm much, yes, I agree.  You saw what happened in Westworld,  I'm not as, you know, listen.  Don't give Now a gun, let's just say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So CES, I'm going to do categories.  There were lots of things for wellness  and a lot of things for breathing into stuff  and detecting, so Mint detects if you have bad breath,  you breathe into this like thing and you go,  and it's like, whoa, back off.  Or, so that's one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're selling this by the way.  This is introducing Mint by measuring the organic compounds  in your mouth released by various bacteria.  It can monitor your oral health.  See, that's more interesting  than just saying you have bad breath.  It could say, you got the beginnings of gingivitis  or something, I mean, that would be more useful, right?  Or, you know.  Well, sort of, yes.  Or, well, if you do something about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm like, I would be fine just to be like,  God, don't talk to anybody, Stacey.  Go brush your teeth.  Maybe with the like gingivitis stuff,  the insurance company will buy it, I don't know.  So there was also a company called LevelNow,  L-E-V-L, now.com, and they checked for,  I think it's the acetone in your saliva.  Oh, that's for ketosis.  It's for ketosis, yes.  So it's detecting if you're burning enough fat.  This is not it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a community association management.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's missing an E, so L-E-V-L, now.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see the internet, we're running out of vowels.  That's the problem.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could use that, though, for my diabetes.  That would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, because ketoacidosis is actually  a very dangerous condition that you can get into  with diabetes.  But this would, so yeah, so it's for weight loss.  So it's to help you go into ketosis,  safe ketosis for weight loss.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is, because there are lots of kids with epilepsy.  There actually is a diet for migraine people,  people who suffer from migraines,  and that if you're on a super low ketosis diet,  I don't know what the right ketogenic diet,  I think, is what it is.  Ketogenic, that's right.  Yes, so this could be useful there.  This looks really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm gonna sign up right now for this.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  So that was cool.  Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This one is also good, or let me say interesting.  It's called, what is it called?  Leaf, L-I-E-F Therapeutics,  and the website is GetLeaf.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is a nice Scandinavian boy gonna come to my house?  No, that would be.  That would be Leif, sorry, I misspelled.  That would be Leif.  Leif Therapeutics, hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would buy that service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Leif as in relief.  I saw the ad for this.  It's a biosensing patch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, and you know, I will say with all of these,  there's a fine line between wellness  and actual therapeutics, right?  And there has to be,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because the FDA gets involved  as soon as it makes health recommendations  or becomes a therapeutic device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you know, this could be so much snake oil,  but this was interesting because it looked at your,  you wear it as a patch right underneath your chest,  and it detects when you're stressed  and you're supposed to do biofeedback,  and it's supposed to help improve people  who are depressed or anxious.  It's supposed to start training you to like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It actually can be used with CBT,  which is a cognitive behavioral therapy.  It's a treatment that I know,  because I have a member of my family who uses CBT  to control mental illness.  And so the idea is to give you tools  to control your mood, your anxiety,  so that you can, without medication,  kind of get an even keel.  So having some, like something to say,  hey, your anxiety level's going up,  because you don't always notice it,  would be very helpful, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that was that.  And then there were like nine breast pumps there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know.  I'm sorry, I'm a man, I'm gonna giggle.  I apologize, that shouldn't giggle.  There's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As a woman, I nurse my daughter.  Let me just tell you,  breast pumps are the most archaic,  medieval things out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember doing this with Jennifer when Abby was born,  and it was painful.  And I'm watching this happen,  and I'm thinking that was invented by a man.  That's what I'm thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, you feel like a cow.  A cow.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's probably derived from the same devices used on cows.  Probably, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a similar, I mean, it's a similar process.  So.  But.  I'll just stop.  My favorite was this company.  It's called Willow.  And what these are.  Are you expecting, Stacey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is there a reason you have this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I just, like I said,  I nursed my daughter for 18 months.  So you're interested.  The whole time, I was like, technology!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, for one thing,  this looks a lot less like the kind of thing  you milk a cow with, and much more,  well, like a bra,  like something that would fit you comfortably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It fits in your bra.  So this is probably TMI for your,  like many people in your audience,  but I'm just gonna tell you,  when you breast, when you pump,  you like have to take off your clothes.  You're like, there's apparatuses, there's tubes,  there's like a giant pump that's like this big, you guys.  This is literally a shell.  And noisy.  It's like.  And then there's the engine in the back.  It's, ugh.  So you can't do it in the office and be discreet.  This is not a discreet process.  But this one would be.  It fits in your bra.  It fits in your bra, it's quiet.  It's, yes, I was like.  Oh, this is great.  I wanted to go out and get pregnant and try it.  I was like, yes!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, look at that.  Oh, this is gonna be huge.  Isn't this funny how we've suffered for so long  with really primitive technology?  It hasn't probably changed in a hundred years.  And this, of course, has its ties into your smartphone.  So you can, it has a milk tracking app.  I'm not making that up.  I'm glad they mentioned this.  Willow is for women.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I'm not gonna go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm guessing it was made by a woman.  And that's the one thing you immediately think  when you look at the predecessors is no woman designed this.  Wow, that's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it'll be out.  So they're targeting, I believe, the June timeframe for this.  And FDA approval.  And FDA approval.  They already have it.  Yeah, they have it.  The key for this will be, for widespread folks,  we'll be getting insurance to cover it.  But the more people who buy it,  the more likely insurance is to cover it.  Is it expensive?  It costs about as much as a normal breast pump,  is the aim.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we rented, we didn't buy,  because they are expensive.  I think we rented.  And you're not gonna use it for more than a year.  So I think we-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could use it for as long as you nurse, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could use it.  Yeah.  But that's roughly a year.  I mean, you didn't nurse till she was seven.  I nursed for 18 months.  Okay, a year and a half.  Fine, that's roughly a year.  All right.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was like, there's a whole movement of women who do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know there is.  And I'm old fashioned enough that it shocks me  when a four-year-old comes up and says,  I'd like to eat now, mommy.  Mommy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I have one for Erin.  I saw these guys again and I love them.  So this is, what's the, it's the Next Thing Co.  They make a $9 board.  Yeah, so the chip,  they actually introduced a more powerful $16 board  that I think has, I think it may be Wi-Fi integrated on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll have to double check.  The first one had Wi-Fi.  This is what it looks like right here.  That's the original chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've had the chip folks on.  In fact, we had them on when they invented it,  they went on Kickstarter,  and they brought it when they came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I remember that thing right here, this thing.  That is the great chip.  And that is a $6 chip  that is the brains behind the chip board,  like the new more powerful board.  Sorry, that's the chip pro is what it's called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is rapid, kind of like the American raspberry pie,  Erin or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, to some extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got the pocket chip, which is cool,  because you get a terminal and a Linux command  and you can actually reprogram the games on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, the pocket chip was really cool.  I mean, I think that really helped them out  when they launched this a few years ago.  But yeah, it runs Linux.  And we're going to talk about a similar product later on,  but it runs Linux.  You can connect to peripherals,  you can hook up other things.  And with the original model being $9 and it's Wi-Fi enabled,  there's a lot you can do with it.  Now it doesn't come,  it's kind of hard to hook up like an HDMI display  and things like that.  So, you got to kind of pick where you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's one thing the raspberry pie is really good at.  It's really a full computer ready to go out the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can hook up an HDMI display and go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's not $6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the pie zero is $5.  Yeah, so.  Pie zero is five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  So I thought that was pretty cool.  All right, you want crazy smart home stuff  or should I stop bringing stuff to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, continue on, I'm having fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is all cool stuff, yeah.  Okay.  I have to make fun of it because it was ridiculous.  Look up the Moen, let's see,  I don't know where you're going to find it.  It's the Moen faucetless shower.  It's a $1,300 shower, just Moen and CES  and you'll find the visuals for it, I'm sure.  So what Moen did, Moen makes these beautiful faucets and,  yeah, faucets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They replaced.  I have Moen.  In their house, right?  Yeah, it's one of the big names.  It's lovely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they replaced the turning on button faucet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the one that you have where you tap your faucet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you have one of those though.  I do, so that's capacitive touch and that's a Delta faucet.  Moen does have a capacitive touch faucet too.  Okay.  But this is a app to go with your shower.  Oh, I don't need an app in the shower.  The button, they replaced the faucet with a button pad  that has four buttons on it and a little screen.  There it is.  And it gives you a customized shower.  So everyone's making fun of the IoT hairbrush.  This is the you.  Yes.  Okay, is that what it's called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, just the letter you.  Shower like never before.  Here, let's watch the video.  This is the you video.  It's you for you and your shower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's you, only wetter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this goes in the shower, it's waterproof?  Yes, it is.  Wait a minute, your phone, wait, I don't understand.  Is your phone.  Your phone is not waterproof.  Your phone is outside the shower.  Your phone is outside the shower.  You can tell it what to do.  Oh, it's got colors.  You could pause your shower.  This seems like maybe it's going a little far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a perfect example of put a chip in it philosophy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is where your shower gets hacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can see high end, you know,  or mid range to high end hotels putting this in,  you know, their luxury suites and stuff.  Something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, here's some good news.  With the connection to the cloud,  and all showers should be connected to the cloud.  Future updates to you, you by Moen Shower Setup is automatic.  Automatic firmware updates for your shower folks.  That's what you've been missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I asked if I could tell the Echo,  hey, run me 110 degrees shower.  And they said, no, that's not there.  See, that's perfect.  That I would want.  That's kind of cool.  It eventually, it could do that.  But right now what they've done is basically,  and they've taken it away.  There is no more faucet.  There's no knob.  It's all those buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right.  Erin, you nailed it.  Some high end hotel will have this,  you know, the Aria in Vegas or something.  Right.  The wind to go with their Echoes.  Yeah.  I agree with you though, Stacey.  You gave them a very good idea.  Echo, turn on my shower, 109 degrees please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have no idea how hot my showers are.  But with this, I would-  I think that's real, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a little hot.  I think that's scalding hot.  Not, it wouldn't hurt you, but it would be very hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm thinking you're more of a hundred,  seven, 108 kind of person.  Got it.  I like that.  All right.  But that's the beauty of it.  You could actually say, no,  cause Lisa likes a much hotter shower than I do.  And so she, you know, very, very gentilely  turns the heat down before I get in,  which is very nice of her, you know,  cause she has it really high.  We have a lever that goes hot to cold.  But I just know where it is on the wall.  Like, oh, it's about three o'clock.  If it's at three o'clock,  then it's the right temperature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And usually they take a little bit to heat up.  Like, unless you've got an instant hot water heater.  It'd be so cool to be able to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lisa's is 110, mine's 107.  That would be really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.  Wait a year.  And I bet Moen has that for you.  And you can install this thing in your shower.  I would actually buy that.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If, but it has to,  I have to be able to tell it to Echo.  That's why these voice things are so important  because the hub is everything.  The ability to communicate with these things  in a natural way is everything.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think.  What else?  And it's the auto learning mechanism too  that will eventually come, right?  Right.  It should, I shouldn't have to learn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then you're like, run me a shower.  I just tell it what I want.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It figures it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  We're going to go there eventually.  All right.  Other things that I thought were cool.  This is so fun, Stacey.  Thank you for bringing us back.  Yeah, this is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm like, I'm running out of stuff, but.  This is the view of CES we didn't see.  I like it.  Smarter.  Smarter company.  So they make the iKettle,  which actually was in the news  because I think it was hacked.  But I think.  I'll just, I'll just be right up there.  They did have that.  They fixed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What happens if your kettle gets hacked?  Somebody.  Brews coffee without your knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say they burn the water.  I don't remember the hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everything's been hacked.  Yeah.  Well, that's the, the bigger, by the way,  I just want to say this.  The bigger problem with IOT hacking  is not that you're going to,  somebody's going to turn on your coffee pot remotely,  but that they're going to use it as a gateway  into your network and then be able to plant stuff  onto your network because the,  this device is on your wifi and can be used  if it's, if it's got a security flaws  to get into your network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We can talk about those devices.  I saw two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Smarter launched a fridge cam.  Everybody, woo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, don't want.  I'm excited about fridge cams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is like $149.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much could be going on in the fridge  that you'd really want to see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is so you can check to see if you're out of milk  or do I need to pick up this?  Or did my teenage son eat the last of, you know, the cereal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is the ultimate,  that is the ultimate first world problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is, but you know what?  First world has a lot of money  and they want to know what's in their fridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just can't, I don't want to get up.  Just tell me what's in the fridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's more like I've been to Precious.  If you're tired to Alexa,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  then you could, I'm seeing Echo,  you could say Echo, did Henry drink all the milk?  And Echo would say,  I see you're down to a quarter of a gallon, Leo.  And Echo, could you order me some more milk?  It'll be on your doorstep tomorrow morning.  That would be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  And this is kind of like, I mean, imagine, you know,  Amazon's convenience store thing that they're doing, right?  I mean, this is kind of like your own personal  Amazon convenience store.  It takes the phone, figures it out, it orders it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does food tracking, it does expiry dates,  expiration dates, recipes, notifications.  And somebody pointed out, you don't,  it's handy not when you're home, but when you're at work  and you want to know, do I have enough eggs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's handy when you're at the grocery store  and you're like, oh crap, do I need to pick up this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  I've thought for a long time  about building a barcode scanner system attached  to the fridge so that every time you put something in,  you know, when you buy it, you scan it, put it in.  And then when you take it out, you scan it,  or whatever, and it tracks this stuff,  very similar to this, but it's kind of hard to do.  It's hard to catch all the corner cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is there a light on this fridge again?  Because John's coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's when you open it, because other thing to know  is Wi-Fi in your fridge is basically a giant Faraday cage.  Oh, right.  Well, but it should be when you open it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because it doesn't change while it's not open.  Somebody's coming in and eating.  Then you have real problems.  I suddenly realized, oh yeah, the only time  the fridge contents changes when the door is open.  Okay, that makes sense.  It's a hundred pounds.  You can pre-order it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  So Erin, I have something for you with your barcode scanner.  It is the GenieCan, G-E-N-I-Can.  So the idea here is it was going to be a trash can,  but then that didn't work.  So they are just created a camera  that you stick near your waste bin.  And you can, it's got a barcode scanner,  so you can scan the products as you toss the package  or recycle it.  And I think you can also talk to it  to put things on a shopping list.  I entered the wrong thing,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because I have a Kegel fitness device for your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's the Vibri.  Someone did ask about that.  We can talk about that.  GenieCan is G-E-N-I-G-A-N.  This is Vagini.  Okay, Genie.  Oh yeah, the Vagini is,  it's a vibrator that they basically turned into  like a Kegel exercise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I got it.  Okay.  So Genie can,  makes your trash can smart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it's plugged into Amazon Dash replenishment.  So when you throw stuff away,  it automatically orders it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Let's talk trash.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Grocery lists are such a pain.  They're impossible to maintain and they lack detail.  Talk about detail.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is really creating a problem that does not exist.  Okay.  All right.  So it scans what I throw in the trash can?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you can talk to it and say, buy more milk.  If you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, wait a minute.  Let's see it.  Okay.  Genie can adds-  Oh, you don't have to like,  you can just throw it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Say you want to add ketchup to your shopping list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like you might have to do a little bit more.  Why not add it while you're there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  Okay. Okay.  So she held it up to the,  the thing's hanging on a lip on your trash can.  And before she throws it in,  she puts the barcode in front of it goes,  bling, and now it's on your list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And then you can also talk to it and reorder stuff.  Oh, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, yes, voice recognition.  So, okay.  We've come a long way if this works.  Cause I remember I had a grocery list thing five years ago  where you talked-  A haiku?  Something like that.  It was terrible.  Do you remember it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I tested the haiku.  It had some challenges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So maybe this is better.  We have gotten better, certainly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So imagine this.  So dash replenishment, right?  That's pretty cool.  Or you just send your barcoded order to Instacart.  Like it's just happening.  Look at, you don't even have to,  and then boom, it's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You probably want to tell them,  Hey, wait, I have 10 items or something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yes.  And maybe, maybe you do it up until,  I would check my Instacart order before I sent it on  because sometimes you use stuff and you're like,  I will never buy that product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just found the killer feature.  It'll even text your teenager when the can is full.  Oh, there you go.  It tells your kid to empty the trash.  That's awesome.  Sold 125 bucks for the genie can.  That's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  I mean, that's well within crazy early adopter  device spending range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it that it ties into the Amazon dash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See?  All right.  Let's see.  Should I buy this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think?  Should I?  You know what I'd be afraid of?  In fact, I know this would happen like the first day.  It would get thrown out with the trash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you don't have to stick it right on the trash can.  You could stick it near the trash can  if you were worried about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it wouldn't know where the trash is full  if you did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is true.  Sorry.  If you just want it to text your teenager,  there's some sensors you could just pop up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Darren, would you build me one of those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure, sure.  No problem.  Give me about 10 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trash can sensor.  I'm telling you, you could make some money on that.  Maybe.  I could just, I just see this.  I know this, how this would go.  Hey honey, where the genie can go?  Oh, I don't know.  Maybe we threw it out.  Got emptied with the trash.  What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I laugh because I've been there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I threw away my wedding ring, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's a little Freudian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it was accidental.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's what you're, yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it was, like it was an expensive ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, yeah, no, I'm sure it was accidental.  But I'll tell you, if a guy loses his wedding ring,  no wife. Then it's Freudian.  No wife would ever let a guy get away with that.  Oh yeah, sure honey.  Yeah.  Yeah, you misplaced your wedding ring.  Yeah, sure.  While you were in Vegas.  While you were in Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well yeah, it does depend on the setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, one more and then,  honey, where'd your Vagini go?  I lost it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right, this is just cool tech.  This falls under cool technology.  I didn't see a lot other than the Qualcomm glance thing  and then of this company, which is called UltraHaptics.  And basically they are doing pushed air  to create haptic feedback,  to create like a gesture-based controller  is probably the best way to talk about it.  So their demos were things like an ATM machine  that you didn't have to touch.  You just stuck your hand over it  and then you could enter your code.  I think they had some gambling aspects too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now we've seen, of course, this kind of thing with light.  What is the name of that launch thing  that you could buy for a Macintosh?  Leap.  Oh, leap.  Leap, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So their demos actually had a leap motion  detecting your gesture  and what they were doing is haptic feedback.  So I think I said detecting gesture, I'm sorry.  Oh, so it's not.  The feedback, so you knew if you pressed a,  if you gesture pressed a button, if that makes sense.  You feel it.  You'd feel it.  So this works with the leap.  So yes, and their demos, it was working with a leap.  It could work with other camera systems.  So I thought it was-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you try it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What does it feel like?  Uh-huh.  It feels like, oh, what does it feel like?  It feels like someone blowing on your hand,  like a lot of things.  Oh, oh, a bowling alley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, bowling alley hand dryer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Imagine it's like finer bits of that air  and then you can change the presser  and the finer kind of segments.  Does that make sense at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does.  So it doesn't feel like what it's supposed to be,  but it's giving you feedback of some kind.  I mean, it's not like it's simulating an actual feeling  that you would have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's a totally different feeling.  Oh, place a fine mesh over the bowling alley thing  and control each flow of air through each mesh.  And so then you can-  That's kind of cool.  I thought it was really actually pretty compelling.  So here's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the thing.  If we combine ultra haptics with leap motion  with the Moen faucet,  nobody would ever have to touch a public restroom faucet  again.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, or garbage.  Or garbage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or like an ATM pad or your,  I mean like think of elevator buttons.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ooh.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a lot of surfaces like that  that get pretty grungy as you'll find out  if you have kids my age that are doing science projects  for school.  It seems like there's always a germ one.  Somebody's doing germs and they swab all these things  and you go, oh, that's so gross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Michael did that.  That's so funny, Michael did that.  Yeah.  It was a little weird when I came into the kitchen  and there were all these pet treat dishes,  beet treat dishes on the counter  and they're all growing stuff.  Yeah.  Don't tell me what that one came from.  I don't want to know.  Your toothbrush.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey.  All right.  Thank you for that IoT tour.  Got any, is that it or you, I don't want to cut you off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I mean, you know, at CES,  there's like a chillions of devices.  I'll say two things.  Air quality sensing, very, very hot.  Many devices there.  Yes.  And then sleep is still.  Because they're being made in China  where you can't breathe the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes, they need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, and oh, and I did need a lot of things  that will take your job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So.  Not my job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not your job, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody could take my job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know, Curry might get up here and.  Curry, tell me about what's going on in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it'll say, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Oh, that's true.  Of course, Curry would stick to Google.  So, some people might be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's take a break.  Come back with more.  There's a lot of stories,  and I know we wanted to talk about the Google Hangouts API.  Sad story there.  Changes at Google.  Google Tango.  Lots to talk about.  But first a word from a sponsor that's been,  oh, we haven't seen these guys in a while.  We're glad to welcome them back.  LegalZoom.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, enjoying all the cool gadgets and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's awesome. Yeah, really fun stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'ma let y'all talk now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you go to CES every year or is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I've been for three years now.  Okay, so I had to pick it up when Kevin stopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so this is kind of new for you.  I asked Paul Theron, who hasn't been there  in five or six years, I said, has it changed?  He says, it's exactly the same.  So, I haven't, because I haven't been in a few years.  We used to go every year and do big,  we'd had a big booth there and everything, cover it.  But the problem is we had a couple of just boring CESs  in a row and I thought, why am I spending all this money  to cover iPhone cases?  I'm not that interested.  But this seemed like a year with some very interesting stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you just have to search it out.  I mean, people say that same thing about South By.  They're like, oh, it's so corporate now.  And I'm like, there are always cool people doing crazy stuff  pretty much everywhere.  So, I don't know.  Maybe I just find those people because I'm-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're just so positive and cool and great.  I'm just a curmudgeon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You should have seen me Thursday afternoon at CES.  I was like, I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't care about your Bluetooth thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Were there any rides and self-driving cars there for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I didn't do that.  The car section was huge.  Oh, I forgot about a really cool thing.  Can I tell you?  Because it has huge, great applications  for real people.  Of course.  Plot, P-L-O-T-T.  It is a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute, don't tell us.  Okay, Aaron, let's play a little game.  What do you think plot does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it is a-  Don't look at the screen.  I'm not looking.  I don't think that's actually helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Without looking, I'm gonna say-  That's a kind of dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a garden monitoring system that monitors water  and soil composure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh.  Oh, so the project is actually called Cubit.  I'm sorry.  The company-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, that's a clue.  Don't say anymore.  Okay.  Cubit, see that goes with what I was thinking  because I thought it was a way to measure yourself  for your cemetery plot.  And that goes right in there with a cubit.  So what is plot really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is, so it's, I'm gonna, okay.  It's hard to say because it is more than just a tape measure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wasn't too far off actually, wasn't I?  You were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the idea behind this is it looks,  it's got the form factor of a tape measure.  It uses lasers to detect distance like straight lines,  right?  But underneath you can't see there's a wheel  and it uses that, it uses the wheel to do  like irregular surfaces so you could roll it up  if you were like measuring a sleeve.  So the device itself is about  like creating accurate measurements.  What's cool is the software,  basically it plots out where you need to put things.  So if you wanna just do like the wall of frames,  this is a great example actually.  You don't have to figure out the math of like,  I wanna put this here,  just say I wanna center this in this room.  You take the measurements with the plot  and then you roll it up the wall  and it starts beeping when it's in the center.  Or if you want it, wherever you want it.  And then it also-  Well, how do it know?  You take a picture and it maps it.  This is really interesting.  Like I thought this was freaking awesome.  And I don't even wanna do a frame wall.  But like hanging these shelves behind me,  they're free-formed shelves  and something like that would have been great  to make sure A, it was level,  B, they were in the right spot on the wall.  Cause you can tell it where like  you wanna put your nails in the picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, this is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean you would use it once every five years.  I guess if you're a contractor, you'd use it more often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it was only like,  I think it was like a hundred bucks or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so it's just as expensive,  twice as expensive as a really good tape measure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it does the math for you.  Like I cannot overestimate how important it is  that it does the math for you.  I don't know, I have pictures all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cause you could use a laser level for example,  but you still don't know the spacing and where to nail things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's doing this almost in three dimensions.  Oh, that's really cool.  It's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you could use it for furniture placement too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or bathtub placement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I've seen there are apps that will,  you take a picture of a room  and it kind of makes a 3D model of it, roughly accurately.  You can do measurements by taking pictures.  But I guess having the wheel makes it more accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, did you see him?  He just measured that bathtub and was like,  where is it gonna go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's kind of cool.  I don't know.  I could see a pro getting a lot of use out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Or an interior designer or et cetera, et cetera.  Yeah.  What they need is to be able to do that  and then upload everything into like a 3D design tool  so that you can walk into an empty space,  take all your measurements.  I mean, that's basically what you do anyway, right?  That this would automate the process.  So all your measurements and all that stuff  that you wanna do just gets uploaded  to whatever tool it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you can say, hey, well, I want them evenly spaced.  I want them centered on the wall.  I want them up and down.  I think that's hard to do that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could email it to the container store  and then they would plan out your perfect closet.  And that, see, like think about if you're a business  like that, Home Depot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  They could send you a plot and just say, hey, measure it.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You send them your plot things and your Pinterest page  and boom, it just comes to email.  All the things you want.  Now we're cooking with gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder if they'll have a problem with the name though.  I mean, there's already a qubit out there,  which is another one, another microcontroller product.  I know the owner.  In fact, I think you had them on at some point.  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah, so I wonder if they'll,  there's a lot of qubits out there  that there's probably not enough,  not enough to worry about, but interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there's also qubit with Q's.  Yeah.  So.  Oh yeah, the qubit.  I'm like, I don't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's a board game, I think, right?  Called qubit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I think this is such a generic trademark now.  We don't have to worry about it.  Don't have to worry about it.  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it was an ancient unit of measurement, isn't it?  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, too.  What's a qubit, Jonah?  Remember Jonah, the Cosby routine?  God?  Yes, Jonah.  What's a qubit?  You don't remember that?  Noah.  No.  Not Jonah.  Ed Noah.  Noah.  Oh, okay.  Jonah was the whale.  Noah was the ark.  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would play it, but it's not really done  to play Cosby routines anymore on the year.  No.  Finally, a use for tango.  Speaking of, I guess this is kind of related.  Google tango.  A partnership between Guidigo  and the Detroit Institute of Arts.  When you go to the museum,  you can ask for one of those Lenovo Fab 2 Pros,  which is kind of the first tango phone.  And you take it, and you can see on the video  what the guy's doing.  He's looking at a mummy,  and then using the augmented reality on the phone  to see the skeleton inside.  That is really cool.  So this is, I've been asking all along,  well, I'm not sure I understand  what you would use tango for.  This is probably one of the best uses of it in museums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it seems like Google is really hot on developing this.  I mean, I know, just because I'm in the job market,  I've noticed that they're hiring several tango,  several people for tango on their website.  So yeah, I mean, they gotta do something, right?  I mean, the hardware's pretty much static at this point,  or very low incremental changes between hardware platforms.  So you gotta develop the software.  You gotta develop, or add something like the sensors  to get people interested, I think, at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of a weird story,  and I immediately went to my Google Voice page,  which because I'm a Fi user,  I had to kind of negotiate around to get to it.  A number of people pointed out to the Droid Life blog  that when they went to their Google Voice page,  see, I'm going to it now, and I'm getting redirected to Fi,  and then I go down here and I click Google Voice,  but I'm not getting it.  Nope, not yet, but they're getting it.  They're getting, you have the new Google Voices here.  Try now.  But what is the new Google Voice?  When they tried it, the page just refreshed,  and they didn't get anything up newer.  But Google has in fact confirmed  that it's working on updates to Google Voice.  Hallelujah!  Because I used Google Voice  from the day they bought Grand Central.  That's where they got Google Voice.  I love it, and that's still the phone number I use  as my main phone number,  and I've been deathly afraid that with the advent of Fi  and the deprecation of Google Voice  that it was just going to disappear,  but it sounds like Google might have plans  for Google Voice.  They would not tell TechCrunch when,  but they said they are working on updates to Google Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's actually really good news.  I mean, I also have been a Google Voice subscriber  since the beginning,  and I use it for my cell phone primary number,  I use it for my home phone primary number,  so I never have to worry about moving  or changing numbers or anything like that,  and I'm always like, oh, this is dying to be integrated.  They finally integrated it with Hangouts  several years ago, right?  Of course, now there's problems with Hangouts,  but they finally integrated it with Hangouts,  and it's just one of those things  that's just dying to be more integrated  into the rest of the Google ecosphere, if you will.  So I can't wait to see what they're doing with it.  I just hope that they do it right  and that it's something that's going to be useful,  because we've all been disappointed by these little,  these Google rumors in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lots of people who are listeners to this show  and in the chat room too say,  yeah, I would be devastated to lose Google Voice,  and I've been worried about that, especially.  See, if you get a Fi phone, are you a Fi user, Aaron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am not, I mean, I could be at this point,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that almost stopped me from doing it,  but I have the Pixel, I actually had a Nexus 6,  and I got Fi, actually, I think I got Fi on the Nexus,  yeah, on the Nexus 6,  and the first thing they say is,  okay, you have two choices.  You can either port your Google Voice number over  to make it your Fi number,  or you can say bye-bye to your Google Voice number.  So that actually held off for a while,  because I knew that that was what was going to happen,  and finally I said, all right,  and I ported it over to Google Fi,  but so far all the voice capabilities are still there.  As you saw, you go to your Fi page at the very bottom,  you click Google Voice,  and you can get to your Google Voice page  and still do all the things Google Voice does,  but I just felt like this is the beginning of the end.  Crossing my fingers, crossing my fingers.  I would be sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I too have a Google Voice number  that I've had for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's my public number, it's the number I give everybody,  because I thought, oh, the last number I'll ever need,  and I'll just have it forward  to whatever phone I'm using at any given moment,  which is exactly what I do.  You're not a Google Fi user either, Stacey?  I am not.  Yeah, I think Jeff is.  I seem to remember Jeff.  Jeff is, yes, he talks about it a lot.  It's great for traveling.  And then very sad news, I guess,  and this is another one of those Google things  that they're all hot and excited about it,  and then they lose interest over a couple of years.  You remember that Google Hangouts had all these wild,  crazy things you could do  in the Google Hangouts video calls, conference calls.  Everything from put a mustache on to play ping pong.  Google has announced that they are gonna shut down  the Hangouts API, which will prevent new apps  from being built and turn off all existing apps  on April 25th.  So bye bye.  I read something interesting that makes a lot of sense to me  because we've complained bitterly  about Google's very confused messaging over messages  since SMS apps.  Allo can't be an SMS app,  but Facebook's Messenger can on Android devices.  All Android phones, you typically come with Google's  SMS app messages and an SMS map called messages  from the manufacturer like Samsung or LG.  So I have like four or five candidates for SMS messaging,  including Hangouts.  So what is Allo?  What is Hangouts?  What is their intent?  Which of these should I use?  It's very messed up.  And what I read,  and I think it was probably on a Reddit thread  talking about this Hangouts API,  is it's probably for antitrust reasons.  Google's reluctant, which makes sense, right?  That if they were to say, no, no,  this is the messaging app,  everybody uses Android should use this messaging app,  that that would be an antitrust problem.  Don't know, but that, I couldn't,  it has to be some external force.  Surely Google knows what a hash they've done of this.  Yeah, you would hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple has their own messaging thing.  They control their physical hardware  to a greater extent than Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a very good point.  Apple does have one messaging app.  It does SMS and data messaging.  It's not cross platform.  You have to use, well, it's cross platform  to the extent that it interoperates with the SMS network,  but you can't get Apple messages on Android.  So you're right.  Nevermind, because Apple's not being sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Apple isn't like the king of search  in all kinds of crazy productivity apps either.  So I don't know.  Antitrust is gonna be hard to determine  as we become more converged.  Yeah, what's gonna happen going forward?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't know.  We are in such, it's really,  I've been talking about this a lot  with friends and family off the air.  It's just unknown what's gonna happen in 10 days,  what the world's gonna look like.  Incognito.  I said this morning in the chat room,  I said, I really wonder what a year from now,  what our top news stories will be.  What we'll be talking about on January 10th  or January 11th, 2018.  Could just be like this.  Probably there'll be some Google technology  that they're deprecating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm like, there's deathly silences.  We're all like, we can't even imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We can't.  And some of us don't want to imagine.  Well.  I don't wanna go there.  I'm willing for it to be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm just waiting to see what happens, I guess.  Project Aura, another one of those Google projects  everybody was excited about.  This was the Motorola R&D project,  the modular camera that Google kept  when they sold Motorola.  And of course, it's gone.  Good story on Android Central  of how Aura came and went.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I loved this project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was so sad.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  I did.  No, Leo, you hated it.  You said it was stupid.  I was, cause look at this phone.  This is why.  Look at that phone.  Do you want that phone?  I know.  Is that the phone you want?  And remember, so Aura, the idea was you have modules.  The whole phone's made up of modules  and you build the phone of your dreams.  If you really want a great camera, you put that in.  If it's not as important to you as a big battery,  you put that in.  But you know these wouldn't fit together tightly.  They'd be all janky and wobbly and feel like,  remember those number games  where you had to slide the numbers around  and get them in order?  It'd feel like that.  So is this a VentureBeat story

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  or is this a Android Authority story?  Cause the long epic story-  Oh, you're right.  It's a VentureBeat.  Thank you.  Let's give credit to VentureBeat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just like, they did the reporting, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I get bit by this all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  where a blog will come along and say,  and rehash that.  A blog will come along and say, and rehash the story  and get all the credit and the links.  So let's do the VentureBeat story.  Yeah, in fact, let's give credit to Harrison Webber  who did a lot of good reporting on this.  So there we go. Yay, reporters.  Yay, reporters.  What would we do without you?  You are the grist to our mill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know that phrase.  I think this was a good idea  when they came up with it, right?  Because phones were iterating quickly.  And so you buy a phone and then the next month,  the new phone would come out and have twice as much memory  and all of these features and hardware features  that you didn't have.  And so I go back to what I said before.  I mean, the phones aren't iterating like they used to.  And so it takes away a lot of the need, I think,  to have a phone like this where you can switch things out.  Granted, customization is maybe important,  but I think a lot of the impetus for this was  you want the latest Wi-Fi technology.  You could get the module and replace the one that you had  with something better, like you said,  a better camera or something like that.  I just don't think that,  I think that the speed of the way things are iterating  has slowed down to the point that there's just no need for,  there wouldn't be a demand for it.  Yeah. That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And one of the problems that Motorola had with it is,  well, it's a nice idea, Dennis Woodside,  the CEO at the time of Motorola, it's a nice idea,  but real people don't want to assemble their own smartphone.  They just want to go to the store and get one.  And I think he's probably right.  But we would have liked it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this reminds me, like when you said that,  I was like, oh, that's exactly why I used to build  my own PCs, because then you'd swap stuff out.  And then I'm like, when people were like back in the day,  nobody does that.  You build your own PCs, right?  Why would you do that, man?  What are you creating? That's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's a PC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they knew what PCs were. I could be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I guess what Motorola is doing  with those snap-on backs for the Motorola Zed  is kind of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And those are neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't have the phone.  I don't either.  Actually, I've been really tempted  because the Z Play has really good battery life.  And it'd be kind of fun to have those back.  They've promised to do like one a month for a while.  Like, you know, there'll probably be a lot of them.  Anyway, Project Aura, another one, Bites the Dust.  Do do do do, another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was not the song.  Another one, I don't know what you were singing.  I was just, I'm talking about-  I don't know what you were singing.  You want to talk about Waymo in H3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Waymo, which is a better name.  I like the name because Waymo, better name.  For the Google self-driving car project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, which is now its own company in alphabet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And they're going to start test driving  a minivan later this month.  That doesn't look at all geeky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty ugly compared to the,  what was the other one that just came out?  The Fairchild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Faraday one?  The Faraday's not real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Faraday.  Yeah, that's a concept car that's electric.  Faraday's an imaginary car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see that one at all?  You didn't do any car stuff, did you Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't, you know, there's only so many miles  I can walk in a day or two, two days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, they're not selling it yet,  but they've done drive-offs.  What do you call that?  They've driven it against other, you know, even the Tesla.  And they claim that it outperforms the Tesla.  They're claiming that it's not a fast-  Highly controlled.  Highly controlled environment, of course.  But I mean, they did show off a real car.  And they have 64,000 orders at $5,000 a pop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing is, as a Tesla owner,  I think Stacey, you probably would agree with me,  the kind of the fundamental thing  that Tesla did isn't that hard.  It's a golf cart with a shell on it  and a big computer system.  Making 100,000 of them is hard,  you know, at a reasonable price.  That's reliable, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  So making one or two of these,  it's just, it's not, electric motors are really simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can pop them into all,  I mean, there's so many customization shops you can pop.  They'll turn your old car electric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I think now that they've opened the gig,  now that the Gigafactory's in production,  Tesla's really gonna have a lock on this  just because they can make the batteries cheaper.  I mean, they've integrated the whole, you know,  the whole process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and they also wanna sell it.  Don't they wanna sell the batteries  from the Gigafactory to other companies?  Tesla's always been like, we'll share this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, which is nice.  Anyway, we'll see.  The Faraday Future, a number of people said,  we'll believe it when we see it.  It's beautiful. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, they showed off some pretty cool stuff.  I like the valet parking feature they showed,  which I don't think is gonna be available,  but you know, you get out of your car  and you say, go park yourself.  Excuse me.  And you know, it just goes off  and finds a parking space in the parking lot.  And they actually demoed it, live demo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tesla can do that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can get out and say, Tesla,  go around the block and find a parking space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in theory, you can't do it with stock software now,  but they've shown that doing it.  And of course, the summon feature  is the reverse of that, isn't it?  Summon feature comes out of your garage and comes to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they showed off both of those features in a live demo,  which was, you know, it could have been rigged or whatever,  but I thought it was pretty cool.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That means they have some pretty good software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the lidar that they have built in  pops up out of the hood, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But remember that when they tried to do  that self-parking thing at CES, it failed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which one? Tesla or?  Faraday Future.  Well, no, the demo that I saw, it worked.  It didn't go in the spot that they wanted it to,  but that's because it found a better spot.  It was kind of interesting.  So I would recommend to people to go watch it.  I thought they did a pretty good job in the demo  of explaining some of the features.  I don't doubt that they're way off in terms of timeline  with when they can actually produce a car  that is on the market that can do this,  but their test vehicles seem to work fairly well.  Because I thought the same thing.  I heard lots of poo-pooing about the Faraday  before they had this demo,  but they seem to actually have proven  a lot of the concepts that they've been talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I only heard about this failed one,  and I guess subsequently they did it again or something  because this thing, as I remember, just stopped.  And that was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It might have on the first attempt.  I watched it after the fact.  Hang on, I gotta take my phone off the hook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're just, I'm just a highly competitive Tesla owner.  Yeah.  I already bought my electric car.  Don't make another one.  Stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's no doubt.  I mean, I think Faraday's gonna be hard pressed  to catch up with Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there need to be more.  And you're right, Stacey.  Elon's always said, let a thousand flowers bloom.  We'll show you how we did it.  So, Waymo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't wait for my Model 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you order a Model 3?  I did.  You luck cat.  So, who gets the Model 3, you or your husband?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm gonna take it because I injured my Tesla again.  That car is just too big for me.  I am a small car person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So.  Actually, the way this is going,  it might be your daughter that gets it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, it's gonna be out in 2018.  It'll be, I'm gonna get my car this year next.  Okay.  Speaking of self-driving cars,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, we'll talk about Waymo first  and then I'll mention the fact that Apple,  Apple's Chris Latner, who is, I'm doing it now.  So, I'll go ahead and finish.  Yes.  Who is a legend because he created LLVM  when he was a grad student at the University of Illinois  in 2000, was hired by Apple three years later,  went on to create Swift and Clang,  announced he was leaving Apple on Tuesday morning,  Tuesday afternoon, we got the press release  he's going to Tesla as VP of Autopilot Software.  But he's not the only guy who left Apple.  There's a footnote to this.  The guy who designed the MacBooks  or helped design the MacBooks  is also going to Tesla to work on hardware.  So, Tesla continues to poach.  From Apple.  Now, let's talk about Waymo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, I think the big news here was  that it's got its own suite of sensors  and it brought the cost of LiDAR down by 20%, by 90%.  90, yeah.  Wow.  Which is a lot because you need to have LiDAR.  That's the laser thing that sits on top of the cars  and is like, here's what the world around you looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Tesla does not have LiDAR.  It has radar and ultra, what is it?  Ultrasound or supersonic or something.  Ultrasonic.  Ultrasonic and cameras.  And cameras.  But it does a good job with that.  LiDAR's even better though, right?  LiDAR builds a 3D model of the world around the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have no idea which is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  LiDAR's better but it's more expensive.  That's why this price thing is so important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was $75,000 on the original Google self-driving car  and it's now $7,500.  That is a significant drop, as you said, 90% drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think the big disruptions  we're gonna see happening in tech,  I feel like, and I even saw this at CES,  a lot of the technology and things we want is invented.  The big challenge is gonna be things like price.  So I saw a robotic arm there for $10,000 with computer vision  and that is so disruptive  because they're normally like 50,000 or more.  So this was just a typical manufacturing arm,  cheap as anything.  I could build a manufacturing plant.  I don't know what I'd make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, wow, that's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So these are the kind of things like,  I feel like when we're looking for the next big thing in tech,  we actually should probably be looking  for the next big thing in economics,  which is way less exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Way exciting.  Who was it?  Neil Stevenson said the future is here already,  it's just not evenly distributed.  Right.  Was that him?  Somebody, not Neil Stevenson.  Somebody said that.  Somebody.  Sounds like it could be though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds like something he would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Heinlein, was it Heinlein?  No, that was the magic.  That's a sci-fi guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's no, that was...  Let me just type the, actually I could probably ask,  I could probably ask Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My money's on William Gibson actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who said the future is already here,  it's just not evenly distributed?  See if she says anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to Goodreads, quote by William Gibson,  the future.  Very good.  It's just not even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then who...  Who said any sufficiently advanced technology  is indistinguishable from magic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Arthur C. Clarke.  Ah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh!  Same generation, dang it!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those old timey guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would fail on your trivia team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you love Google?  The fact that I could do that is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's, I will say, so that's where Google Home shines  over the Echo.  That's right.  I saw that you were upset that there weren't enough things,  or on the show notes, there's a thing about Google not having,  Google Home not having enough, is it apps, participants,  things that work with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, remember, Echo's two years older.  I mean, Google Home came out on Echo's second birthday.  Talk to me in two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, in like the, what was it called?  The Echo.  It came out in December, that first initial version,  December 2014, I think.  And it wasn't until March that you actually got a lot  of the smart home capabilities.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just takes time.  People have to add, you know, there were only four  or 500 skills in the first year of Echo,  and now there's over 7,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Talking to people who are working with both companies  in the smart home space, the challenge,  so what they say is the big difference is  Amazon knows what it wants, and how to like,  it knows how it wants things to work.  Google's still trying to figure that out,  which makes it hard to actually implement  some of these things for companies  who are trying to work with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you get the feeling Jeff Bezos has dialed in,  and in a way that no one at Google has dialed in.  There's no person at Google who says, you know,  it used to be Larry and Sergey, I guess,  and then it was Eric Schmidt.  I don't think Sundar Pichai is saying,  Google's still responsible for Google Home, right?  That's a Google company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think, isn't it Rick Osterlo?  Because he's in charge of other hardware.  Yeah, he's in charge of hardware, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't know who's in.  You need the visionary.  You need the Steve Jobs or the Jeff Bezos  or the Mark Zuckerberg.  You need the one guy who says, no, no,  this is a priority, this is what we're gonna do.  Or a girl.  Or a girl.  Or a girl.  And you know what, Marissa Meyer is now available.  Yeah, that's true.  She is now, once the deal closes for Yahoo,  she'll be off the board as well as leaving as CEO.  What remains of Yahoo, the stake in Alibaba,  will now be called Altaba.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Where did that come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had another name too.  Wait a minute, let me see if I can find that.  Because that wasn't the only choice.  They had another name that they were thinking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's only the investment group.  It is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just the Alibaba stake in the Yahoo wherever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yahoo Japan and Alibaba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  There was another name.  What was it?  Before there was Altaba, it was like Aba, Aba.  Alibaba, Al, something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and maybe this means something in another language  or doesn't mean something.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, we don't have to mention it  because there'll be no news about Altaba  that will be germane to us, I don't think.  So like I said, Marissa Meyer's available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  True.  Dan Premack, who I adore and is the smartest person  when it comes to private equity VC,  says that she'll be snapped up quickly by a PE firm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so.  They're a good CEO.  And man, you need the visionary.  I'm telling you, I think you need the visionary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you also need the,  I was gonna say the executioner.  That doesn't actually need you.  You need the executioner as well.  That is actually what they do.  That's exactly what you need.  You need the executionist.  In other words, you need someone that can execute  on those plans and carry them out.  And I think that's where Google falls down.  They've got a lot of great ideas, right?  But they don't follow them through.  They don't figure out how to connect things together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think that that's,  so when you say executionist,  I think of a Tim Cook type, a COO,  a guy who can make things happen.  But to me, the executionist is a person  who has enough vision to say,  this is what we're doing,  and this is how all of these pieces fit into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's that second part of what you just said  that Google falls down on.  They don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They throw a lot of spaghetti against the wall,  but they never tie the strands together  or weave them together as it were.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  As it were.  As it were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.  Oh, speaking of, oh, I was gonna say CEOs.  Did you see that John McFarlane stepped down from?  Sonos.  Sonos.  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was one of the founders.  He founded it 14 or 15 years ago.  Really, it's an unusual company.  They never took investment.  It was bootstrapped.  It's in Santa Barbara, not Silicon Valley.  They succeeded because they made a product people love.  And actually, the article I read about it said,  the real secret was you buy one,  and I know this was true for me,  and you like it so much,  you buy another, every room ends up having it.  That's what happened with the Echo, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so he, it sounds like reading the interviews,  he had wanted to step down for a while.  His wife was fighting breast cancer and whatnot.  He stayed on because of the challenge of the Echo,  but he admitted, I think it was in the New York Times,  actually, he admitted that he didn't see the Echo  for what it was, and the challenge it would be  for its business, he just saw it as a crappy speaker,  and he was like, eh.  And I think that realization is one of the reasons  he's stepping down.  He's like, oh, I don't got this anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was my take, too, was he doesn't have it anymore  because he really is focused on his family and his wife.  And bully for him, you know what?  They had a billion dollar year last year.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  I have six Sonoses in my house.  So yes, I like you, Leo, I'm like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Echo and Sonos, but that's why you and I are both dying  and it's supposed to happen this year.  I can't wait.  Then I'm done.  And if we were-  My home is smart enough.  Then I'm done.  No, if we're Google Home that did it, it didn't matter.  Whoever did it, I would be able to say,  hey, play David Bowie on my living room Sonos.  I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is really the dream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  I would love it if I could say,  listen to my audible book on my living room Sonos.  And that's where Echo might have an advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That would be really awesome, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, can't you already do that though  with the Chromecast audio?  Now, granted, it doesn't work with Sonos, but.  If you want that functionality, you could do it.  Could you plug in an external audio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to make a, for Sonos anyway,  you have to make a backend.  I guess, how would Echo control Chromecast?  Is there a Chromecast interface?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, with Google Home you can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, with Google Home I could do it.  Oh yeah, that was one of the things they sold of it,  didn't they? Yeah.  Cast this to my living room TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can say exactly what you just said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It never quite worked though.  I have a problem with all of these casting things.  It works for me.  Like all the time, like you see the living room  and you pick it and it just goes and it starts  and everything works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you have the new one?  Because I think they improved some of the networking feature,  like the wifi and radio stuff on the new one.  I think I have both the new one and the old one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it typically works just about every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The old one's real iffy for me.  I'm with Leo and the old one is just kind of like,  my husband even liked it for a while and then he's like,  you know what, don't buy me the upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want it. It drives me crazy  cause I can see it and the device can see it.  And I say cast to the living room TV and it goes, okay.  And then it spins and then the TV goes like this  and then the spin and it just never ends.  It's like, it's like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I do get that occasionally.  Every once in a while that'll happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we've talked before, you haven't been here  but on this show, I have the worst,  I have the worst most wifi hostile environment  and I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you still blasting it with the Orbeez?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that works.  But you know what I ended up doing  is disconnecting every other,  I mean, like I really narrowed it down just this  and it works.  And my mom, I gave my arrows to my mom  and it's working perfectly.  She loves it.  It's a huge, cause she couldn't,  she's mostly in the house,  but she has a studio out back where she paints and weaves  and she stopped going out there  cause she couldn't use her iPad out there.  So I put the arrow on the router,  the arrow in the front room, the arrow in the kitchen  and then the arrow in the studio  and then the arrow upstairs  and it all works perfectly now, smoothly and flawlessly.  It's how I should, I don't understand why  but there's something about my house.  There's too much stuff in there I think.  Too many wireless devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  RF interference.  Yeah.  I have that in my, I call it my server closet  but it's really now my hub closet.  So I feel you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm so jealous that you have a hub closet.  When you built the house,  did you build the hub closet intentionally?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I built my house in 2012.  So we put cat six cable through,  we put ethernet in every room, no jacks, no telephone jacks  and then I had a-  Oh, that's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You put no telephone jacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have, and what's funny is there is an elevator shaft.  We didn't put the elevator in cause we don't need it yet  but if we had, we would have had to put a telephone  in the elevator to deal with like building code regulations  cause every elevator has to have a physical telephone  but AT&T actually doesn't want to install  copper telephone jacks.  So it was like this big, like, what are we going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you have an elevator now?  No, I don't.  You just have a shaft, you got the shaft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got the shaft.  One day, you know, one day when I break my foot again  I'm going to be like, dang it, now's the time.  Let's put in the elevator.  But until then-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My husband got, it sounds like a country song.  It's very Austin.  My husband got the elevator and I got the shaft.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's yours, take it, run with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That should be your next show, Stacey gets the shaft.  I just want a little shout out to Mike Masnick  who we love, he's been on our shows before,  he's the guy who blogs at Tech Dirt  and really, you know, Mike is an outspoken son of a gun  and that's why we love him and he says,  tells it like it is.  And he's now being sued.  There's a guy going around, Shiva Ayodhurai,  who claims he invented email in like 1978 or something,  which of course is on the face of it kind of absurd  because email's been around a lot longer.  This guy says, well, but maybe he, I don't know,  maybe he invented it independently, I don't know.  But he's been going around and says he invented email  when he was 14 years old  working at a small medical college in New Jersey.  He created a messaging system for doctors,  called it email and copyrighted it as such in 1978.  Of course there are many earlier ones and Mike,  in fact, Ray Tomlinson, the guy who invented the at sign,  invented that like 20 years earlier.  Mike Masnick has called this guy a liar on Tech Dirt  and so forth, 14 posts over two years.  So now Ayodhurai is suing Mike and Tech Dirt  for $15 million.  He's represented by the guy who shut down Gawker.  This makes me so angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if some First Amendment right company  or even like the New York Times does not step up  to help Mike, this strategy is the same thing  that shut down Gawker and we can say what we'd like about it.  But this is going to shut people,  this is gonna cause smaller publications  to censor themselves.  You know, it'd be awesome if Peter Thiel  kind of gave Mike some money to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'd be awesome if Peter Thiel  kind of gave Mike some money to defend himself.  Yeah, that's not gonna happen.  No, I guess not.  In fact, I don't know if Thiel helped.  I think that's just a coincidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, Thiel admitted that he helped Terry Balia.  I mean, that's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hulk Hogan sue Gawker using Charles Harder.  But there's no reason to assume  that he's helping Harder sue Mike Masnick.  That's not the same kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's got, Harder now has money  because that case was won.  And also he's got a playbook now  for going after media companies.  And you know, Mike-  Well, and to be fair, Mike Masnick wrote in November

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in a blog post, congratulations Peter Thiel  about the settlement with Gawker.  You've successfully censored true stories  reported by the press.  And now it's Mike's turn.  He says, Mike says,  we're truly a small and independent media company.  We do not have many resources.  We intend to fight this baseless suit  because of the principles at stake,  but we have no illusions about the cost.  And I can tell you, you know, from my own experience,  it costs could easily exceed a million dollars.  Even if we win, it'll be distraction  no matter what happens, it already has been,  which may have been part of I had to rise intent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It totally is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, that is a chilling effect.  You know, I didn't have any love for Gawker.  And so I have to confess that I wasn't completely unhappy  about the lawsuit, but yeah,  you got to defend the first amendment.  You got to defend the right for-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Mike is a quintessential public interest reporter.  He reports for the consumer against companies  that have every interest in silencing him.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Grrr.  Yes, this is, you know, Tector is no gossip blog.  This is a very, very important blog.  So Mike, if you're listening,  whatever we can do to help, let me know.  And if you should decide to set up a legal defense fund,  we'll be glad to not only contribute-  I will send you money, Mike.  Yeah, but to publicize it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  I'll tell people I'm sending you money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, let's take a break and we can wrap this up  with a picks or tips or anything you're interested in.  Man, we had a lot of picks from you, Stacey.  So if you wanted to take the week off, you could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, do you not want my picks?  No.  No, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Cause I have some.  No, I want your picks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, we didn't talk about the Washington Post story  about the Best Buy technician.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, cause this is highly relevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you are a technician  and you see some child pornography on a hard drive  and you report it to the FBI, well, that's one thing.  If the FBI then starts to pay you,  are you now working for the FBI?  In which case, wouldn't you need a search warrant  to look at the hard drive?  That's the question at the heart of this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like the question at the heart of this story  is probably, can the FBI take evidence from paid informants?  In this case, it's Best Buy,  but imagine if they had paid informants at Amazon  listening to your searches or paid informants  working on the AI team at Nest that sees your camera.  Well, they've always had paid informants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yes, but. That's not illegal.  However, at this point, they're in effect performing  illegal searches on the FBI's behalf.  Right.  And that's where it's a problem.  It's one thing if you hire a guy who's mobbed up  and say, wear a wire, and we're going to give you $10,000  to wear that wire, that's one thing.  I don't think that's illegal, but I'm not a lawyer.  Is that illegal?  But this is different.  This is like a fishing expedition.  Look at every hard drive and see if you find anything  illegal, if you do, we'll give you some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But is that what's happening,  or are they just seeing something and reporting a crime?  Well, that's the question.  No, they are paid informants.  Yeah.  At one point, where do you cross that line?  And obviously, if you're getting paid by the FBI,  That's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  then you've crossed.  It is completely legal for Best Buy technicians  to look at your hard drive,  because they're a private company.  You've authorized it.  So the law doesn't prohibit private searches.  But as soon as a court could say,  well, but because you're paying this guy,  he is now working for you, that's different.  Then you need a warrant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's only, I mean, like if you send your,  I don't have child pornography on my computer,  but let's not do child pornography, actually,  because that's just reprehensible.  Let's do something a little, like-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's say you have torrents on your computer.  You've been downloading movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so I've got my torrents, I'm sending them in.  I mean, that's something I would totally expect  no one to mess with, because it's a small crime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, but if I knew I was consigning that over  to someone who was paid by the US government,  I would think very differently about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an interesting thing.  I mean, if you're in your work,  if you come across something so illegal  like child pornography, I would think you'd have a duty  to report it, don't you?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would totally, I mean, I would report  child pornography in a heartbeat.  Right.  I probably wouldn't report torrents.  I probably wouldn't report-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's your value judgment.  But I don't think there's anything wrong.  In fact, I think there's a duty.  If you see something-  Say something?  If you see something, say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Couldn't there also be a liability issue though  if you don't say something, like in the case of torrents?  Exactly.  So I would think that companies might have a policy  that says if you see any of these lists of things,  you are obligated to report it, because if you don't,  that company could be held liable in future,  in the future for not reporting that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there really, it comes down to,  is there a relationship, prior relationship  between the FBI and the technician?  Yeah.  And a judge has, by the way, in the case,  an issue here, has agreed that the defense attorneys  can bring that up and probe that relationship.  So a judge, I think, is saying, yeah, well, let's find out.  There is something, perhaps there is something here.  The federal prosecutors argued in California  that when a technician doing repairs, quote,  stumbles across images of child pornography  and the government wasn't aware of the search,  the technician is clearly not performing the search  with the intent of assisting law enforcement,  and therefore that is a legal search.  That's their position.  So intent and search, got it.  Any circumstance, now, Best Buy spokesman said on Monday,  Best Buy and Geek Squad have no relationship with the FBI.  From time to time, our repair agents discover material  that may be child porn.  We have a legal and moral obligation  to turn that material over to law enforcement.  We're proud of our policy, and we share it  with our customers before we begin any repair.  I think that's germane, right?  They disclose that.  Yes.  Any circumstances in which employee received payment  from the FBI is the result  of extremely poor individual judgment.  So they're saying, hey, that's on the employee.  It's not something we tolerate,  and it's certainly not part of our normal business behavior.  Court records did not detail how often  or how much the technicians were paid,  other than one $500 payment to one supervisor.  But emails between Geek Squad technicians  and FBI agents in Louisville  indicate a long-running relationship.  So.  See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that, I mean, because if you're certain,  I mean, you have access to my emails, you have,  imagine they go to Google with something like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that would be an interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, sorry, I thought that was really an important story.  No, that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is.  That's your prerogative.  Ta-da.  It's her prerogative.  But that does bring us to a break  and more with our picks of the week coming up  in just a bit, okay?  Unless you guys have something else.  Last chance.  Nope.  Nope, I'm always open to, especially on this show,  for some reason, I just, I always like to give you  all a chance to bring up anything that I left out.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.  I love Rocket Mortgage because I am a geek  and I wanna do everything online.  I don't know what it was like  when you got your home loan, Stacey.  You had to get a construction loan.  That's a, oh, that's a nightmare.  Or your refi.  When we bought our house,  when Lisa and I bought our house almost,  yeah, a little over three years ago,  we thought, oh, you know, we'd been through it before.  If it'll be a couple of weeks,  we have a vacation coming up in a month.  Couldn't possibly go that long.  There we are on our cruise faxing documents,  getting Lisa's sister to find bank statements.  That thing went on for six or seven weeks.  That's crazy.  Rocket Mortgage takes the mortgage approval process  into the 21st century.  You know why?  Because it's backed by Quicken Loans.  There's nobody better,  the best mortgage lender in the country.  So when it's time to buy or time to refi,  I want you to check out RocketMortgage  at QuickenLoans.com slash twig.  Not only can you do the whole thing online,  including submitting pay stubs and bank statements  with a touch of a mouse or your finger,  because you can do it on your phone or your tablet,  right on the couch,  but because it's all computerized,  it'll turn around fast.  You can even, they have all these great calculators  on the site where you can try different loans out.  You can see what the payments are.  It's totally informational, totally transparent.  You know exactly what you're in for.  It's all about information, isn't it,  for us in the geek community?  I wanna do it online and I want it friction free  and I want information and you get it all  from Rocket Mortgage.  And because you're doing it online,  you can do it fast and get a response,  get a loan in minutes that's tailored to your exact needs.  Skip the bank, skip the waiting, go completely online.  Quickenloans.com slash twig,  Quickenloans.com slash twig,  equal housing lender, licensed in all 50 states,  and MLSconsumeraccess.org number 3030.  I know if I were selling a house  and I had two equal buyers  with offerings, equal amounts of money,  if one said, but I'm using Rocket Mortgage,  and the other one said,  yeah, I got the bank down the street,  I know who I'd pick.  Pretty obvious.  Quickenloans.com slash twig, Rocket Mortgage.  Let's see, let's get Aaron Newcomb's pick of the week  to kick things off here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, could have unburied this thing.  So regular viewers of this week in Google  will probably remember,  I can't remember what episode it is.  We'll have to get the chat room on that.  But I talked about a microcontroller  probably a year and a half ago or so called Onion,  and we did a little demo,  I think I was in the studio for that one.  And-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was that the LED lights?  Was that the radio?  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's a little microcontroller called the Omega,  Onion Omega.  And I did a little demo of it as one of my picks.  And as luck would have it,  they've released a new version called the Onion Omega 2.  And I happen to have it right here in my hot little hands.  I got this shipped to me a couple of days ago.  So that's what it looks like.  You're just showing it, very small little device.  And I think that people will be interested  in checking this one out.  You know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cause it's a Linux server.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  Yeah, it's a Linux server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  $5 Linux server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we talked about the $9, right?  The $9 chip computer, which is this one.  And this is the, let me get them side by side here.  This is the $5 Onion Omega 2.  Quite similar actually.  They both have built-in wifi.  The Onion Omega 2 doesn't really have a display,  so to speak.  But what they've done, which is really cool,  is they've developed a lot of cloud-based  and browser-based software.  So that when you hook this thing up,  there it is right there,  and you shot flash by,  you actually get all the applications you need.  You get a terminal,  you get ways to control the GPIO,  you get all kinds of things right there in your browser.  And you can just click on them and say,  okay, make this GPIO pin a I squared C interface  to talk to some other thing  that I want to hook up to it, for example.  Can you get video out of it?  Sure, there's a way to get video out of it.  I've looked at the GPIO pins to see  there's not really something built in.  There is an ethernet adapter  you can get through the GPIO pins, physical ethernet,  but there's not really a way.  And that's not really what they're after.  I think their biggest thing  that they wanted to do with this device  was to make it easy for makers to jump in and use it.  And video can be kind of a hassle  if you don't have the right,  oh, I don't have HDMI, I only have VGA or whatever.  It can be kind of a hassle.  So what they did was they created this interface.  In fact, they even have their own cloud service  that allows you to control these things over the cloud  just by logging in, registering your device,  and then you can connect to it basically from anywhere  and reboot it or change things, get access to it.  So they've made that part really, really easy  for people to try.  It has this neat little dock, by the way.  The original one did too.  It has this neat little dock if you wanna get that.  And then you just plug this right into there like that.  And then you get access to a switch, USB,  and then you can start stacking.  They have all these really cool modules  that you can start stacking up kind of like an Arduino  if you wanna do other things.  So I don't know, I'd highly recommend people check it out.  I think you can still buy it on their Indiegogo site.  There's the stack right there.  Look at it build up.  All sorts of things you can do with it.  So it's yet another, you know, microcontroller.  It's a real Linux box.  I think it runs a version of OpenWRT if I'm not mistaken,  which is really cool.  OpenWRT runs on a lot of routers and access points  and things like that, but it also runs a lot of applications  and it's super slim version of Linux.  It's still very powerful,  but doesn't require a lot of space.  This, the one, the version that I have  has 32 megs of storage built in,  and that's enough to hold the OS  and also enough room to do firmware updates  and things like that over the air.  So really cool.  I'd highly recommend it.  I was really impressed with the first one when it came out  and the second one just adds, you know,  power and space and an SD card if you want it  for even more space  and pretty cool little piece of technology.  So if you're into that kind of thing  and you're making really small projects  or something where you just need a little Linux server  to run either inside or in the background  or something like that,  I highly recommend checking it out.  It's very, very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish I had time to do all this stuff.  I would love to play with things like this.  It's so cool.  It really is.  What an amazing time we live in.  Wow.  Five bucks.  I don't even know how they do it.  Omega 2, it's the best fatty acid  and it's available at indiegogo.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm glad that's out.  We talked about it like way back.  Did it launch in the summer maybe?  Was it the summertime that it launched?  Because we talked about it over the summer.  On this show or on IOT?  No, no, on the IOT podcast  because it's like, why wouldn't you want that?  A $5 Linux server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think now it's gotten to the point  where really what you should do is start with a project,  start with something you want to accomplish  and then investigate  because there are so many choices  from the Raspberry Pi on down,  investigate the best way to do it.  I love seeing this proliferation  of different ways of handling it  but I'm the guy who buys the thing  and then tries to figure out what to do.  That's a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I do that too  but that's exactly what we tell people at the Makerspace.  They come in and they say, well, what do I do with it?  I'm like, well, what do you want to do?  What do you want to do?  And then I'll tell you.  And then also you're interested  in actually making it happen.  If you're just like,  I want to learn how to use a Raspberry Pi.  Well, okay, fine, you can do that  but why don't you find a project  and something you want to build  and then you can actually dig into exactly  what you want to do with it  and it makes a big difference.  They've got some examples,  some on their website,  they have some examples of what they've done with it  in terms of, you know, teaching,  turning lights on and off.  I mean, that's kind of the easy one, I guess  but they also have like, you know, streaming music  or building robotics or, you know,  creating digital art and things like that.  And once you start honing in on,  oh yeah, that looks cool.  I want to do that.  Then the rest comes a lot easier.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, what do you have for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, guys, I have a buy this and don't buy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So.  Oh, I love that.  You should do that more often.  This could be a whole regular thing.  Buy this one, don't buy that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, okay, guys, y'all are going to laugh at me.  I bought the Homedics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute, don't tell me,  is that your wrestling belt  that you won for being the champion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, okay, I have to back up  so you can get the full visual here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Lord, what are you, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ready?  Yeah.  It's going to make a lot of noise.  It is a, see that giant glowing, it's a massager.  I saw this at CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you had to have it.  Okay.  This is the Trumetic Insta-  Trumetic Shiatsu.  There it is.  Plus neck and shoulder massager.  Oh, it's only a hundred bucks.  That's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, and you can like move it around your back.  So, totally buy this because it is like really great.  See, it's like pushing me out.  That's how strong it is.  And the fact that you,  because I had one of theirs where it was like,  it's called the Thumper.  And you had to like hold it.  My doctor was like, you're so tense all the time.  You need this.  And so I was like, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I do after I,  this is my little secret,  but after every show on Wednesday,  I go get a massage from a human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I get massages every two weeks from a human.  But in the meantime,  cause my life is so stressful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mommy, mommy's wearing her special shawl now.  Don't bother me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is amazing.  All right, so-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does look a little bit weird, but okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It totally looks like an alien is like with the,  cause there's a heating element  and that's what makes it glow orange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's what that weird light is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought those were LEDs in there or something.  Yeah.  They might be.  So it, you don't really need it to get warm, but-  No, why not?  Yeah, that's kind of my thought.  Yeah.  So I'm in love with this thing.  So buy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the T-R-U-M-E-D-I-C.  It's $108 on Amazon.  The truMEDIC Insta Shiatsu  plus neck and shoulder massager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  Cause the weight of your arms like keeps it on there.  So you don't have to-  Oh, that's why.  Oh.  Yeah.  Now I will say,  I, it's some spots,  because I am a delicate female, perhaps, I don't know.  It does hit my shoulder blades.  So there are a couple,  my husband doesn't have this problem  cause he has more muscle, I think, over it,  his shoulder blades than I do.  So if you are  tinier or have not a lot of muscles,  that may be an issue in certain spots,  but it still has, there's still places it works for me.  So there's that.  Here's what you don't buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you fight over it?  Do you like, or do you have two?  No, no, no.  Honey, it's my turn with the Insta Shiatsu.  It's always my turn with the Insta Shiatsu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does only run for 20 minutes  before shutting down and they have to recharge it.  Oh, no.  It's battery.  You don't have to recharge it.  No, it plugs in.  No, that's to charge it.  It's wireless, which actually is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, cause you want to walk around.  Yeah.  Don't go outside wearing it though.  Cause-  I know.  Okay. That's the do buy.  What's the don't buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't buy this.  What is it?  It was so promising.  It's the GE Z-Wave hinge pin open-close sensor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I saw your Instagram or your picture of this at CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, it was my nemesis.  So I tweeted about this cause two weeks ago  I saw this online and I was like,  holy cow, it's like a hidden open-close sensor.  I love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want this on my office door.  When people come in my office,  I want to be able to push a button  and have the door closed behind them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can this do that?  This doesn't have a servo.  So no, it wouldn't do that.  What does it do?  That's your project.  So this just tells you if the door is open and closed.  So then it can trigger things to happen.  So I know, not as exciting.  There are other things that do,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, smart things makes a sensor that'll do that.  There's lots of companies that make sensors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The value here is that it's hidden.  So it sits on a hinge pin.  Not that it's open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, why shouldn't we buy this Stacey?  Let's buy this.  This looks good.  No, don't buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it connected wonderfully to both smart things  and to the Wink platform.  So yay for the connectivity side of it.  The downside is it doesn't hang tightly in the hinge pin.  So it's impossible to calibrate accurately.  We spent 45 minutes trying to get it to calibrate  and by golly, it just moved.  And then once it moved, it was like,  now my opener shut, opener shut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And it doesn't know.  How much was it?  How much is it?  It's only $40.  I'm gonna refer to Amazon, but yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if it were me, I would go down to the dollar store  and get those little security things  you can put on your window.  Yeah.  And just hook that up to the door  and then you can do all sorts of stuff.  That's not invisible.  That's what Stacey says.  It's not invisible, but it could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could build that into a door frame.  You can build that into a door frame,  but you are like six levels of hacker more than I am.  I'm willing to futz around with software  and maybe a little bit of wiring.  But when we start talking about drilling into door frames  with my dollar sensors, then I'm like, nope.  No.  She just built this house.  Also my husband would never let me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now, what's your husband's name?  His name is Andrew.  Is Andrew into this or does he just look at you  and just go, mm, and walk away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
