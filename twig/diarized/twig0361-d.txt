Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm like level minus six on Pokemon Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think from now on when you are introduced, you'd have to tell us your Pokemon Go score.  Oh no, no, no, no, no.  That's important. That's a new rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was hoping, what I actually did do, I went down the street and I was just praying to get some beast on the New York Times logo next to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that's the thing now is take pictures of Pokemon all over the place.  There's even one on number 10 Downing Street as David Cameron is leaving. There's a Pokemon barely moving in.  Oh, I'm going to find it.  That's on the BBC feed. Kevin Marks is also here. He is of course, Kevin Marks, the original.  We love Kevin. He worked at BBC and then at Apple, Google, BT. He's been everywhere, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You say that I'm named stupid three times apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Kevin Marks, Kevin Marks, Kevin Marks. I guess you could figure out from his name what his website and Twitter handle are.  Stacy has the week off. Stacy Higginbotham normally here. She's traveling.  And we are hoping soon that the third or fourth member of our crew will join us. Dan Lyons, of course.  We love Dan. The fake Steve Jobs he wrote for a long time for Newsweek magazine.  Then had some misadventures in startup land. He wrote a book called Disrupted, all about it.  Then went to work for Silicon Valley, the TV show.  His post today on Facebook says, went to Hollywood, got the jacket. He has, yeah, as you said, Jeff, the best swag ever.  Ever. A Pied Piper jacket. The jacket that is so hideous.  This was kind of the highlight of season three, I think, the jacket.  Anyway, Dan, he said he's going to be busy through July. So it should be, we should be, he should be joining us soon, I hope.  I'm crossing our fingers anyway. Still don't have a commitment.  He may be hedging his, waiting to see if Hollywood calls or something like that.  So both of you, I thought for sure this would be the first show I've done all week that doesn't mention Pokemon Go.  I thought there's no way Jeff and Kevin, yeah, there's no, no, not old, just serious.  I thought there's no way these guys, these are serious guys. They're playing this dumb game.  How could you not?  You were saying, Jeff, that you see people playing in Manhattan everywhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it's really amazing because I walked on the street and now I see somebody standing there.  Number one, you can tell if they're doing the motion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, you can, you really can tell because if somebody's playing Pokemon Go, they keep their phone out.  Yeah, because they're waiting for the buzz that says a Pokemon is nearby.  So if you're like me and you're surreptitious, you're walking, but your phone is there.  When you feel the buzz then, and then you start seeing this as they play the game.  Oh, wait a minute, I just got a buzz. And seriously.  And then so and then you start and I'll show you, I'll demonstrate the motion because I'm actually going to fight a wild Zubat.  And then you see this kind of finger up motion as they shoot the Poke balls at the Zubat and try to take it home for their collection.  So this game came out a week ago on today on a week ago today on Wednesday afternoon.  Took everybody by surprise, except I guess people were really paying close attention.  Somebody just got something.  Something appeared.  Yeah, that's the cry of the wild something.  Yeah, so you hear their cry and then you're Kevin's just playing the game for the first time.  I'm a lousy shot. Yeah, it's hard.  So you notice I turned off the augmented reality, which was.  Yeah, I was gonna ask why.  If you get part of the fun of it, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the fun of it, but it also saps battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, boy, does it? Yeah.  Because your camera's on all the time.  So you could turn that off and that will help.  And then it also it makes it a little bit harder.  I find it's easier, at least for me, without the augmented reality.  There you go. You caught it, Kevin. Nice.  So that's added to your Pokey collection.  You can now turn I was in Facebook's New York headquarters yesterday.  Oh, good. You got an E-nax snake spelled backwards.  I don't know. Yeah.  No, that's a really good one.  E-cans. E-cans.  Keep the E-cans. Yeah.  So your idea is you're going to get these.  These are baby Pokemon that you evolve to stronger and stronger, sometimes once or twice.  And then.  Ta-da.  You caught another one.  There's a bunch of them around your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's because I just signed up, so they were easy ones, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, not necessarily.  Usually you have to walk.  That's the virtue of this game.  I mean, they have another version for Brits.  It's not. It's only US, Australia, Canada.  Carson told me he rolls out today in Germany, which is surprising because, frankly,  the servers have been very unreliable because so many people are signing up in those three countries.  And Niantic, the company that made this, which is a former Google company,  has said we're not going to roll it out as fast as we thought globally.  However, the thing people can do, and I don't recommend this,  you can download on Android, sideload an APK from one of your...  Can you turn that down?  I never thought I'd say that.  He lost Kevin.  He enjoyed the game a little too much.  Oh, he got away. He escaped.  That one escaped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to reduce my predictions about progress in the future by about a year and a half  based on losing Kevin Marx's brain power for that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not just Kevin, but look at that.  I mean, if you see Kevin, imagine all the brilliant people.  Elon Musk has announced there won't be a new Tesla because he's busy.  No, that's a joke.  So here you can sideload it on Android, but also if you're on iOS, apparently...  This is kind of a loophole.  You can sign up for the US store and get it in any country.  Apparently somebody on number 10 Downing Street has signed up  because a wild Pokemon has been sighted at the house of the Prime Minister,  outgoing Prime Minister David Cameron.  There is a Pikachu right there in front of number 10 Downing Street.  Well, not anymore. It's been captured.  So there's the good news.  There's the Downing Street cat.  So is this what happens, by the way, Kevin?  Is the Prime Minister actually just moves out, his whole family?  They just move out of the house?  Yeah, he's moved out.  But do we know who the new Prime Minister is?  Yes, to be specific.  It is going to be Theresa May.  So is she now officially the Prime Minister?  Yes, she met the Queen.  She curtsied to the Queen this morning.  Oh, that's right. I remember that great scene from the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. There's a picture online of her curtsying, which made me think...  The only reason I wish we had a Queen is so that Donald Trump would have to curtsy.  I'd like to see him curtsy with those girly hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're going to get in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is this weird thing.  Basically, the leader of the largest party is the Prime Minister,  which means that if...  What happened here was Cameron resigned as leader of the Conservative Party and as Prime Minister,  which means there was an election within his party, and that ran last week.  And then over the weekend, it was supposed to go to a ballot of all the members,  but the second-place person dropped out, which means Theresa May became Prime Minister.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It wasn't really an election, even. It was just a...  It was an election only by the MPs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it wasn't contested, so they didn't have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, at the bottom of Other, you heard Cameron's song as he walked back into 10 Downing, right?  No, I didn't.  Oh, okay. So go to Cameron's lament. This is just too British and too beautiful.  So his mic was on as he walks back into No. 10 Downing Street.  After saying goodbye.  Yes, basically.  Okay.  And if you go to that... Okay, so now go to the one with the piano.  Go to the one... No, no, no, stop, stop, stop.  This one?  You want to hear the original?  Is that the original up there, Kevin? Is it there?  Isn't the original there?  This is fantasy.  I'm not sure the original is there.  So if you go to the one with the piano with the computer, that one, you'll hear it.  So you want to turn the sound up and play this.  Okay.  Do it again. He goes in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do we recognize that or is it just...  Well, no, no. So now watch what she does with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then he raises it to an E flat.  So it's kind of out of tune.  So I'm going to choose...  Because it's much nicer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is like Greek.  Oh my God.  She's making it...  Go up to some of the others.  They're just wonderful.  This is lovely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was shutting down my studio about midnight last night, finishing a long day of composing.  And I checked my phone and saw that this had happened yesterday.  I kind of missed it, you know.  I had to listen to it.  And it instantly inspired this melody and finishing the job, as it were.  I mean, the thing is about music, you know, music for me penetrates the heart in a way that sometimes words can't.  And actually, I was really struck with the response yesterday to his singing.  This guy who's running the country actually does have a heart, you know, and he has deep emotions.  And whatever those emotions are, people have different ideas as to what he was trying to do.  Well, he didn't know he was mic'd, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, this was like a person going back to work.  I do that.  Of course, his going back to work is packing the house and getting out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Trying to book a moving company on two days notice to central London.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, Jeff, I see you pointing down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was turning down my mic to listen to it.  Go down one more.  Just one more on the page.  There's a choral group, the Fugue Camerata.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Fugue Camerata.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right now, keep going.  Right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's hear this one.  Oh, you have to say right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, there will always be an England.  It will be tiny and strange.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There will always be an England.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why there will always be a great Britain.  Isn't that the greatest?  Wow.  That's wonderful.  I love it.  Yeah.  I do love that.  It's been one of those weeks in England.  And then Theresa May has to curtsy to the Queen and walk out backwards afterwards.  And the Queen always carries her purse with her, which I think is an odd but kind of somewhat charming affectation.  Because, you know, be honest with you, what could be in there?  Not money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Veep has a purse carrier.  You think the Queen could?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was there was this like a Cody Thatcher reference?  The Queen is passing on the ceremonial handbag.  The ceremonial handbag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is said that I think it was who was it that said to the to the Queen, everything smells as fresh paint.  She never goes anywhere that isn't just painted.  Yes.  The world smells of fresh paint.  I think that was Alan Bennett.  That sounds like me.  Yeah, I love Alan Bennett.  Oh, my God.  I love him.  He is not well known in the US.  It's a shame.  But that movie they made about the woman, the woman in the driveway.  Yes.  Yeah, that's probably America's introduction to Alan Bennett.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  There's a lot more there.  But yes, it was a good film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Am I am I wrong?  Does anybody know who Alan Bennett is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, do you know who Alan Bennett is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yet they.  No, no one knows.  And yet the only reason I know is because my mom gave me a book of his short stories and I fell in love with his stuff.  He wrote The Madness of George III, which you might know.  But he is quite a funny and, of course, very literate.  He started with Cook and Moore, I guess, and Jonathan Miller and Beyond the Fringe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Beyond the Fringe was great.  And then they did TW3.  He was involved in that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was The Week That Was, which was a great set.  But again, nobody knows that in the US, I think.  How did your mother know?  It is 50 years ago.  Well, we only know what we only know British stuff that we've done ourselves, like The Office, you know, that we've remade.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you can't really couldn't really remake Alan Bennett stuff.  It wouldn't work.  Yeah, it's too British.  See you doing the History Boys or something.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't map.  What would you recommend for somebody?  I think I have the Alan Bennett reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think readers read his stories.  He writes wonderfully and it has his has this tone.  I mean, but he's he's done.  I actually would actually recommend seeing the film.  That would decide whether you you like his his style was that that was very in his style.  Yeah.  But like we've done for film, but he's done lots of television stuff as well.  He used to when I was working in London, he was he lived around the corner from our offices.  So we really see him in the cafe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The movie is called The Lady in the Van.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Maggie Smith is the lady in the van.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's a true story, right, about a woman who lived in his driveway for some time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  20 years.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  So she was she was parked his van outside the street and his neighbors kept trying to move her on.  And he said, well, you could park on my driveway for a bit.  And she just stayed.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So again, there will always be a British.  I hope to God.  What's your take on Brexit?  Actually, we haven't talked to you, Kevin Marks.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, well, it's one of those things.  It's like no one was expecting this to happen.  They think what I think what happened was they were trying to replay what happened in 1975.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you remember, you remember I remember 1975 and the debate over whether to join the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Now, there's there's a wonderful photograph, which I will try and find for you, which is Margaret Thatcher,  who had just become leader of the opposition campaigning for being in the European Union.  I think I've seen it.  But where are me photos?  So the point is, in 1975, if you actually read about the 1975 referendum, it is almost exactly the same.  She had a really ugly sweater, right?  She had a really ugly sweater and a and a.  I think we have it.  You have it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, look at mine.  Look at mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go back one.  There's a better one.  That's the one.  Yes.  Support your local continent.  And then there's the little UK flag with its hand.  Britain is not on the continent.  Well, no, that's why they support your local continent.  In the UK, you say the continent is how you refer to Europe.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, we're on.  Now they are.  There's a continental shelf and and and we are on that we are part of the continent.  But yes, in the UK, you refer to the rest of Europe as the continent in.  Right.  Not ironically, as you say, oh, no, it's the continent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The continent over there across the post.  Yeah.  We're across the pond.  They're the continent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  So but but if you actually read the history of 1975 referendum, the parallel is almost exact.  Basically, Wilson had just won the election.  There was some contention within his party about wanting to join or leave the European Union.  So they had this referendum.  They let the cabinet campaign on both sides.  But they got the lead of the opposition to campaign with the prime minister to say, we think this is a good thing.  And hence that picture of Thatcher doing that.  So I imagine some civil servants, someone said, well, this is how you do it.  We've done this before.  Or some campaign or something.  We took Cameron into this.  And then it didn't work because a the opposition didn't really line up and and campaign with him, though most of the labor members did.  Labor supporters did vote for remaining.  The conservative party split itself very, very broadly.  And then there's UKIP, which has been making hay with this issue for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then Nigel Farage, after winning, says, OK, I'm done here.  My work is done here.  Good luck.  We'll see you later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Christ.  And that was that is the height.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know what?  We may have the same thing because there's some speculation that Mr.  Trump, should he win election as president, will then resign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was Howard Stern's platform, you know, when he was running for governor of New York.  Yeah, it was three things.  And then he was going to quit Larry Lessig as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only way I the only interest I have in winning the presidency and the only way we can change how campaigns work in this country is if I win, I can with executive fiat eliminate campaign, you know,  this campaign farce with funding, make all funding federal and then resign to I'll choose a very good vice president.  That's why we'll watch with interest on Friday to see who is going to be the next president.  Oh, boy.  So so, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the other thing is that basically the two things were conflated.  And this is this is why it's a complete mess.  They can't unpick, which is that there is the the issue of.  Is there too much migration and the issue of should we trade with Europe?  And all this stuff was like tied up together.  So a lot of the people who are voting for leave were actually voting.  I'm fed up with Westminster.  I'm fed up with being, you know, you something is telling us what to do.  Something anything, something must be better than this.  And, you know, the sort of the dog whistles about immigration and so on and the scare tactics that they put together.  The thing is that there's no way to be part of the EU to be able to trade with the EU without free movement of people.  That's part one of the four things that you have to agree to to actually get free trade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've rejected free trade in effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got to you got to one of the habits that was not clear.  So it's pretty clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty clear that the EU is going to say, yeah, well, if that's about that enough of that, we're not going to make that deal.  In fact, who was it?  I think was Ian Thompson from the register who was on Twitch early after Brexit, who said the EU is at great pains now, because if if Britain succeeds,  that is sends a terrible message.  So it must not succeed.  They are not going to make a favorable deal with Britain because that would encourage others to leave Brexit to leave to exit the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's the challenge is, yeah, we're in this constitutional gap.  I mean, the other thing is that may just appointed Boris Johnson as foreign minister and appointed another.  I didn't hear that.  David Davis as minister for Brexit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't hear that. Boris Johnson is foreign minister.  Yeah.  So was Theresa May pro-Brexit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, Johnson, of course, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't think she was she was for the stay, but not not.  She didn't make much noise about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She was quiet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So she's the best that they could come up with.  In other words, but meanwhile, Boris Johnson is absolutely pro-Brexit is now foreign minister.  Will he be doing the negotiation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Goodness knows.  You know, with the literally nobody knew what was going to go on.  They're still trying to work out what the implications are.  They the only clear thing is Article 50, which is once they once the British prime minister says, OK, we're officially leaving EU.  Then that starts a two year clock, at which point the negotiations over what will happen next have to be concluded.  But there's there's back and forth between do we try and negotiate before we trigger this and the EU saying no, you don't get to do that.  And Britain say, well, then we will trigger it.  And so there's like 16 kinds of brinkmanship going on.  And and then it's just like every day there's something there's something even more surreal.  We had John called John Claude Yuncker saying aliens from other planets don't want worried about Brexit or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mars has decided to leave the Federation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was speaking in French, but he definitely said ultra planet and people watching us from afar.  So it's like he had too much wine or he was just there are people who really believe that that's going on.  There's that each day I read the news from the UK and I'm like, no, that didn't just happen.  Did it? By the way, there is good news.  It's very cheap. Yeah, it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's cheap to travel.  The pound is weakening by the moment.  And we now can use three.  The British carrier three on our Project Five phones.  Yes, that's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and a faster rate.  Good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we get full at full rate.  You pay the it's not free as it is with T-Mobile, but unlike T-Mobile, they're not gating it.  It's full LTE if that's available because you'll be paying the same ten dollars per gigabyte that you're paying in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've taken my five phone now for a number of international trips.  All in all has worked very well.  And just I can now cancel that hundred dollar a month thing I pay in case I use me to band with my AT&T phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fi is the fi is now clearly the way to travel.  And essentially what Google is doing by making these deals with carriers around the world.  Fifteen countries is making it all local because it's the same billing, the same process, the same cost, no matter which of those 15 countries you're in.  So that's huge.  How about calling is calling the same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Calling is inexpensive.  Yeah, I forget what the deal is.  So there's no longer a speed cap as you travel.  I'll find out soon, Leo, because I did the entire Mexico City show on my five phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Hey, seriously, send us the bill.  No, no, it'll be fine.  If it's big, send us the bill.  If it's small, you can take care of it.  But I don't want you to shoulder a big burden.  No, no, no, I wasn't saying it for that reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So fi is to be clear, fi is available in 135 countries because they use T-Mobile and Sprint, which have global networks.  But when you're using fi...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  T-Mobile was actually pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  T-Mobile is great, but it's not full speed.  That's the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you didn't actually pay for it, which was good.  And they had some notion that you can upgrade to faster, but it never actually worked.  Yeah, I did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You pay for more and it wasn't very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you actually managed to get it.  I couldn't actually, you know, I would say you could upgrade and I click a button and it would just sit there and look at me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got it in Germany probably because it's Deutsche Telekom.  I was able to do it in Germany and I think in maybe also in Austria.  But it wasn't that fast and you paid money for it and it ran out very quickly because it was by bite, not by time.  But this way there's not none.  It's none of that stuff.  You get as much speed as you can get on that carrier.  Three is a pretty good carrier in the UK.  What is that?  That's a it's two companies together, right?  It's the Deutsche Telekom and BT.  I can't remember what it is, but it's not BT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, but orange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean, the UK has always had like a very easy swap.  The same in market.  You can basically get the Mary sweet shop and put a new SIM in and then recharge it over the counter there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've used three before and I was very happy I had a my fight card last time.  I've used and they have little vending machines from the airport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's it's it's it is straightforward to swap stuff there.  But this does make it easier.  It's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It means if you are traveling, especially if you're traveling in those 15 countries, you must get a Nexus phone and get by service.  Fies no longer in the other advantage is my AT&T doesn't because I'm on grandfathered unlimited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't do tethering.  Whereas with the iPhone, I can tether.  Oh, nice.  Again, you pay ten dollars per gigabyte, but that's not a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Couldn't be more reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Happy to pay tethering is a bit tricky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because once you tether, then you're where else?  Whatever else you're on thinks is on Wi-Fi is like we let's just download all these apps.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, stop doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There should be a setting that says I'm on a metered connection even though you think it's Wi-Fi.  It's metered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think I complained about it when I was in Mexico City, but I went to a phone store.  I complained taking four hours to literally four hours.  I tried to buy a my fi, try to get it working.  The speed was awful.  I mean, and that is a solution.  Country to country to country is untenable.  Now, once Europe gets rid of roaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, ironically, will Britain be a part of that now?  No, I guess not.  Oh, good point.  So that is going to that is a new EU rule that there should be no cost to roaming within the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So my thought was I could buy a UK Wi-Fi and use it all over Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to be I'm going to be doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's still true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This can be true for at least two years.  I'm bringing my T-Mobile phone.  We're going to Europe in September.  I'm bringing my T-Mobile phone.  Actually, we're going to the Baltic.  So I will see what happens here.  So we're starting Paris, Sweden, St. Petersburg, Latvia, Riga, Latvia, Tallinn, Estonia.  I'm going to try to get my international identity card in Tallinn while we're there.  Estonian digital citizenship.  Wouldn't that be fun?  It has it has a PGP key on it.  That's your I mean, it's really an interesting idea.  Are you taking a cruise?  I assume.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then we're going to go to Bruges and Amsterdam and then to Southampton.  So I will try all of those countries as we just see Tuesday.  It must be bruised.  I like you know what?  The nice thing I if you're on a cruise ship, it's different.  It's a different experience because you don't unpack.  You unpack once.  So it's almost as if you're in a hotel room and the country's come to you.  It's a very different experience than being on a tour where you're constantly unpacking, unpacking.  Do you do the official land activities or you go up on your own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It varies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sometimes we do. Sometimes we don't.  In this case, we're on a kind of high end cruise line.  We're on Regent Seven Seas.  So they call them excursions are very nice.  This is a PBS cruise too.  So there'll be PBS people.  Oh, how snotty of you.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you get to watch in Bruges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  You know what?  The only reason I want to go to Bruges is because of that movie.  I'm hoping there'll be no gangsters there at this juncture.  That's a great movie, by the way.  It's a great movie.  And Bruges looks beautiful.  It's a medieval town.  So, yeah, you know, I'm not going to Brussels.  I have no interest in going to Brussels.  Believe me.  You do not want to go to that airport now.  Yeah. Well, this is the beauty of it.  You fly to Stockholm and then you're on a boat, which you never, you know, unpack or pack.  And then you get off and you're in Southampton and we have to go out of Heathrow.  That's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In Stockholm, the Stullerhof restaurant.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was looking for recommendations.  One of my favorites.  One of my favorites.  Send me the link or the name.  Yeah, we'll do.  Because I don't understand Stockholm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I sit there and just have...  I love my hearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I'm not a big...  You're going to have to convince me on the hearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, but you have five flavors of hearing.  American can't hear.  There's only one.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  There's only one flavor of hearing.  You can claim five...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's the sour cream hearing and the dill hearing and that wonderful cheese and a beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is it?  S-T...  How do you spell the restaurant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  S-T-U-R-E-H-O-F.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stullerhof.  Stullerhof.  All right.  I'll go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically, whichever place...  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not a fan, to be honest, of Scandinavian food.  You got to try it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Try a little bit there.  All right.  Oh, a fish?  Fish?  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not a fan.  Meatballs?  Meatballs I could...  Yeah, but I mean, I've had enough meatballs at IKEA that I'm not anxious to experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  more meatballs.  Oh, I love Scandinavia.  Oh, the little...  The stand with the sandwiches.  Oh, they're...  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  The smorgasbord.  I love Scandinavia.  Scandinavia.  If I could move somewhere, I would move to Scandinavia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, see, I'm looking at this meal.  It does not appeal.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That...  Mm-mm.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have things like steaks, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I don't...  Now, mostly I eat salads, so I'm sure they have lovely salad.  Oh.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're one of those.  You're one of them.  What does Storhof mean?  Something house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's on the...  And the Stor...  What is the name of the street?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Storhuis.  Well, that was easy.  Maybe.  I'm guessing.  I might...  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My Swedish is not good.  Enough of my travels.  So, that's good news, though, and I will report back with the Google Fi.  I will bring my Fi phone.  Now, I may have a new Fi phone, right, because we're a Fi-Fi phone.  Ooh, let's hope.  Let's hope.  I didn't realize it.  I bet you that's why they named it Fi-Phone.  Fi-Fi phone.  Maybe the next Fi should be a Fi.  Fi.  We hear there will be new NexEye in that timeframe, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds extremely closely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because we're seeing already renders and, you know, leaks and stuff.  Probably the new Snapdragon 821.  I'm so happy with my 6P.  Yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hard to...  You know, and I'll be a schmuck and I'll buy it like you do.  But I'm so happy with my 6P.  The 6P is excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, even if you upgraded to Nougat, we have a name.  Where'd the Nougat go?  Did somebody eat all our Nougat?  We had Nougat.  From last night, from all about Android, they have Nougat.  They always have the candy of the week.  But no, as of earlier today, I'm happy to report that Pokemon Go will work on Nougat.  It didn't.  Oh, sure.  But it now will work on Nougat.  They say maybe August.  And we're seeing renders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do we think?  What do we think it's going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We think it's made by HTC this time around.  There's two phones, two different sizes.  Sailfish and Marlin.  Everybody seems to agree.  All we've seen is renders.  In fact, Android Police has a render, but based on description.  The thing that was kind of interesting on these is this two-tone back.  So there's glossy up top.  Probably a plastic for the camera, which is hidden behind that.  Oh, no, I guess there's the camera.  Again, this is a render.  This is just based on descriptions.  Same fingerprint reader on the back.  I suspect they'll be very similar.  Faster processor.  I'd like to see more RAM.  I'd like to see better battery life, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, something I think Pokemon is doing.  Death to my battery.  Think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Although I'm using my daily driver now is the OnePlus 3.  I love it.  And obviously price is not for me a determining factor, but I've got fairly good battery life, even with Pokemon Go running.  It only maybe takes 40% of my charge in a one-hour walk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do I have to actually kill it to stop it doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you should, because it kind of runs in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK.  So I'm going to go this afternoon, so I don't actually want a dead phone by the time I get there.  Because it will refuse to let me do anything on the train.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where did the Nougat go, Karsten?  Where's the Nougat?  Chris, can you find the Nougat?  Karsten is chewing right now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is like that, though.  You got rid of the evidence.  We got the Italian version, which is Torone, which is really good.  That's nice.  I grew up on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know where it is, but it was delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We used to go down to the corner store in Providence, and for a quarter you'd get the yellow box of Torone.  It was really good.  And it's delicious.  So it's egg white and nuts and sometimes dried fruit, and it's quite delicious.  I can't believe it's all gone.  There were at least 10 pieces left when I got here this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well.  Somewhere in that office, there's somebody with a tail between the legs.  Yeah, somebody with crumbs down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, it's Android Nougat, which is kind of what I was expecting, to be honest.  I was being facetious with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When will they announce a contest for it, and then they'll call it that anyway?  It was obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only question was would they go with a brand name if they would, obviously Nutella, but I'm glad they went with something.  And also it's international, right?  Nougat is an international treat, which is smart.  Originally French, I believe, although many countries in the European Union have their own version, Italy and Germany.  It's like fruitcakes.  Yeah, like fruitcake.  It is kind of a fruitcake candy.  A fruitcake candy, yeah.  Marlin is the high end, the Nexus M1.  It'll have the, of course, both of these will ship with the release version of Nougat.  The Qualcomm 821, according to sources, 4 gigs, this is Android police, 4 gigs of RAM, 128 gigs of memory.  That would be nice, at least they say.  Adreno 530 graphics, 12 megapixel camera, 8 megapixel front, Nexus phones, of course, have type C.  Oh, I see a Nougat box coming.  Is it an empty Nougat box?  No, yay, that's not Nougat.  This is Nougat.  For some reason they have some big hunk, which I don't consider Nougat.  This is the Nougat.  This is just for people who want to know.  This is Ferrara, which is an Italian Nougat, Torrone.  And I'll just show you so you can speak authoritatively.  Some people say, oh, you know, the Nougat inside of a Mars bar or something.  That's not Nougat.  That's not Nougat.  This is Nougat, my friends.  What kind of nut?  I think it's almonds.  Yeah.  It's quite tasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the most ridiculous unboxing I've ever seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should YouTube it.  Nougat unboxing.  I should totally do that.  And do breathlessly keep them waiting for like five minutes.  Well, okay, we have it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then show, as you just did, you're showing every angle of it that you have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me read the material on the back.  In Cremona, Italy in 1441, at the wedding of Francesco Sforza to Bianca Maria Visconti,  the buffet featured a sweet made of nut meats, honey, and egg whites in the shape of the famous tower of Cremona.  Torrone, hence the name.  Torrone from Farahara since 1892.  Anyway, I can't eat it, but I'll put it there for you to look at.  This is kind of stale Nougat.  I don't know where we got this, but it's kind of stale.  Do we cover the most important stories of the day or not?  I ask you.  We surprise you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So are you guys running on Nougat or are you still on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I put Nougat immediately on my 6P.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got it on my 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it's not a daily driver, I wouldn't do it as a daily driver.  There are a lot of apps that don't work with it.  It seems fairly reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Things just suddenly decide to quit again and again and again.  You got to say, okay.  Yeah.  I like it.  I love the notifications.  I love the ability to operate within a notification.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting because iOS is doing exactly the same thing in its next version, iOS 9 or 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you use the split screen at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Never.  No.  I think that's a tablet thing more than anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I barely remember it's there and then after I've been copying and pasting back and forth.  The double-click to switch is quite good, but the split screen is like, oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do like the double-click to switch, and people don't necessarily see that.  You have to force hold or long press the recents button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Double-click to switch between the last two and then long press and you get the split screen.  Yeah.  I didn't know about that until I saw them demo on stage at Google.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't think the next, to be honest, I think the 6P and 5X are fine.  I don't think the next Nexus will be particularly different.  So I would stick with what you got.  There won't be, that's probably the one I'll be bringing to Europe.  I can't, but I guess I have to get the new one just to look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the only thing I'm wondering is if they do smarter things with more cameras,  which is predicted last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's what Apple is apparently going to do with it.  It's next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The obvious thing is you put a second camera here, then you've got a stereoscopic camera.  Right.  Or you beef up the front and back cameras so you can actually do a 360.  By moving it that way.  So a little bit of work like that and suddenly you've got a thing that will let you gather the 3D stuff.  Also, if you put the stereoscopic camera there, then once it's in the headset,  the AR actually becomes stereoscopic, which is a difference.  Oh, good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If anybody were to do a 360 camera on a phone, it would be Google after all.  I mean, they support this with cardboard before anybody did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I suspect part of it is that they want to push this forward.  They announced the cardboard successor, which I've gotten the name for, at I.O. for the VR staff.  Obviously, they want reference devices for that.  And they'll be pushing that stuff.  And then there is an obvious AR thing of strap your phones to your head and have the camera operating.  That's Daydream, right?  That's what they're calling Daydream.  Daydream.  That was it.  I couldn't remember the name of it.  And they've also got other stuff that they've talked about, which is the AR based on Magic Leap.  But the point is that if you think about the natural extension of this there are things in the world thing is  you're wearing it over your head and you can see the things in the world.  And as long as they're not bigger than the thing you're trying to walk in front of, that makes some sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Daydream is really a spec for others to adopt.  It's so, so similar to Samsung's Gear VR.  You have the Gear VR 360 cam, Jeff Jarvis.  Yes, I do.  Have you done anything with that yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do.  I played with it.  So when I went to VidCon, I did the wrong thing.  It was supposed to be very stable with it.  I walked through the entire VidCon floor.  Makes people sick.  Yeah, but it was fun to do.  Did you post that somewhere?  I can show it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I haven't posted it yet.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you can do that, but you need it on some kind of steady mount.  Yeah.  But then you can...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Judicious motion, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Right?  When Casey Neistat was at the Oscars, he just kind of walked with it as if he were carrying  a chalice to the Pope, you know, very carefully.  But what's nice about it is that you see all the cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the thing that takes so long to get used to.  I'm so used to pointing a camera at the subject.  And eventually I finally got it with the Ricoh Theta S, which I love.  You just hold it.  It doesn't matter where you hold it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Well, it does matter.  No, it does matter from where the stitch is.  So you don't want to hold it this way.  Can you see the stitch?  I'll be stitched.  Oh, yeah, you can see the stitch.  Oh, well, that's not a good camera.  That sucks.  You see the stitch at one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, close range.  The Ricoh, I don't see stitching at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is why you have the 16 camera rigs.  But then, yeah.  Hold on a second here.  So...  They're a bit harder to carry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're doing it.  Now that's...  Okay.  Something cool.  You could do that live.  The Ricoh just recently added that feature.  That's one view.  That's kind of neat.  The idea being that you could...  Somebody could be at home wearing their Gear VR, their Samsung virtual reality headset,  and you could stream to them.  And of course, at Samsung's event earlier this year, they showed some friends in Paris  carrying the camera and then their friend at home who couldn't go along for the ride.  Don't move the camera.  Move the phone.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we can't move the phone.  You'd have to move...  I'm getting sick already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, the other thing that strikes me back to the phones, and back to Kevin's point, is  that I...  And I'll go back to the fabled, not yet arrived Mevo shooting at 150 degrees.  And what you can do with a wide shot like that in terms of cutting things up and editing  afterwards, and all kinds of neat things, I think that's where phone cameras go next  is wider angle.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's also part of this.  I mean, the point of having...  Putting more lenses on there is that it gives you that more control.  So, you could put in...  Instead of...  So, the trick there was it's a 4K lens, but then you can crop it to zoom effectively,  right?  That was the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  This camera apparently...  The ZTE Axon 7, which just went on pre-order today, which means I better pre-order it,  supports...  Is the first phone to support Daydream out of the box.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  This is from China's ZTE.  Front facing camera...  I mean, speakers, which I love, and I wish even HTC has abandoned that.  20 megapixel camera, 4K video.  The key though in supporting Daydream is going to be the screen, isn't it?  It's going to be...  You need a 4K screen, you need enough resolution.  And of course you need enough...  This is a 4K screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you need enough graphics.  I guess the Adreno 530, which is in this, is sufficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you need more GPU power for it, really.  Right.  That's the key on it.  You see it?  You put it into cardboard and you're like, oh...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This looks a lot...  It's got the back of the box fingerprint scanner, which I think we've now come to agree is probably  the best place to put that, right?  My OnePlus 3 has it on the front.  Dual SIM, which is the key, and up to 128 gig SD.  Dual SIM is key for developing nations.  India, for instance, has so many carriers that you might switch carriers going from town to town, so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  It seems it's another reason for the fire to get its biz death together.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  I'll order one of these.  I'm not seeing where the screen resolution is, but obviously it has to be 4K.  It'll be a 4K screen.  It has to be.  You can't do it otherwise.  That's one thing.  That's one of the reasons this OnePlus 3 is a $400 phone, fully featured.  I mean, this is definitely a flagship phone in every respect, except 1080p screen.  So, you will never put this in a VR headset.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that presumably means that helps the battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Great battery life.  18-hour battery life.  Really nice phone, and 400 bucks.  So, for somebody who doesn't want to do VR, this is a really good choice.  Fingerprint reader is on the front.  I think Google really nailed it by putting it on the back there.  Yeah, I think so too.  Yeah.  Let me just see what the price is on the Axon.  Seven...  Ah, 400 bucks.  So, they're doing the same thing.  They're doing the same thing.  And you can get it in gold.  I guess I'll get gold, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or quartz gray.  You have to wait a little longer to get it in gold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so that was the other interesting Nougat feature, is the screen size feature.  Wait a minute.  Nougat what?  Nougat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nougat?  How do you say it?  Nougat.  Nougat.  Nougat.  You're saying it Frenchy style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I come from a country that's fairly close to France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You also say restaurant.  Well, it used to be.  Nougat.  Nougat.  Nougat.  I have to start saying it.  Nougat.  It's a French nugget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nougat.  Nougat.  Anyway.  But that was...  I don't know if you remember this feature, but you can actually change the display zoom  on your device, which is great if you actually own a bad eyesight.  If you've got presbyopia, you need bigger text.  And you can switch that in the OS now.  So, that's something that they've changed here.  I love that.  But I want that...  That's the thing I want on the Nexus 7, because the Nexus 7 could do with being that little  bit bigger visually.  Yeah.  Some of the time.  But it's neat.  It works.  And it's the one thing that changed the text size on Facebook, because Facebook ignores  the system text size.  So, if you actually want to be able to read Facebook and you're short-sighted, you have  to switch it in the system, because Facebook hates people with bad eyesight.  Don't we all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't we all?  No, I'm the same way.  Exactly.  All right.  I'm going to pre-order this real quickly, just for completeness.  I'm a completist.  So, continue talking.  Don't...  Oh, sorry.  Don't shut up.  What are you explaining?  I'm pushing buttons and entering credit card numbers, if you don't mind right now.  Oh.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Well, I just saw that this is just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you tend to buy more on the air or off the air?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's all the same to me.  No, I just saw that it went public sale right now.  So, you got to...  It's like Pokemon.  You got to get them while you can.  Let me use Amazon Payments.  That'll save some time.  There you go.  Cool.  You know what?  That's interesting.  That's a good price.  What is it again?  I wonder if that's going to be the new...  That's a good price.  Yeah.  I wonder if that's going to be the new...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's one thing that Google could do.  They did it before, remember, is they had a bunch more price on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They could go back to that.  Oh, that would be nice.  Wouldn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but yeah, between the Motorola ones and the Nexuses, that was a very good run of good  prices, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and really it was a case of thinking of the phone as a developer phone, not as  an end user phone.  Would you say the 6P and 5X really are more aimed at the end user than the developer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  I haven't been shopping in the shops and seeing where they sell them.  Certainly in the Nexus line, they're selling in the main screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and one of the changes is Google Fi, because you have to have a Nexus phone to  use Google Fi.  And so I would guess that, in fact, that's the way you get Google Fi is buying a Nexus  phone or buying Fi and then you get a Nexus phone.  I would guess that that's really changed the equation a little bit.  It's not a developer phone because now Google's in the phone business.  What about Project Tango?  Should the new phones be Project Tango enabled?  Tango seems to me such a specialized thing.  I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like it's powerful.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I've long said I can't, you know, people with blindness and things like that, it'll  be phenomenal to map inside spaces and find you lost things and do all kinds of great  things.  But I think it's not going to be a consumer product for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google, remember, has wanted to build the biodome space campus and has been thwarted  time and time again.  Well, it may be a reality now.  They just made a land swap with LinkedIn.  I guess now that LinkedIn is a Microsoft company, they're all moving to Redmond anyway.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they actually, LinkedIn is building a new property.  In Mountain View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In Mountain View.  But they've also moved their office to San Francisco.  So they did an extra big chunk of land there near the old office and then they pitched  Paytech over to San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Silicon Valley Business Journal with the scoop, they say that a few million square feet of  real estate will, with a property swap, will become Google's and that this will be sufficient  to build the master plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, isn't part of it is getting stuff that is zoned differently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I thought.  I thought that they had been turned down by Mountain View.  Google?  Yeah.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's a whole big thing.  This allows them to consolidate services.  LinkedIn, I think, has like a shopping center and restaurants.  It's all kinds of things they had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  LinkedIn plans for a new office plus retail promenade in Mountain View.  Now maybe because some of this property is in Sunnyvale now, not just Mountain View,  there's some of the LinkedIn property.  Maybe that's somehow part of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're in shape to consolidate.  Then I think there's transit things they need to do.  Yeah.  I still get, you know, I keep on thinking about it.  The housing situation throughout that area is awful.  And there ought to be high rises going in by the train lines, damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  LinkedIn had prior approval from the city council because that's where they were going  to put their shoreline for 1.4 million square feet of office space.  So presumably that, at least this business journal says, that those approvals will transfer  to Google as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder how that deal happened.  You know, who sat down with who?  Can you imagine the negotiation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  LinkedIn acquires ownership of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I vision a monopoly board and I say, okay, I'll trade you.  Yeah, kind of like that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, I will give you...  Don't say the word monopoly around those contracts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I will give you 700 East Middlefield Road for property, the old Gold's Gym.  I'm going to need more than that.  All right, I'll give you 800 Middlefield as well.  But then I would also like to get the property 1431 Plymouth.  Was there cash?  No, it was a straight up trade.  Really?  They also get the pub apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The pub?  The sports page.  There's one pub south of one.  Sports page.  They call it the sports page property.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the old Gold's Gym.  It's a dive bar.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's like, it's the only pub that side of the freeway.  So it's where you go to drink with people that did not be on Google premises.  Well, guess what?  Google just bought it.  Whoops.  Guess what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google now owns all of Mountain View.  Congratulations, Google.  Oh no, all of Mountain View south of 101, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm not joking.  It's all of Mountain View south of 101.  West of 101.  West of 101.  West of 101.  And then east of 101 is like going to be the other side of the tracks.  Which might it be?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  East of 101.  Basically, the Bayside of 101.  It's like 101 is kind of diagonal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also, apparently, and this I would be interested in, Google's working on new Android Wear  watches.  They've never made their own Android Wear watch.  According to Android, place these watches would come out at the same time as the new  NexEye.  But not sure what features.  Angelfish and Swordfish are the codes.  But the speculation is it will be very voice assistant focused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I was ready to give up on my Android Wear.  This one is dying every day about 6 o'clock.  It just dies as the battery's not out.  Plus, they won't give it the update.  The charging is really awful.  So I was thinking, OK, we better watch it.  I wear the LG a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the LG a lot, but it's clunky as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wore the LG every day until I got all my stuff stolen on the train and lost the charger  for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh no.  I hate proprietary chargers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what you get for taking public transit.  Be it California, take a car.  But I'm sorry, Kevin, I actually don't mean to be making fun.  It sucks.  There'll be two sizes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've seen the photos of my bike having a bit stolen from it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are renders, we should say.  This is another thing.  This is what Android Police does.  They take the rumor and they do a render.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exclusive.  We're making up something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, they've got the picture is not the key.  It's the pros that goes along with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they are going to be round and not square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is good.  I like round.  I'm not crazy about the flat tire.  This doesn't look like it has a flat tire.  I hate the flat tire.  I'm sure they get rid of the flat tire.  Yeah.  You know, with Rick Osterloh now in charge of hardware at Alphabet, or is it at Google  or at Alphabet?  It's Google, isn't it?  I don't know.  I think it is.  Yeah, I think it's Alphabet.  It's Google.  I mean, they still have Nest and he's not in charge of Nest, so I think it must be Google.  And I think these are coming out of Google.  I would expect to see some good stuff.  Of course, he did the Moto 360.  It was when he was at Motorola.  Let's take a quick break.  We're talking about anything we damn well want.  But you know what?  That's what I love doing with this panel because Jeff and Kevin are the greatest.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage, which is if you are not Google size, if you're  not making monopoly deals for your next house, you maybe need a mortgage.  Yeah.  But remember the last time you got a mortgage?  I remember it three years ago.  It was all delayed.  It took forever.  We had to give them so much paperwork and then more paperwork.  I think since the banking crisis, it's gotten worse and just piles of tons of paper.  And then we had booked a cruise.  Lisa and I leave on the cruise and her poor sister who works in her office here had to  do a lot of it and she couldn't just sign her name.  She had to sign her name.  I feel so bad for her.  I can't remember the phrase, but in place of Lisa LaPorte, it was crazy.  It was crazy.  Well, now there's Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans and it's easy.  It's kind of the slogan push button, get mortgage.  It's for one thing, completely online.  So no more paperwork.  You share your bank statements and pay stubs with the touch of a button.  You can get approved in minutes for a custom mortgage solution tailored to your unique  financial situation.  Look at this.  This couldn't be easier.  And you don't even have to do it on a computer.  You could do it on your phone or your tablet from the couch.  Couldn't be quicker.  Couldn't be easier.  And by the way, because computers, you're going to get a custom solution tailored to  your needs.  This is the way.  Quicken Loans, of course, you know Quicken Loans.

I think we're making progress.  The idea of a free and open web that is not burdened by proprietary standards.  I feel like you're making progress.  Microsoft, for instance, I'll give you an example.  Microsoft just announced that they're going to do Skype for Linux.  They're updating it and it's going to use WebRTC.  There we go.  Standard.  Standard.  Now, unfortunately, one of the reasons we use Skype is because their proprietary codec,  Silk, does such a good job.  We could use WebRTC.  That's basically Google Hangouts.  Silk's the audio codec, right?  Silk is proprietary.  It's their codec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but the voice codec that's in WebRTC is based on a lot of the Silk stuff.  It's Bricks, isn't it?  Or something like that.  Bricks, yeah.  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wasn't crazy with Bricks.  We've sampled them all.  You know what?  It's fine.  WebRTC is perfect for what most people use these for, which is video and audio conversations.  We have a somewhat more challenging standard because we're trying to get broadcast quality  video out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no.  I have to quit everything else because I'm using the older slower Mac now.  I have to quit everything else and run just Skype on this machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People come to us and say, I was just watching Skype on CNN.  Your guys look so much better.  How do you do that?  It's over years of messing with it.  But I worry because if they go all WebRTC, I'm torn because on the one hand, web standards,  I like it, open standards.  On the other hand, it doesn't work quite as well as the proprietary codec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I bet it's, I mean, you can probably work on tuning that as well.  Maybe we'll get better at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, maybe.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a few seen.  I'm going to have to look up the name before I recommend it.  Is it Anycast?  Oh, it's Tricast.  That's it.  T-R-Y-C-A dot S-T.  No.  So this is an interesting tool.  It's a tool for podcasters or audio podcasters.  So not quite your set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's confusing because of the Tricaster.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the thing's called Cast, but they've got a clever URL.  Right.  But what's neat about it is it uses WebRTC in the browser, but it records both sides  locally and then uploads them to their server.  Oh, that's very smart.  So it lets you do the record both ends thing without having to futz around on your own  machine, which means you get clean audio from both sides.  And then they have an in-browser editor you can use, or you can just download the tracks  and edit them yourself in GarageBand or whatever you want to use.  But it's a very neat application of using the WebRTC thing.  And having used it a couple of times, it works surprisingly well.  You make a connection and you start talking to people and you realize, oh, that's remarkably  low latency and it works very well.  And at the end of it, you've got ISO files from each speaker.  So it's a...  What was that URL again?  TRYCA.ST.  And it's like, you can try it free for a month and then there's a 10 bucks a month, 30 bucks  a month, depending how much you use it.  Oh.  And then they'll host your podcast for you as well if you're paying them.  But I've tried it out a couple of times and if I was going to do an audio podcast again,  that's what I'd be using because I was really impressed with how straightforward it was.  Like the usual thing of, I want to record both ends.  If you're actually serious about audio quality, you want to do that.  And that involves so much encouraging people to set things up and fiddling around and specialized  tools and stuff.  And this just was like, oh, click, click, click.  That just worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We tried it once.  I think I tried to double enter at the very beginning of my career.  It was such a pain in the ass.  I never did it again.  Steve Gibson teased me because he was going...  He felt my pain.  He was going to write.  And it's not so hard to do.  He was going to write because the codex, the Briggs codex and stuff like that, you just  plug it in.  We had a very clever idea because part of the problem is you want the conversation in  real time.  So he was going to have a local ring buffer that would fill with local content while you  did the conversation.  So filling in any dropped packets or out of order packets and getting a full quality.  And then when the recording was over, it would just send, in effect, send the other end up.  But you'd be in sync because you were doing it in real time and not worrying so much about  what the real time sounded like.  I imagine they're doing something similar to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're effectively recording it locally at each end and then they're syncing it afterwards,  which is very smart.  So basically, buffer gets a local storage, transmitting it as well.  The impressive part of doing it in the browser.  You used to be able to do this with iChat and GarageBand a long, long time ago.  Yeah, yeah.  Remember that?  You had to launch at the same time and press record and it would record the conversation.  And that was very neat, but it was hard to explain to people what you had to do to do it.  This is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to, this is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's a neat thing.  Is this so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Boy, if you're a podcaster, it's so much easier.  It kind of makes me mad.  So much easier to do it.  But it's like everything else, right?  Well, that's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So going back to the India web point at WebYTC, one of the things that I mentioned,  but I think I don't know if I mentioned this last time I was on the show or not,  was the Decentralized Web Summit, which was an event organized at the Internet Archive  about three or four weeks ago.  Trying to get a lot of the people working on these different bits and pieces of things  that are making the web work in a more P2P way together and having a conversation together.  Yeah, June 8th, so it is more than a month ago.  And I wrote a piece, I wrote a thing on it with Dan Gilmore that we can link to in the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you had Cory Doctorow's, the keynote.  How nice is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, we had Tim Berners-Lee, we had Vint Cerf, Mitchell Baker.  Amazing event.  What?  Yeah, it's, if you've got a bit of time, go back and watch the videos.  It was interesting stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rooster Kale winding things up.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm in there somewhere.  Look at this.  So I did a panel with the P2P guys.  There we go.  That's me in the middle.  So, but the interesting thing was a lot of them were doing some of this clever stuff with the WebRTC  and some of these affordances that have been put in the browser to use them to do other things,  to do edge-to-edge communication without having to go through the client-server model.  So that was definitely interesting.  So there's me hand-waving.  Yep.  So like being able to do, using it to download videos through BitTorrent entirely in JavaScript  and also as they play in the browser, be sharing packets upstream to other people who are watching the same stream,  which you can now do without downloading any plugins or anything, which was fascinating.  So there's a chunk of bits and pieces, ways of people repurposing these web technologies in lots of different ways.  And also the other big thing that I got from that was there are a lot of different people doing content addressable storage  where you look up things by a hash of the data rather than the data itself from an address.  And at the moment they tend to have slightly different hashes and models.  So one of the things that struck me was there's scope for us to converge some of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you don't care where the object lives?  Yes.  But because you'll have a kind of canonical URL that's deducible from the content itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And also it means you can check you've got the right version once you get it.  Nice.  So there's a bunch of bits and pieces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it decentralized storage? Is it kind of a peer-to-peer network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. There's several different ones. There's IPFS, ZeroNet.  That's a great idea.  A lot of people built these out. But the challenge is always you have to be part of one of those systems to do it.  But if we can actually unify them through converting the content hashes, then that's a powerful thing.  Because suddenly you'd be able to say, I need to get this thing.  I could go to the original source for it or I could get it from this local server that's local to me so I don't have to traverse the net for it.  So if it could be on a local network, it could be an offline thing that has a bunch of stuff on it and so on.  You can check it's the same thing because you can hash it.  So there's a bunch of really interesting bits around the edge of that that I got from that that's fascinating.  And then there's, you know, plus there's the rest of the IndieWeb stuff where we're really excited about this.  But it was one of those places where I was like, OK, I've been rolling my eyes at Bitcoin a bit for a few years.  And there are there was still a lot of some of that stuff going on.  But there's also a bunch of other applications of these kinds of cryptographic primitives, some of the browser standards like WebRTC and progressive web apps.  And lots of these other bits and pieces that have been worked into the platform that suddenly gave me a lot of confidence that the web has sort of a lot of headroom for doing more new things.  Nice. I'm glad to see it.  So the article I wrote with, I think it's in the thing, with Dan Gilmore is, where's that one going?  A fast company.  That's a sort of good starting point with some links.  But the archive, the site itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Break open the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The site itself has the videos and stuff from the event.  And I think there'll be more versions iterations of this in future because it was it was one of those events where you're like, oh, wow, there's a lot of people working on things like you.  You know, you meet a bunch of people who are working on a bunch of different things and you start seeing patterns in them and saying there's a lot of commonality here.  And some of that is because you started from the same point.  But some of it is you start from different points are converging.  And that's when it gets interesting.  I love this illustration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sandra Shun did network structures.  The old centralized network, of course, the pre Internet days of networking where you had a hub and spokes, the decentralized network, which is really a network of networks, aka the Internet.  And then this new model, which I mean, you could argue that's kind of what the Internet is to the distributed network.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the point is, and there's there's everything's a peer and the distributed network.  Right.  Is that are you are you rooting through?  Are you rooting up and down a tree?  Are you rooting side to side?  Right.  And in the Internet, we are generally reading up and down the tree a lot of the time.  And the point, so the point of the content hashing stuff is that it is independent of rooting.  It doesn't matter how you get that.  And we know we've had this bit torrent in effect does this be basically you pass around these days, you pass around a hash of the bit torrent structure that gives you the torrents that gives list of service.  And then you can you can bootstrap the whole process from that.  So you should let me find the look at go to Web torrent I.O. Have a look at this Web torrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I.O. Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Web torrent.  I.O. Look at that on your computer where it's I shall introducing Web torrent desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is this JavaScript bit torrent client you were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. So if you if you watch Scrap a bit, there's a video at the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, up. You know, that means different things depending on.  Scroll up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that video that's playing there is being downloaded by BitTorrent in very high speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm high quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can see the network, this topology on the left.  And also you are this is super cool.  Cool.  I'm loading bits to other people as well.  So I'm downloading it from eight peers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you still have a seeding a peer?  Yeah.  So somebody seeds it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody seeding it.  But but but but other people.  But the point is you are actually helping seed it by playing it.  And the other subtle thing that for us is for us is done with this is because he's in control of which audio you load the bits.  He's loading them in the order you want to play them in.  So he's using the like the bit the BitTorrent normally with the BitTorrent model that you have the file broken up to try to assemble kind of a random order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's not usable until fully assembled.  Yeah. But with streaming, you would love to assemble it in order or at least close to order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As the audience signs on.  Look. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at this.  Oh, that's the the the peering.  Oh, my God. This is fascinating.  And this is all done in the web.  It's done in the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, in the browser all with JavaScript.  That's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is pretty cool.  Yeah.  So basically he does this by including including other things we already had, which is the BitTorrent protocol, JavaScript and the ability to to move video around.  But also he's using WebRTC to do the edge to edge communication because you can do that with RTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So can I just use it now?  I mean, I use this.  There is a desktop client for OS 10 Windows and Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is it's you basically you can embed any torrent into a web page.  He explains how to do it.  Someone to someone on the page.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This changes the distribution equation for even the stuff we do.  Right.  Dramatically.  You wouldn't do live streaming with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This isn't the last stream.  This is because this is still somebody would have to see the entire file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you do you do this for you.  You could do this for your archive.  But they've hooked up the Internet Archive already had a BitTorrent mirror of the video they store and they've hooked that up to this so that you can just stream those in the browser now as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So where it would really be of interest, you know, right now, Google has really a monopoly as close to a monopoly as you can get with YouTube.  And it's very it's obviously centralized.  And only Google is big enough to kind of host that volume of traffic.  But you could do a decentralized YouTube using this.  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, you still use to be someone to see it.  But the point is that you could cope with with ramp ups as people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it would be great for us, for instance, right now, if you download a file of any of our shows, if you're not watching live, you're getting it from Cashfly and they shoulder the burden of all the bandwidth.  Now, they're a CDN.  So, you know, you get great download speeds and everything.  So from the end user's point of view, there'd be no difference or no advantage.  But from our point of view and cashless point of view, the huge advantage because the burden of bandwidth would be shouldered by all the users as you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I mean, but then the challenge, the difficulty there is you are using as then you when Jeff's on his tether thing, it suddenly finds his upload to other people as well.  So there's a trade off there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We when we first started doing the shows, we distributed via BitTorrent.  And and that was I liked that because the model was great.  We said to people, you know, if if you if you get the show and you want to be a seeder, please do will really help us distribute it.  And people were great.  And I love that community feeling of everybody was helping out and everybody was participating.  And as a viewer, you were but you're right now with with bandwidth caps and metered bandwidth.  It's really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the thing is, it actually got harder to do to do that precisely.  Well, somebody said in the chat, oh, your eyes people throttle you.  The ice piece did start to throttle it.  But that was partly because to some extent, BitTorrent was like an arbitrage around asymmetry because it would let you like the cable networks were designed to download faster than they uploaded.  But if you made multiple connections, you could end up uploading more as well.  So.  But the problem is the way it initially did it caused a lot of contention and stream dropping.  There was actually a lot of thrashing going on because it was open lots of TCP streams.  So they invented the invented the the muti protocol, which actually is much more efficient than that.  And the amount of bandwidth used dropped a lot because it doesn't doesn't waste bandwidth.  And also, it doesn't push the rest of the network out of the way.  It basically backs off in front of TCP streams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Kevin, being a Chromebook user, why can't this just operate on the web since the demo does?  Why do I need a desktop at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It can go on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the point.  So you know, I could I could.  But I don't have a client from a Chromebook.  No, you don't need a client.  I'm sitting right now.  What I'm saying is I wanted to look up a torrent.  And do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. I mean, basically, you can embed a torrent in the page.  There's a tell you how to do it.  You can look up a torrent and then they could embed it in the page with JavaScript using this this library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm just saying they should make this basically a service search on the torrent and play it through the through a web client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure someone will.  I mean, at the moment, it's a technology thing.  I mean, they've done it for the Internet Archive.  Somebody could do that.  I think there's some constraints on which codecs it can use.  So you'd have to pick the right because it has to be a codec that's supported by the browser, whereas a lot of the torrents will have a variety of different codecs.  So it has to be in the in the subset that that is that is part of the like the common browser codec things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But so is basically empty for it looks like it caches it to.  So since I downloaded it already, it comes from me.  I'm playing it and now others are joining to download it from from me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it uses local storage to cache it.  I haven't actually like all done the whole stack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, it does. I just went forward a page and back and it's redownloaded it now.  Yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's the difference on a Chromebook, I guess, because here I am on a desktop, a Linux desktop, and it saved it.  So this is great. I love this idea.  I'd love to see a front end that is browser only, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the more that BitTorrent is legitimized, the less that it'll be demonized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would, God, by now, isn't it?  Don't people know that BitTorrent used for so many legitimate purposes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is. Yeah, I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The bulk of piracy is BitTorrent, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is less blocked than it was.  I mean, the part of that was that they said this protocol change that they came up with that meant that it was actually causing network problems.  It doesn't do that anymore.  It backs out of the way of other streams.  It doesn't overload the pipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  BitTorrent's going to cover the Republican Convention next week with BitTorrent Live TV.  They have a news network. We're on BitTorrent Live TV.  We're one of the first networks on it. So you could watch us.  Oh, cool. I can watch you through that.  Yeah. You can watch us on Apple TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's that?  Bram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent.  He was there, too. And I think he was talking to Foros about this, but I'm not sure they made the live thing work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think for Bram, it really is all about legitimizing his baby.  I mean, he really doesn't like it that it's seen as a piracy tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, he cares about the protocol and that it makes sense and it works. And it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is. It's a really good protocol.  If you go right now to webtorrent.io, you will see how quickly and easily this downloads.  Yeah, it's amazing.  And it really is kind of remarkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the beauty is because of the UI for this demo, but showing you how you're helping others and seeing that.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of great.  I really love seeing that.  And you know what that does? That eliminates the piracy claim because you see every IP address that's seen this, right?  So, yeah, I guess somebody could use Tor and obfuscate their address.  But it's pretty hard on BitTorrent to be anonymous.  It actually turns out to be a really crappy way to pirate stuff despite its success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's the same way that Bitcoin is actually a bad way to buy legal things.  Right, right.  It's like, oh, wait, that wasn't that wasn't the goal of this protocol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not at all. What happened? Bitcoin halved.  Bitcoin halved, yeah, over the weekend.  Wow.  That means it takes twice as much power to generate the same amount of Bitcoin if you're a miner.  Does it solve the ledger problem? The ledger was running out of room.  No, it doesn't touch that.  And they still haven't, as a group, haven't solved that.  I mean, I presume the forks of Bitcoin are ongoing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's still ongoing. They're still debating that back and forth.  I've actually looked at the ratios of the different versions yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does prices stabilize, which often to me is a good indicator that things are getting better, at least not getting worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was my depressing headline of the week. Bitcoin now less volatile than UK pound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God, that's such bad news.  It's like, yep.  Oh, that's bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Obviously, it depends on the window you choose.  But yeah, basically, you've had a bad time for weeks.  Oh, my God.  But the other thing that the halving does is it it adjusts the balance between what you make by mining and what you make by fees,  which does adjust the utility of the Bitcoin protocol to some extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's automatic, by the way. We should point out that nobody does this.  The Bitcoin foundation doesn't do it. It's part of the protocol.  It's automatic, which is so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it happens every whatever it is.  Yeah.  Five thousand days or something.  Yeah.  But the point is that it's just some number of blocks, isn't it?  And the block rate is approximately every 10 minutes.  It's it's it's I mean, we don't know and we will never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm pretty convinced who Satoshi Nakamoto is or how many whatever.  But pretty freaking brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This was so but he missed a few things, but you know.  Well, there's this there's this weirdness is like things could change.  You know, enough miners could the miners could have ganged up and decided they didn't write the half.  Right. And they'd have had to do a fork and do that thing.  But what it means is that this is predictable.  You know, it's going to happen. They can plan for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no protection against forking no matter what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's the protection against forking is one of you has to win or you end up with be able to double spend.  And so at the point where there's a fork going on, there is some distinction about what counts as truth.  And you're picking up picking a branch every time you send a transaction in.  But the sort of the point of the halving is because the number of bitcoins you get per block went from 25 to twelve and a half.  That means the fee income is more significant.  So when you actually when you're trying to put bitcoins on the transaction queue, you're able to say I will pay so much to the miner for this transaction being put into the block.  And they will obviously rank them by how much they make from it and put them put those ones in the earlier block on the later block, which means that that ratio is now more significant, especially as the block size hasn't grown, which means the amount of fees you have to put in will creep up because of the amount of money.  Since you're going to have to pay a lot more for the size of this as the scarcity of space in the block as the same.  So to some extent, the miners now have an incentive not to grow the size of blocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it also means which is bad news, because that's part of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it depends on depends on what you know, what you think Bitcoin is for.  It means that using Bitcoin for various transactions makes even less sense than did before because you would you would have to put more fee value into it.  Because the block size is limited, you fill it out with small transactions, then the value of the potential fee value is lower.  So it's causing sort of Bitcoin to migrate to towards large transactions in effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samsung Galaxy Note 7 coming August 2nd, we think.  We got the invitation yesterday to Samsung's event in New York City.  I'm going to forward it to you, Jeff.  Yes, please do. I'll try to go.  But we and I will not be in town.  I'm going to San Diego that day to see a play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aren't you just Mr. Culture?  Or what is it? Is it is it a dramatization of Taco Bell commercial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Steve Martin's new comedy.  Oh, my. And Jenna Fisher is in it from office.  Oh, love her. I know.  You know, it's a great premise. I don't think it's a musical.  It's called Meteor Shower.  The premise is two couples go to their back to their backyard, one of the couple's backyard to watch a meteor shower.  It's one of the it's like a drawing room comedy in the backyard.  At least that's my understanding. It's great cast. Just four people. I can't wait to see it.  Anyway, that's why I will not be here. And but we will have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's like a rabbi, a priest and an elephant walking to a bar and you stop there.  So four people go. I don't know what else happens. I haven't seen it yet.  And then what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, dialogue ensues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems so obvious. Well, it'd be great. You watch it.  You're watching a meteor shower. Of course, I'm playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You heard of a play called Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?  It's Steve Martin. That's all I need to know. I know.  Steve Martin writing it. Think of it as a comedic.  Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?  It should be fun.  Anyway, Samsung has skipped the Note 6 because, of course, they have the Galaxy S7.  They want everything to be in sync.  We don't know anything about the S7.  Except that it will be in the Note 7, I should say, you know, a successor to one of the most successful phones, despite all odds of all time.  This Galaxy Note was the giant phone.  You know, it was the first five inch plus phone.  Everybody laughed when I put my note to the to my head and they said, what the hell is that?  You got a can't you know, a giant Hershey bar? What are you? What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I never understood that criticism because the distance between my ear and my mouth is more than this.  It fits. It fits.  Yeah.  You know, the classic handset is bigger than even the S7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, everybody realized that we need a big screen.  We want a big screen.  And the stylus, I think for not everybody, definitely for some markets is awesome.  Take notes. You could draw pictures.  They're going to do the apparently they're going to do the edge style, which has been so successful for them.  I'm I've mixed feelings.  I said it aesthetically.  The edge is incredible.  I mean, it's beautiful.  It's like an infinity pool, but it's a little hard to hold.  And sometimes you get straight stray inputs from your fingers.  Five.  The rumor, of course, five point seven inch screen edge style.  Same 12 megapixel cameras, the Galaxy S7 water resistant.  Again, they're back to that perhaps a massive four thousand milliamp hour battery, which, you know, you never know if that's going to be enough given the size of the screen and the number of pixels it'll be pushing.  It the other rumor that I find interesting is an iris scanner.  I don't know if that's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the FBI can get it from you.  Yeah, that's good. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, do you really want to unlock your phone like by holding it to your eyeball?  And, you know, there are I think Windows phones use this and it's a very annoying.  They says up down a little closer.  No, a little far.  OK, don't move.  Wait, the paper clip will tell you how to do it.  Yeah, no, that's not you don't want that.  So and by the way, fingerprint works so well.  I don't see a reason for it.  It looks, you know, we don't know.  We'll find out and we'll be covering it August 2nd.  That's just around the corner.  Couple of weeks from now.  Couple of weeks from now.  Galaxy Note 7 unpacked 7 unpacked 2016.  August 2nd, our live coverage, 8 a.m. Pacific, 11 a.m. Eastern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Put that put that in your calendar and I'll make sure you get an invite because we'd love to hear from you.  What do you think of it and all that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If they'll fly me there, I'll take an invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think airfare was included.  Well, didn't why?  I think Jeff and I both got an invitation to Huawei's big event in Shanghai.  Yep. Yep. Yep.  Oh, sounds like fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It saved me to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I've been looking at Jeff and it looks more, you know, at first we thought, well, what is it a junket for Huawei?  But now it looks more like Dreamforce, you know, Salesforce.  Salesforce has done really well with a conference around the Salesforce technologies.  It's huge.  And I think Huawei is attempting to do the same thing.  And they told us we're trying to get people outside of Huawei.  Somebody's playing Pokemon Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to tell you how many I have.  What Pokemon's up?  Your son will peer pressure you into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, now that you've done it, everybody else has to launch their Pokemon Go just to see if anything else is showing up.  You were trying to get somebody from outside.  What?  Huh?  They're trying to get they have Intel CEO Greg.  I can't ever pronounce his name.  We'll be there.  And I think they're trying to get others from other companies.  So to make it more of a conference.  Can you stop that?  Or at least turn the sound down so I don't know you're playing because it's making me a little antsy.  Let me find the sound settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There we go.  You're not going to stop playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need to turn this off.  No, yeah, that's fine.  I can understand why you would never stop playing.  Apparently you'll be able to share Google Play apps, movies and music soon from Google Play with up to $100,000.  Google Play with up to six people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I spend a fortune buying shows on Google Play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is the Google Play Family Library Plan.  Now there is already a family subscription for music.  So is this just extending that to TV and apps and music?  You would have to pay more or?  Well, I think so.  You certainly do for the music family plan, which is $15.  That's a little bit for five.  Yeah, $15 for five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a case where I've already bought the show.  Can I share it with up to six people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  According to CNET, the primary account holder will be able to remove specific titles from the family library or hide certain artists you want others to know you enjoy.  Well, we don't know.  I guess this is you know, this is not yet out.  Everyone in the group will be able to site will be able to access every single app, video and book that's available to the account holder.  So as dad, you're the account holder.  I am indeed.  You can hide the breadwinner.  Now you're the account holder.  You don't. Oh, you don't have to pay extra to sign up for the Google Play Family Library.  But you will have to have a credit card saved to the account for future purchases.  But you are probably do.  Believe me, that's there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I do things like Mr.  Robot.  I'll just go ahead and buy it on play so I can watch it when I want to and not have to because the problem is I want to watch it on a train or a plane.  I'm not online.  Right.  So I'll buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  I don't think it's stupid.  That's good.  Let's support shows and show people there's a business in not just putting it on cable.  I think that's really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, I said he's the founder of Google Music.  That's great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, you know, I suppose I'm pleased to do that with Amazon in that we've got Kindle's that are on the same account and we can read each other's books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, you know, we have a sponsor texture that's like Netflix for magazines and they encourage you to they said you have five five devices.  You can share it with your family.  They actually encourage it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But wasn't there was wasn't there a legal decision this week?  Yes.  It's this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it potentially makes it a felony to share.  Oh, that's a share your password.  I don't you know, we talked about this yesterday with the Steve on security now.  And it really was.  So Snopes says it hasn't become a felony.  It was a court decision.  Most people like the LA Times are saying relax.  You're not going to jail for sharing your Netflix password.  It was a appellate court ruling that so this guy David Nassau worked as a regional director at an executive search search firm.  Cornferry left the firm started his own competing business.  He had someone else use the log in information of his former assistant who was still at Cornferry to download proprietary information from the company's database.  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals say that David affirming David did knowingly steal trade secrets by acting accessing a protected computer without authorization.  That's a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Economic Espionage Act.  Some have projected that.  Oh, that means you can now prosecute password sharing as a Computer Fraud and Abuse Act violation.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's so that's a it's a different.  So that's a different kind of yeah, there's an intent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's really stretching it.  Maybe somebody will try it.  But you know, it's always up to the court to decide whether that's the case.  And I don't think any court would reasonably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But also if if yeah, if Amazon did that for Kindle users, then they just use a lot of Kindle users.  No, let's just be dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody's going to prosecute that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They already know that we're reading the same books on multiple devices over different times and they're clearly happy with it as we're buying books that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So don't worry.  Go ahead.  Here's a story that I think is kind of interesting.  PewDiePie, among other YouTubers, was paid thousands of dollars to promote a game by Warner Brothers.  He put now this is I'm very curious what you say.  This is an FTC judgment.  FTC says that Warner Brothers failed to adequately disclose it paid online influencers to post gameplay videos of Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor.  PewDiePie, one of those streamers now apparently PewDiePie said sponsored by Warner Brothers not in the video, but in the YouTube description of the video.  What now?  No, but I don't think anybody that the FTC has gone after PewDiePie, although they do have strict rules and we are we're our attorneys said, hey, guys, if you mention a sponsor and on a tweet or an Instagram, even if you're responding, you know, somebody says to us got those emails now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody says to us, hey, we really love that Casper mattress and I retweet it.  I have to add hashtag sponsor or, you know, text that indicates clearly that they are a sponsor.  I can't just retweet that.  That's a violation of FTC rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, if I say that on a show, I say that on a show I've got to identify.  If I as a recipient of your great generosity say it in my own tweet, we would like you to say.  By the way, full disclosure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, or you see, you know, our attorney said saying hashtag ad hashtag sponsors.  Okay, I prefer to put it in the in the pros.  My sponsor or our sponsor Casper, something like that.  The thing about this is I'm fine with that.  That's full disclosure.  That's appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am too.  This is the new payola.  Right.  We didn't know how it all has gone on.  Now I don't know how this gets done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  FTC says customers have the right to know if reviewers are providing their own opinions or paid sales pitches.  Cost companies like Warner Brothers need to be straight with consumers in their online ad campaign.  It's interesting, though, that they went after Warner Brothers.  And to my knowledge, they have not yet gone after the YouTube creators.  PewDiePie's video had 3.7 million views.  Warning shot.  I think PewDiePie needs to do more than just put it in the description.  Be my opinion, because people don't always see the description.  Plus, remember, YouTube videos can be embedded anywhere and you won't see the description.  It needs to be in the video at the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you put a super on when you're doing an ad read, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, we're clear.  Yeah, I think we've never there's never been any question that it's an ad.  I don't want to trick our audience.  I have no interest in tricking anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The ethical podcast and things will put some different background music on.  They'll put if it's audio only, they'll put a caption on the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I usually say we're going to have will be more conversation.  But first, you know, let's talk about our sponsor at the end.  I'll say we thank them for their support.  I try to really make it clear.  Here's a different lower third.  I do everything but but Blair Horn and say advertisement advertisement.  Yeah, the voice even changes and my voice changes.  That's unconscious, by the way.  I've turned into Leo the pitch man.  So no, but we look at I don't it's not even that this is against the law.  It's that you don't know money in there.  We should try to trick your community, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which was the whole issue with data advertising product placement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that was so disheartened to learn that my favorite publication,  the Atlantic, makes the bulk of its money with native content.  Now, fortunately, with the Atlantic, it's clearly native content, right?  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you courts, I think did a superb job and they make their money the same way.  The publication of the Atlantic.  And interestingly, I had a conversation with with Justin Smith,  who was the founder, of course, when he was the head of Atlantic.  And Zach Seward, who was there when I was at a conference in Africa last year,  and then the conversation they said, Oh, remember, I don't know who it was,  of course, but somebody didn't like advertising.  And so he said, This is how we're going to do it.  This is so so an editorial person kind of set the standards for what advertising  should be, and then and then they're going to care about the user.  They're going to make sure to be straight with the user.  That's that's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all.  Your audience deserves that.  My audience deserves that.  And if I'm doing it wrong, I want to be please tell me.  I want to make sure everybody understands.  It's funny because there's different cultural standards.  People in the United States are used to ads in interstitial ads in the street.  Yeah, stuff.  And there's a long tradition in older broadcast media of people like Arthur  Godfrey stopping the show and saying, now I want to tell you a little bit.  Are Paul Harvey and the Bose acoustic wave radio and all of that.  But in the UK and elsewhere, we get a lot of UK viewers say,  What is going on with the adverts?  Yeah, they were shocked that a host was doing ads.  I guess it's not done in the UK.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I mean, well, it's there are a ton of rules there.  And the BBC, they will actually cover up products you're using on screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we used to do that, too.  In fact, I think we somewhat do look see that you can't tell what model TV I'm using here.  But you do know the kind of new guy.  You know that I'm using fine Ferrera quality.  The new good of champions.  My God, somebody's eaten all of Ferrera.  Notice there's plenty of big hunk left, but the Ferrera, it's a scarce commodity.  That's because Ferrera Torone has been made in Italy with love since 1829.  Eighteen ninety two.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I wish I could get money for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe they'll send me some nougat anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We gave so much free advertising to Chipotle.  I never got a penny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then, of course, after the E. coli scare, we haven't mentioned Chipotle since.  Didn't get so much as a free burrito for this thing.  Not even a burrito.  We made a joke of it on one of our shows, The Daily Gizmos, because we were never able to get ads.  So we started doing our own ads for Tostino's pizza rolls.  And then we found out that it was Totino's.  We were saying it wrong for a long time.  Needless to say, we never got any money from them either.  Facebook, Twitter and breaking news.  This is a BuzzFeed report from Charlie Warzell.  And of course, it's talking about the fact that a lot of these, you know, the live video of the shootings last week going right through Facebook.  Jeff was on. We had a fantastic tweet on Sunday.  Jeff, thank you. Thank you.  Siva Vajanathan, oh, Dr. Jason Hiner.  If you didn't watch that discussion of how the new media is changing the conversation in this country.  Really a very good tweet and really.  And I went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The session I had was off the record.  So I won't talk about it in detail.  But Facebook brought in one of its policy executives in this tour of talking to journalists in New York about these kinds of things.  And it was great because that because it was an open discussion.  And these are really naughty issues of what you're going to do about live.  And I think Facebook's attitude has shown by the fact that what they did.  And they, you know, I'm told that it was not they did not take down that video on purpose or to provide breathing room.  But they're trying to leave things up.  They're trying to leave things out there.  They're trying to go for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter is probably very much in the same vein, right?  They're going to have this.  They haven't yet.  But Periscope, which is a Twitter property, is and it lets you stream right to the Twitter feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  YouTube is putting up as everybody in the world is going to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think that's a bad thing.  I think it's a good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree.  I agree.  You know, what I said, what I'll say, what I said to Facebook is that I think what they can do, they'll recognize in their data when tons of traffic is going to something.  What I what I suspect happened with the Reynolds video was there was tons of traffic going to something and something shuts off and says, oh, watch out, could be porn.  Yeah, no, I'm sure that's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was definitely an automated thing that triggered a human review.  And then the human review went through and then they said, OK, put it back up.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But number one, Facebook and YouTube at all will recognize when there's an unusual occurrence of traffic to a video.  And the number two, when it's something that's happening in a, you know, in Times Square, they'll also recognize geographically.  Oh, here's 10 feeds from the same place showing the same stuff must be true.  So between discovery and verification, the platforms will have data that we can't possibly have.  You have these new platforms like Storyful that do a wonderful job of verifying video.  But the platforms will know that base data that will make it possible to find this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, Twitter trying to become a legitimate news outlet.  They just made a deal to stream the Republican National Convention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think I'm not going to watch on NBC, ABC, CBS.  I'm going to watch on Twitter.  I think I'll watch on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Will it be in moments? How is this going to work?  I don't know.  You know, I can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I've watched news break in moments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, that's the theory that you would do that.  That you would see.  Certainly, if somebody dies, first place I see it, the first place I saw that David Bowie had passed was on Twitter.  The first place I saw, you know, well, I don't want to go through the list, but great many people have passed.  That's where you see it is Twitter.  And I don't think there's a reason that breaking news couldn't happen on Twitter.  I guess it would be smart of them to then have on moments.  There is this capability.  I don't know if anybody uses it to follow momentarily breaking news, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But the challenge, I mean, the challenge is with the convention is that it mostly isn't news.  By the way, here's some story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Neil Farage is going to be speaking at the GOP convention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  What? Nigel Farage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nigel, not Neil.  Nigel Farage is going to Cleveland.  Is he speaking?  Jesus.  Is he speaking?  I don't know.  He's attending.  I can't imagine if he's there that they won't bring him up on stage.  What are you going to put?  Just have him in the mass of people?  What the what?  I mean, he wasn't there.  Solidarity.  Of course, yes.

Transcript:  Marie Le Pen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, let's get Marie Le Pen out.  Why not?  Let's just have a, you know, as Kim, what's Kim Jong-un doing these days?  Is he?  Bring him in.  The reason that, you know, here's the reason.  Bring him in.  I know everybody.  They're great, great people.  They're leaders.  They're smart people.  And I have a great relationship with all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I am going to watch it on a GOP.  I'm telling you, of course you're going to watch it.  I'm going to hold for the fail whale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter will be an interesting place to watch because you know what?  Facebook tried to do this.  Whatever happened to that?  Remember they had streams and you would watch and there'd be all these social content going on around it.  They still do that?  I don't think so.  Well, they're going to be in Facebook's going to be able to.  Right.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, you know, it's kind of the model we have with we have the thing live.  We have the chat room going on and Facebook has a bit of that.  But it's it's less coherent because it's Facebook.  And so it's in there sort of with Fred thing.  And so your comments you see don't make a lot of sense.  It's a natural fit for that kind of life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last night there was another shooting on Facebook Live.  So it's not over by any means.  This from Norfolk, Virginia, three men badly wounded and one of them was streaming live video.  You can hear 30 gunshots over 20 seconds.  This is just as the New York Times said, another night, another shooting on Facebook Live.  This is this is the normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the the the British news.  This was this was actually in the piece that I linked from the editor of The Guardian, which I can't remember.  How technology disrupts the truth.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, tell me what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so it's a long piece.  It's very thoughtful.  And she's saying it's about the end of gatekeeping by media and.  But how does that disrupt the truth?  Well, because it is her contention is that before media was fact checked and now people can go and pick their own channel and cluster with a bunch of people who believe the things that aren't necessarily true and their sensation, so on.  But to be fair to her, she then partway through talks about the Sun newspaper in the UK.  And the the recent they finally settled settled the Hillsborough thing recently.  You know about this, Jeff, right?  So this was a long time ago.  15 years ago.  It's a long time, very long time ago.  There was a there was a there was a horrible stampede inside a football stadium in the UK and lots of people crushed to death because they put up wire mesh netting between the two of them.  And the Sun runs some hideous story about it saying that people defiled the corpses and all kinds of stuff like this based on nothing much, particularly based on rumors from the police and so on.  And then didn't didn't respond to this and that sort of the lie held up for a long time.  And finally, they backed down from it after years later.  So that is an example of the gatekeepers getting it wrong and not being as challenged from it.  And she and she rightly says, had something like that happen now, you know, with 53,000 people present with phones in their pocket, we'd have seen the video of what was going on with the narrative.  The false narrative, which was served to spread, which was served to serve the truth.  And, you know, I suppose the American equivalent would be the alleged deaths in the in the in the arena after Katrina and the, you know, the myth that was created there of people rampaging in the in that place when actually that didn't happen.  So, you know, there was there were these narratives that sort of take hold and become part of the discourse.  And then the people who were there were the ones who were there.  And I think that happened.  The this stuff gets resolved more quickly these days because more people on the site with cameras and and spreading stuff through the social media.  But at the same time, the other half of this is it is much easier to put together a channel full of people who will agree with each other and believe the latest conspiracy theories.  So when the head of the of the European Commission says he's been talking to aliens, all the clusters of people who believe that the Earth is the leaders of the Earth are in communion with aliens, put those things up on their site to say, look, finally, see proof.  And this fits in with the other ancient aliens evidence we have over here.  And the narrative continues.  And so, you know, in a sense, we have this jeweling truth out there.  This world, you know, we're always going to have this and this sort of myth that there was only there was that the news was this golden age of news.  Everything was fact shaped and true.  Actually, there was just a small piece of the truth that was there.  And that was the truth.  And that was the truth.  And that was the truth.  And so, you know, the truth was that the news was this golden age of news.  Everything was fact shaped and true.  Actually, there was just a smaller set of people controlling the narrative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is exactly exactly what we talked about on Sunday.  Right, Jeff?  This is exactly the question is.  And Jeff's always been really good on this.  It's not it wasn't better than it was.  It's a myth that these people who control the news had the had the monopoly on truth by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And let's be clear that the trust in American news media started falling in the 70s.  Right.  Long before the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And rightly and to be honest, I think we know rightly so.  But we aren't we now in a better position?  Yes.  If you're one of if you're a conspiracy theorist, you can find many more sources to confirm your belief.  But, you know, that confirmation bias has always been a problem in general.  But for everybody else, there are many, many choices of sources and you get to sift them all and come to the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is that we have business models built on volume over value.  Well, I mean, the illiterative.  And so I think part of what Cath is saying in full disclosure is I work with The Guardian.  The Guardian has started a membership program, which is really a contribution program, which is her saying support quality journalism, support value.  And we don't want to put a wall up.  So can you please join and support us that way?  And I think that we have to find various models that are going to support value and not just crappy stories about two color dresses.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And well, you know, in my opinion, if you are it's this is where I have high hopes for new media and podcasting in particular.  If you are more interested in serving your audience than in tricking your audience with link bait, right, and you focus on serving your audience, all will be well.  And I do think that that's the strong message that I that podcasters understand.  You know, a few people, you know, when you get into this stuff and it's certainly if you're working for a big company and there's pressure to deliver views, you may fall sway to that.  But I think any company that's really smart about media says we need to serve our audience.  We need to give them the information they need.  We need to serve them with the best as best we can and not trick them into clicking our headlines by writing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Leo. And I think in tribute to what you do, I'm learning right now how difficult this is, because as you know, we've kind of pulled back a little bit on on dot NYC because I haven't figured out what it ought to be yet.  And then the essence of this is I don't know what the right relationship is with that audience to know how to serve them.  And so trying to find that right voice and that right expectation is really hard.  And I've always respected what you do, but I see all the more how hard it is to come up with that formula.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's easier for us because we have a niche, right?  We we're serving geeks. We're serving people like me.  So I know how to serve people like me because it's people like me.  And I've never attempted to go beyond that.  And every time we have or I've worked for companies that have I have been at sea because I don't know what those people want.  I know what my people want.  And I'm going to and I'm very interested in serving that community.  That's my community tech enthusiast community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was the what was the what was the McDonald's hula burger?  What was the right?  Right. What was the hula burger of twist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The hula bur.  Well, we did a quite a few.  We did a junk food show called Munchcast, which I liked a lot, but it wasn't really right up our alley.  I mean, a number of shows like that where we were where we made the biggest category made a mistake in his geek culture.  And I think a lot of people make that mistake is conflating technology enthusiasts and geek culture, the cons, the comic cons and stuff like that.  We for we drifted a little bit in the geek culture vein.  And I put it the end and then to that because that's fine.  And do that. Anybody wants to should do that.  That's not what we do. We we're about geek tech enthusiasts.  And yes, there is, you know, there's some overlap with comic book culture, comic con culture, geek culture.  That's but that overlap does not justify us deviating from what we know about, which is how to serve the technology audience period.  And, you know, it's funny because we've we had a staff meeting yesterday and we were talking about marketing messages.  And I said, it's very tempting with marketing messages, you know, the little blurbs for each show to put something that's going to generate traffic.  And I would ask you not to do that, but to put the information that will serve our audience, tell them what they're going to expect from the show and the information in the show and how the show is going to benefit them.  That's how I want you to generate traffic, not by putting a catchy headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amen. Amen. Like, oh, I don't know.  There is only one flavor of herring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's going to be the title, by the way.  But that came about that really was never an attempt for link bait or SEO.  That was just jokey. Right.  And it was kind of a game I would play with the audience.  We kind of, you know, with this is lost in the midst of time now.  But I always used to have bloopers at the end of the show, not bloopers, but like the convert.  I would have long conversations that the tradition of that long conversations before the show starts is we were always looking for a little chunk we could then stick at the end of the show.  And the the title usually came from that.  And the idea was to get people to listen to the whole show and go to the end.  That I don't think is too bad.  Let me ask you another question. Yes.  It's not tricking anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So whenever you get a new employee or you get somebody who wants to understand what I will just bet that they that oftentimes you hear the same idea.  You want to. Yes. Blank. Absolutely.  And you know better. What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, a big one with the young people especially is do a better job on YouTube.  In fact, we've lost people like Chad Johnson who believe very firmly and he's young and he's probably right for his generation that that's where the future was is on YouTube.  And I disagreed.  And but what we did is we we let him start his show here.  And as soon as it got good, he said, all right, take it to YouTube.  I said, all right, normally in a normal business, we'd say, no, we own this show.  We own all the assets and we put over one hundred thousand dollars into generating those assets and that shows success.  But you know what? I love you, Chad.  So go out and go do it and have fun on YouTube.  That's your that's your mission.  It's not our mission. Right. So that's a big one.  Yeah, we don't nobody who comes here really says, oh, we ought to do more link bait.  No, no, no, no, no, no. I think that comes from the top down.  That comes from pressure from the boss to generate more views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The business model, because all we're selling is volume.  I was talking to a media company the other day and I said, listen, you have this huge reach now.  And the one thing that they say in media these days is that reach is good for conversion.  The problem is you have nothing to convert people to.  I want to get the mass product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've always said this is something else to tell our staff better, not bigger.  We're not trying to get more audience. Right.  We're trying to serve the audience we have better.  And we feel that that will give us the best benefit and we'll grow.  And we do grow something like five to 10 percent a year.  So as we're growing, I guess that's good.  I'd hate to see shrinking, but all of our shows grow about 10 percent.  Some some more, some less.  And that's fine with me. I don't want to become mass media.  I think it would be a mistake. It's a dying model.  All right. We ran out of time with that fabulous.  We ran over. Yeah, we actually did.  We have to go to TNT.  So why don't we wrap things up with the back of the book?  As I say, Jeff, you got a number.  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about you, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got something you'd like to plug or promote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, well, it what was we've changed the URL for IndieWeb.  So it's now IndieWeb.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I like it even better because there's no camping involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Well, the camping still happens.  IndieWeb.org is our new site.  That's a good title. That's a good IndieWeb.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  And it looks a bit cleaner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I like it. Yeah.  We have Homebrew Website Club tonight in San Francisco, Portland and Bellingham, Washington.  Great. Great.  Oh, Los Angeles too, maybe?  Uh-huh.  Didn't realize it was Los Angeles.  And we've got IndieWeb camps coming up.  There's one in New York in August.  So pay attention to that, Jeff. Go along, bring your friends.  And there's one in Brighton in September.  And then Los Angeles in November.  The other IndieWeb stuff that's going on is that WebMention and Micropub are still going through W3C Social Web Working Group to count the recommendations at the moment.  So that basically this is these are the things we've been using for a while.  WebMention is one site telling another that is linked to it so that you can transfer comments and RSVPs and things like that.  Micropub is letting me post to one site from another site.  So give me your permission to post on my site, or rather make it easier for me to post on my site from your site.  And those are sort of baseline protocols that we've moved to W3C.  They're at the stage now where we're trying to make them into actual official standards, which means if you've heard me talk about them before and was interested by them,  log them up now, check them out, test your implementations.  We've got test suites and test cases for both so you can try this out because we need to make sure that we've got this stuff right before it gets turned into a formal standard.  So this is like this is kind of recommendation means we're in the state where we think we've got this right, but we're able to make changes to it.  So help us make sure we have got it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Excellent. IndieWeb.org. It's all there.  Yep. That's the stuff there. Love that.  Promoting the idea of a web standards. What a thought. What a notion.  What a concept. Jeff Jarvis, did you find your number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, I did. So to Lufthansa on July 1 started two new flights.  And this goes, I've been talking about this since going back to the days of what Google do when I talked about what a social airline looks like.  I love this and their friends, some friends there who have been charged with this and I've had discussions about this.  That's disclosure. They announced a flight going from Frankfurt to San Jose.  They call a lab flight and on the flight over, it was all Samsung VR stuff.  Oh, that would be so cool. They could try out all the technology is a long flight way to throw.  They can try out the technology. Then they also have guest speakers and you can watch on your phone or your tablet or your laptop over the Wi-Fi with the guest speakers.  Then you can try out the stuff. I want to do that. And on the way back, they're doing they did sleep technology.  Fun. Are they doing more of those?  Arianna. Yeah, that's the plan.  Sorry, I lost the earpiece.  What a great idea.  Yeah, I thought it was a great idea. I wanted to give him a plug. Torsten Winklert is my friend there who's done really neat stuff.  And I guess I should also disclose I'm officially a member of the Lufthansa Innovation Lab Advisory Board.  But they do this is this is I mean, why should you just be trapped in a metal tube? Right. As a commodity, they can make these flights special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I would guess there's a pretty brisk business from Silicon Valley to Frankfurt and back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah. The other event, you know, imagine the special flights.  KLM did this a while ago where they people on social media urged them to have one flight to some kind of music conference.  But, you know, German flat Germans have taken over South by Southwest. Every German I know goes to South by Southwest.  They love it. Oh, yeah. Marketers and Germans. So we're not funny.  The marketers Germans are there. But imagine special flights to South by Southwest where you know where they're going.  You know who's going. You can have content going over. You can meet other people. You can try out things.  It's brilliant. So airline should be doing this more and more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you imagine somebody who got on that flight by accident and didn't realize what he was getting into?  Why is everyone walking around in these goggles? Who is this guy? Why is he talking to everybody?  What is this Torsten guy up to? When's dinner? How fun. I would love to do that.  Well, that'd be cool. It's like you've been on these cruises.  I you know what? This is one of the reasons I actually like cruises is the idea of kind of a track of education.  I used to get cruises for years where we would do a conference, Mac mania or something else.  And I love that idea of travel plus education. I did.  It ended up being working vacations and I don't think those two words should go together.  Yeah. So now I do vacation vacations, but I suspect as I get older, I may I could see myself ending my years on a Cunard vessel,  teaching people of similar vintage shadows get email. I see myself.  Now press the send button. You don't have goggles on.  You see this? Yeah. Okay. Now swipe left. There you go. Now you've got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Swipe. No, no, no. Don't take out your handkerchief. No, not wipe. Swipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Lord. Oh, we have fun. And I am so glad I love just sitting around with my buddies talking about interesting stuff.  And there's just Sean, smart people. It's there's nothing like it.  Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at CUNY buzz machine dot com is his blog.  He's a very, very big thinker and we love talking to him every week. Thank you, Jeff.

Just email tickets. TV. We'll put a seat out for you. Our new studio. I should mention this.  We're going to be here and we think we're moving August 21st.  So we will not have a studio audience on August 20th to 21st because it won't be much here.  The chairs will have been moved. It's possible we will have to delay it if the contractor gets behind to August 28th.  But it'll either be that weekend or the next. That's why we want you to email tickets at twit dot TV so we can let you know what the plan is.  I do think what we're going to do, though, that day, we've rented a motorized cable car because we can't walk to the studio.  So the plan is that Sunday, whether it's 21st or 28th, that I will finish the radio show because we'll still have the one radio studio left.  Finish the radio show and then everybody who's left will grab a few things.  I'll take my Emmy and my clock. That's all I care about.  And get on the cable car and we'll have a live streaming camera with us as well.  We'll stream the drive to the new place. You'll catch a few Pokemon along the way.  We probably will. We are Team Red here at Twit.  Vala, sorry, Chris.  And we will then do Twit from the new studio and it'll be an all in studio Twit.  So some people will be that we could have audience for that, right? Or no?  Yes. Yeah.  So just email. You know what? Email us. We don't know exactly.  We don't know yet how many people fit and how many chairs we'll have and all that stuff.  A team is amassing because we are now going to take Team Valor over to the seed bank and take it back for Red Team.  Sorry, Chris.
