Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cutts here, don't we? Matt Cutts is a Googler, one of the first. He's at mattcuts.com slash blog.  Hello, Matt. Good to see everybody. How are you? And we clarified before the show, but let me  re-clarify. You are employed by Google. You speak for yourself, not for Google. Currently on leave,  enjoying life. Apparently somebody wrote an article, I guess it was on Bloomberg or somewhere,  that this is not unusual, Google, that the really key employees after a certain period of time,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's almost like an informal sabbatical. Well, and I don't know what sort of arrangements they have  for the rest of the bench, but Google's been very kind about letting me take the time off and, you  know, they're not paying me salary or anything like that. So I'm not costing them a lot of money.  You're not getting paid. For a little while I was, but at this point I'm not. So I'm relatively  cheap for them to keep around in the wings. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Gosh, you should really,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they should really give you a little something, something to keep you in house. I need to,  I need to kind of negotiate for you. They should give you a pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so they are paying my health insurance. So that's not, oh, hey, that's not insignificant.  Yeah, but it still helps. But yeah, maybe I'll ask for one of the new pixels. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ask for a pixel for crying out loud. It's nice to see you, Matt. What do you, what do you,  are you doing a 30 day challenge every month? Matt likes to do a 30 day challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am. A friend emailed me and he said, I'm doing a 30 day challenge where I take a cold shower  every day. And I said, no, I said, that sounds like a great idea. Why don't I try that? And it was  a horrible idea, but, you know, you take a cold shower and it's the worst thing that happens in  the morning. And now everything else through the rest of the day will be better. And such a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  mad cunts attitude. You know, you know what I think, Matt, you're not a human, you're a Disney  character. If I get too pixelated, you'll know that I'm actually right side of life. You're amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But so the cold, I'm on like day five and every day I sort of take a deep breath and I'm sort  of cussing the shower. What do you mean? Like ice cold? It's cold. You turn it as cold as you can.  It wakes you up. It's actually maybe good for your metabolism. And it's great for the philosophy of  like, okay, I've done that. Now I can do phone calls. What proof do you have that this friend

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  isn't just chortling that he got you to do this for 30 days straight? I could be getting trolled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's entirely possible. If I may, one of the very distinct memories I have from when I was in  elementary school and they showed you those old films, you know, the film roll or whatever in  health part of fifth grade or something like that was a video about a guy who took cold showers  every morning. And one of those mornings he gave himself a heart attack. Just saying, be careful.  All right. I distinctly remember this video and it's haunted me for my whole life. So I never take

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a cold shower because of it. Jason, I thought you said you were in the cold shower. The cold  shower film was going to be part of sex ed. No, thankfully. Thankfully, no. You get a little too

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  excited. Take a cold shower. Well, all right. So there is, I remember reading that that's one way  to lose weight. In fact, we met somebody who said that they lost weight that way. There's also this  new trend of like super cold, like 200 below baths. Becky Wardley did this for Good Morning America  recently. She was telling me about it where you get it. I mean, it's really, really, really cold,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like freezing cold. And Robin Quivers of the Howard Stern show just took some kind of cryotherapy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's cryotherapy. That's not, that seems like coffee enemas. Like, not a good idea.  If your friend says every day for the next month, I'm doing a coffee enema,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  can I just suggest you don't? Well, the whole idea is you're always trying experiments, you know,  and some of them are going to fail horribly. Like I don't plan to keep taking cold showers.  You don't. You can bail, right? I can. But you know, it's a cold shower. It's five minutes and  then you're done. And so why not try something new? You know, maybe you'll pick up a new habit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sounds very Scotch, like Scottish. Scottish people would do this. I'm going to take a cold shower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll be great. And I'll feel manly. And then whoever started one of these and some before 30

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  days said, oh, effort. Yeah. Yeah. You have. Okay. Well, well, okay. There's been somewhere  I really suck. It turns out I can't meditate. Like my brain doesn't. I try, I count leaves,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know, and it's just. I want to do that. I want to, I want to, I want to start meditating.  I asked Lisa, she said, you could do it when I'm sleeping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She wasn't. I said, come on, we'll do it together. No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to go watch TV. You go meditate. All right. So cold showers. Wow. I don't know.  I don't want to do that. Sounds terrible. So did anybody listen to Mark Maron's podcast with the  press? I want to yet. I want to have you. Yeah, not yet either. That's why it's only been downloaded  a million times so far. Yeah. I millions a lot for a podcast sounds low for an interview with  the president. What are you going to get the president on Twitter? Yeah. Really? Huh? I'm  not sure what the deal was. Maron's people approached the president. Maron said we didn't  really know. It was just, we thought what the heck. And then as it got more and more real,  he said, then I was wondering like, well, where do we do this? Do I go to air force one? Do I go to  the oval office? And it turns out the president came to him, his garage, little tiny garage studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hilarious talking about about the, you know, the all the secret security, a sniper on the  neighbor's roof. Yeah. Tents all around. And then crowds came out because they knew they knew where  he lives. So they wanted to come out and see the president. Wow. You couldn't because the president

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  pulled up in his limo into a tent and then and then left the limo was completely out of sight  as he entered the garage and left the garage. And of course, the media focused on the fact  that the president in a completely appropriate context, I might add, used the N word. And that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  became the story, which is so, so typical. Then Don Lemon did his Don Lemon this about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You see that? No, what did lemon say? Don Lemon's CNN, CNN anchor. I'm glad I can finally say it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  out loud because I thought I'm not the only person who thinks this guy's a buffoon. He held up a  he held up a sign, a big sign that had the N word on it. Why would you do that? Yeah. Well, he's an

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  African American. And he, by the way, got kicked off CNN tonight. And before it, though, he held  up a Confederate flag. So there is some sort of interesting, interesting thing going on. This is  what CNN calls intelligent. Yeah. What do you think of this? What do you think of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aaron's a great guy. I actually was I forgot about this. Mark Maron. I was on I was briefly  a regular on his Air America show. I didn't know that. Yeah, long ago. Not very, very briefly,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know, weeks, but we met him at a Stitcher Award event, spent some time backstage with him.  He's very funny. He's actually a little neurotic, a little nervous, right? And I can only imagine  how nervous he was about interviewing the president. Oh, geez. But good on him because what he did,  it's funny, the same day I was in LA at the same time to do the Nerdist podcast, and I had to  apologize to Chris Hardwick. I said, I'm sorry, Mark Maron got the president. You got me.  You kind of get the short end of the stick on this one, Chris. But Chris pointed out, he said,  this was before we'd heard what they talked about. He said, you know, he's going to make  it personal. It won't be about politics. It'll it'll be about, you know, Mark really likes to  talk to people about themselves. And I think that that's it's kind of the president's senior

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  year, isn't it? He's almost done. It's his. Well, that's why the name of the podcast is so perfect  because this is his WTF year. Right. I wish he would. I wish he would do a WTF and like get

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  rid of guns. I wouldn't be surprised if on the way out, he does a few less than politic things. But  remember, he's still the standard bearer for the party, which means he has to be careful because  the six he doesn't he doesn't want to screw it up for the Democrats. It's not so much the presidency,  it's the House. The Senate. Yeah. But how do we get into a political podcast? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah,  that. So how is that? What is the status of your project? Fire invite, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I look it up and it says, we're still deciding your status. What do you mean deciding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is like this? We're working on your status. So I'm going to enter in. So here's what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You go to you. Where what's where down to the bottom of that, there's a link that you can click

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  through. I hate pages where they OK, there we go. There's my invites. We're still determining your

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  status. Yeah, that's what I got, too. So it's not really a status. Now it isn't. It's not very helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, dear. But I will say at least they're, you know, it'll I'm sure it will take a few days before  they start to give info. But it's nice that they're at least letting you know how things  stand now. Yeah, sort of. Or will someday someday at some point in the future. You will know how you  how you stand. Are you using fire, Matt? Well, now that it's launched, I can tell you that I  have been testing fire and I really enjoy it. The the Wi-Fi calling is really good because the audio  you'll have the Nexus six on Wi-Fi and you don't need to use your cell phone. And it's that's been  really, really nice. So I know a few of the people that work on it. So I'm a little biased,  but I've got pretty good expectations for it. I think it'll go well. I've been excited about

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this. Chris Michael in our chat room says he's actually watching right now on fi.  So it's Wi-Fi calling its T-Mobile and Sprint, a weird kind of dual SIM. It will choose the  best of the three Wi-Fi T-Mobile or Sprint and use that for your data as well as your phone calls.  It's not necessarily price competitive. In fact, it seems like it's pretty close to the same price

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  as T-Mobile would be. Well, and I think starting with Nexus six, you know, it's pretty smart  because they're like, OK, let's start with just known hardware. Right. You know, this gives them  a chance to work all the kinks out, seal the corner cases, test out the billing and the statements.  And then after that, you know, who knows which direction they'll go. Maybe they'll support  more different hardware. Maybe they'll, you know, be able to make deals with other carriers. But  I like the fact that it's a per a flat amount per gigabyte. And then if you don't use it all,  they'll refund you back what you don't use. That's kind of nice. That's better than anybody else does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you pay for just what you use no more or less. That's kind of what Ting did that. One of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  our advertisers. Ting did that. Karma. I'm still waiting for my Karma. They're finally passing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  tests, but they're supposed to come soon. That's the Wi-Fi device. Yeah. Yeah. So there's a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of pressure to get away from this, this horrible rip you off for things you don't use. There was a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  rumor and I have yet to see it actually disproved that the people who got the early invites to Fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  were all people who did not own Nexus sixes. Yeah. I don't, I don't know the truth. I can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  confirm or deny that. I think that's unlikely, but I do know that those of us like me and Jeff  and I presume you too, Jason Howell, who are holders, owners, legitimate owners of Nexus sixes  have not yet received our invite. And the several people I've talked to who have been using Google  Fi had to buy Nexus sixes. Chris, did you have to buy a Nexus six to Chris Michael in the chat room  to, to, to use Fi? He said, um, others round up to a gig. Fi does fractional data, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, Chris Michael had to buy it. I mean, totally unscientific, unscientific in every regard.  But I swear everyone that I hear that has it did not have a Nexus six and bought one for five.  Weird. So I'm just saying it seems that way. It's hard to prove it, but there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I just want to say this and I'm not looking for special things. I'm looking for  nothing free, but it is kind of, I was talking to a friend of mine the other day and he said, what,  you don't have it. You're on the show every week. No, you know, one would think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but I've been told in no uncertain terms by numbers of people that we're not going to give  it to you in early testing. You'll just pan it. You know, they're worried that those of us who  have a bully pulpit, if we have a bad experience, we could really ruin it for them. Yeah, but that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not very googly. I think, I think Google actually does care about, you know, hearing what doesn't  work and making it better. And I think they're believable in that. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Cause we  were sophisticated enough to know that this is early. The reason they're doing it on one phone  is, is you just said, Matt, to work the kinks out. There are, it's a company that unlike Detroit or  something like that, it's a company that, that acknowledges kinks. That's the whole point. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Matt, doesn't it, I don't know, maybe you know, but doesn't it, it seems to me if you're going to use  two different carriers, that, that is going to require something special on the phone or in the  OS. That is not, that is not something most phones can take a single SIM for two carriers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  True. Well, and just to have, right, just to have the radio where you can have all of the bands that  are necessary. I mean, that alone, you know, is a big restriction, I would think. So yeah, it does  make sense that they're, you know, over time, more phones will support more bands and we're getting  closer to true world phones and all these sorts of things. But you know, I think starting with a known  set of hardware that they can sort of help on any part of the stack that goes wrong does make sense.  But I'd love to see more people be able to get by quicker. I suspect another reason might be that  they want to make sure they, I think they want to have really good support. And so if you roll it  out too quickly, then you can't bring it up and ramp up and train all the support people to be the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  level of quality that you need quickly enough. Exactly. Exactly. So you can find out if, if you,  what your status is, which is, I mean, actually, you already probably know. But if you want to get  official confirmation at fi.google.com slash sign up, I guess question mark u equals one, I bet you  don't need that. Let's just take that off. And yeah, if you just go to fi.google.com slash sign up,  it will let you know if you've already signed up. If you haven't, it'll give you a chance to  sign up and then it'll say, we're still determining your status. Check back.  I was kind of hoping to get it before I left the states just to see how it would work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was so happy I got an email from Asus saying, would you like to test the Asus flip,  which I've been waiting for. I actually once a week I searched and say, is it for sale yet?  And then I saw the stuff saying it's for sale yet. Then they sent me an email. Oh yeah. And it was,  we'll send it to you on loan, but you can keep it. So I write back and I say, well, no, I'm a  journalist. I want to buy one, but I'm happy to buy one early. I really want to get my hands on  this. This is great. And they come back and they say, well, can you guarantee you're right about  it? I said, no, I'm a journalist. You were on the wrong list. You were on the educational list,  which I guess education is no, no, we have a press list too. And yes, you can buy it. So I can't wait  to get it. But yeah, I just want to try these things early. By the way, some of our chat room,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  including Dr. Mom go in there and they get, expect your invite in three to four weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So some people, some people do have it concrete days coming. And so I just sent an email to one  of the people I know on fi and said, is there any way to speed up the invites for Leo Laporte,  Jeff Jarvis, Jason Howell? So we'll see whether, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we're going to find out whether you've lost your clout and his leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. My Google mojo might be, you know, pretty much the cloud test, cloud test,  cloud test.  They might be on vacation, who knows, but I at least asked, it can't hurt to ask. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you, Matt. You're really, you're really great.  Let's see, what should we talk about? Hey, by the way, thank you, Google. Thanks to you,  the new Twitter website is secure. Google announced a little while ago that they would  bump your ranking a little bit if you were an SSL secured website. And even though there's really  not much reason that Twitch should be SSL, there's not a whole lot of reason not to be either. I mean,  except for the cost of the search.  Which is the point, I think, just making a standard.  Yeah. And some people, when I mentioned this said, you know, you could make a case that somebody  could do a man in the middle on Twitter. And then when they downloaded, let's say what they thought  was a podcast, it'd actually be downloading some malicious software. So I guess any site where you  you're actually going to use that site to download something probably should be secure.  Including, I mean, the contents of the site, I guess.  But the other thing that Twitter was going to, yes, show the page just because we spent so much  money on it. OK. The other thing, let's look at that site again one more time. Just yeah,  well, that looks good, doesn't it? The other thing Google was doing was the mobile Gettin  thing. And there's some some results in on the results of mobile Gettin. Adweek has some numbers.  The mobile Gettin challenge was to get websites to upgrade to a mobile responsive format. Yes,  we are responsive as well. I don't think you really need Google's incentive to do that. I just looked  at our stats and I saw that there's a lot of slow bozos. I know. But if you look at your analytics,  which we did, more than half of people coming to the site came in on a tablet or mobile phone.  So if more than half your users are on small screens, you better well make your site responsive,  regardless of what Google's index is going to do. But this certainly helps. Recent study of more  than one thousand important e-commerce keywords by MoveWeb, the percentage of mobile-friendly  results in the top keyword position was 83 percent. I'm looking at the top ten positions on page one  as a whole, 77 percent mobile-friendly. So I don't know if that's an improvement.  That's the problem. Yeah, we don't know the delta. Yeah, but I would expect the world is moving to  mobile-friendly because remember we did it the old way we did it was you'd have two sites. In fact,  I still do this on leoville.com, my blog, because I'm lazy and it's a WordPress blog. I have two  templates and if WordPress senses you coming in on a mobile, it'll give you the mobile version,  which is kind of a dopey way to do it. But that's the old way of doing it. Remember WAP? Oh man,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah. What does that stand for? Wireless access protocol. I thought. Yeah, no, but there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  WAP browser. Oh yeah, you're right. Wireless application protocol. You're right. It was a  standard for accessing information. No, but there was a WAP browser is a browser for mobile devices  and then you would you would make your your website WAP compatible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, remember that? For years, Google's mobile stuff was entirely half time from one engineer.  I remember talking to this engineer and she was like, you know, there's just not a lot of  of mobile usage. So that's all the staffing we read we need right now. So one half man year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love the idea that she's sitting off like in an island on the Hebrides and then the next day

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  she's queen. Yeah, I am now in charge. One half woman year. Yeah, but it's kind of crazy. Like  before I go on leave, we'd go and evaluate changes that we were going to make on Google site  and we had to make a conscious effort to say mobile first. And so, you know, the people in  charge of the UI would say, don't show me what it looks like on a desktop first. Show me what it  looks like on a phone or a tablet and then later we'll look at what it looks like on a desktop.  Yes, you have to you have to make that shift because there's so many people coming on mobile

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  devices now. I think our site actually looks better on mobile to be honest with you. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but the problem with the problem with talking about about being mobile compatible is that it  doesn't change enough. It still looks like it's a web page, a portal thing, a content thing,  and make it work small as opposed to what I've argued is that what Google and Facebook understand  is that mobile is a context generator, a signal generator for different use cases. And so just  taking the thing you already do and making it fit on a small screen misses the whole point of no,  I want to I want to I want to stream or I want a quick update or or I got an hour to kill.  You let me let me immerse in something. These are different use cases for content and we're  not thinking that way at all in our in our business and media. By the way, Chris sent us a link

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to his Google Fi Nexus 6 and I guess you get a free external battery when you sign up for five.  So his Nexus 6 is connected to the batteries watching the show while he chats.  Humble brag. Thank you, Chris. Chris. I like it. Show off, Chris. I like it. By the way, this is  this is how nice it is with Google Photos. You could just take a picture, get a link  and send it to somebody. And that's what he did. Oh, so somebody Mark Pagan

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just said that he had a before and after nearly 50 percent of non-mobile from the URLs dropped in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  rank. I'll put this on there. Oh, they oh, so they went down because they were not mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so I just put it in the chat on the wow. Thank you, Mark. Wow. So this mobile  for mobile getting actually happened. Sorry for mangling your name, Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's good. Well, yeah. So mobile getting that's Eric Inge. He's a pretty well-known guy in the  SEO space. And as I understand, and I'm nicely unplugged from SEO these days, for mobile getting,  they had to bake stuff into the index. So a lot of the stuff, you know, you can just flip a switch  and you can turn it on within hours. I might be mistaken, but I think for mobile getting,  man, that's a terrible name for the mobile ranking change. They had to sort of, you know,  make the determination, bake that into the index. And then at that point, they can start to do the  ranking changes. So sometimes those can take, you know, 10 days to roll out if you're making new

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  stuff into the index, for example. Yeah. This is a, this is a big deal.  And it shows you how much power Google can wield. I mean, we was part of the consideration of why  we're doing HTTPS, part of the consideration of why we made it mobile friendly. I mean,  it was in our best interest to do both anyway. But that's it. We tried to support only stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that would be a good idea anyway. But these sort of policy changes generate a lot of hot debate.  For example, the story just came out this week about RevengeBorn and how Google will take it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  out of the index. I don't know if you heard Twitter on Sunday, but we had a very good debate about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that. Oh, okay. No, I haven't heard that one. I'll tell you my position on this. And it's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know, when you use RevengeBorn, it's like using ChildBorn. It's a non-controversial thing.  Everybody thinks it's a bad idea. So I understand that nobody's going to say, oh, well, you know,  we should promote RevengeBorn. That's not, but what I do, I am of the opinion that, and this is  kind of a very purist point of view, and I'd love to hear what you think about it, Matt,  if the goal of a search engine, which I think it should be, is to reflect the web as it is,  then it should do that purely algorithmically and without editorializing about some kinds of content.  And if you don't like RevengeBorn and no one's saying it's a good thing or ChildBorn or anything  else, you should go to the source of it and shut that down. For Google to change the search results  puts Google in a position as an arbiter of what's acceptable and not acceptable.  And I think that's a risky thing. Now, Ben Thompson, very smart guy from Stratecary,  argued the opposite. And I thought it was a good discussion. But I'd love to hear what you think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's certainly true. There's that. And then there's the other aspect of it,  which is the slippery slope, which is if you're willing to take action on RevengeBorn, then why  don't you take action on this? You know, why do you show the Confederate flag?  Right. I should not be able to search for the Confederate flag.  Now what do you say? Right. Right. So I, you know, when I worked on SafeSearch,  we deliberately tried to make it only for pornographic content or non-family safe content.  And when someone wanted to add another category, I would kind of lead them down this garden path of,  like, well, what about bomb making? What about anarchy? What about pro-anorexia? What about  wiccans? What about, you know, and it's interesting because after a few categories, people realize,  oh, yeah, okay, now I can see the slippery slope in front of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, furthermore, SafeSearch is a checkbox. So I can decide not to use it. And I think putting that  explicitly in the hands of the user is a great idea because the user can then opt in to see the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  whole web. Right. But doing it, as you say, editorializing by default, those are the sorts  of policy decisions that are very hotly debated within the company and between the search group  and the legal group. And, you know, what are the right precedents to set versus, of course, no one  wants anyone to be subject to sort of objectionable content in this case. So there was a lot of  internal debate. But what do you think about- Would you say it's fair? This is actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we don't have to go back through that debate. But what is the goal of Google? I mean, the original  goal was to organize all the world's information. Make it universally accessible and useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Accessible. I knew you couldn't leave that not finished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but that is a laudable goal. And I would underscore all the world's information there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it's fun because we tend to be on the free speech absolutist side of things. I think  Twitter has carved out a niche niche, whatever you want to say, even a little more that they say  we're the free speech wing of the free speech party or something like that. And I think the  internet lends itself to that compared to, you know, Western Union or telecom carriers or that  sort of thing. But yeah, it's also interesting to see the impact on people's lives and how do  you balance those two different things is not an easy decision to make. Well, very relevant to this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  discussion is David Drummond in Cannes just basically started war, Google war on ISIS  and drew a line and said no to that kind of extremist video. That's another interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  use case. Well, and it leads to the right to be forgotten, frankly, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does. You know, and also and look at the other end of it. Look at Facebook. Facebook says,  no nude pictures period. We don't care if your breastfeed we don't care if it's newsworthy.  No nude. Put it up in an instant article. Chris Cox said, can we take it down? No nudity. That's  our rule. That's what we do. No nudity. I'm not wild about that, but at least it's a consistent  rule. And I get it. And they're saying here's our rule. And if you're a news organization,  or if you're a club, or if you're a person, you have to accede to our rule. And that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. But there's also Google is closer to library. You know, Facebook is more like a  nightclub where they try to make an environment that's conducive to what they want. And that's  fine. Right. Like people need a place to hang out and a place to talk about things. But at least  at Google, we tend to want to be a reflection of the web as much as possible. So yeah, these

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  changes tend to be few and far between. You're right, Matt. But the issue now that's causing  discussion is that with instant articles, with basically Facebook turning into a place where  a publisher frankly could get rid of their backend, their CMS, their technology department,  say, you know, what the heck, let's just put everything on Facebook. We'll get 100% of the  revenue we sell, 70% of what they sell. There's audience there. We don't have to be in the  audience business. Let's do it. Then the fear is my friendly competitive colleague at Columbia,  Emily Bell says, Whoa, then Facebook and Twitter become the press. And Facebook recognizes this as  an issue. And it's not part of Facebook's mission right now to have an informed public. But Facebook  could be very soon the most important distributor of news in the world. What position does that  put them in, in terms of any obligation they then have? And I don't say that I have the answer or  that they have the answer yet. All I say about this is this is a good and important discussion  to have. Because once these platforms become distributors, do they take on whether they choose

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to or not, some responsibility? What do you think? Well, and then, well, the notion that right to be  forgotten, you know, which, which in some sense is the terminal case in a lot of these sorts of  situations is really interesting because you see France and Canada sort of making the claim that  you should do these sorts of removals worldwide. And then what do you do when you get, you know,  China, Russia, whatever kind of country is asking for some of the things and you talked about this  last week with Danny Sullivan, but it's, you know, Google, it's weird because it's people think it's  an attack against Google in some cases, but in many ways, it's an attack against the internet  to say we want to have a splinter net, we want to have an internet divided by country. And I don't,  a lot of people I think identify more as citizens of the internet than, you know, than that strongly  with, you know, the pride of their particular country, which is a little interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're gonna take a break when we come back. Is Google listening to you? Apparently it is.  And some people aren't happy about that. This week at Google, Matt Cutts is here. Great to have you,  Matt, Jeff Jarvis, and all of you in the chat room. And by the way, I guess it was Mark Trafagan who  did that study. Thank you for pronouncing that properly. Well, I don't know, Mark, Mark can  correct me if I'm wrong, but they did that study of the mobile GEDN results. And so we want to give  heat. It's nice of him to come into the chat room and give us that link. And we want to mention  the website, which is I've lost it. Was it still Stone Temple? Stone Temple, I think. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Mark's pretty active on Google Plus too. Or social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stone Temple Consulting Digital Marketing Excellence. And I think one of those two guys  is probably Mark. Not sure. But there you go. We're gonna take a little break and talk about  my mattress. You got the video of me bouncing on my mattress? I love my mattress. My Casper mattress.  You would think it'd be crazy talk if somebody said, hey, we're going to sell mattresses on the  internet. First of all, how are you going to ship them? Well, it turns out Casper's figured out a  way to take that incredible American-made premium mattress with latex and memory foam, put it in a  little box. There's a Tyvek sleeve and they give you a little opener to open it up and boom,  the mattress, as you can see, inflates. And it's beautiful. It's great. And by the way, you might  say, oh, is it going to smell like foam rubber or late? No, no, it's beautiful. I don't know  what they how they do it, but it's incredible. You get an amazing mattress. So there's problem  number one solved by technology. Problem two is how do you know if a mattress is going to suit you?  I mean, you buy a mattress online, don't you have to try before you buy? Well, I think the folks at  Casper would say, and I would agree that going to a mattress store and lying on a mattress in  full daylight in front of a salesperson for five minutes is not really the way to find out whether  a mattress is good or not. In fact, I have bought more than a few mattresses I didn't like once I  got them home. You don't have to worry about that with Casper because you have 100 nights to try it  and you will get free delivery and painless returns, absolutely free, no cost to you.  If at any time in that first 100 nights you say, you know, it's not for me. So there's literally no  risk to you. And it's so easy to buy and so affordable to these are premium mattresses  that started $500 for a twin. In fact, I'm going to make it even better with a $50 discount when  you go to casper.com, c-a-s-p-e-r.com slash twig and use our promo code twig, long lasting comfort  and support. Guaranteed, I think they said guaranteed for 10 years, right? And man, is it  comfortable. We liked it so much we got one for Henry and then Lisa's sister came and stole our mattress  which is all right. It was, I can't remember why there was a good reason.  So we're going to get another, I love it, you will too, casper.com slash twig, use the promo code twig  for $50 off. It's a bed that loves you back and your back will love Casper.  So I don't know where to start on this one. This comes from fullstack.info blog post.  Not okay, Google, not okay. And actually Google responded to this earlier yesterday.  So here's the deal.  Let's be clear. Okay, go ahead.  So as you know, if you're using Chrome and you go to the Google search page, let's do it,  I can now talk to my browser. I can say, okay Google, and it's listening and will respond.  I said, I can say, I don't know, maybe it's not turned on. And that's one thing, one point to make  is that you do have to opt into that. There's a checkbox to opt into that. Well, it turns out  open source advocates noted that this hot wording component was actually being shipped with Chromium,  the open source version of Chrome, as a binary prepackaged. So you couldn't look at the code,  you couldn't see what it was doing. Google's response to that issue when it was filed as a  bug report is, yes, we download the hot word module on startup, but it's not activated  unless you opt in. And Google doesn't control Chromium, right? Right. The code for activation  is built into Chromium itself. But it isn't really, it is kind of not done to put a binary blob,  especially a binary blob that can listen to you into open source software. So after a little bit  of a furore, Google yesterday, you're laughing at the word furore, kerfuffle? Kerfuffle.  Google announced that that binary component is being removed from Chromium. It's not open source.  It doesn't belong in the open source browser. So resolved. Yeah, and much, and much a do over,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not much, I would argue. Oh my God, Google's listening to you. And you know you're going to  see this on stupid reports on the evening news. And it just doesn't help the techno panic issue.  Just wrap your computer in tin foil and everything will be okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As you know, in order to use this, Google has to send your sound back to the Google  store to analyze it. They don't do it locally. That's true of, as far as I know, almost every  speech program, you know, Siri does it. Google Now, Siri, Cortana. I mean, that's how they work  because nobody had, you know, Microsoft's Kinect, well actually Kinect has a few simple commands,  I think that don't get sent back. I think Google does too, doesn't it Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the voice recognition, if it's offline does work. It's just not as good as if it can send it  to the cloud. But I think it's a fair point. Like if you're using Debian, you want to be able to  compile everything from the source code to know you're clean and you're going to check the  cryptographic signatures and everything. So, you know, fair point, good feedback. I'm really glad  that Google made the change because, you know, if you're the kind of person who wants to use  Chromium and an open source instead of Chrome because, you know, you want to compile it all,  then yeah, you don't want a binary blob on your device. So it took Google a little while long  to make that decision. I mean, I think it took me a little bit longer than I'd like to reach the  right decision, but I'm really glad that within a relatively short period of time, they made that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  call. Now what if I'm using Debian and I want it? Can I download the blob? I think so. I think you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  can. Well, I'm not sure. I don't know how it'll be after this change, but you would hope so. I'm not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sure though. Now you'll have to have a note from your parents saying it's okay to use it. It would  like to use it. I like okay Google, personally. Fair point, Matt, about that. But it's the  kerfuffle around it. It's the conspiracy theories around it. Oh my God, Google's trying to listen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to you. That's what just... Well, yeah, and actually too, to Ofer Zeleg's credit,  even though he does link to that privacy post, he doesn't actually go crazy about it. He says,  So Rick Falkenviggen did it. Yeah, Rick did. But this is appropriate to raise this issue.  Debian should be open source. And this is an unknown kind of blob that actually has the ability  to listen in. That shouldn't be part of the open source. And Google did exactly the right thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  after a few days of kerfuffle. The interesting thing is even after that mistake, that will now  be a bullet point that gets used against Google forever and ever. And I think that's probably Jeff's  point. And that's true. I have a mental image of kerfuffle is down here. Brujaha is one notch up.  It was an iPhone announcement level, but Brujaha I'd give it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's definitely not an antenna gate. It's a clusterf, which is up here.  We need a little thermometer or something so we can see, we can gauge the amount of  of upset going on. Yeah, the righteous indignation meter or rim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There ought to be something on like you could just mine Twitter and figure out  people are 7.9 annoyed about this thing versus only 2.7 annoyed about that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's sentiment analysis on the people are doing. That's kind of an interesting subject, actually.  I'm going to figure out what people are talking about.  I'm going to, there's so many stories in here. Jeff, do you have one that you want to bring up?  Oh, jeez. There's just, there's just, I know. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, talk about open containers. Go ahead. Where was that? I missed that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about the pictures? Do you want to do the inception?  I thought you might have put that in there. I really like this. It's really cool.  Thank you, Matt, for putting this in here. This was from the Google research. Oh, Jason,  Google research blog. It's talking about neural networks. Neural networks are a form of artificial  intelligence, computer software that learns the way you teach it is just feed it stuff,  feed it lots of stuff. And in this case, these neural neural networks, which are attempting to  simulate the human brain is being fed images. And actually, this is quite a good conversation of how  this works. Image classification, speech recognition are two very big areas where neural  networks are being used to try to get better at this. And there's some really cool images in here  of, I don't know, what are these, Matt? Would you explain what I'm looking at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you basically try to train a neural network, a deep neural network to recognize  specific things, whether it be ants or antelopes or dumbbells. And then you can turn it on its  head and have the network sort of amplify things or given one image, kind of take that and sort  of build on it. And then it becomes self-reinforcing. So you're looking for the platonic ideal of fork  or ant or parachute or banana. And then you could feed it back into itself. And then once it sees a  little bit of a fork, it turns it into more of a fork. And so before you know it, you get this  macro level structure like a dog on one end and a fish on the other end. It actually looks like an  object, you know, because it could be plausible. And it's funny because a lot of people on Google  are reading the comments on Reddit and Reddit was sort of saying, this is exactly what acid looks

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like, man. Well, there's something to be said. It's not merely a stoner talk in there. That's  kind of what happens when your brain doesn't organize information very well because it's  drugged. Well, that's what the neural network kind of is like. This is your Google. This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  your Google on drugs. Yeah. So there might be actually some learnings about how the visual  cortex works. Yeah. How it processes stuff, you know, together with LSD or whatever. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  notice, by the way, these are images of dumbbells. It seems like no dumbbell is complete if you look  closely without a muscular arm. Yeah. So there's dumbbells, but there's also arms in here. And  when the computer sees those two linked, it says dumbbell. It might be hard to see a dumbbell

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  without an arm holding it though. Right. And it only knows what it sees. And so if it never  sees a dumbbell without an arm, it's like, well, it's got to be something else. They go together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. This is beautiful. This does look like you're on acid. This is wildebeest on acid,  apparently. Wow. That is quite gorgeous. The Seurat paintings are pretty cool. Isn't that  amazing? So George Seurat was a pointillist. It's all about pixels. Yeah. Wow. Is that neat?  I don't know. I don't know if there's anything to be learned from that. Here's the sky.  So these are the representations internally of the neural network. Here's that dog snail thing you  were talking about. Wow. Oh man. Who needs drugs, man? This is very Van Gogh. Yeah, totally Van Gogh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think there is something to be said of, you know, if a brain is not doing a good job of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  organizing the information in the brain, it probably does look a lot like a neural network,  a very naive understanding. This is the Admiral dog, the pig snail, the camel bird and the dog fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. So I guess it also shows a little bit, you know, deep neural networks, they're going to be  popping up everywhere for, you know, I think maybe Facebook did something where you can give it a  caption and it will generate an image to match that. So, you know, there's neural networks are  going to show up in all kinds of places, you know, in the next five years, not in the next 50 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this what they're using for face recognition, for instance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Google brain and the deep neural network stuff is used, I believe, but this might be a  sub part, a different, you know, branch of that. So. Right. That was really the lesson to me from

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  IOMAT is that is that Google photos could only be done by Google because it has the kind of  and Facebook probably, but it has that kind of deep neural network computing power at scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in fact, Facebook's getting in a little bit of hot water because they've released a  interesting new product, which actually I like a lot called moments, which does face recognition  on all the photos you've ever uploaded to Facebook and then says suggests maybe some people you'd  like to share that with, which is which is pretty wild because it's recognizing not only  recognize the face, but recognize the connections inherent. And yet it's incredibly useful. These  are pictures I took of a friend's niece. They all popped up together because of course they're all  related. And it said, who would you like to share this with? It didn't know that it was Johnny's  niece. But of course, it made it much easier for me to share those. And I did, in fact, share those.  But it did recognize and this is what's wild. They recognize Lisa in these pictures in which  she's wearing a jeweler's loop and I mean, she's wearing a helmet. And yet it knew each one of  these. I mean, how did it know that was Lisa? Apparently, Facebook says that they can recognize

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  people with 83% accuracy, even if their face is obscured or there's hair. I'll vouch for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, you know, it recognized, I guess, her arms, her hands. I don't know. It's amazing. Yeah. Yeah.  So and I think that this must be something that got a problem that got solved in the last few

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  years. And then that's why you know, there's so much more that could be done with facial recognition.  Both Google and Facebook are scared to death to show their holding back. And I think that's a  pity because I got examples I always use is what can we do publicly about missing children and  Alzheimer's patients, not to mention terrorists and criminals and connections with people and  relatives and all kinds of neat things. But oh, it's going to freak people out. Creepy line. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I, you know, I've just kind of I've I've embraced Google at this point. I've given up  fighting. I love I love you, Google. There really is something to be say that, you know,  that that old joke I for one accept our new overlords. There's a there is at some point  where you go just is just so cool and so useful and so valuable that I'm not going to worry about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the privacy concern. There was a slash dot thread in like 2001, where we rolled out something and  the slash dot commenter was like, soon you'll take your Google to the Google in your Google and  then you'll Google on your Google. In 2001, he was right. And your car will be a Google car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it was like, see, that's it. I don't mind. And the problem is, and I guess you label this  techno panic, Jeff, the problem is you can always come up with doomsday scenarios around anything.  So it's easy to say, oh, well, you know, what's next is the police are going to use that they  probably already are uses to recognize faces on the street and in crowds. And they're going to,  you know, they're going to be able to criminalize activity and say, we have we know you were in this  crowd. Yeah, you can always create these doomsday scenarios. But does that mean you shouldn't do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if we if we if we manage life to the worst things that could happen, we'll live in caves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go. Thank you. That's exactly pretty dangerous to me, Jeff. I think we actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  actually, yes. Bears get in there. I don't want to. They're scared of games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought the article about Google bringing fast Wi-Fi to cities is an interesting one,  Leo, because it's kind of a similar thing. Like Wi-Fi could be incredibly useful, but I can see  where people who don't like or don't trust Google might be. Aha, here's another brick in the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your great minds think alike, because exactly where I was going with this.  This is the sidewalks lab startup that Google was talking about to make cities better.  And their first project is to bring free fast Wi-Fi to cities around the world. Now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what could be wrong with that? Well, Leo, was it last week when you were talking about the announcement  of sidewalk labs and you were saying, this is so generic, I could take, you know,  Twitter and insert my name and it would be the exact same announcement. So maybe.  Now we know what they're up to. Yeah. Yeah. They were listening and like,  OK, we got to announce more concrete stuff so that they know what's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it was one of those do good things where, oh, yeah, that's a great idea. But let's see what  you plan. What do you think of? And this is a great one. So they're planning. This is from  Bloomberg Business Week.  Boy, are they derelict. Yeah.  And this is so this is ad supported.  In fact, it could bring the city half a billion dollars in ad revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. One thing I hope is so we now have Wi-Fi in scattered subway stops. So I just today I  was doing this. I wanted to. In fact, today I was rushing to get here. I got here at 10 minutes to  spare. Thank you. So I downloaded the Twig rundown, wanted to download it onto my tablet.  Right. But my tablet doesn't. So I had to use the Wi-Fi. But you have to do that stupid thing.  Like you have to sign on and say, no, I put up dirty pictures. And so it just takes right.  You're trying to catch us up. No, no, there were the Wi-Fi. Oh, no. You know, and we've got to come  up. I've said this before. We've got to come up with a universal way that I just say, OK, so as  soon as I'm near that phone booth and I can go on the Wi-Fi, it just does it smoothly. This whole  sign on McGill is a pain. They don't have to do that. I don't know. I don't know yet. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that would be a fantastic thing to offer because how many times have you ever read what  the hotel hotspot Wi-Fi says before you click your terms of service? But, you know, I think  75 percent of people would be like, I agree not to do anything criminal or the or maybe just  universally agree to these 10 principles, you know, harass anybody. And then you can just get  on the Wi-Fi without any trouble at all. That would be wonderful. So here's what these look

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like. This is from Fast Company, an Instagram shot of these new booths. This is this is the  Link NYC Wi-Fi access point. I'm in New York. Yeah. Yeah. Doesn't that look cool? Can you zoom  in a little bit on that, Jason? Cool. Yeah. So there's obviously some sort of interface in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  front there, maps, that kind of thing. And people are going to be standing there for half an hour

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  charging their phones. Well, you know, if you need to make a call, just the fact that you go  somewhere and plug in the phone and make that call, you don't need to stand there and charge it,  but just be able to make that call is worth it. Oh, I know. I agree with that, especially with

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with Google Fi. It'll switch over to the Wi-Fi. Right. So that's well, and a lot of people,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know, might have trouble getting Internet in their home. And so if you're if you have a  low income person who would normally go to the library and you can just go down to the nearest

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  lamp post or something, that would be wonderful. This is a really good. So you're saying, Jeff,  that there's still a lot of old phone booths. They're not not booth booths. They're the kind

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of, you know, the hoods, head to knee size. Right. But they're you know, people have done bad things  in them. And most of them are they're not they're not run by the phone company anymore. They're  run by an independent company that, you know, is is is actually, I think, using wireless  and just charging you. But it's rare you find a phone in them. They're really there. They're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  still just looking at there. These are not unattractive to. I mean, I know that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  good thing is it'll. But you know what's going to happen? Graffiti has not been applied yet.  A, we're going to graffiti B, within six months, we're going to have stories about  all of the bacteria on the touch screen. Don't touch it. Use a glove if you're going to.  And then we're going to have you're going to be able to walk by and say, OK, Google,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's listening to all of New York. Yeah, that's right. Listen to OK, phone booth. Yeah.  This is good looking, though, I got to say. And they've even mounted a little light in the

Transcript:  sidewalk to light it up. That's pretty. The company is from Dan Doctorov, who was  former deputy mayor under the mayor, head of Bloomberg, the business, very smart guy,  really cares about cities, loves New York. And I think I think neat things will come out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is the kind of thing to you benefit from an urban aggregation of people.  You can you can you can do stuff like this. And as you heard, it could make half a billion dollars  a year in ad revenue just because there's so many people in New York City. You're not going to put  that in Montana. Well, that's pretty. You've got balloons and you know, that's yeah, there's other  things for that. That's right. That's right. Google has launched a news lab to help journalists.  I was wondering what you thought of. I can tell you about that. Well, in fact, I visited right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  after I was up the last time in Petaluma, I went down and visited the news lab team, Steve Grove,  ex YouTube and ex Google Plus. It's a great team of some great people. Olivia Ma, there's Steve  right there. Daniel Seberg, Simon Rogers. They're all really great people. Now, this is part of what  I see is the leapfrogging of Google and Facebook trying to make nice with publishers because  publishers can be mean to them in Europe. Google started the digital news initiative with eight  publishers. They're, I think, about to see Sundar and we'll see whether this moves to the product  side. Facebook did instant articles and I just saw a story up says that's finally going to take off  beyond the test articles. Then Google comes back with digital news lab. Now, this is not, you know,  news lab may be a bit of a misnomer. It develops some stuff. It did some new things on trending.  It'll do things that are generally helpful. The aim of this is not to reinvent news and fix the news

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  industry. It's more to help the news industry. But imagine if you're not an official, you know,  reporter working for a major metropolitan daily, but in fact, just somebody who's interested in  doing some digging. I mean, there's a lot of information. There's good stuff here. They have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  smart people. Simon Rogers was a data viz guy at The Guardian who then went to Twitter and got the  hell out and is now at Google and is doing neat things there. And that's great. But this is,  this is the one thing I want to keep pushing Google on though, is that this is an initiative  of marketing and corporate relations with media companies, which is good. I'm all for it. It's  wonderful. I still want to push farther than say that Google needs to take news into its heart  in its product side. I'm sure Matt can confirm if it ain't product, it ain't nothing at Google.  And so that's what I want to see next is how not that Google is doing nice things for the industry,  which is wonderful, but how do we find true mutual interest? Google wants to organize the  world's knowledge and make it universally accessible, etc. etc. News and an informed  society are part of that mission. How does that become part of the heart of what Google does?  So this is a good start, but I think there's a quantum leap that comes when it gets into

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the product side of Google. Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of fun things you can do. I love the Google  Trend Searches you can do. It's beautiful stuff. Yeah. People, you know, truth is anybody who's  watching should just dig into this. g.co slash news lab. They also announced they're working

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with MatterVC, which is a incubator accelerator for media startups. What else are they doing?  They're going to do training and other things. They had a launch party in the great YouTube space  in New York two nights ago. So I'm delighted this is here, but being greedy and desperate  news people, I'll say, okay, what have you done for me lately? Yeah. Pushed for more. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could ask for Google to fight on your behalf when the government comes knocking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and wants to subpoena information. Boy, is that a great and amazing story. Awful story,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but amazing story. Let's take a break. We'll tell that story when we come back. Jeff Jarvis,  Matt Cutts, Leo Laporte. This Week in Google is on the air.

What is the story you started?  But I'm not sure where you're going with that one. Jeff Jarvis explained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matt, you were going to start to explain. Maybe Matt should explain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IO error. I'm happy to start. Yeah. And Jason, I just pasted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Matt, you're sinking into your lower third. So can you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's melting. He's melting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apologies about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is your laptop in your lap actually?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm sort of bracing it on my knee. I don't have any furniture in this room.  So there's an interesting story. Basically, I'll try to summarize and please no one sue me and no  one at Google get angry if I do it wrong. But the US government came to Google and said,  we would like data on Jacob Applebaum, IO errors, data, his Gmail and maybe other stuff. But the  Gmail is the stuff that I read about. And Google tried to fight it. And along the way, we also,  Google got a gag order that said we're not allowed to discuss it with anyone. And so now  something like five years later, we're finally able to provide more information. So First Look  published a 306 page legal document that's basically talking about all the steps that  Google tried to take to protect Jacob's data. And of course, Jacob wasn't able to be apprised of the  progress of that and what worked and didn't work when we fought that case in court. So the story  finding link was interesting because I think Jacob sort of sent, you know, he was live tweeting it as  he was reading this. It's amazing. Yeah. So he's, you know, there's one tweet where he's like,  you know, I feel like I should send flowers to Google's legal team. They must have spent

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hundreds of thousand dollars on this case alone. I have to say using Gmail has been the best legal  services investment I've ever made. So Jacob is, this was over, I think over WikiLeaks. Jacob's  done so many things. He's a very well known hacker and activist at IO error on Twitter.  And he was only apprised of this a few days ago, but it's been going on since 2009.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, which sort of to me violates all kinds of due process and the right to know and fight,  against, you know, stuff that's going on against you. But it was funny because I tweeted this and  at least two different people were like, okay, so the moral is never use Google for your email.  And I think, no, that's exactly the wrong answer. The answer is Google will fight very hard, just  like Twitter fought very hard to protect a subscriber's privacy. But what needs to happen is,  you know, a new way of looking at some of these national security letters and these gag orders,  because no one's claiming that as far as I know, that Jacob is, you know, trying to, you know,  do terrorist type things. It's just he was sort of a player in this stuff going on with WikiLeaks.  And you can actually see the government say, when we let Twitter talk about their disclosure,  it generated a lot of problems for us. And so we don't want Google to be able to talk about it.  And that's incredibly frustrating. Google or anybody else ought to be able to fight this stuff  and not be gagged for five years. That's just incredibly excessive and uncalled for, in my

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  opinion. So he's at the he also says, I don't think I'll ever be able to come back to the  United States. Yeah, I did not feel safe. They are clearly after him. Yeah, in huge ways. It's an

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  absurd. It's a document that's very disturbing about democracy. He says he's being politically

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  harassed. And, you know, the government says that unsealing these orders has jeopardized their  investigation. And Jacob says, Yeah, it's hard to politically harass me when it's public.  Just shameful, really shameful. So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know, we need to, there's these weird legal doctrines that date back to like,  ECPA, ECPA, like to the 80s, that say, oh, if you have documents stored on a cloud server,  after 30 or 60 or 90 days, you know, clearly it wasn't private, because in those days,  you would pull down your email. And so if you left your email on the server, it must not have  been private. Anything after 90 days is, is free, free game. So practically no one does it that way.  In a world in which people use Yahoo and Hotmail and Gmail, of course, you should have to get a  full subpoena, you know, and all the legal protection just because it's sitting in the  cloud or on Google servers doesn't mean you don't want it to be protected. Right. From

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  government scrutiny. And as I'm fond of pointing out, this is the problem with writing laws to  technologies, that law was written to the technology, our constitutional right to privacy in our mail  applies only to first class mails and packages through the USPS. Whereas the law should be written  to the principle that says the private communications are private unless, and there's  a condition there about warrants and due process. But that's not the case. And that's why every other  kind of private communication isn't truly private from government. And yes, I do care deeply about  privacy, especially against government, the one entity institution that can use your own life

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  against you. You got to read this article. And it's just, it's just kind of amazing. And hats off to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google for a fighting so hard with no one knowing they could have just let it go. And so, okay,  subpoena, we, we, we acceded to it, though it is in Google's interest not to have this be the  precedent because Google, Google, but as far as Google knew, as far as Google knew, no one would

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ever know that they had done this. And that's the other thing is Google also fought to make it public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, right. Incredible. It's incredible. Anyway, so you're exactly spot on, Jeff, these laws do  matter and writing it so that it, you know, isn't obsolete by technology really matters. So,  and now that I've been a complete bummer, why don't we talk about free music supported by ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I read the story. It's, you know, it's so important. And,  yes. Wow. That's the thing when people talk about kind of imaginary potential threats.  That's one thing, but these things are right in our faces. There's nothing to imagine about this.  And, you know, maybe Google knows a lot about me, but the federal government has,  has prison cells and guns. They have much more harm that they can do. And this is just  shocking and very saddening. All right, free music. Let's go to Google Music, because you know what,  Google Music got better and better. And they announced that they bought songs some time ago,  which I really liked. It was a free service that allowed you to listen to music like kind of a radio  station based on your mood, the time of day, the concierge. And Google bought it and they've now  incorporated that into music, Google All Access Music. You, if you're, you got a free version with  that ad supported if you're not an All Access subscriber, but as far as I'm concerned, this is  just yet another reason to subscribe. And you can see it says it's Wednesday afternoon, play music,  by the way, Google fixed this because for the longest time, this was in the Eastern time zone.  So now it would say it's Wednesday evening, but Google fixed it and they actually know where I am.  Because that's the center of the universe. Yeah, right. For the longest time, it's, you know,  I'd be in the afternoon and say it's, it's Wednesday night, you're going out. So play music for  getting out. What, which do you want gentlemen, getting outside, entering beast mode, boosting  your energy, brand new music or having fun at work. And that's just the beginning, by the way,  there's a lot more focusing and no lyrics. There's also stations based on your songs,  recent activity. I've always liked, I'm feeling lucky radio, which takes the music that I've  listened to and the music I own and makes a radio station for me. But what you want to enter beast  mode? Yeah, let's get into beast mode. Do you want gritty hardcore rap, brutal bass drops,  turnt up anthems? Is that a word turnt? Turnt up anthems, greatest aggro anthems, adrenaline  boosting fight music or I think aggro anthems, aggro anthems. And now we can go to, and by the  way, you see how far down I've gone. There's so many stations. Is this aggro cultural anthems? No, aggressive.  Aggro is aggressive. See the beast. Do you want 90s aggro anthems? Welcome to the jungle radio  or let's listen to the aggro anthems. Probably none of this is safe for work. Instead of punching a  wall, unleash your inner beast with some angst ridden, oh, oh thrashers, hard rock, emo punk,  and aggro rap hits, not for the fate of heart or the library.  Lose yourself, Eminem. There you go. That's not exactly, it's a good song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He does grow over time. I'm going to get pumped up. Yeah, get spaghetti on my shirt and all that. Yeah.  I'll sometimes listen to it to get new music to run to, you know, because I can't listen to Twig  all the time. You don't create enough twig for me to listen to. Oh, actually, yeah, I have,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's a station I listen to that's some really good new music. There's a lot of stuff in here.  So this is Songza and this is free. They'll do ad support at all. I haven't listened to it for  the free version because frankly I have, I paid for it, but Google music just gets better and  better. There are some negatives to Google music. You can only play on a certain number of devices  and they don't let you deactivate devices as much as you'd want. I'm sure those are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  restrictions imposed by the music industry. They need to fix that though. Like Jason, I feel your  pain, you know, that you can only deactivate four a year for devices a year. That's frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Because Jason and I both, Jason's probably worse than me, but we activate how many devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a year? 20 or 30. I mean, it's gotten to the point, I mean, before if I was reviewing a device,  mind you, obviously an edge case, right? Like we're reviewing devices. The majority of people  are not doing that. But part of my way of reviewing devices is using a device as if it's my own. And  I use play music all the time, but now that's not a part of my review process. So it kind of  changes things a little bit because I can't afford to burn through those deauthorizations.  And what music really needs in my opinion is family plan. And I think Apple did that right,  with Apple Music, I think, what is it? $15 for a family plan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Spotify, $15. Spotify's going to do that too. That would help a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm convinced, yeah. That's good feedback. That's good feedback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is because it's tied to your account. There's no way to share it with your family in  any way because they would have then access to all your Gmail and everything else. But there's other  restrictions. You can only, the weird one, and again, I think this music industry, I love Google  Music because I can upload my music to it. What is it? $50,000? What's the limit now?  I think it's $50,000 now, which is insane. And the example I always give is that most  of these services don't, the only place you can get the Beatles is from Apple's iTunes because  the Beatles never did digital deals and still don't want to. Whoever owns the Beatles music today,  I think it's Yoko. But if I bought Beatles music, I can upload it to my Google Music account and now  I can stream it. And so that's great. That's now part of my radio station's high quality  Google Music. So all of my songs are there, plus the 30 million other songs that they have access  to. It's a really great service. But there's a weird restriction. I can't remember what the details  are. I can't download my own music from them. I can do that, I think, twice. So it's not a backup.  Don't think of it as a backup service. Three times? Okay. It's not a backup service.  It's not like you can always download your songs from it, which is weird because those are songs  I own. But anyway, the intake is very much like Apple's new music system. You choose the genres

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you like. Classical, hip hop, rap, and jazz. Who has the best curated collections? Spotify's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think, are very good. Spotify's are excellent. I think Apple's going to be good. That's what  Apple's focusing on, right? I don't know. I'm surprised that they don't have, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Scrobbler or Last FM. You ought to be able to subscribe to people or rather than having some  editorial person on staff paid in the cloud, I would happily follow people who are cooler than  me or my friends and just let them curate good music. Right. I like Sinatra and Jackson. I like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Johann Sebastian Bach as well as Pink Floyd. I like the Queen and the Rihanna, who is the Queen.  The Stones and Bey. I'm sorry. I lost my head there. See, I have to go back and do this later.  That's going to take forever to go through all of these artists. But you can see, and then  you basically what I'm doing is I'm customizing this and then I'm going to get some radio stations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The download thing that you were talking about, Leo, it's that you can download two times on the  web. But if you use, it says here, the limit does not apply when you use Google Play Music for Chrome  to download. So I'm not sure what the difference is, but you can get unlimited access to it. It

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  just depends on how you do it. Through the Chrome, if I have a subscription. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's good to know. They probably didn't want people sharing an account an entire school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's what it is. That's what it is. Take your entire library.  That's what it is. And it's again, I don't think it's them. I think it's the record industry with  your and the thing is that each system seems to have different rules. So, you know, I can deactivate  deauthorized stuff unlimited on one system and only once on others. And it's just very strange.  See, now I have Beatles radio because I actually have the beat. I own the Beatles. Otherwise,  I wouldn't be able to get that. And to their credit, they've got album art in there and  similar music and so forth. I don't think I want to hear the beat alls, however.  That's what you hear on other services.  We don't have the Beatles. Perhaps you'd like to listen to this karaoke version  of Hey Jude by the Beat Alls. That's not good. But look, I got the Quarryman. That's the original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Wow. Yeah, that must be from like a compilation that you imported or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's some weird, weird source of that. I really like I like All Access. I actually ended  up getting Spotify too, just because they carry our podcasts and I wanted to support them. And  I really like Spotify too. So there's some good choices, which makes it very difficult,  frankly, for Apple to enter this market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You all see the big news probably from Google, the health tracking wristband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. OK, tell us about that. Is that real?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is real. It's from either. Yeah, it's from Google's  X Life Sciences. And it's not a consumer device, but there's a lot of people who run clinical  trials. And if you run a clinical trial, you want to know, you know, their heart rate or their  temperature, maybe their pulse oxygen level. And so it kind of sounds like they developed this for  internal use. And now they're looking at whether they can make it available more widely. They also

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  do that. That's the same people who are doing the contact lens that can tell you what your blood

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sugar level is. That's right. Yeah. So you're not going to go buy pick up one at Target or  Walmart anytime soon. But, you know, to be able to run clinical trials and correlate this sort  of data like skin temperature with, you know, whatever medicine you're taking could be pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  useful. So very useful. We had to go through having worn a halter monitor. This is an old  man moment when they want to check, check your heart over some period of time, because I have  atrial fibrillation to be able to just do that and know that you can check anytime. And some people  are asymptomatic with that. If the monitor could let you know this is going on when you don't know  it, you know darn well that some of these things are going to be indicators of worst things to come  and you can get an alarm and alert. This is going to save people's lives. Yeah, it's great,  but it's going to violate your privacy at the same time. Yeah, I don't care. You can, you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  share my fibrillation with the world. I don't care. We know, you know, I was just reading an  article in the Times a couple of days ago that we've really drastically improved heart detect  survival rates, not by any specialized technology, but just by getting people to treatment faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but the heart has like 90 minutes to recover and if you get in before that you can do it  without damage. I was amazed by that. Of course, living in New York area it's scary because God  knows all the bozos who don't get out of the way for the ambulance. Yeah, but that ties nicely in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with these meters and so forth because same thing with stroke. Your survival chances with stroke are  very, very good if you can get to a, you can get treated fast enough. So, you know, having a little  advanced knowledge of something bad about to happen can make a huge difference in survival rates

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and quality of life. Yeah, you know, earlier today we talked about computers and neural nets making  cool pictures or doing face recognition, but if you've got sensors that are ambient noise and  temperature and all this sort of stuff and maybe it's possible to detect things like heart attacks.  Now, because it's medical maybe it would just show you an alert or a notification on your phone and  then you'll have to decide whether you'll call the ambulance or something, but you know there's no reason you  couldn't use that sort of, you know, intelligence or machine learning to maybe help save people's  lives or get them medical attention much faster. Oh, I love it. So here's a story from The Verge

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about, now that we've done all the happy news, Google photos in the unguessable URL.  So, actually this is probably good news. Yeah, it is. A user on Reddit said, I was browsing  through my photos and I wanted to see the full size of an image so I right clicked it, which  gave me a link. Even when I'm in incognito mode that link is public.  I haven't shared it, but anybody who knew what the link was could see it. Now, of course,  this is a kind of security that is kind of frowned upon. It's called security by  obscurity because the URL is incredibly, it's 40 characters, it's 10 to the 70th combinations.  So it's highly unlikely that somebody could guess an individual URL. On the other hand,  I should point out that it wouldn't be hard to just start generating random links and seeing  what you find. So it'd be hard to find your picture, but a picture, not so hard. Web traffic  is encrypted, so as you're looking at a photo you have to worry about somebody in the coffee shop.  But most importantly, the photo isn't at that URL until you specifically say,  let's look at that photo. So I think it's probably okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it also sounds like reading through the article, they don't put the photo at that  URL until you do a right click on it. So the photo isn't accessible until you do a right click and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ask for a URL. And then Google also keeps an eye on how many, they rate limits the requests. So  if suddenly some address is asking for a million different photo URLs, they're going to block it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me understand that, Matt. So basically the URL doesn't exist until the user generates it by

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right clicking. Right. I believe that's right. I believe that's correct. I've been annoyed the  other direction where I wanted to share, I wanted Google to host my photo for me. And so I got a  URL that was on Google Photos and, or before Google Photos, it was just on Drive. And after  fetching it five or six or 20 times to make sure that it would be safe, I think Google rate limited.  And so I had to pull the image down and host it myself. So I think they are putting some good  protections in place. How many people looked at that picture before it? Well, I'm paranoid. So  when I do a blog post, I was going to host it on Drive. And so I reloaded my blog post a bunch.  And then at some point it failed and it failed from then on. And so just to be safe,  it's multiple steps to pull it down so that it's hosted on your own. I wish you could say,  well, maybe now you can make this public and then anyone can see. That would be nice. Yeah. Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  now you have to download it to your computer, then put it somewhere else. Yeah. That's not rate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  limited. Well, if you go ahead, if you think about it, this feature of Google Photos,  the fact that you can share a link with friends or family or on Facebook is  incredibly useful. And the only way to do that is to make that URL available somewhere. So they  try to obfuscate it, but it's sort of built in that you need that. It's got to be a public URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like the idea that I can share collections. I'm going to use this as I travel. I've been looking,  so funny because I've been looking at all different ways to share pictures. And the easiest  thing for me is just have photos automatically uploaded to Google Photos. And then I can use the  automatic collections or make new collections and share them on my blog or wherever else I want.  That's kind of cool. So if you hit the share button, this is a collection. If you hit the  share button, we've always had Google Plus, but now Facebook and Twitter are there, but you can  also just get this shareable link. And now this is generating that unusual link. And this is a link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there a difference between a collection and a story? They were calling it stories.  I think it's the same thing now. Stories are not collections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if I do a new tab, let's do this and see. In fact, let me do a new incognito tab so it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  doesn't even know it's me. Jeff, I think a story might involve that animation of you're going from

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  place to place. No, I think this does that. These collections do that. So this is what it calls a  collection now. And it's just like stories, right? Yeah, it's just like stories. So I love this. But  I just shared this with an incognito link. So I mean, isn't that sweet? I mean, this is going  to be great. But you're saying, and that's something to keep in mind, Matt, if I put that link on my  blog, it might get rate limited pretty quick. It could, yeah. But if you're just sharing with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  family, then- Facebook would probably be okay. Yeah. Right? Yeah. I would think, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was pretty great. My daughter's high school graduation did that automatically,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and it was pretty wonderful. I really love this capability. And this is an auto-awesome.  That's good. I mean, I didn't do anything. And of course, now with the new photos, you can create  your own stories and collections, whatever you want to call them, and put music behind them and  fancy them up. So I think this is great. I'm really happy about this. Would you get rate limited

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  before if you posted one of these stories to Google Plus? I wouldn't think that you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never had anybody say, oh, I can't see it. Right. I wonder what the difference is though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I was getting rate limited when I was trying to load an image on Google Drive. So I'm  probably completely different. And I'll bet Google Smart, and if you've got like 20 different IP  addresses, then it's like, oh, real people are looking at it. Whereas if it's like the same IP  address 30 times in a row, then they're like, oh, this is some dumb bot. Yeah. Okay. I was the dumb

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  bot. You were the dumb bot. Well, I'll try it. I'll put all my I'm gonna I'm gonna share my stuff  up to leoville.net. Google is if you thought your pixel was expensive. Now there's a $2,000  Chrome box. But yeah, there's good reason for it. It's for meetings. And you know, for people who  spent upwards of $100,000 on special Cisco teleconference rooms, this seems like a pretty  good darn deal. allows groups of 20 people in the meeting rooms. But you do need this Chrome box  and it provides pan tilt zoom camera features. That's nice. Additional mics and speakers for  the groups improve support for dual screen setups. This is for $2,000. This is pretty sweet. The PTZ  camera means you can actually I presume aim the camera right at different people. That's really

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  nice. Acer makes the I think probably a lot of people are thinking about consumer grade webcams  and they're like, oh, I should pay $100. But for businesses who are used to Tandberg machines,  right off like this is really pretty cheap or inexpensive for for a product like that. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what a great use for a Chrome box. You're using Hangouts right now, Matt, with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. And Google does a lot of its video conferencing with a very similar  product. Yeah, yeah. For a long time, we were like one of the top customers of a very expensive  video conferencing system. And so I think it might have been partly trying to save money for  ourselves that motivated or was part of the motivation for this. Peanut in our chat room says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if you're worried about a link becoming compromised, you can also talk talking backwards  about the Google collections thing. You can delete that shared link and no longer exists. So you  really do have control over it. Look, there's some type C connectors. I love those. Give me more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't wait for more. I just can't love them. Love them. You know, I can't wait for the day  when you go to a Google media and the connector for everybody is a type C. Oh, what a life that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  going to be. Yeah. Oh, Sean, the day. Everything. Everything. Apparently there is one Android phone  now, a European phone that has a type C connector. Really? Already. I think Google's basically said  that's what's going to happen. Right. So this is the one plus two announced that they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  are they doing type C? Yeah, that was their latest. Yay. They're driven that one out one,  one feature at a time. I know it really annoys you, Leo, but I went to go check it out and I  was like, oh, that is actually interesting. That's a good fit. Yeah, they got you. It's good marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good marketing can be a no simultaneously annoying and effective. Yes.  Park sausages, mom. That's a good example, actually. Well, it's not very informative,  but we should buy this so you can get a large room bundle or a small room bundle.  Update people for this. We should get this for our. So that was the one we saw set up was a small

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  room, but the larger has the PTC. Could you handle that as a instead of using a PC, use that as a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we currently in our conference room have set up a big screen connected to a piece to connect to a  PC with a camera and we would just use Skype. We could use Hangouts to. I mean, it's basically this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  also asking for your your your the Skype machine that for the show we met. No. Yeah. That handles  that right now for Hangouts. Could you use that instead? Yeah. What about it? I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo is such a power user like, yeah, we're not. But for a regular business, I think you really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Look, look who's on here. Mike Elgin.  Before you buy. What is that? Oh, that's oh, I'm sorry. That's YouTube giving me more information.  So I'm going to paste the link. The chat room said paste the link in here to your  collection. Let's see if it's rate limited. All right, chat room have at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll find out if that's rate limited. If it can keep up with the tweet comments. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's already limited. This is this is sweet. All right, everybody, click that link. Look at my  photo. Tell me I want to know about the bear in that photo. There's a bear. Oh, that's not a bear.  That's Lucille. Oh, OK. Wait a minute. Let me let me. Are you talking about Lucille the bear?  This was the Giants game and we were we were at the ballpark. OK. And the Giants mascot who is  Lucille. See, she's got two rings. She she came and snuck up on me while I was doing a selfie.  It was like, I feel the cold touch of a free hand. And then she and then she posed.  She posed for pictures. She's the giant. That's the Giants stadium mascot.  Lucy revealed. I don't know about sports ball. You don't apparently. You've never been to a Giants  game. Haven't I should. I think we could remedy that, Matt. I want to take you to a ballgame.  Ever had a hot dog, Matt? Have you ever had a hot dog that's been cooking since spring training, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm missing out on these vital experiences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you're an American. What is that bear in the picture? He says.  Oh, dear. See, actually, I calling her her. I think it's a he Lucille. Yeah, I love how  it handled the videos in this and how it handled some animated gifts and stuff that it made  automatically. This is just really nicely done. I think they're really, really. I love

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  stories slash collections. You know, someone at Google right now is like,  what is happening with this link? We're down melting all the servers. What's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't see how many who ate my tuna is asking. How can I? Why is there so many food handles in  our chat room? Peanut and who ate my tuna? Creamy corn cob. Why did I don't know how many people can  look at my collection? I don't know any way to do that. So everybody hit that sucker.  Hit that hard. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Toad Sloth says he has a spinning circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it's maybe it's maybe slowing down now. We're doing it. We're doing it. We're breaking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's break Google. Everybody chime in. Android Wear gets new watch faces from Hello Kitty.  Take that Apple Watch. Take that. And Angry Bird. Don't forget Angry Bird. Are these official?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, these are official. Wow. What does that mean? Official? I mean, they're, you know, from,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know, Hello Kitty from Sanrio. Oh, it's Sanrio approved. Oh, wow. All the new faces go live in  the Play Store. Still no Mickey Mouse. Hello Kitty. Are they animated? Can like Mickey tap his toe?  That's the question. Can the kitty tap her toe? That's a good question. I want a Lucio watch.  I didn't install Hello Kitty watch face. You didn't? What's wrong with you? How about Moods of Norway  featuring a tractor? There you go. Terminator Genesis. Yeah, some of, yeah, these are Rovio's.  These are all official, aren't they? Because that was one knock kind of on the original Android Wear  was that, you know, you can get a Rolex, but it's not from Rolex. This is an official Rubik's Cube  from Rubik. Two stars. Wait a minute. You could actually solve it? What the heck? That's crazy  talk. This is exactly what Apple didn't want. And well, I'm still loving Android Wear, I have to say.  Him too. I am wearing an Apple watch. I'll probably wear the Apple watch to Europe. I don't know why.  AirDroid got in a little bit of trouble. You probably talked about this last night on All

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  About Android. No, he didn't actually. I think I saw this this morning. So AirDroid, which I've

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  used for, and we've recommended, I think it was even probably a pick on App Arena, certainly a pick  on Twig many times, is an app that lets you connect to your phone from your desktop and vice  versa. It has been apparently removed from the Play Store. The AirDroid, this is from a story  in Android Police, the AirDroid team said, well, I don't know what happened. Google had removed the  listing after a mass complaint from Facebook. The sweeping set of complaints picked up tons of apps  with WhatsApp in their name, but also apps like AirDroid that simply mentioned WhatsApp in the  description. So Facebook was asserting trademark infringement. The reason given to AirDroid was  alleged trademark infringement. And here's the reason for suspension. Does AirDroid, it passes  along notifications from WhatsApp. It doesn't replace WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a little tough though, because you don't want apps in the Play Store that, you know, say  bejeweled and they're actually spammers or something. It's a huge problem. In fact,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's one of the things Microsoft has not done well in the Windows phone store. There's a lot of  fake apps in there. And actually Google's done a good job in Android. It does say that after about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  40 minutes, they reinstated the situation. So, you know, that's better than, you know, not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  reinstating it. It's still so optimal. In fact, this is another one of them happy stories with a  happy ending. It's all happy stories today. Happy story today. Google did the right thing.  People freaked. They shouldn't have. This is barely kerfuffle. Where does it fall in the kerfuffle  meter? Hardly, hardly a brouhaha. Definitely not a fracah. That's totally a kerfuffle again.  Well, how many words are there for kerfuffle? There are quite a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brouhaha, kerfuffle, fracah. Yes, fracas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well. No, we're getting there. We're getting there. And so let's talk about OnePlus. So the  OnePlus 2, the way they're doing this is they're leaking out one feature at a time. OnePlus says  that's just good marketing. And I have to say, I guess it is just good marketing. It's certainly  getting a lot of attention. They just want to build community, they told 9to5 Google.  We're just trying to build community. So we know two things right now. It's going to be a Qualcomm  810, which is the latest Snapdragon. Actually one that was eschewed by Samsung for its Galaxy S6  because it used so much power and was so hot. HTC used it in the M9, but they downclocked it  so it wouldn't burn up the phone. So the OnePlus 2 will have, let's see if they've added anything  to this spec here. Let me see if I can find it. Where is that on the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not going to be Cyanogen anymore, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  No, it'll be Oxygen OS.  And actually like Oxygen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do too.  I put it on my OnePlus 1 and I'm very happy with it. It's as pure an Android as you can get.  I miss a few of the little features of Cyanogen mod, but not much.  OnePlus 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really all we know right now is the Snapdragon 810 V2.1. So maybe, I guess I don't know about  V2.1. I don't know if maybe that addresses the heat issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe. And Type-C, which is huge. Very happy about that.  USB Type-C.  I would buy a phone just because it was Type-C. Seriously.  That's awesome.  And it's a very nice lollipop. Yeah, the Oxygen is very nice.  Google told to expect large fines.  Oh, here we go. Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll just be taking a drink while you all talk about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Expect large fines. This is the European Union.  It of course is investigating Google for antitrust violations.  And the Commission has reached the preliminary conclusion that Google's practice of positioning  displaying more favorably in its general search result pages, its own comparison shopping service,  which doesn't exist anymore compared to competing comparison shopping services,  constitutes an abuse by Google in the relevant markets for general search services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the total business of said comparison shopping services is probably in grosses  a tenth of what they're thinking of. Charge fine. It's ridiculous. It is a witch hunt.  It is why people are not going to invest in Europe.  Large fines. It's going to do far more damage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And as Danny Sullivan said on Search Engine Landon on this show, this is how search engines work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, let me say this to my friends and then the commies of Europe,  it's how capitalism works. You promote your stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Talking about Europe disliking the internet, the freedom of panorama,  that was another interesting article that came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really bad when I added that to the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's go to that article from Medium. Freedom. What is freedom of panorama?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It allows you to take a picture. Go ahead, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you take a picture of artworks that are permanently installed outdoors? Like the whole  idea that you can't use those pictures, which you took from a public place, you know, for commercial  purposes or whatever. Like if you read through the Medium article that says that, you know,  Wikimedia and Wikicommons type stuff, they often don't have pictures of some of these  buildings or artwork or whatever because it's not clear that they have the right to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this color map of Europe shows how different countries handle this.  Countries that are yellow have freedom of panorama for non-commercial use only.  Countries that are red have no mention of freedom of panorama.  So in other words, presumably you could copyright, let's say, the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  And then what does that mean? No one could take a picture of it and put it anywhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. What it does is it kills the definition of public.  Right. This is what I wrote about in public parts. Pardon me for the plug.  But it matters greatly is that what's public is owned by the public.  Right.  When you diminish that, you diminish the property of the public.  So the idea that you can't, this is the problem with Google Street View.  The principle is that you can, from a public place,  to take a picture of a public thing and to share that is fine.  And now this limits it and says, no, no, no, you have to have the permission  of that which you're picturing in the public. Thus, it's not public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like the places I'm going are all in green, which means I have freedom of panorama.  So I'm going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, I hope I'm not... Sorry, go ahead.  No, you go ahead.  Oh, I just... Jeff, I hope I'm not stepping on your number,  but it sounds like Wikimedia Commons has a category full of deletion requests  related to freedom of panorama. There have been nearly 100 images  deleted of the Louvre pyramid alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had no idea it was that bad.  Who are these morons?  So the Eiffel Tower copyright...  You're a human!  The good news is... Get this. It's this crazy.  So the Eiffel Tower was built in 1909 or earlier, so its copyright has expired.  However, the lighting displays are considered original visual creations.  So you can take a picture of the Eiffel Tower, but not of the lighting display on the Eiffel Tower.  That's insane.  You can't do the pyramid entrance to the Louvre because that's copyrighted.  These are all blacked out copyrighted images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matt's absolutely right. This is a matter of free speech.  This means that you cannot picture to the world...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, can't we just do massive civil disobedience here?  Let's just all take pictures of the Eiffel Tower light show and put it up on Google.  Screw them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I think it is for commercial use.  So if you're a photographer, you can't put it on a poster.  But at the fact where you can't have it in Wikipedia because the licensing isn't clear,  that's pretty bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pfft. That's the real issue is that Wikipedia is very careful and doesn't want to violate rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because everybody... I know when I want to use a photo that has rights,  I know I can use it from the Wikimedia Commons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if I show my pictures on Twitter...  That's commercial use.  That's commercial use.  So when I come back...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm calling a scene for you, bud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Civil disobedience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm having a slideshow.  Damn it.  Fight the man, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fight the man.  You know what's worse, Matt?  Is because now we know the Google photo can identify specific things like Eiffel Tower at night.  Watch. There will be subpoenas to eliminate all images of blank.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're up!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. I am now going to commit an act of civil disobedience.  That's the butt of the Eiffel Tower and I'm showing it on commercial television.  By the way, I found that with a Google photo search.  I know I have other pictures of the Eiffel Tower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's another horrible horrible horrible decision.  Which is the Human Rights Court now says that sites are liable for user comments.  Now granted, Europe never had the section 250 that we have.  And this 250?  Now what's the number?  Doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  230D, I think.  And yeah, there's Big Ben.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Take that.  Big Ben, baby.  I'm sorry. The Elizabeth Tower containing the Big Ben bell.  Take that.  I don't know what that is.  It's a copyright water tower.  I typed in Eiffel and I got this. I don't know.  I'm sorry. Continue on. I didn't mean to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no. I was actually European you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's two counts, Leo. Two counts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Two counts.  Civil defabedience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not going to... You're never coming back from Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In Petaluma, we have a giant feed silo called the Eiffel Tower, apparently.  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That alone, that's coming down.  That's coming down.  That is coming down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Petaluma.  Now I wonder if...  In the United States, can I take a picture of Mount Rushmore?  Yeah, because what's public is public.  Public is public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can take pictures.  That's also the principle that allows you to take pictures of police  doing what they do in public.  Good luck trying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you have a legal right to do so.  I know I do, but go ahead and tell them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I've been to Pebble Beach and they try to say that you can't take a picture of the one tree on Pebble Beach.  You're kidding.  And they're like, no, no. They're saying we control the rights to that tree or something.  You're kidding.  I don't know what the legal status is, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the picture that got me banned from Egypt forever.  That's it. You can't come back.  Cannot come back.  I think he's telling that guy, go shoot that guy over there.  I don't like him.  All right. That is so weird.  I've always thought that's a lot.  So for non-commercial, if you're just taking a snapshot as a tourist, that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but is putting it on Facebook commercial use?  Is it?  They're going to make advertising money on it.  Uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook needs to block it then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So I'm just looking at a Pebble Beach on 17 mile drive.  That's the Lone Pine out there.  Yeah. The Lone Cypress.  Cypress.  They claim trademark on the Cypress. Yes.  Oh my God.  Which is, or yeah, I think it's now fallen down or a bit built over, but...  Serves them right.  Take that Cypress. Yeah.  Serves them right. Well, let's see. Let's go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. See, they have a picture on Wikipedia of the Lone Cypress.  So...  Not for long.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So...  Not for long.  Yeah. I'm sorry. I don't mean to get you busted, Wikipedia, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'll post a link into the chat about...  There's a New York Times article about, you know, whether or not this tree can be protected...  Wow.  ...from denied permission to photograph the tree for his business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A commercial photographer was denied.  Well, I guess the argument in this case is, is the golf course a public place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's a private entity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's private, but apparently they say it's not the physical ownership of the tree,  but the ownership of the intellectual concept of the tree.  Maybe we shouldn't bash Europe all the time. Maybe some of this stuff happens here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, we go back to California. California is Europe-like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  Oh, you New Yorkers. I swear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey...  All right. So I want to do... I want to go back to it because I think it's important.  Real quickly, the Human Rights Court says that sites are liable for user comments.  What we have in the United States is section 230 that says that there's a safe harbor  that does not make you liable.  Now...  This also is a huge decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We talked about this on... Mike Masnick did a great article on Tech Dirt about this,  but we talked about it on Twitter on Sunday, and Tom Merritt told me that one of his chat mods,  T2T2, is from... where was it?  Estonia.  And said that that decision by the European court applied only to Estonian law.  So it was not the blanket decision that we thought it might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. But it's a... well, it's a bad... it's a troubling decision, and it's a precedent  at a larger level. That's what worries me.  Right.  Whittle, whittle, whittle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was... and I don't know, but he was of the opinion that this isn't as broad or as concerning  a decision from the European Court of Human Rights because it applies specifically to Estonia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And when you've got freedom of expression and then you also have the human rights aspect,  and it sounds like most of this decision was on the human rights aspect, but I agree with Jeff.  It's a really scary precedent and a very slippery slope to go down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I didn't mean to interrupt your smooth segue into a commercial, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you want to talk about Twitter at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to know... can you explain... Lucy, can you explain it to me?  Explain lightning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lightning? I can explain it.  Actually, it's a smart thing. First of all, I think that... I don't know what happened to  poor old Dick Costallo, but I feel like... it's interesting. Again, this was another  good conversation on Sunday's Twitter. Ben Thompson pointed out that it was Costallo who  ousted the third party developers at Twitter. He's made a lot of boneheaded moves.  Jack Dorsey is back and his beard are back, but only temporarily.  Twitter says, we need a full-time CEO. The board says, more importantly...  We don't... and Jack says, I'm going to split my time, as he did before, with Square and Twitter  crossing the street on odd days or whatever it is.  So there's some debate over whether Dick Costallo was a sacrificial lamb to appease the market.  If that was the case, they didn't really accomplish their goals because the market went up,  then went right back down. Or if he really was legitimately not running Twitter well.  One of the initiatives that he had spearheaded and was apparently very excited about, even though  he knew he was being ousted as CEO, is this lightning thing. To me, I'll tell you what I  think of it. If you think of what is the most useful... Twitter has lots of uses and really is  kind of... and one of the problems with discussing Twitter is it really depends on... each individual  uses it in different ways. So if Twitter is useful to you because of the way you've crafted your  followers or the people you follow or whatever, that's great. But what Twitter mostly seems to be  useful for is live events. Where do we go when there's breaking news or Ferguson is erupting or  Arab Spring is going on? Well, we go there to find the news. The problem is the news is intermixed,  intermingled with people's lunches and weird diatribes against stuff nobody ever heard of.  It's all mushed up. So lightning is going to be part of the explore tab. And I haven't seen it  yet, but my understanding is we'll be human curated, which I think is very interesting,  live events. So during the Oscars, there'd be a lightning page that's human curated pictures  from the Oscars, tweets about the Oscars, tweets by people at the Oscars. Same thing if there's a  big news event, World Cup, whatever. That seems to me to be Twitter trying to show people this is  what it's really good at. It seems to be that that to me, that is one of the real great things  Twitter does well. So that's my explanation of it. Thank you. Does that make sense? Now,  Wired said Twitter is killing Twitter to save Twitter. I don't think it's killing Twitter to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  lightning. But well, you know, I took a bunch of German executives around if I told you this,  taught me a few weeks ago, and I went to smart places like Vox and courts and places like that.  As we entered the room, they would say to these publishers and editors, you know, you may all be  on Twitter, but pointing out to the world, they're on Facebook. Twitter is only seven, what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  17%. I can't remember what the number is, but it's very small. We tend to think it's the center of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the universe, but it's not. So I have an infestation of ants. That's why I've been going crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they hitting you? So what makes sense to me about lightning is you know, although,  and this is one of the problems Ben Thompson pointed out, that Twitter.  Europe is sending ants to Japan. 27 with one blow, ladies and gentlemen. He's the tailor of New Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was nicely done, Jeff. I'm waiting for the show to get off so I can get some spray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everywhere! The Bane. Saving their lives by talking. Yes, let's save some ant lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes sense that Twitter would do this because you could go without even being signed into  Twitter and see what's going on. It doesn't make sense because the value of Twitter comes from the  signals they get. And this was again a great insight from Ben Thompson. The signals they get  from signed on users, right? Same reason Google created Google+. The signal of attention is not  useful unless you know who it is and becomes more and more useful as you aggregate material around  that. So this lightning might be a good idea, but if it means you don't have to log into Twitter to  get value out of Twitter, it might not, it might have the wrong effect. It remains to be seen how  they implement it. I think it's a great idea and it's something I would use. It's kind of like  trends, only better, right? It's live, it's streaming, it's human curated, which I think is  very interesting. But that's also a cost structure. Well, it's not only a cost structure, it's an edit,  it's this whole thing we were talking about with editorializing. So what if it's during the Oscar  ceremony and ABC says to Twitter, we would take it very kindly if you had nobody in there who said  anything bad about the Oscars. In fact, Samsung here has given us some money, so if you could put  more pictures of Samsung devices, I don't know why I do that with my nose when I talk. I was wondering.  It's supposed to go with a wise guy. We would take very kindly to the notion of you not in any way  up sending our Apple cart. I haven't seen it yet. I don't know if anybody has. I don't know if it's  out there. Supposedly be part of the explore tab. There's all kinds of new neat stuff going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's Instagram's new discovery thing. Yeah. There is also the- Discovery's a big deal if

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you're one of these social networks, isn't it? It is. Isn't that what Facebook tries to do  automatically with its algorithm is like surface a Facebook that you would enjoy? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hard to do. Storeful and YouTube doing a feed of verified news videos that  better beats TV. There's neat stuff happening in this area of  curated, whether human or algorithmically curated content of what's going on now where it screams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I couldn't be happier. I feel like I never have to contemplate my own death ever again,  because there's so much entertaining stuff on the internet. I can be distracted forever now.  Matt got it. Yeah. I'm distracted to death. Neil Postman. All right. Let's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So anything you have to say about that, Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis? About what? Twitter, the Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. You said what I wanted to hear. Which is-  The Dick story is interesting. I've always liked Dick. He's funny. I feel bad for him.  But it hasn't been a happy place to work, I hear. And they have done some odd things. They've done  some great things over the years. They've stood up for free speech. As you said earlier, or I think  Matt said it's the free speech wing of the free speech party. God bless them for that.  They also kind of threw developers under the bus. They've done odd things. You don't know what to  expect from them. You don't know what it is. Nonetheless, at the end of the day, give him  credit. He took a company that was being laughed at because it had no business model whatsoever  and has serious revenue and serious value there. And so give Dick credit for that. And now Twitter  is probably going to find some new path and we'll see what that is. Right. It's interesting, though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  everybody's going to some sort of curated feed, whether algorithmically or-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's my going too far statement, my tweet on this, is that we move from a page-based  web to a stream-based web. And that's not fully true. We'll always have pages, we'll have sites.  But the idea of an attention stream, obviously- Twitter invented that, though, right?  And mobile has a lot to do with the adoption of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like that was my main insight from Twitter and maybe eight years ago was I even  wrote a blog post because I wanted to do something like it was that Twitter, initially at Twitter,  I felt like I had to read every post and go back in time. Yes. And then at some point I had the  final realization, oh no, you just dip in and out whatever's going on right now. It's like a New

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yorker cartoon. No, I can't come to bed. I haven't finished reading Twitter. Right. Exactly. I haven't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  got to the end of the internet yet. And so you quickly realize the internet does this to you,  that there's too much. So you just dip in and you enjoy what you read, but you don't feel like you're  missing- you don't have to worry about what you missed. And that kind of content stream  is a whole different way of thinking of stuff. Imagine if you only, like every time you got a  book, you would just open it up, read a few pages and close it and never look at it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then Amazon wouldn't pay you for anybody reading it. But that's kind of what we do with the internet.  The internet is a book only half read. I mean, now it becomes a war for attention. And I'm not sure  that's the end of the game. I think that people can game that and often efficiency matters. Google  doesn't go so much for your attention, but for informing you and being useful and having you  come back often. Right now, there's a lot of efforts to grab attention with streams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're giving- go ahead. Oh, just a lot of sites are constructing reasons and ways for you to  spend more time. I suspect Google, in my experience, at least the search team cares more about,  okay, how do we win the trust and the reputation rather than win the attention? Because if you  have the trust and the reputation, then people will still come to you when they need help or  need answers. But absolutely, my wife will surf and then, well, okay, I'm done with the internet.  I've spent all the time, I've read everything on Facebook. So if Facebook can invent new things  to read, watch, or share, or the same with Twitter, then that benefits their bottom line, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we've covered the news in thorough detail, have we not? Well, one more thing I'd  like to mention. Your friend Bill Gross's printer. Oh, yes, just got an award. I saw you tweeted him  13 seconds ago. I'm thinking, wow, is this man a multitasker? Of course, I'm reading Twitter.  He's not paying attention to the show. Yes. I couldn't really call you on it because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was reading Twitter at the time. It's very neat. It's the $399 3D printer from New Matter.  It's really neat. Yeah, I can't wait to get mine. $399. Are you into that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, wait a minute. Did you get that pen that you would draw things in the air? I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now you want to do 3D. I know what's going to happen to my wife and my children.  They're going to look at me and say, what did you do now? Excuse me. Ants! Ants!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, you could 3D print an ant killer.  Oh, geez Louise. They're just ants. This is reminding me of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you want ants? Because that's how you get ants. Wasn't it? That's Archer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, here's a printer from NewMatter.com. $399. It looks cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It also is... I'm sorry. It's constructed differently so that the base moves and the head stays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The head stays and the base goes... These things look very cool. I just want to tell people  it's not as easy as it looks. No. But what's also going to be interesting is you're going to have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  open source creation. It's hard for me to... I mean, my family will make fun of me, but it's  basically me being nice to Bill Gross and signing up early. It's hard to imagine  journalistic uses of this, but who knows? Recreate something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you guys seen the 3D printer that was announced at TED, Carbon 3D?  No, tell us about it.  It's actually extremely cool. Basically, instead of laying things down very slowly,  it uses a light above and it uses a light below and it can pull out of the liquid very quickly.  So it's got the potential to be much, much faster.  Which was really great for the show. Sorry, Matt.  Oh yeah. No, no. The guy who is one of the main principals went to UNC, or he's a chemistry  professor at UNC Chapel Hill, which is where I went to grad school, which is why I was interested.  And so it actually looks like you can do all kinds of different materials and continuous  speed. Much faster scale, right?  Yes. Yes. Absolutely. So it's... But technically, there's an oxygen variable layer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, sorry. Go ahead, Jeff.  No, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You were saying the actual interesting stuff. I just wanted to joke.  If Leo finds the video, we can get kind of a violation here because... I'm sorry. I see  another ant. It's the Eiffel Tower. So... Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this what you're talking about? This Carbon 3D?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it. That's it.  The interesting thing is that the light shines from below and there's an oxygen permeable  layer where basically instead of having to go down, print, go back up, and all this sort of stuff,  it just kind of pulls all out in one continuous mechanism. And so I was in the audience and it  was printing while he was talking and a 3D printer I've never seen move that fast. And so it actually  has a lot... It's not just fluff. There's a lot of real world potential on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I hear up to you, Matt. How does it do it again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. So there's an oxygen permeable layer and basically... It's ants.  It's ants. They get a ton of ants. They combine with the squirrels. They make scaffolding.  And you can actually read on the website. It's Carbon 3D. But I know a friend from Google who  went to work there. So it's at the point where they're able to poach some people from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. That is very cool. Because I tell you, one of the big issues with printing, of course, is speed.  Oh, they're so slow.  Yeah. You don't really realize... I mean, this all looks great on the website and then you get it.  And it's like... Yeah. Overnight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you end up with? A chess piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I expect you to print a lot of interesting stuff, Jeff. Will you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to try to take it to school and have people look at it and say,  that's cool. What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've had a few and I always donate them to schools because that's a great thing for kids to...  Hey, from ScooterX in our chat room, some very good news. The Wireless Power Consortium,  which runs the Qi Power Standard, has announced that Qi will soon have basically the equivalent  of Qualcomm's Quick Charge, which means wireless charging, which is speaking of slow, notoriously  slow, will now be fast. Wireless Charges will be able to deliver as much as 15 watts to phones.  Yeah. Nice.  So anybody who... I love wireless charging. To me, because I have a little stand and I put the  phone in the stand at night and it charges, that'll be very nice. So just quick story.  Let's take a break. Come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One quick story I want to mention. Just want to mention.  Because I want to... May it rest in peace, but Circa is no more.  We forgot. Yeah. And I'm very sorry to see that.  I meant to ask you about that right at the top. Circa, for those of you who don't know,  is a site that cut news up into pieces. And so it allowed a couple of important things. One,  it knew what you knew. So this is really important. It was the only news site that  then told you what you didn't know because it knew what you'd already read. And second,  it allowed you to follow stories, which is a way to give permission to get alerts when something  new happened in a story you cared about. Now, as a consumer proposition, it would have required  a lot more investment because they needed to have you... If you want to follow all the stories  you care about, they had to have enough people writing stories in this new way. That didn't  happen. Or it could have been a new CMS, content management system, for the news business and  rethink how we do things in an age of alerts and updates and stuff. But that would mean having to  change the news industry. We know how hard that is. So it was really insightful and important.  And I, in all full disclosure here, is I introduced them to a lot of companies,  trying to hope that somebody would buy them and nobody had the foresight to do so. Because there  were important insights and experience here that I guarantee you we will come back in a year or two  and say, just like with Google Wave, we'll say, darn, alerts are now using a lot of things that  Circa used to do. And so salute to the team. Sorry this happened. It sucks. But know that what you  thought about in the future of news will indeed be used in the future. So that's... I just wanted

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to get that in there just to pay tribute to them. That was it. Yeah, it was an app on iOS and Android.  They had a website. Circa was CircaNews.com. I remember Ben Ha, who was one of the, I think,  the funders and the founders at a... I think it was a foo camp saying, we want to reinvent news.  Let's all get together and talk about what should news be? So I remember at the very beginning of  that. It was also penance for what cheeseburger did to... Ben was the creator of I Can Has Cheeseburger.  Yeah. Yeah. I love Circa and it is sad to see that not make it. Yeah. Thank you. Let's take a break.  Your picks, final numbers, that kind of thing, the back of the book coming up. But first a word from  the best place to create your next beautiful website or online store. It's squarespace.com.  Very proud, you know, to have been part of the success of Squarespace. Right from the very  beginning, we were one of the first places they ever did ads and we were so impressed.

Even if every single person  watching this show right now went to a Squarespace site, you just couldn't bring it down. We love it.  But on top of that, you also have this incredible software that lets you make a beautiful site with  absolutely no technical background at all. I think that's a really valuable thing to bring to the  world. All Squarespace sites are mobile responsive. Don't have to worry about mobile getting. They all  have e-commerce built in.

I don't know, Matt, do you have anything you want to share with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  us? You always have something cool going on. I do. So if you listened to TWIG a week or so ago,  somebody mentioned Google Contributor. And the idea behind Google Contributor is that you can  give Google, you know, one, three, five, $10 a month. And then instead of seeing ads, Google  will bid on your behalf. And so if I, for example, have seen 4,000 less ads because I'm using Google  Contributor. What? I think at the time, Leo said, this is great, but it only applies for like, you  know, nine or 10 sites. It started out with an initial number of partners. But my understanding  is that Google Contributor now works through the Google Display Network. And so literally millions  of sites can be supported by this. So for example, it's kind of neat. You can see the sites you've  contributed to. And Leo, you talked about distracting, you know, amusing ourselves to death.  I've actually given over $6 to Imgur because I enjoy browsing. But I've also given, you know,  a quarter to the Washington Post, 30 cents to Vox.com, 16 cents to mobile. And so you won't see

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the ads on those sites because you donate. That's right. And in fact, you can replace,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this is the power user feature. You can replace the ads with any custom HTML, like iframe that  you want. So I have a little thing that shows a little Mondrian piece of artwork. And you know,  every time I see it, it makes me happy because I'm like, oh, I'm supporting this. But you could make  it kittens. You could make it your to-do list. You can specify a URL and it will fold that in.  And so right now, I think there's an invite list. But my hope is over time, they'll have that to  the point where everybody can participate relatively quickly. So if you thought that it was  only for nine or 10 sites, it's not. Anywhere that can basically display, I don't know if it's  display AdSense or use the Google Content or Display Network, but essentially there are tons  of sites where you can give a buck to 10 bucks, whatever, a month, and it will take that and give  that directly to the publishers. And so it's exactly the sort of thing you want to support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a great answer to people who complain about ads on the web. We've had lots of debates  about ad blocker technology. And I've always said, you know, you got to consider when you're  blocking ads that you're kind of using the site's resources without paying them. So that's not  acceptable. So this is a great alternative. It's kind of like an ad blocker, but if you don't want  to see ads, you can support the site instead. Do they set the amount of contribution ahead of time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like each site or? I don't know whether it's you look at the number of impressions per month and  then you divvy up the pie, whether it's $5 you give a month or whatever, or whether it only bids as  as little as it needs to so that you see, you know, your pretty picture or kittens rather than the ad.  It might do that instead. I'm not 100% sure. And does this, how much does Google keep or  how does it work? I don't know. You know, I would assume that it's a minority and the majority goes  to, I wonder if it's the same, the same ratio of the ads. I suspect it's, you know, I have no idea,  but it's probably along the lines of AdSense or something like that. But, you know, over and over  again, you hear the phrase, if you're not the, if you're not paying for it, then you're the product.  Right. And on one hand, I hate that because it's, you know, it's more like just a sound bite. But on  the other hand, hey, now you have the ability to pay and have that money go straight to the publisher.  And, you know, six bucks for Imgur is, is not nothing if you have millions of users who are all,  you know, paying to not see the ad. So give it a, give it a checkout. I think they're getting to  the point where you can almost invite someone and they'll be able to join pretty quickly. So it's  worth it's, you know, in the next few weeks. Join, you mean as a reader or join as a site? You need

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  an invitation to do it. Right now it's invite only. Yeah. But, you know, I've got like five

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  invites. I'm happy to invite people, but, but it's, well, that should cover everybody who listens to  this show. We're set. Right. I'll take an ideal world. They'd be able to get rid of that invite  system. I, I'm, I hope they're working on that, but, but it really is, it makes you feel good  because you see this little piece of art or a kitten and you know that you're helping a publisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is really a great solution. I would actually like to have one because I want to experiment  with new business models. So I'll take one. This makes a lot of sense instead of running ad block

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and basically using content against people, against the publisher's will for free. You can,  you can make a deal that everybody's happy and you don't see that all the time. Or instead of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  paint wall. Yeah. You know, the Blendle model is okay, I'll pay 25 cents or whatever. Well, okay,  maybe, but you're also probably going to lose some audience. I think I mentioned when we had this  discussion two weeks ago that, that the guardian has found that when they, when they put their  membership pitch to people who have used ad blockers, the guilt helps increase the yield on  membership. Right. And I think there's an opportunity in the long run, I'll be curious  about the economics of this because what you care about in the end is what we call so sonorously,  sonorously, ARPU revenue per user. Oh, okay. And you want your, you know, what's, what's,  what's the relative ARPU of showing somebody a whole bunch of junky five cent CPU, CPM ads  versus getting N dollars a month from a loyal user. What's the relative loyalty that that causes?  I don't know what the answer is. I suspect it's, I expect contributor, this thing will be less,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but maybe not. And if you're somebody that bemoans the loss of Circa, well, there's a reason why  services like Circa have to go away. They cannot do it in a financially viable manner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the nice thing is when, when you have a publisher who would show an ad  and there you instead have a user who has Google contributor, you are guaranteed that the publisher  will get, you know, like a penny more or, or, you know, a fraction of a cent more because  you are by definition paying what it takes to outbid the people who would programmatically

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  want to show you. Oh, I see. So your ARPU is higher for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. You, you take part in the auction, as I understand it, and you bid from this pool that you  contribute in order to win. And so that you will not see the ad.  I like it. That's very, yeah. And so I think a lot of people confuse the fact that it started out  with a small set of sites as like, Oh, I did, I did. But, but it was one of these like five where  they want to start slowly and make sure that it makes sense and, and test out, kick the tires

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  before they roll it out more broadly. They need to do a better job of explaining which sites  do this. Cause they only show six on the web page.  Totally. That's like, it's kind of unclear here of, you know, so I'd like to know this is good. So  it's now millions. That's really great. Yeah. I'll sign up for that. People wonder, people often say,  well, Leo, why is it you show sites like the Virgin and don't use an ad blocker for the same reason?  I would hope you wouldn't skip through our ads. This is what pays for the content you're looking  at. And when I show a site, I'm not going to block the ads, even though I'm showing it on our  stream. Oh, by the way, that's my tip of the week. The premiere of Mr. Robot, which is a,  we, many of us have talked about it already because they put the, first of all, they made  it a fabulous site. If you go to who is mrrobot.com, it is, Oh, it's changed now. That's too bad.  That's, that's too bad. This was, this was a really fun kind of, yeah, here it is. Here's the,  boot screen that you get when you, you know, you have to dig a little farther now that the show is  launched, but it's a hacker show. It's a, and the technology is pretty accurate. It's a, about a  young hoodie wearing. It's pretty amazing. The hackers, a black hat and gets kind of  involved with a hacker group that seems to be trying to change the world for the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You liked it, Jeff? Yeah, I did. I watched the first episode. Well, the first great thing is,  is I discovered, I'm finding that Google play is a discovery mechanism for new shows.  The other one that I just watched is unreal. Have you watched that one? No. Oh, it's fictional,  but behind the scenes in a reality TV bachelor like show with really mean TV people.  It's about reality television. I love it. And like the first four episodes are free  on Google play. Really good. Yeah. There's this, this episode from Mr. Robot is also free. Last I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  knew. Yeah, it's on YouTube. It's all over the place for free. This is, yeah, I'm going to be  watching it and I'll be taping it, I guess, or whatever it is the kids do today instead of  taping. Have you seen sense eight on a new Netflix original? No, it's from the Wachowski's and it's  really interesting, but what's, what's most interesting to me is the production values  are feature film level. Very, and the, and the locations are all over the world. Very clearly,  very expensive to make. And it just shows you Netflix is really coming of age in terms of its  production capabilities. I mean, first of all, you're hiring Wachowski's who created the matrix  and cloud Atlas. It reminds me a little bit of cloud Atlas is really beautiful.  I'm not sure what the plot's going to be about. I think it seems to be about  eight telepaths who somehow can sense each other. They don't know who suddenly they start sensing  each other all around the world. And I think it's really well done. But what's to me interesting is  the production value of it. Incredible. What do you got for us, Mr. J? Well, there's something

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  related to that's which is a Pando, the Pando Daily just started a $10 membership pitch,  which and you get the content early. You can also make things public. I don't fully understand it  all. But she says, Sarah Kuda says that she's unlikely to get more VC money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this was very famously started with VC money. And yes, after the failure of Giga Home,  I think a number of people are wondering, is there a future to VC backed journalistic enterprises?  Maybe not. She's going to charge a membership fee just like Jessica Lesson does at the information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's you get it early. She gave a good screed on Twitter, Sarah did, being against paywalls  and paywalls don't work for the journalists, don't work for the public. So this is like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So she's still it's freemium. So she'll still offer a free version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Okay. And you can make things public and free and so on. By the way, the number actually  should be twenty seven. What's that? The number of dead ants around.  I'm telling you, with some glee, they're bad. And their ants with wings. I'm telling you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  he's the tailor of Teaneck, ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Jarvis. I just saw a spider came down and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  did it in one of the ants for me. Thank you, Spider. Charlotte, Charlotte, we like Charlotte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff's professor. Yeah, we press of journalism at the City University of New York. Great guy,  Buzz Machine dot com. Get his book. The latest is Geeks bearing gifts. There's also Gutenberg,  the geek, the Kindle single public parts and soon a book about ants. Dr. Mom says those could be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  termites. Jeff, are they? No, they could be. There could be something like that. That's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we're calling the experimenters. Get them out there. We can't do the show from inside a tent.  I just want to say no. No. Mr. Matt Cutts, always a thrill to have you. Matt Cutts dot com slash  blog at Matt Cutts on the Twitter. He's on the beach and enjoying every moment of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks so much for having me. It was a ton of fun today. I had so much fun. It's always the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  greatest. You give this show some dignity. Actually, we want you to quit Google so you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  can be on this. We do. We do. You have a standing offer. Can replace Gina. I have a hundred dollar

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bill. It could be yours. I'll bet Leo would get you a pixel. I'll get you a pixel. I'll get you.

Transcript:  You want a pixel? I got you a pixel. Leo takes good care of people. It's great to see you, Matt.  Thanks for joining us, everybody. We do this week in Google Wednesday afternoons, 1 p.m. Pacific,  4 p.m. Eastern Time, 2000 UTC at twit.tv. You can also watch on demand twit.tv slash twig.  I hope you enjoy the new site. We're still working on it. That site's great. I'm proud of it.  I'm very proud of it. It's gorgeous. It's worth every penny, eh?  You're not seeing all the money on the screen because a lot of the expense. People say,  why don't you use Squarespace? Because this site is actually, the site is the top layer of a huge  API written in Drupal that is part of our workflow. The editors start when this show is done.  The editor edits it and then goes into Drupal where the workflow goes and the Drupal handles  how things get encoded, where things go. It's all done automatically. That was the expense.  So you don't even really see it. And in fact, we've got a public API and we're inviting anybody  who wants to to create a new website or a hundred websites. Let a million websites bloom or little  snippets. Whatever you want to do. The API is very rich, very powerful.  You will control licenses to it, right?  Well, no. What we'll do is, as you always do with an API, you'll need an API key,  which we will freely give you.

Transcript:  So it goes through a site called 3Scale. I'm sure Matt knows about it. What 3Scale does is  gives us metrics on each key. If somebody's using 8 million hits a day on the site, obviously we're  going to pull the plug on them because we can't support it. But nobody would. I mean,  the nice thing about this is we don't put out shows every minute. It's more like every five  hours. So I don't anticipate a whole lot of traffic to do. Like, for instance, what the website does  is it's not very burdensome. So I'm excited. I mean, I'm going to start writing. People have  always asked us for years. I just want to download every single episode of a show.  And we just don't do that. RSS feeds are not designed to have hundreds of shows in them.  They would be massive. RSS feeds are really just to tell you, here's the new show, here's the new  show, here's the new show. But we could easily do a one-liner in almost any web programming language  to download every show, every episode of show. There's all sorts of notify you when a new show  is available, things like that. All that's through the API. More information at twit.tv.  If you click the button that says Learn More, we describe all of the behind-the-scenes machinations.  And we have a link. You can also email api at twit.tv and we'll get you hooked up. We're just  about to do that. Just about to do that. We had a few last changes to the API, a few more things  we wanted to put in. The documents are on apiary.io. Just Google twit and apiary. You should be able to  find those pretty quickly. Thank you, everybody. Very nice to see you all. And we'll see you next  time. I won't be here, actually. I should explain. I'm going on vacation for three weeks.
