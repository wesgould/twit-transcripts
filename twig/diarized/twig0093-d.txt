Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm in the Brooklyn.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Howdy, howdy.  Howdy, howdy.  Out there for a think up, think up stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How you doing?  Yeah, yeah, out in town meeting up with expert labs.  How you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you ever have an accent?  Did you talk like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I worked really hard in college to get rid of it.  And now it comes out when I'm very angry or very passionate.  So I'm sure you'll hear it at some point.  If you have, I think I've broken out the accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's like a scene from a movie.  You know she loves me when she starts sounding like that.  Oh, baby, baby, I'm doing.  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are you talking about?  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you talking about?  Like that's a typical thing I'll come out.  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you do the whole thing in Brooklyn today?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't do it on demand.  It just becomes, it's like this primitive, it's like the id.  You know what I mean?  Like it's this early version of myself before I went to college and decided it didn't sound  educated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You sound so educated now.  Yeah, she sounds so smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Kipsey New York, it'll do it to you.  Scrub out that Brooklyn accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  Really?  Here you probably noticed Jeff Jarvis.  He is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York and blogs at BuzzMachine.com,  the author of What Would Google Do?  I had one of your former students, Karina, in here.  Oh, really?  Yeah, she took a job.  You told her, don't, whatever you do, don't take a job at a newspaper.  So she took a job with Patch.com, which is AOL's kind of hyper local news.  Right.  Is she covering the town?  She covers Petaluma at Petaluma.patch.com.  Cool, wow.  Just wrote an article about me.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah, I think it was really cool to see her and hear that she was a Jarvisite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A CUNY graduate school of journalism.  There's a sign behind me, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I guess the big story of the week, the year, probably the decade is the Osama Bin  Laden site, or assassination, I should say.  But the interesting thing, of course, is all of the Google stuff.  I immediately actually, when it happened, went to Google Maps and somebody had marked  his compound.  And people have been ever since have been reviewing his compound with nasty reviews.  But there's actually some genuine value here to it because Google Earth has also been bin  Ladenized and people are doing 3D sketch up renderings of the compound that are, I think,  fairly accurate that you could see on Google Maps.  I'm like, for sale, open house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The instant shtick, the joking, the analysis, the interaction that happened that night,  I mean, it was amazing on Twitter and everywhere.  The fact that by the time you got to where you thought the compound was on Maps, it had  already been marked.  That's amazing.  I mean, it's Wikipedia, except it's everywhere.  For me, I was on Twitter most of the time waiting for the president to speak for a good  hour or so.  He was pretty late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would say all of us learned that the president's security speech, which was to come an hour  or so later, was most likely going to be that they had got bin Laden from Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mashable did a survey in cooperation with USA Today.  So it's one of those unscientific surveys, both because it's USA Today and because it's  Mashable audience.  But as I remember the numbers, 14% of that audience learned about it on TV, 18% on Facebook,  and Twitter was 43%.  Interesting.  Which says a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That audience is super skewed.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it says it's possible.  And once, I had a reporter from Reuters ping me and ask if this was a defining moment for  Twitter.  And I thought, well, okay, you know, the 20 is another one.  Every day is a new defining moment for Twitter.  But as I thought about it, trying to say something quotable, which is what I do, I realized that  I was watching Twitter in the foreground and TV was on in the background.  That's a big deal.  And TV just repeats and repeats.  The other thing that really struck me is because they were starting to show the scenes from  the White House and then later, of course, ground zero and Times Square.  And I said my quote to her that I then retweeted because you only have so many good lines is  that Twitter was the Times Square of this victory day.  Oh, that's good.  We all wanted to go and be with people.  And that's what we did on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Instead of kissing a nurse in Times Square, I went to Osama's compound.  Now there's a bunch of darts in here.  And a lot of reviews.  There was only one when I first went there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, being here in New York, my first instinct was I want to get on the train and  go to ground zero right now.  Yeah, I mean, it wasn't until my boss, Anil, who's much as a much more reasonable and thoughtful  person than I am, when he started to say, I mean, the conversation about the way that  people were reacting, I mean, this is just happening at light speed.  First, the death certificate, birth certificate jokes happened before Obama, you know, was  even near making the announcement.  And then, you know, this like, I want to go there and be with people.  I'm going to get silly string and like throw the beach balls around to it.  So like, oh, maybe maybe that isn't the, you know, the appropriate response.  What is the appropriate response?  How do I feel?  It happened so quickly.  Such a small span of time.  I was thinking about I was thinking about, you know, I was here in New York on September  11th. I know you were to Jeff and I know you wrote about it and you tweeted about where  you were standing. I thought about that day and I thought about what how would that day  have been different if there had been Twitter?  It would have been so different.  I mean, I would have felt a sense of connection.  I remember just a sense of panic and loneliness, like I'm not going to be able to get back  across the river to my family because I because the phones are jammed that I can't even  call my wife or call my mom.  Like it was this disconnection.  But, you know, Twitter had been working, although I don't know if data connections would have  been working either.  It would have been a different experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So well, as a master, Twitter might have been working.  You know, it was.  Yeah. And I think the people would have had a very different view of the event.  People witnessed the event from rooftops three miles away.  It was it was smoke going up.  Yeah. And that's where I was.  You know, the scenes that I say it was since that day, I I missed the  scenes that are seared in my brain, many of which I don't want to recall, but but some  that are amazing.  And I had no camera.  I started carrying the camera in my bag every day since then.  Of course, now, you.  Yeah. And and so, you know, what would have been recorded and seen, you know, there was  this wonderful project called I think it was called Here is New York.  That was a collection of photos that were from there.  That is a giant book and it's magnificent.  And I obsessed about the photos trying to because it was just so odd  what was happening. For those who don't know, I was I was in the last train into  the World Trade Center.  I stayed around like an idiot as a journalist, which is synonymous.  And I was a block away from the South Tower when it came down.  I was one of those guys who was covered in stuff covered in soot.  Yeah. And it's such a surreal, strange thing that you had to kind of remind  yourself what this was like.  And so if there had been thousands of cameras there live telling the world what  was happening there, it would have been terribly, terribly different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. And that's why I started blogging.  Really? It was like I.  Because everything had changed.  Everything had changed.  The city had changed. You change.  Everything changed. So after that, I was like I became obsessed with writing  everything down because because I have to remember it, you know, and just, you  know, I mean, the whole experience was just and that's when I started.  Yeah, that's when I started blogging.  I started my personal blog in a month or two later.  And Jeff, you started blogging because of 9-11 as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I started days later because I had more to say.  I wrote a story. If you go to my blog, there's a post high up that has a link to  the story that I wrote.  And then I had more to say the next day.  I thought honestly I was going to blog for a few days, a few weeks just to get it  out of my system.  But then, you know, little did I know, it changed my view of media, my career and my  life. And all of that was out of 9-11.  And there's also a link there to the audio that I recorded from from the day that I  was there. And the original blog was titled Warlog, World War Three, which was  kind of rather of the time.  And I was part of one of the original war bloggers.  Wow. That's the story.  And yes, well, that's you're right.  You know, it bin Laden's killing just just for me and the same for you.  It just went full circle and brought out all these memories and all these visions  and emotions.  And yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I was really happy.  But then it was like, you know, I lost a family friend and, you know, he's still  gone and now bin Laden's gone.  You know, it doesn't bring anybody back.  It's just someone else. Yeah, it was it was lots of whatever.  I don't mean this to turn into a therapy session, but it was very complex as it was  for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the other thing about Twitter, too, I think was was fascinating to me was that,  you know, I wanted to know what was happening at the World Trade Center.  I wanted to go there.  My heart was there and I couldn't.  Far more important was take my daughter to school the next day.  And but Matt Bishop, who is the New York bureau chief for the economist, said I'm  going to World Trade.  So, you know, I said pictures and he sent pictures, he said vision.  And it was so great to have that.  And of course, the great story out of all this was the was the technician, you know,  an old news. Now, the technician in Abu Dhabi who tweeted the event.  Yeah, that was and got hacked after that.  Oh, he did. I didn't know that part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he you know, his blog got a lot of traffic.  So he was sitting, I guess, sitting in a coffee shop.  He said there's helicopters flying over.  I wish I had my big swatter to fly it swatted away.  And then he said, oh, there was a big boom.  I hope this doesn't presage something horrible happening.  He actually, yeah, he basically live tweeted it, not knowing at any point what it was  till the next day, which just said you can't keep anything secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No kidding. Yeah, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm on reserve power, so I may cut out any moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so if Gina loses her Skype connection to us, she'll just phone in.  I'll call in. She'll sound like she's on the phone.  But other than that, she'll still be her same scintillating self.  Yeah, but I mean, it really it's funny how 10 years has been  such a huge shift from the CNN era to the the  is it the Twitter era?  Is it the social media?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter is just part of it.  Yeah. Right. But but yeah, I think that it changes  the whole thing.  You know, the other thing that that I've been saying lately,  I don't know if I said on the show yet, is that after watching a Larry  Lussig video recently that he talked about how the architecture of the web  is something we don't take and pay enough attention to.  And I realize that in Twitter, news is now  mimicking finally the architecture of the Internet.  It's going end to end.  That the the the witness over here and the the world over here  can talk to each other.  The journalist doesn't need to be there anymore.  Can be can add value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be my question about it all.  Does it?  Is there an advantage?  What do we gain? Do we do we get a better understanding of it?  I mean, certainly more immediate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We gain witnesses, we gain perspective, we gain questions, we gain  not jobs managed to push their their death or BS around.  Luckily, on Twitter, you can unfollow it.  Yeah, I think we gain mainly the witnesses.  That's what we gain.  Now, there were no witnesses to this event, but you gain witnesses  who are in the World Trade Center and things like that.  And that has value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And background and context, I found myself reading the Bin Laden  obituary that the Times published.  Like I went to the time I mean, I was on Twitter and listening to all the crack,  you know, all the jokes and all the feelings and all that stuff.  But then I went to the Times and was like, I want to read the story.  I want to watch the president and I read that obituary.  I learned things that I didn't know about him.  It just, you know, I think there's there's there's context and depth.  I think that you get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but you still go to the main  the mainstream media sources for reporting and factual information,  vetted information.  But you get it. But the but the colors are filled in  by the social media.  Yes, the place we can talk about it.  And yeah, and reaction and right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the key was that, you know, the grand national experiences  we had before really amounted to us all happening to watch the same show  at the same time. Right.  Right. Kennedy is killed and we're all watching.  We're all watching Cronkite announce it.  Right. And and that that passed.  People mourn the passing of that and say that we don't have that thing  that brings us together.  Well, we have things that bring us together in far better ways now. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, it was the largest sustained throughput on Twitter,  not the largest single tweets per second.  That goes to the Japanese New Year, of all things.  But the largest sustained tweets per second over a period of an hour or so.  And Google says they saw a one million percent increase in searches  for Bin Laden. So that's interesting, too.  It means that we not only go to Twitter and the New York Times,  but we then do searches.  Are we looking for current stories?  Are we looking to research bin Laden or are we looking for pictures?  What are we looking for? Yeah.  Between and this is between 730 and 830 p.m.  So that was when the news broke over Twitter.  So what that is, is people saying here.  Oh, I know what it is.  They read the tweet and they go, what?  And they are and they're going to Google to find the news story.  So that does validate.  Universal search has it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They know news is going to be part of search now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that validates the fact that we still want to go back to a mainstream source.  That's actually a good sign because it is.  You know, you want to hear it on Twitter doesn't mean it's true.  So you want to validate it.  It is a very different experience that we have.  But I the reason I ask that question is because I wonder  if there's this if it's a substantive change or if it's just, well,  now we have this additional stuff, does it really add to our understanding  of an event? It certainly has to the.  The color of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it is I think so, I absolutely do think so.  But again, it's the difference is whether it's an event  in which the witnesses add a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there were no witnesses, you know, if the Navy SEALs were tweeting.  Right. Yeah, I mean, never.  That's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think Navy SEALs.  I think Gina's right, too.  I think you start to get a sense of the mood about this.  You know, I was surprised when.  It didn't register with me when people started showing up  at the White House gates, chanting USA, USA and being happy.  And, you know, I got it pretty quickly.  I'm not stupid, but but that was not my reflex.  It was kind of like, oh, well, at last.  And, you know, I feel a little bad for myself that I'm no longer a pacifist.  And that's the reason why.  And being able to talk to other people and react to it.  I think I think Gina's right that, you know, getting that color  of the country's mood is something you could not have gotten before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You also get made up quotes from Martin Luther King and others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, right.  That's just a natural human error.  I was guilty of that.  Did you retweet the quote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I retweeted. Yeah, I retweeted the twain quote.  Was a twain quote made up as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I believe so.  Yeah, they were just a little too apropos,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a little too right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it was funny because I initially felt triumph  and saw people showing up at the gate and I thought, wow,  I'm feeling more patriotic than I felt, you know, in a really long time.  And then I started to see people on Twitter question celebrating a death like that.  And then and I started to sort of realign and be like, that's true.  Do I, you know, do I want to celebrate?  I have mixed feelings about this.  It's not just triumph.  So it helped me.  Certainly it helped me work through the thought process a little sooner  because I was listening to lots of different people  talk about their reactions and and otherwise I would have just been  watching TV and seeing thousands of people chanting USA, you know,  who would have been in diapers, you know, 10 years ago or 10 years old.  10 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Megan McArdle writing for the Atlantic did the I guess she did the original  research that said no Martin Luther King never said that, but she pointed out.  And I think this is really true.  It was a way for whoever created that fabricated that quote is a way for them  to say something that they didn't feel safe to say with their own words,  which is, you know, I mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives,  but it's hard to mourn a single person or hard to celebrate a single person's death.  And that's kind of politically incorrect to say at a moment like that.  Let me get the quote exactly right.  I mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives,  but I will not rejoice in the death of one, not even an enemy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're trying hard to get the quote right where the quote is right.  I know the fake quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me get the fake quote right.  But but she makes this point, which is  that it was a way for somebody to say something that was otherwise hard to say.  So, you know, it's not now now they're saying, by the way, not malicious, but mangled.  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you had to go back to what you're saying.  It was kind of therapy for me.  And my first tweet was ding dong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I saw that.  And I was like, yeah, wicked, which is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And then and then I, you know, turned around and I said pretty quickly  this is the moment to remember his victims.  And then I turned around and the anger came back out.  And I to clean it up just said my entire tweet was effort.  Yep. You know, and it was it was it was a back and forth just for me,  because Twitter is so immediate that the emotions just just are going to come out.  Like, you know, hate me. I don't care.  It's going to be me. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it was actually quite interesting.  The next day.  And I missed this. Otherwise, I would have said it right up front.  Megan McArdle followed up.  She's the business and economics editor for The Atlantic  on how this quote came about.  And actually on Facebook was a much longer quote,  which is from Martin Luther King, except for that first sentence,  which was the one retweeted.  And she found out who posted it first, a 24 year old Penn State graduate  who teaches English to middle schoolers in Kobe, Japan.  Jessica Dovey and.  Someone stripped and pasted the quote.  And stripped out the quotation marks, in other words, took her.  Her writing.  Oh, so she said, I will more.  And then in quotes put more from MLK, somebody  missed the fact that missed that subtlety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That happened so often, probably because they needed the one character to retweet it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, too many characters. Yeah.  So that's that's kind of but that's good reporting.  Great reporting. And I think it's good.  Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I retweeted the I never wished a man dead by read  some obituaries with great pleasure quote from Twain.  It was actually Clarence Darrow.  So the attribution was was incorrect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So but these things get corrected pretty quickly, too.  That's what that, you know, you optimist and triumphalist that I am.  It comes back around and the Internet is also pretty quick at correcting things.  Yeah, not in everyone's mind, but at least in sensible minds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's quite it's quite a fascinating  process, part of the telephone game that we're all playing these days.  Let's take a break and come back with more.  I think that we've.  Talked about this a little bit enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gee, a real upper for the beginning of the show here, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it was it's the story, isn't it?  It's a story. You can't not do it.  And yeah, we had to we have to talk about it.  Well, first of all, because both of you were there  in 2001, but also because  it really is the reason why we're here.  It's the reason why you're there.  It's right. Because you started writing because of that.  It gave you a voice.  Yeah. I think it's very interesting. Yep.  I did not know that about either of you, both of you.  It's kind of interesting.  But it's also. Where were you, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where were you when it hit?  She's frozen. That's what she's frozen.  I was going to call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's going to call and she's lost her batteries died.  We'll get her on. And I would like to know that.  Now we know that Jeff was literally in a building next door.  Which must have been.  Just very scary.  Zero. Yeah, I can only imagine.  And we'll get Gina and find out where she was before we do that,  though, I would like to take a break.  And we all need a little break right now and talk a little about carbonite dot com.  There are all kinds of disasters, some of them little,  some of them obviously quite big.  But the disaster you don't want to have happen to you is the data  on your hard drive lost forever.  Just think of what's on there.  Your first blog posts, your pictures of your kids being born,  your wedding pictures, your financial records.  I mean, I can go on and on. It's all on there.  And unfortunately, so many of us just don't make a copy.  We don't back it up.  It's just too much trouble or we forget to or we don't know how to.  And yeah, you may have an external hard drive  that you back things up to once in a while.  But really, what you really need is an automatic backup that's off site  on multiple servers in multiple locations.  That's when your data is really safe.  And that's what carbonite does so beautifully, so elegantly.  If you go to carbonite dot com right now,  you could sign up free for two weeks just to see what happens.  Use the offer code twig, T W I G.  So we get credit.  You'll put the software on your Mac or your PC.  And whenever you're online, it just backs up.  It trickles it off because it doesn't want to slow you down with your,  you know, your Internet access.  It doesn't want to slow your computer down.  So it's very polite in the background.  It trickles it up.  Depending on how much data you have, it may take some time  to get that first backup done from then on.  You're always backed up.  And you can always check that data anywhere you go just by going to carbonite dot com  and logging in from any computer or with a smartphone.  They've got Blackberry, Android and iOS applications that are free.  And you can see your data.  It's really cloud storage in addition to backup.  If you decide to buy it, it's it's the most affordable solution.  If you price all the other solutions, you'll see that at fifty nine dollars a year  for everything on your internal drive, there is no better price, no better value.  That's 16 cents a day for a true peace of mind.  Try it free for two weeks. Carbonite dot com offer code to it.  And if you decide to buy use, I'm sorry, offer code twig, T W I G.  And if you decide to buy, use twig again and they'll give you 14 months for the price of 12.  An additional two months free from carbonite dot com.  When disaster strikes, be prepared with carbonite.  You got to back it up to get it back.  Do it right with carbonite dot com.  Gina, are you on the phone now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, can you hear me? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Awesome. Sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's fine. This works just as well.  Gina lost her power or didn't have her power supplies, lived at work.  So her battery died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get more camera time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just means I can leave the leave the camera on.  I know it's all mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love doing twig.  There's always a plan B, which I really appreciate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And C and D, I just have learned that nothing ever works right.  Nothing ever works.  You get a plan for failure like Netflix, right?  I always always always plan to fail.  Never fail to plan.  So Jeff asked you when we when you when you disappeared,  where were you on September 11th?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At the time I was working at a company that was located on Hudson and Spring.  So I actually was I was on my way into work when the second  when the second plane hit, I was on the F train,  which is one of the only trains that goes outside and is elevated in Brooklyn.  I thought about training.  Everyone had stopped and was at the windows because the first tower was smoking.  So it looked like there was a fire, you know.  But then the second plane hit, you know, but we didn't see the plane.  We just saw the explosion.  And then the train went underground.  Everybody on the car was like, what is going on?  And, you know, I so I stayed on the train and I arrived in Manhattan  and walked down, walked down Hudson Street.  And it was just insane.  I saw people coming out.  I saw the jest of the world kind of walking uptown covered in soot.  And yeah, it was crazy.  So I was actually at a seat.  I mean, I was a safe distance.  I wasn't at a place where I didn't see people jumping.  I wasn't close enough to that.  So so I was about a mile and a half north.  You know, the train could stop and, you know, people were walking  across the bridge back to Brooklyn.  I hung out at the office of my coworkers for quite some time, you know,  because then we heard about the Pentagon.  I mean, it was that moment of panic of like, oh, my God, you know, the world's ending.  So I was at a safe enough distance, but certainly close enough.  He a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The eeriest moment for for the scene when I came in,  it was the last train under the first the north tower.  And I came up to the big concourse, the gigantic escalators up.  And I ride the concourse first was quiet, which is weird, never quiet.  And I look around all over the concourse and there were all over everywhere.  Women's shoes empty.  Hmm. They run that fast out of there.  Yeah. Yeah.  So anyway, we'll go on a happier Google.  That's a very twilight zone.  It really was. Holy. Yeah.  That's right before I was standing at one more story.  This will probably get me in trouble.  I'm standing at the block  with the south tower on Liberty, a little more than a block.  And and I'm looking up at the tower and I'm thinking  and I don't know enough about engineering and I'm thinking,  how are they ever going to get that fire out?  Idiot, I did, you know, can figure it out.  And I go there's a fire.  Yeah, they could do some way.  They can't burn forever. How is that fire going to get out?  How are they going to do it?  Because, of course, they are going to do that.  You know, when they when they arrives and I a tourist,  I'll let you guess what country the gentleman was from.  But he was taking pictures.  He had a camera. Yeah.  Yeah. And he got to me and said,  will you take a picture of me with a burning tower in the background?  And I said, oh, my God, people are dying.  He said, yeah, I remember that I survived.  Oh, boy. I said no.  Good for you.  And 10 seconds later, the towers.  Oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was when that when that.  Yeah, the first power went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we're talking disasters will stay with the disaster  because, of course, there have been some horrible tornadoes in Alabama  in the south and Google.  Again, we know more than ever before.  We can see what's going on on the Google blog.  They posted before and after pictures from Google Maps satellite views  of various places.  This is the University Place Elementary School in Tuscaloosa before.  And after.  And when you see pictures like this, you know,  it's the same thing as your first person accounts, Jeff and Gina.  We hear about these things from such a distance.  I don't think we really feel the same thing with the tsunami.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where when you see pictures, the swath, there's that one picture  I don't know where it is, but it just showed the swath that went across  that was just awe inspiring, just this long  because it was because the big one was was huge and stayed there for a long time.  And it's you're right.  It it it takes it away from the single shots.  And Google gives that global part of me perspective. Right.  Just that's that that that you should see the path.  Just that's what's so phenomenal. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hard to hard to imagine the destructive power.  This reminds me these were pictures remind me of the tsunami.  Yes. Yeah. Same kind of devastation.  You know, and it's tempting to think, wow, times are worse than ever before.  And I don't think so. I think we just can see it now. Yeah. Right.  Times have always been bad.  All right. I'm going to give you something more upbeat.  The it's it gets better campaign.  Gina, how did that it gets better campaign start?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So a columnist named Dan Savage, who does  he does a podcast called Savage Love, and he's a he's a very well known  and well liked columnist started this during the time that there were like  several teenage gay teenage suicides, like three or four in a row recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And abuse and beatings and beatings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And Dan, Dan started this campaign called It Gets Better.  Right. Because as you know, as a gay adult, I look back to what I felt like  when I was 15 or 16.  And I would do anything to go back in time and just say to myself,  it gets better because let me tell you, it does.  Yeah. And so this is this is what Dan did.  So he started this YouTube campaign where it was just it was him and his partner  just, you know, just kind of giving encouragement to gay teens.  Because when you're a gay teen, you're alone and you haven't told anyone  and you're scared. You don't know what to do.  So we started this YouTube campaign saying it gets better.  And then he asked other people, celebrities, regular people  to do their own clips, giving their own sort of it gets better message.  And he just he nailed it.  You know, it gets better. Those three words.  That's exactly what you want to tell teenagers and your and your former teenage  self when you're different anyway, not just gay, when you're suffering,  you know, when you're a nerd, when you're just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It gets better for everybody. Being a teenager is horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is being a teenager is horrible. Exactly.  Exactly. It's true. And that's an excellent point.  So it just it went viral.  I mean, so many people did so many touching videos.  There are a few that really stood out. Tim Guns was amazing.  There was this like I want to say a mayor in Texas  who did one that was also very, very touching.  Anyway, so Google and actually Google staff did one which we I think we played  or featured on the show. We did a few episodes ago.  I actually have not seen this yet because I'm in New York and things been crazy.  I have DVR Glee, so I've not seen this on TV yet, but I watched it on YouTube.  Google did a chrome commercial  based on featuring the it gets better videos and original message.  And then a montage of other of other messages  basically showing how Google products like YouTube and I guess something like Chrome  get this message across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me play it because I think it's really worth  giving them a minute on on Twig to see it. Yep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  High school was bad.  I was obviously gay and some kids didn't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I did get harassed.  What I'd love you to take away from it is that however bad it is now,  it gets better and it can get great.  And it's important for adults to reach out to kids and share our stories  so that they can picture futures for the better.  And I think that's what I want to do.  I want to make sure that we're not just talking about the past.  And share our stories so that they can picture futures for themselves  that are worth sticking around for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, little ones, here's the first thing you need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You are perfect and wonderful exactly as you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not alone.  There are a ton of us out here in this world.  We love you without even knowing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's art to be made.  There are songs to be sung.  So hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at me, 80 years old, it gets better with age.  Listen to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It gets better.  It gets better.  It gets better.  It does get better.  So much better.  You'll be fine, partner.  Your life can be amazing,  but you have to tough this period of it out and you have to live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, it's such a great commercial and it's so classy of Google to stand back.  And yes, the message there is you use the Internet to do all these wonderful things  and that's great.  But it really is Google handing over the front of that platform to them.  Yeah.  And it also was during Glee, which is like the gayest show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just so perfect.  Well, you got to figure if you're a gay teen, you're watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're watching.  No doubt.  Along with millions of other people like me.  I'm completely choked up.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I hate to say this, but Cinex might say, well, it's a Google ad.  I mean, they're kind of taking advantage.  Are they taking advantage of this?  They did manage to get some.  For those of you listening, you didn't see every product used.  Whereas a Google product, there's YouTube, there was Blogger.  I mean, they congratulated Dan.  They congratulated Dan.  They said this is important.  But it was a Google ad for sure.  No doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they were promoting Google as a platform for whatever message.  That message, the web is what you wanted to be.  That's what they were doing.  They're promoting the web as a platform and Google's tools as a platform to make a change.  And that to me, I love that message.  I mean, if I didn't believe in that, I wouldn't be here.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I wouldn't be working on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm just saying, I love that message.  I think it goes beyond that.  I think that it also says that a decent company can create tools and create the means that people can then do great things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And a decent company respects people for doing these things.  And Leo, you're right.  When I saw it, my socks were blown off because it's very moving.  And it was so impressive to see it in that form.  And it's what you said earlier.  It's not just the campaign.  I don't want to dilute its message, which is about being a gay teenager, but it's about the trouble of being whatever you have trouble with in life.  And you know what?  It's for adults.  It's for everybody.  Exactly.  It's not just for teenagers.  And for anybody for whom life is not perfect, it gets better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And that's the whole point.  And you know, so many PSAs are aimed at, don't bully, don't do the bad things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I love about this is it's aimed at the, I hate to use the word victim, but the objects of the bad behavior to say, no, you're OK.  And it's going to get better.  And that's a really powerful message for people.  And I think that Google used the word victim to say, no, you're OK.  And that's a really powerful message for people.  And I think that Google used expensive time to basically share its time with that message is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also promote that the web gets you connected to people who are like you, even when you feel like there's no one else like you and no one else that knows your experience.  Like on the web, you will find those people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an ad for the Internet, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an ad for the Internet.  Exactly.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're doing something right.  According to a Harris survey, Google has the top brand reputation of any company in America.  Google scored a, they call it a reputation quotient of 84.5.  That made it number one ahead of Johnson & Johnson, the 3M company, Berkshire Hathaway, then Apple, then Intel, then Kraft, then Amazon, then Walt Disney and General Mills.  All in the 80s.  I mean, I don't think any of those companies would feel bad being in that top 10.  But Google the best.  I mean, it makes sense, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like, did you Google it?  Like I know something, Google gives it to me.  Yeah.  You know, like that's what it is.  Like I had a thought and then Google filled in the blank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The categories that they, there are 30,000 people were surveyed.  So it's a very large sample of their opinions of the top 60 most visible companies in the US.  The categories include emotional appeal, products and services, social responsibility, vision and leadership, workplace environment and financial performance.  Boy, I'd have to you'd have to score Google 10 out of 10 on all those.  Except maybe emotional appeal, although when you see an ad like it gets better, they're doing a very good job of scoring high there.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were.  I think there's an emotional appeal.  At the same time, Leo, the brand Z brand value came out where they put a monetary value to top 100 global brands.  Google is number one again this year has been since they've been doing it for five years.  It's up 14 percent and they put a nominate do this wrong.  If it's if it says one hundred fourteen thousand and it's in dollars and millions, is that one hundred fourteen billion or is that one hundred fourteen trillion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ask the programmer. I'm just some schmuck on TV.  I don't have my calculator.  I don't even understand the question, Gene.  I suppose I heard the numbers. I went, huh? Squirrels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's worth a lot. It's worth just incredible about it.  It's a lot.  A lot. IBM number two, oddly, Apple number three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know why I put you get IBM in there. How do you get IBM in there?  It's worldwide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Classy.  Yes. So Microsoft for Coca Cola five McDonald's six.  I got to point out that Marlboro number says worldwide Marlboro number seven.  That's Japan. Put that one over the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say Facebook on this Harris poll.  Thirty first place way down, but still better than the bottom of the heap.  You want to take a guess who the worst the worst companies were?  The lowest rated companies, AIG, BP, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup.  I think you get the I think you get the message here.  And I couldn't disagree. I couldn't I couldn't agree more with with that assessment.  Wow. I mean, these are just polls.  I don't think they have that much value, but I think I think it's fairly accurately representing  the fact that Google, despite all the stuff we talk about, the privacy issues, the creepy factor  and all of that is still considered a quality brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Apple that Apple's fifth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think, of course, this I don't know if this came about at the same time as the location data  or location gate, as they're calling it.  The interesting thing is Apple did a really good job, I think, of saying, hey, it's not us.  It's Google. It really pointed the finger.  I mean, Steve virtually said that in the interview with Ina Fried at All Things D.  He says, why aren't you guys I hope you guys will look at the other people.  And we know who the other people are. What are they doing?  And he you know, he does make a point. Unlike there's there's different approaches.  Google is a little more upfront to begin with about what they're doing.  Both of them, I would say, do exactly the same thing.  We should say I mean, this is this is the business that they're in is collecting information about their users  to sell the marketers or for other reasons.  But Google does tell you more upfront.  But Apple has an advantage because before any programs allowed to use your location data on an iPhone,  it warns you and you can never turn that warning off.  That's permanent. Apple also today put out an update fixing the location bug.  They claim a bug in iPhones, a six hundred sixty six megabyte download.  I don't know how the Internet survives this stuff. Thirty five million iOS users, all of whom are going to download.  Now they're going to get your calculator out for that one. Six hundred sixty six megabytes.  Holy bandwidth, Batman.  But I do think Apple does does does win the award on that one first, because any time it locate now  when it turns on the microphone or camera, they don't tell me.  But any time an app says, you know, any time I use a location, the app says, well, maybe actually now I'm doing four.  I guess it doesn't do it every time. Eventually it gives up and says, OK, I guess you want to allow it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But now I'm questioned from an iPad news.  I need to hook my iPad up to my Mac in order to get the notification about the about the update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. That's correct. There's no push.  So so whatever your iOS device, you'll have to connect it.  And in fact, mine, it didn't alert me. I had to say check for update.  Although I imagine it would have. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of iPads. Yes. It's a crow moment.  He bought another one. Well, yeah, I mean, it's the only one I have.  But I have you know, you can't see, but I have an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it a one or a two? It's a two.  It's a two. Eileen Rivera, who hosts our All About Android show, produces this show, is shocked.  She I mean, she had that moment.  She had we're going to call it the Hillary Clinton moment now.  She covered her mouth. I'm not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, my God. Somebody please Photoshop that. Oh, they already are.  Yeah. Yeah. I see. Channel, please. Somebody Photoshop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get Eileen in there covering your mouth instead of.  Well, here's the pathetic thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I can show the laptop to I've actually walked around the house with my iPhone, my Galaxy Tab and my iPad and my laptop.  How sick is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To do what? Play Angry Birds? No, this is your job now.  Now that you are a full fledged Internet superstar, you must carry all of these at all times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you forget your charger somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you're back to the telephone. Yes.  So for those who don't know, we're talking about the it's the very famous situation room of the president and secretary of state and probably members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the situation room.  Apparently getting the news that Osama bin Laden had been killed.  It is now the second most viewed picture on Flickr in just about three or four days.  Yeah. And yeah, they're they're putting people from Jersey Shore in there.  I don't know if you noticed the one I'm showing you.  There does seem to be a topless fellow behind the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The little girl from the balcony of the royal wedding is there at the table next to Hillary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, with her hands over her ears.  You know, I put this up. I thought this was the actual picture.  I didn't notice that Mike, the situation, Sorrentino was standing bare chested behind the president.  That's just well, I just thought it was maybe that was Chuck Norris because wasn't he involved?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love remix culture. Yeah. Isn't it great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, others have noticed PC magazine in particular that both Vice President Joe Biden  and Secretary of State Clinton use Hewlett Packard notebook computers.  I don't I don't know if we care.  You know, this picture was made to edit because there's this all this blank space behind the president here  that you could really do almost anything with.  So yeah, get ready. The meme is on its way.  Although it's such to be honest, it's such a serious and momentous picture.  It's a picture. One of those pictures that you know you will see for decades to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A friend of mine named Rex Hammock, a blog Rex blog, wrote about the pictures and say, why was it so powerful?  And his assumption was that you're looking at the president in this moment.  But then he got the original photographer size and went around and realized that, no, it's Hillary that is the focus of the picture.  That that that her eyes, if you look closely at it and her expression are quite amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're exactly right.  What happens is you first see the president and then and then you go and then you see Secretary Clinton and it is quite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm surprised I haven't seen remixes of the pixelated piece of paper on her laptop.  Or was that pixelated? It is pixelated.  Clearly porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Clearly porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm. That looks like a map.  Yeah, that looks like a map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also looks like there's no Wi-Fi there.  No, look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's overdo the semiotics.  Well, in the situation room, you would hope there's not Wi-Fi.  That would be very depressing, but they've all got their ethernet cables plugged in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the White House just published a picture of everybody's Blackberry at the outside of a room.  They're getting there in a briefing and I guess you have to surrender your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an older picture that was posted a year or two ago when Obama first took office and they leave their Blackberries outside.  That is a dramatic picture as well. Yeah.  If you don't follow the White House Flickr stream, you should.  I think it's Pete Souza. I think all those pictures come from Pete Souza.  He's quite amazing.  We'll see Gina on it coming up.  You might. Gina's going to the White House.  By last night, 3.6 million views.  3.6 million views of that photo on Flickr, making it the second most viewed.  The first most viewed took years to get to the higher number.  So I have a feeling this is going to be the most viewed photo of all time on Flickr.  Again, another example of how we're getting our news direct from, you know, in this case from the White House, which of course the White House loves.  Yes. Because it gets to control the image making. Very powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw some controversy on one of the press blogs today on Romanesco today that after Obama gave the speech, he went back to the podium in front of the teleprompter and photographers came in to take pictures of him.  Oh, really? Interesting.  And people say, well, you know, it's staged. What the hell isn't staged in life?  It's all staged.  Yeah, it's all staged. Sorry. Sorry to bluster public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there is a tradition. I remember this when I worked for NBC. There's a tradition.  And it's in the green book that they hand out to all employees that you don't stage news events, that you only take pictures as it happens.  At no point are you allowed to say to the newsmaker, would you stand here so I can get a better background?  That's not the case anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? That's you're the I just had I had I don't know Inside Edition or one of those kinds of shows to come and do the death or a story today in my office here.  And they're dressing the set. They're moving the stuff around behind me.  They're telling me repeat this with that word and that word. Of course, it's not exactly NBC News.  It's Inside Edition. Yeah. What were they asking you about?  The death or thing and conspiracy theories. And does the Internet make it worse? Right.  It's like it's like asking me whether this was a defining moment for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know it's kind of it's kind of sad that we need to go through this.  But this is why I Twitter exists because I got so sick of mainstream media coverage of technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amen, brother. I heard you. I heard you before between the between the two shows that you said this show will never be on cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and it's a mutual, by the way.  They don't want me as much as I don't want them.  So this is presumably the staged doesn't look staged picture after the speech.  Yeah. I mean, I don't you know, I don't know.  I think it's if it's Pete Sousa taking the picture, he's a good photojournalist.  And I and I don't think that most of these are staged. No, that's different.  He's he's he is the White House photographer.  It's his job to get compelling images for history.  Not he's not a journalist. Right.  I do wish I do hope that journal that there is some ethos still in journalism that you don't.  Oh, well, you don't stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give it up, Pollyanna. Give it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's nothing real. I get a fronted.  I get a fronted. You know, we I think we were in a situation where we were about to do something in the case.  And the producer of the shooter said, can you do that again? I said, no.  What do you know? I get a fronted.  That's staging. I'm the last old man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, on on the on the show, on the media, on NPR, a wonderful show.  Yeah. At first, I went in there to do the show.  The show that is walking out of the hall, the producer said, you know, I should tell you that we we edit Bob Bob Garfield.  I didn't know why he told me that.  And you get in and Bob, God bless me. He's a friend and I love me.  He's very good on the show, but he from first through questions.  He changes five times around. Wow.  He changes everything. And they did a great story.  The correspondent who did it died this year. Great story.  About five years ago, where they went through and confessed this is how we do an NPR show.  Yeah. You know, they call themselves sometimes sound Nazis.  They are sound Nazis. They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I thought too much. They won't let me.  I was going to do a I think all things considered a morning edition piece.  And they and with this set up and they said, no, no, we can't use it.  It's pop. You're popping too much.  Oh, wow. I jumped through hoops.  It took an hour. You see high standards, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those are the highest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But again, I think that that gets sometimes a little bit in the way of spontaneity and authenticity.  Oh, it doesn't ever.  It doesn't ever. We're to take a break.  Come back with more.  Gina Trepani is here via phone from Brooklyn.  Jeff Jarvis via Skype from New York City.  And we are talking about the Google.  Somebody tweeted me, why don't you do a cloud computing show?  This is it. We just call it this week in Google, but really it's all about the cloud.  And it's you know, it's a lot about media.  It's about how the Internet and society and all of that.  Jeff, did you get an invite to go to the EG8?  Yes.  Good. We can we can be roomies.  I got an apartment. So you did. Yeah.  All right. Yes.  So don't worry about the hotel.  I still have to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want it on the sleepover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can come.  There's plenty of plenty of room.  See you in Paris.  I'm flying out May 20th through the 27th.  Wow. You're really going.  You know why?  If you don't stay over on a Saturday, they kill you.  The airfare is twice as bad.  And it's Paris.  Yeah.  If it were Topanga Canyon, maybe it'd be a four day, a two day trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have the all my entrepreneurial journalists are doing their presentations to VCs on the 23rd.  Oh, so I got to fly out that night.  Oh, my goodness.  I have that ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I didn't want to be jet lagged, but good.  You just tell me what to say and I'll I'll be right out of Bushy.  We're going to also talk about video chat on your Android phone.  It's here.  Google I.O. Gina and I will be at Google I.O.  We'll tell you what that is.  I'm jealous about that.  Yes.  See, I get to hang with Gina next week.  But first, let me tell you about Netflix.  The great way to get movies right into your own home.  You know, Netflix really pioneered the idea of no late fees.  That's why I first became a Netflix customer in 2000.  I've been a member since December 2000 and thousands of movies later.  I'm just a huge fan.  DVDs by mail and as little as one business day.  I have a five disk queue.  You can have as many as one to five disks.  And what happens is you just hold those disks.  So you watch the movie, then you mail it back in their prepaid mailer.  Those famous red envelopes used to have one here somewhere.  Probably mailed it.  And then you get another movie and the turnaround is like a day or two.  It's amazing.  But you can get it even faster with the may even better watch instantly feature  that Netflix debuted a year or so ago.  I have to say this is getting bigger and bigger.  In fact, as I look at it, almost every day I'll go to Netflix.com slash twit  and I'll see that they have added more first run movies, mainstream stuff,  television shows.  They're just growing this thing like crazy.  And the beauty of this is you can watch any of these movies right now  with your Netflix account.  All you have to do is go to Netflix.com slash twit.  You can get this free for 30 days.  You know, movies that I missed in the theater, TV shows that I'd like to go back  and see like Glee, classics too.  Like how to get ahead in advertising.  I never did see that when that came out.  I just I die to see this.  So there you go.  I can watch that right now.  Just press that button and I'm watching it.  In fact, really, the truth is it's hard to get to work sometimes because I just want to watch one more movie.  How about Spinal Tap?  When you when you hear them say it goes to 11, you they're talking about Spinal Tap.  What a great movie.  Wouldn't it be fun to go home and watch that tonight?  You can instantly you could do it.  You can set it up right now so you can watch it tonight on your on your TV set.  Instead, if you've got a Roku box or PlayStation 3 or an Xbox or a Wii, many Blu-ray players even have Netflix.  It's kind of the gold standard.  You're not really Internet connected if you don't have a Netflix account on your device.  Of course, your computer to try it free for 30 days.  You get the movies in the DVDs in as little as one business day and watch any movie.  I love this local favorites for Petaluma.  They actually because they know I'm in Petaluma, they say this is what your neighbors are watching.  They have good taste.  They're watching Battlestar Galactica all 76 episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of that puts you over the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's time for a rewatch on the BS.  Yeah, I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I'm I'm absolutely I missed a few in the middle there, too.  My so-called life.  Oh, that was a good one.  Classic teen drama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was like the original teen drama.  The whole Twin Peaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was just wild.  I wouldn't mind watching that again.  Baseball season's here.  How about Ken Burns baseball?  All you got to do.  Oh, and the original Swedish.  The girl who played with fire and the girl with the dragon tattoo.  The I like the Swedish versions.  They're so good and they're really kind of dark.  If you're in the mood for a dark kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, those are beautifully shot.  I watched those on Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Aren't they great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love Netflix when you're traveling, too.  Like, I love that I watch something on my Roku at home and then now I'm on the road  and I just brought up my iPad and just resume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's great on the iPad, the iPhone, too.  And they not the Android phone yet, but soon.  Netflix dot com slash twit, not twig, but twit.  Give it a try.  If you have not yet a member, don't forget.  And I do this all the time.  You could give gift certificates.  My mom every year on her birthday, she gets a year's worth of Netflix.  And I think that's really great.  That's a good idea.  Oh, it's the well it's they do it by email.  Let's see if I can find that here.  It's really gift subscriptions.  I give subscriptions so you could get a month to get it.  But I just every year on our birthdays, a mom.  And this is the by the way, the seven ninety nine a month is probably what I'll start doing.  That's no DVDs, but just watch instantly for nine ninety nine a month.  You get watch instantly plus a DVD at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, everybody, Mother's Day is upon us.  Wouldn't this be a great gift for mom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you can see even they even mail it with a card.  Yeah, I mean, email it.  So that's kind of nice because you you know, dear mom.  A gift for you from Netflix, Netflix dot com slash Twitter.  I'm moving right along here.  Google I.O. What is Google I.O.  Gina, we're going next week, right?  We're going to cover it, I think we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are. Google I.O. is pure awesome.  That's what it is.  It's a developer event at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.  It's next week, the 10th and 11th.  And you know, it's really fun.  It's a developer focused conference, but there's often goodies and announcements at the keynote.  Right. So the first keynote is Tuesday at nine.  And I'll be there if I am Monday night and I fly out Wednesday night.  And yeah, I'm hoping to cover it.  I would love to see you.  Are you going to come to the Moscone Center?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we were going back and forth.  And I think, you know, last year we covered the Tuesday keynote and it turned out all the big announcements were on Wednesday.  We're Wednesday. Right.  I don't know if Google has gotten it together or not, but we are going to come for the Tuesday keynote.  You and I will be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then we may.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. Should we have Tom sit in the studio and cover it?  I guess we should.  And then you and I will come out and we'll talk about it.  And then Wednesday, I guess we'll cover it on this week in Google later in the day.  But we'll do our regular time.  Do you think? Yeah.  Do you think that we'll see what big announcements do you expect?  Do you expect anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you know, I tell you, I haven't really kept up on one of the rumors.  You know, it's interesting.  I mean, last year it was all sort of about Google TV.  Right. And last year, Wave was still alive and well and very much present at that event.  This year, obviously, Wave is going to be around.  And I'd be interested to see, you know, are there going to be.  I mean, I feel like this year is going to be all about tablets and honeycomb because Android is a huge presence.  They want developers to develop on Android.  So if it goes like last year, I imagine there's going to be some Android related announcements, hopefully, maybe a new device.  Perhaps if the attendees will get, I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's every year so far they've done that, haven't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, every year so far.  And then maybe hopefully some Google TV announcements.  I just feel like Google TV, you know, it launched and it's not so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a flop. In fact, Logitech says, well, we only sold what was it?  Five million dollars worth.  So it's a real flop. So this is the Google I.O. official Android app.  So there's a map schedule sessions.  You can do this five days, 18 hours, 43 minutes and 16 seconds until Google I.O.  There's even and I like this on the app, a real time stream.  So even if you can't make it there, you could download it.  And this is the Twitter stream and follow what people are saying about it.  I wonder if they're going to have in the real time stream video as well, perhaps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do like that.  The report is that the new Google TV is going to come out.  So basically what we spent the last year is nobody's used Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do I do with my three hundred dollar boat anchor then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It really needs a market. It really needs more apps.  I mean, I just it's in dire need of an update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, you know, some dark horse candidates for things Google might announce.  It's Google's social effort, which does refuses to die.  I don't know if it's going to be called Google Me, but we keep hearing rumors about it.  Some sort of unified social effort.  Google Music, I don't know what happened to that.  They announced that last year at Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did. That's actually a very viable candidate for an announcement this year.  I bet that would get people excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So we'll cover it.  And they didn't talk about it last year. Yeah.  We'll be there. And if, you know, if nothing exciting happens, you and I go out, I get a plate of spaghetti.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Beautiful. Beautiful. I get you some pizza.  Actually, I wouldn't. I'd be embarrassed to give you a California pizza.  Nothing good out here.  Even the places, there's places here like called New York pizza.  That's not New York pizza. That's not New York.  What are you talking about? New York pizza.  Take your pizza and shove it where the sun don't shine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're good, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm learning from the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love the conference app, though.  I think I've been to more conferences lately that use an app.  I went to the GitHub conference and they used Conventionive, which is sort of a generic app where you can load your data in.  So I really appreciate not having to deal with paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought that real time stream, which seems to be mostly Twitter, but I thought that was really kind of a cool idea to be able to, you know, open up your app and say, well, what are people talking about?  You're sitting in the speech. I mean, we'll be using it on Tuesday for sure.  We we have now an explanation, according to Giga Ohm from Eric Schmidt, about how Google hires.  Actually, Eric could probably talk about how Google fires as well.  Oopsies. Did I say that?  Oopsies.  See, here are some tips.  Eric Schmidt passes along for getting a job with Google. Be exceptional.  We you know, you've heard about the brain teasers and so forth.  But Schmidt says we spend we spent more time and pretty much ruthlessly on academic qualifications, intelligence, intellectual creativity, passion and commitment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I find irony that they go they still go after the school thing.  They're big on academics, which is kind of ridiculous because, you know, I argue that schools are not good at preparing people to be Google because they teach you to do the predictable thing.  I agree.  People who should be they should go after Google.  I mean, this is Peter Thiel says Peter Thiel, you know, is offering money to people to support people to drop out of school.  You should go after the dropouts.  Oh, yeah. Yeah. He's got he's got a scholarship and the scholarship is to pay you not to go to college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Is he considering an investment?  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, college ruins you.  And this is very Peter Thiel, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's the guy who put half a million in Facebook is now worth billions because of it.  Not his only investment by any means, but just a good one.  I'm the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Thiel Fellowship is called the foster of the next generation of tech visionaries.  I'd like to get that.  I think we're too old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, damn. I dropped out of school.  He can give me a little money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You comply if you're under 20, whether you're in high school, college or not in school, and you have a great answer to one of these questions.  You can get a grant for one hundred thousand dollars from Peter Thiel.  Wow. Good.  Good on him.  That's the kind of that's the kind of F you to the Google way.  Yeah. You know, Google, you got to have a four.  Oh, that story says you better have at least three sevens as the three seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I do think that they're looking for some sort of metric because, you know, you got probably millions of people applying.  You also have to have the ability to answer math questions over the phone with no calculator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fail. I didn't even understand the question.  At least Gina got out the calculator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I sarapitiously Google answers the question?  No, Google interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I wonder if maybe you could use Wolfram Alpha.  Eric says, do your own thing.  They're looking for people who don't need much management.  At Google, we give the impression of not managing the company because we don't.  It sort of has a few of the recent problems.  Yeah. He says it sort of has its own Borg like quality, if you will.  It sort of just moves forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they need to hire a few Navy SEALs.  I love Eric Schmidt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At this point, he is just as anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything. It's own Borg like quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not I think comparing Google to the Borg is really a good idea.  He says, not necessarily to have a winning personality.  He says, you're going to have to deal with the odd people.  Not every single one of those incredibly smart people is what we call a team player.  Even if people don't want them around, we still need them.  They all have the garlic pizza.  Yeah. Hi, what's up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Garlic pizza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Hi, what you working on?  You know, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would take someone who is easy to work with over someone who's super smart, but a pain in the butt.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's why you're not Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, right. And that's why I couldn't even get an interview at Google when I tried back in like...  You couldn't? I never heard that story.  Yeah. Oh, yes. I tried really hard through a friend who worked there.  I had kind of an internal recommendation.  They would not even call me.  Like it was like not even...  Wow.  Do they say why?  I mean, they know they didn't say why, but you know, I didn't go on an IV.  I mean, I did well in school, but I went to a pretty like mediocre school.  She's from Brooklyn?  Yeah, I'm in Brooklyn, right?  But you know, at the time I didn't have a whole lot of personal projects that were like...  You know, if I hadn't started any open source projects, I hadn't done personal work.  I had work experience, but I hadn't gone out really and done my own thing.  So I think that's probably where I went wrong. Although I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean, obviously anybody who looks at Gina Trapani would say Google made a mistake.  There was an opportunity there.  Yeah, a big mistake.  So this is not a perfect system by any means.  The other thing, and I know this for a fact because Colleen, our former chief engineer, went to Google.  And they said be prepared because you're going to be...the interview process basically never ends.  And then Smith said Google had interviewed some people as many as 16 times before deciding not even to hire them.  They've decided now the interview process should be made in five interviews.  But how many times did Colleen go back? I can't remember.  But it took a couple of years and dozens of interviews.  Years it took?  Yeah.  So impressed with her persistence.  She lived to work for Google.  And you always knew that, right?  She told me before I hired her, she said, OK, but I got to warn you.  Google comes calling.  I'm leaving.  And I said, fine.  You know, I encouraged it.  And, you know, we watched as she applied again and again.  And it was kind of she was really had a good spirit, but it was kind of heartbreaking for me because she'd go through this long process and they get very close.  She the first time she got down to the last, I think, three or four people and they declined her.  And she was I mean, she was this close.  And then but but the good news is and this is maybe a lesson for anybody who's been applying at Google.  They do apparently keep you in the system because they call back later, months, maybe a year later.  And she went through another long, grueling process where you just talk to all these people.  You know, it's it's I understand it.  What a challenge it is to figure out how to hire somebody.  I think and they're very engineering driven, but I think you could be too engineering driven.  Yes. Video chat coming to the Android phone.  If you ever get two point three point four.  I guess the Nexus one is getting it first or is it the Nexus?  I think it's the next access. OK. When?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the next few weeks. Awesome.  Part of the Android two point three point four over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Update. Awesome. And so it'll be basically like FaceApples FaceTime.  You'll have a it'll be part of the G talk and you'll have a video that'll use the front facing phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sounds pretty cool. Yeah, it looks pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are screenshots on the but you have to have gingerbread two point three point four.  And they say they will launch it to other two point three plus devices in the future.  My G two X is still two to two.  Although I think we're going to say an agent is going to come on all about Android and mod it.  I'm going to get I'm going to get the say agent modding my phone.  Right on. Isn't that cool? Great.  Good. Good on Jason Howell and Eileen Rivera who booked Cyanogen on their show to mod my phone.  I feel like I'm in good hands, but that we're still waiting.  The mod isn't stable yet. We'll be stable soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you'll see if your next guest can mod your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who's my next guest?  Captain Crunch. Yeah, no way.  Hey, hey, John, what can you do with this?  Yeah, with triangulations coming up in about an hour with John Draper, Captain Crunch.  That he's he's just a walking piece of computer history is what he is.  I'm a little disappointed.  Google has agreed to play ball with carriers who want to pull tethering apps from the marketplace.  Yeah. And as this is my next says Chris Ziegler writing,  this kind of violates the spirit of open access, does it not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can Google learn now that playing with phone companies gets you in trouble?  It's always bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate whenever something like this happens.  Everyone's like, oh, how open is this?  Like everyone takes that that word open and kind of throws it back.  Yeah. It's definition of open.  It makes me a little crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There were people talking about this on Howard forums that said,  at least in the case of Verizon's 4G phones, blocking the tethering apps could be in violation of open access regulations.  Section 2720 of Title 47, which says, quote, licensees offering service on spectrum  subject to this section shall not deny, limit or restrict the ability of their customers to use the devices and applications of their choice on the licensee C block network.  In other words, if you sell a device that uses this network, you cannot restrict the ability to use applications of your choice.  Unless it violates the network's technical standards and violates or regulatory compliance.  But not just because you don't like it, just because it's tethering.  Well, I mean, who didn't expect that this would happen?  Let us I'm not going to do a royal wedding story, so let's move on.  Let us get our.  Yeah, I'm very good about avoiding the royal wedding.  Thank goodness they killed Osama bin Laden and just wiped our memory of Kate and Wills off the face of the.  And Donald Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although I had to say I enjoyed him just sitting there simmering during the correspondence dinner.  Doing in his own juice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now knowing what was going through Obama's head at that moment.  Oh, man, it's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's hard to imagine that Obama didn't want to take a little victory lap there, you know.  Hey, will you hear what I do tomorrow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tune in tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just stay tuned.  I'm not going to say I'm not going to say, but you're going to like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your deal with meatloaf.  I'm getting the worst man on earth.  Yeah. OK. You know, Donald, you got the hair.  I got the guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Time for our tool and tip and number of the week.  Let's start with Gina Tripati and her tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody is listening to twig.  You know, we reported that Google Video was shutting down and there was April 29th deadline to download your video.  That April 29th deadline is no longer.  And there is now an upload video to YouTube option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are listening. They are listening.  So you have to create a YouTube account and you log into Google Video and then there will be options to download and to send to YouTube.  So still got time. If you got some old Google Video clips you want to salvage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is this is great. This is fantastic.  This is about time.  Though when I search for video, unfortunately on YouTube, rather on Google itself, it does not go to Google Video anymore.  It only goes to YouTube. So the beginning of the end is here.  In fact, I don't remember even how to get to Google Video.  Is it Google dot com slash video or video dot Google dot com?  No, both give me a video search.  Which does not which dumps me into YouTube.  That's kind of that's kind of sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Has anybody gotten the voice? You haven't gotten the voice search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's that?  That's exciting.  They are adding voice search to web.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the latest builds of Chrome, I think.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's in a beta. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was a speech input.  By the way, I don't even know why they use version numbers anymore in Google Chrome, but we are at 11 all of a sudden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It turned up to 11.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our number. That is not our number of the week.  It's not.  And Jeff Scott, the number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One hundred billion.  You can guess what that is pretty easily.  Evidently, that's the guest number now for the valuation when Facebook goes out.  Wow.  And then the WPO sometime next year that the revenue will justify that.  Folks are telling the Wall Street Journal.  Its profit is growing at a rate fast enough to justify a valuation of one hundred billion or more when it goes public.  Holy camole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's probably and more or more is probably really the number or more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that would value Zuckerberg's personal fortune at twenty eight billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, he's going to be he's going to be worth twenty eight billion before he hits twenty eight years old.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the new club.  Yeah.  You have more billions than your aid.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you could be in that club, do what is Gatesworth?  Oh, I think it's I don't you know, it used to be thirty two billion.  I don't know what it is.  It's a lot.  Yeah.  An awful lot.  What does it matter?  What does it matter?  My tool of the week actually is stripped from the headlines.  And I thought a fascinating story.  You remember Uber Media, which is Bill Gross's company that's been buying up Twitter clients.  They own Twidroid, which was for a long time my favorite on Android, a really great client and a few others.  And as a result, own something like 11 percent of all the tweet traffic tried a few months ago to buy tweet deck, which would give them a significant portion of all of Twitter's traffic.  Twenty percent.  And give them an opportunity to something do their own as someone rumored, do their own Twitter.  You know, if you've got the client, you can always kind of phase it in, say, well, you can use our client to use Twitter or Uber Twitter, your choice or do both.  And that's a kind of be a very nice transition point.  So I think it's widely agreed that when Twitter came along and offered twice as much, forty to fifty million dollars for tweet deck, that was purely defensive, that they have no intention of doing anything with it.  I hope they don't kill it because it's my tool of the week.  I immediately downloaded after reading this story and try it.  And you know what?  I love it.  It has some really nice features on the Android phone, one of which it keeps all your tweets over a period of time so you can go way back in time and see it.  The topic actually gives the time.  So if I want to go back in time and find out, for instance, what people were tweeting when they found out Osama bin Laden had been caught, I can actually go back to that time after a limited period.  It'll cash.  I know this is cash.  Twenty three megabytes.  It also has the famous tweet deck columns, but you do it by sliding left or right.  Now you need a fast phone.  In fact, I suspect because this is a Tegra two.  It's a very fast phone and it still feels a little bit sluggish.  I suspect this might not be something you'd want to use on a regular phone.  I've been using tweet deck in Chrome.  It's fantastic.  In fact, you might want to take a look at that as well.  I'll show you real quickly.  I'll show you real quickly.  If I go to the I guess I have to sign into my account.  I'll do it over here.  It's a really nice client in the Chrome browser using HTML five.  I'm going to be very disappointed if Twitter kills.  This is actually maybe the best Twitter client I've ever used.  The Chrome version, the Android version has some really nice features.  And when you log into your tweet deck account, it populates it with all the accounts that you've you've set it up with in the first place.  So I only have to set these accounts up once on one device and then it automatically populates these accounts onto my other devices and the column settings and all of that stuff.  Yeah, I really like that feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting.  Tweet deck is also a Facebook client and a buzz client and a four square client.  So Twitter is essentially buying a client that interfaces with a lot of their competitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they're going to I think that I have to think they're going to kill it.  So here's my buzz stream.  Here's my Facebook stream.  And you can see you can even divide it into groups.  So it's a good way of managing Facebook groups.  I don't use LinkedIn anymore, but it supports LinkedIn.  There's my four square.  You're right. And these become columns in a larger view.  I just love it in Chrome.  I think everybody should try it in Chrome, but it's even a great Android.  My only concern is that in Android you might find it's a little sluggish because it is a tiny bit sluggish on my dual core process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm filled with conflict of interest here because I'm a nano investor in UberMedia.  Well, I love Bill Gross. I think he's a genius.  Bill Gross is just great.  But, you know, and so with that with that huge caveat, that grain of salt the size of Utah, is there an antitrust issue here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does seem like a very anti-competitive thing to do.  But I don't see how you could regulate it because I assume a certain amount of, you know, well, they must.  I mean, did Bill ever say I'm going to compete with Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, it's the irony of this open world where, you know, Twitter creates this ecosystem and then sides.  Well, you know, on second thought, we don't like that so much.  Yeah. I mean, it's a very anti-competitive move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says, well, yeah, you know, but I think this happens all the time in business.  We had Michael Robertson on last week and he told a horrific story about MP3.com.  Remember, that was his service where you would put your DVD or other your CD, music CDs in your CD, ROM drive.  The computer would generate a code. It would tell MP3.com and they'd say, yeah, OK, you verified you own this.  You don't have to upload it. You don't have to rip it.  We'll just store it for you on the cloud.  Universal sued them and won, completely depressing the stock price for MP3.com and then bought it.  And at the Robertson told the story that at the closing dinner, he was sitting next to Edgar Bronfman and Bronfman said, basically said, yeah, we figured we just sue you.  There's no merit to the case, but we just sue you.  We knew you couldn't defend it. It depressed your stock price and we'd snap you up, put you out of business.  And Michael says now, having been around for a few, few years more, this is very common.  And and he says a lot of what you see in litigation isn't about really about intellectual property.  It's about putting the other guy out of business or doing if you've got 50 million lying around.  I mean, I can understand why they would do that.  They don't want to over media to start a Twitter competitor.  You and I might.  I'd love to see a Twitter competitor, especially one that had some some, you know, network effect numbers.  I thank you for being here.  Jeff Jarvis, he is the professor of journalism at the City University of New York, CUNY, and the author of What Would Google Do?  His blog since 2001, BuzzMachine.com.
