Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To Berlin. So you're in New York at JFK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, at Newark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, he is of course the author of What Would Google Do? and  professor of journalism and expert in journalism  at the City University of New York and blogs at BuzzMachine.com. Good to have  you back Jeff, our regular. Also our regular Gina Trapani  of SmarterWear.org.  Hello, instant searchers.  Instant searchers. We're going to talk about that in a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Beautiful and well lit and there's a fan doing the hair thing. I know, that's really slick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just really hot in my office so I have the fan on.  The side effect is the blowing hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I have but one life to live, let me live it as a nerd  with great hair.  No, it looks great. I love it. Don't stop. Don't stop.  Also joining us right now, Kevin Marks. He is actually at the Google event at the  Museum of Modern Art which concluded just a couple of hours ago. He stuck  around to  give us his perspective. Former Googler, former Appler  currently at British Telecom running  dot com. It's great to have you, Kevin Marks.  Great to be here. There was some speculation, or I was speculating. It was all on my part  because the invitation was extraordinarily clear that Google was  going to talk about search.  But I thought maybe this will be the event where we'll hear about  Google Music, maybe Google TV more, maybe they'll announce Google Me,  Facebook. No, it was search. It was search, search, search. And they've done this before, haven't they Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they've done a search event last year and before that they've done small ones.  But I think this particular one was very focused on the Google Instant  feature which is the star of the show. Whereas last year it was the  little refinements and things like that.  This is a very clear change. They did start off talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the year in search and stuff like that and how we named ourselves  Google Topeka and all of that. Caffeine was the one announcement that was  germane really to this  instant search. That was a speed up in search that they instituted a few months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's more speed of indexing speed up rather than speed of results I think.  I see.  But that obviously helps too.  One thing I have noticed with the Google Instant is that Google real-time results  tend to be showing up in there.  So there's a  interesting cross over there. It may just be that I wasn't typing the right queries but  it's a bit of a challenge when you've got two different updates going on at once I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said this event was all about speed, speed, speed  and indeed, indeed, indeed  instant search is they say will save something like 350 million  hours a year  in this time because  you'll save two or three seconds of search. Before we start  looking at instant search, was there anything else that they talked about  that was of import or were there any tea leaves you could read by who was on the  stage or  what they were saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, not that I could say. I think this was a very focused presentation. They've got this one  huge feature and they were very excited about that.  And they weren't really taking questions about anything else in the  audience Q&A version. They may have said a few things afterwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sergey Brin was on stage. I didn't see Larry though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, Sergey was here  and Marissa and Udi Manbar and  a bunch of other Google people but  not Larry and not Eric. I think he's still in Europe. And this is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  criminologist in me, not Vic Gundrothra,  who is their social guy.  And the fact that Vic wasn't there kind of made me think, oh well I guess it won't  be Google me or Google Music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is search which is  a core business.  It has a huge infrastructure and is a big chunk of what Google does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is instant search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Instant search is, well, I think it's turned on for everyone now. I'm not sure.  In the US.  In the US, sorry.  Everyone in the US, we have that usual problem.  But as you type,  the search results appear with every letter you type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And when you say appear, we've seen before the drop down. Let me see if I can get it running here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's definitely worth watching if you can get it working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So give me a search. Gina, what should I type in the search box here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Type twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  You get a raise. Gina gets a raise.  Actually I'll do it t.  So immediately,  not only do I get the drop down, which we got before,  but I also get a page of results.  And then I type  w.  And now the page results changes and a second page loads in, which is  headed by Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I notice, fascinating, is this is both personalized and localized.  Let's all put in t and see what the first  response is. Mine's target. What do you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting. So I didn't, you know, and that's because  you can't use this unless you're logged in and you have your, you know, so your  web, previous web searches are in this box.  So I do get target. You all get target? You all following along?  Chat room, everybody gets target? Target Twitter thesaurus Travelocity.  Yeah, that's what I get too. If I go to w, Twitter. I get TD Bank in there in Ticketmaster.  Ah, because you've been... I get TMZ in Ticketmaster.  TMZ, interesting.  We know what you spend some time doing there, young lady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Gossip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I'm a little bummed because OpenDNS just started blocking TMZ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the one that was the weirdest for me is if you put D in, I get  California, California Department of Motor Vehicles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it does know your location, right? And I do too. I do too.  But I bet Jeff doesn't get DMV.  If you type D, what do you get, Jeff?  You've muted yourself.  Unmute yourself, sir.  Hello, Jeff.  Earth to Jeff. Oh, he's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get the Del Mar Fair, which is a local San Diego event.  What if I type D? Interesting.  Ultra local.  Yeah, very local. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's see if I type P, do I get Petaluma?  I get Pandora, PG&E and PayPal.  I get P is Petco.  PET is still Petco, of course.  Now, one thing that Steve... there, after I type PETA, I get Petaluma.  One thing that Steve Gibson pointed out,  and I think it'll be interesting to see if anybody notices or complains about this,  he said, you know, it's loading a hell of a lot more data than it used to,  because every time you type a letter, it's loading a full Google page, images and all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it doesn't work on image search or blog search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You will get images if they show up in Universal Search, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely. So if I search for Pia Zadora,  I don't know why I would.  I get pictures of Pia Zadora.  By the way, in Irina...  How did that enter your brain?  I don't know why. I don't know why.  Irina Slitsky, who was in the event, asked,  hey, why when I type my name, Irina, S-L-U-T,  and this is a very common Russian name, blank, blank, blank.  And that's even if safe search is turned off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you do the F word, same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Type sex, same thing.  S, you get Skype, SF Gate, which is a local result.  E, you get Sears, Sephora and Selena.  X, you get sex in the city.  Sex offenders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think sex is OK, but there are definitely stop words.  If you type...  And Slitsky was a weird one because it blocks whatever you type.  Whereas if you type...  Yeah, poor Irina. You can't use...  You can't search for her anymore.  If you type Bart, it goes blank.  But if you put... I don't know, it reconflexes the button.  Whereas with Irina, any combination of her name just vanishes.  I would be pissed if I were her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you press enter, it will run the search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe it'll still get it. Yeah.  Yeah, it'll still get it.  But you just don't get the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But see, I think for a lot of people, maybe...  I mean, yeah, you know that, but for...  It does say press enter to search, but for a lot of people,  they're going to say, oh, I guess there's no result.  Aren't they? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's going to be a subtle problem.  And it blocks other words.  The other one that Irina came up with was bitch magazine.  If you type bitch, it's a stop word.  Everything goes white, which means that bitch magazine  is now at a disadvantage to the other women's magazines  that it's competing with because it won't appear.  Boy, that's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's probably a problem  that bitch magazine has in general, though.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what I mean?  But I agree.  And it is disconcerting when the whole page goes white.  You're like, what went wrong?  Is there an error? Yeah.  But yeah, that is unfortunate for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I guess it doesn't want to suggest to you  words you wouldn't have seen,  but wasn't that suggestion going to be there before anyway,  or did you notice that this happened before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. It's a good question.  You can turn instant search off.  All you have to do when you're getting the instant search  is go to the right.  It says instant is on, and you can turn it off.  And by the way, if you do turn it off, I found out,  it'll stay off on all of your logins  until you actually go into settings.  And there is now in search settings,  there is a section called Google Instant,  and you can change that.  It also says, and this might be relevant to some people,  sign-in users can remove personalized suggestions  from their web history.  So if you're getting something you don't like  every time you start typing, which I can see happening,  but people have to find that.  But let me get back to my original question.  Doesn't this use considerably more bandwidth  than Google used before?  Yeah.  Every letter, there's another processing power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not quite every letter.  If you type quickly, then it'll only send five.  But yes, if you type slowly,  then it will send for each time.  There is like a little spin loop there.  So if you type a word, you won't see it changing  that quickly, because there is a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so I type my name at full speed,  and I only got one page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and Kevin, they also said,  didn't they at the presentation,  that this is a lot more about caching, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, but that's caching,  that's from Google's point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's their side.  You're still doing a network round trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the ISP may not like it.  Okay, I'm ready.  Okay, here's my conspiracy theory.  Maybe this explains the deal with Verizon.  I wonder if, because wasn't it after all AT&T  who said Google's freeloading on us,  this was what began the net neutrality discussion years ago,  is we don't like it that Google's using so much bandwidth.  We want to charge them.  And I can imagine an internet service provider saying,  whoa, you just quadrupled or whatever the amount of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a drop in the ocean compared to YouTube.  That's true.  That's the bulk of Google's bandwidth.  And that's what makes Google  a valuable peering partner with people,  because they've got so much of that going both ways.  So, Google is now at the stage  where they've got enough traffic  and they've got enough infrastructure  that they count as a peer to the internet companies  in most places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is why we have Kevin Marks on, ladies and gentlemen.  So that when I say something completely stupid,  he can say, well, and he says it so nicely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they showed a briefly,  they showed a version of it working on mobile.  That's puzzling.  That would be an issue there.  Yeah.  There are also, there's other issues  with like trying to type on a keyboard on the mobile  and having enough screen space left  to see more than one result.  But that was, you can see that there's value  in doing the auto-complete on mobile  in some ways more than there is in doing it  in the browser itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did say that they'll be rolling it out  on mobile later this year.  I don't know if that means an Android update.  I'm not sure exactly how that happens.  My question though is how many people use Google  from the Google page?  Don't almost all of us now search from the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, I think that's what's gonna change here tremendously  is that, well, number one, I think it's gonna change  is that now, you're right, I never used the page.  Now I'm motivated to.  But number two, by the way,  I noticed that's a hat tree behind me.  It looks like I have an antenna in my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it.  It's the Martian effect.  Yeah, my favorite Martian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gina has the waving hair and I have the wiki hat tree.  But number two, I immediately asked,  how do I get this into my Chrome bar?  And I guess Kevin, I think they said there  that they are gonna do that, right?  I don't know how you do that.  How do you put the page worth of information  in a pull down from the bar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because you don't wanna give me the page I'm on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the thing that I have to work on.  But I'm presumably, you could just do a really big overlay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Or maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I'm typing it into the page I'm on,  I'm gonna leave that page.  So we could just leave the page.  It's the Google takeover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's our page now.  The interesting thing is gonna be  what they do for the other browsers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is currently supported in interestingly IE8,  as well as Safari, Chrome, and Firefox.  It's just Ajax, I guess.  Yeah.  So it's not HTML5.  It's nothing unusual.  It's something that any browser does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think it's using WebSockets or anything like that.  I haven't actually dug into the code yet.  But I think it's just doing a series  of straightforward page requests, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So are you all gonna just start using  the Google front page from now on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting.  I think most people who use the Google front page now  are not the power users.  They're the regular folks.  And I think that this is gonna be  a really big jarring change for them.  And this makes the power users who search from their bar  and want to go to Google.com,  I imagine that it'll come out in the browsers soon enough  and on mobile as well.  They've gotta roll it out in those other places.  There are so many places that you can search Google  at this point.  I mean, very few of us who use the web every single day  actually use Google.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't seen a Google Doodle  unless I actually go there in a long time for that reason.  I haven't seen the front page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, maybe, Genus, maybe this is for those people.  They had a grandpa on the promo video  who just said, oh, this is wonderful.  I don't even have to hit return.  Whoa!  It saved me a keystroke in life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I needed return.  I love that guy.  Is he enter? Is he return? What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love that guy. That was fantastic.  You know, it's very much, it strikes me, of course,  I'm gonna say this, but it's very much like Wave,  except the difference is that with Wave,  things change on the page,  a lot of different things in all different places.  But with this, you're focused on the text box  and the eye tracking charts that they showed  were really interesting because you're focused on the text box  and it really is gonna draw your attention to the top couple of results.  So you really can kind of...  Yeah, I noticed that as I was using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never really did...  Somebody had to point out, oh, yeah, well, it's updating the page.  Because I'm looking at the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, you're looking at the box and the dropdown.  So you have the box, suggesting text in gray,  which you can tab to autocomplete.  You have the dropdown changing and suggesting words in it  and suggesting whole phrases.  And then you have behind that the page changing as you select more words.  So there's a lot going on there.  So I have to say, I think that it's gonna be kind of jarring.  This is what people complain about in Wave,  like, oh, there's too many things, you know, it's giving me seizures.  I think this is a little more focused into one area of the page,  which is the top around the box.  But it's pretty, it's real time.  I mean, it's definitely commitment to real time.  And it looks like this is how things are gonna be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I can see that if you, see, to me, it's too much work to go to Google.com.  So I'm less likely to do that anyway.  I mean, it's not gonna save me any time or keystrokes.  But I sure do wish this functionality were available everywhere.  Because I could see, you know, when you start typing stuff  and then you arrow key down to the, oh, no, I wanted that.  And you've got the search page that you wanted.  They said, and they pointed this out, far fewer visits to page two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and the problem with putting it in the Chrome bar  is if I start typing twit.tv, it doesn't know whether I'm typing  until I get to a space or to a dot.  It doesn't know whether I'm typing in a word or URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're better at this.  So it can't assume that it wants search.  Unless maybe this is a way to force me to search all the time,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that it goes ahead and gives me twit, TWI search results.  And then when I finish typing twit.tv, okay, it goes to the URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I ask a dumb question?  Why did Google do this?  Kevin, you might have some insight into this.  Why does Google do this?  What does it matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the best thing was the slide Marissa showed at the beginning.  And she said they've been optimizing and optimizing the middle piece of this,  which is how long it takes to get the results back from the data centers.  And then when they actually watch people using it,  it takes them like 10 seconds to type the query.  Then it takes them 15 seconds to decide which one to click on afterwards.  And that was now, because the middle bit was so fast,  that was the dominant thing that was slowing down people from searching.  So by tackling this, they were cutting those two times down.  That was the justification for it. That makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also what happens when you have a vice president in charge of user interface.  I mean, you have somebody that high level looking at the user interface,  you start paying attention to little things like how many seconds they type.  The speed is something that Google has been obsessed with, yeah.  Yeah, always. Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was just saying speed is their gospel.  It's the thing they always emphasize.  Eric Schmidt's tweet this morning was that we're always been fast,  and now fast is faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did he have that weird Hitler mustache when he did the tweet?  You guys see that horrible, we'll talk about it later,  that horrible video from consumerwatchdog.org.  If I were Eric Schmidt, I would be like wounded.  I mean, it was horrible. But hold on, we'll talk about it.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jeff.  I was going to say this really emphasizes Google as a service.  It's a utility. It's instant gratification.  We're going to get you where you need to go.  It's part of the reason why some people theorize that Google might not be so good at social,  because Facebook is about keeping you on Facebook and making you waste time,  or Google is about making you save time.  Is that a cultural class?  Oh, interesting.  This is the thing that they're great at.  What did Marissa say?  She said that Google has one billion users a week,  and that's more than any other service,  and that's just not just Internet services.  Am I quoting her right? She said any service.  So Google is a utility. It's a utility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they know from the numbers that the faster you go, the more business they do,  and the more business they do, the more money they make.  It's simple economics.  But I also think it fits into their larger goal, which has always been, you know,  speed is one gospel, but the real gospel of Google is to intuit your intent,  is to know where you go before you go there.  So Eric got in some hot water again for saying at IFA that we know who you are,  we know where you are and what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why does he keep saying stuff like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eric!  He also said, by the way, he also said that his line about changing your age at 21,  which I've said for three years now, he was joking, and everybody went bananas on that.  The line of today that's going to come out, I think, is when Bryn said,  we're the third half of your brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I was talking with Matt Cutts on Twitter saying,  how long is it going to be before we get our first Google incident search and privacy story?  It took one hour, by the way.  And he predicted that that quote would be the one people would clom onto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And especially people wear tinfoil hats.  Google's in my brain.  So what is the privacy implication of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  None, more than there already was.  You can turn off the cookies and turn this off,  or you can get more personalized search and add results.  And it knows when you ask for pizza, it's going to give you pizza in your town.  Or because I went to Ticketmaster recently for the US Open,  it knows when I put in T, maybe I want Ticketmaster.  There's some odds of that.  And that is, in fact, convenient for me.  Or I can turn it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeanne, do you think it's the problem is the disconnect between what computer scientists,  how they view a computer, and how normal people view mechanistic enterprises?  I think a normal person goes, well, if Google is predicting what I want, they must know.  And a computer, right, they know something about me.  There is no free will, Leo.  And a computer scientist goes, oh, no, it's algorithmic and it's not Google.  It's your browser.  And they don't know nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I mean, I think it's a little bit of a, I think Marissa said a psychic shift.  There's a psychic shift for the UI.  But there's also this like psychological moment where I think a person who isn't an engineer,  a computer engineer, suddenly it's just exposing, Google is just exposing you a little faster its guesses.  You know what I mean?  All those guesses exist in the back end.  This change is just showing you what it knows,  which can freak people out a little bit at first.  Like, oh, they're collecting my web history.  Well, yeah, web history is one of the features they've had for a while.  It knows your IP address.  So it has an idea of your general location.  That always has.  You know what I mean?  So I do think that it's a little bit of a shift of like, oh, that's, huh,  I guess I'm not the only person in the world searching for like, how do I get a quickie divorce?  You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think normal people, though, think there's a Keebler elf in there.  And he's writing this all down.  That's evil elf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why I think the thing going white is going to be suddenly jarring, right?  Right.  You get used to this thing.  The elf's not working.  And you type some bad word, everything goes white.  It's like, did I just do something bad?  That's going to have to be a really interesting sort of...  That's interesting, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the white out search.  I think it's just a version of safe search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't show me nasty words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All I have to do is type arena SLU and it doesn't, I don't even have to say SLUT anymore.  Why don't you type out SLU?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It won't do it either.  No, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't get smart about that.  That they have to fix.  I'm glad Irina was at the event.  We noticed this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, everybody learns this at the beginning of AOL, very back in the early days, they  made breast a bad word and the breast cancer community was of course properly up at arms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not to mention foster farms.  Yes.  How are you going to search for chicken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you can't search for Jeff's penis posts either.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I can't.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now that's a disservice.  Well, that's bad.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me just search for J-E-F-F apostrophe S-P-E-N-I.  Well, I got small penis jokes.  Ignite airport meltdown.  And it goes blank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'm so sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to have parents kind of looking over the shoulder of kids from across the room  going, I see that screen is blank.  What are you searching for, kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What were you thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I search for B-O-O-B, there it goes.  Huh.  This is going to be a new game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, now we have a new dictionary of white words.  White words.  White words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  White words.  All right.  Well, we took 10 minutes and we've discussed the whole thing.  Is there anything more to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think there's some subtleties to this.  The thing is that Google has said in the past that 20% of queries at any given time are  unique they've never seen before.  What?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a stat that they published several times and I can find science.  One in five.  Wow.  Because there's diverse number of things that people type into it, which makes some sense.  This was always their point about serving the long tail and not just doing the top few queries.  And that was a Google in-depth thing that helped them compete with others.  But this is going to change that because you're going to get a lot closer to other people's  queries all the time.  And so there's a subtle effect from that, which is that you're gradually being pushed  into the things that other people have searched for before.  We've had a bit of that with the autocomplete already, but this is going to make that much  stronger.  Is that a good thing or a bad thing?  That sounds like a bad thing.  I think it's a bad thing.  I think it's a bad thing.  It's suddenly Google is very normative.  I read a long post about this last night when I was playing with the Google scribe thing,  which we can maybe talk about in a bit.  Yes.  Yeah.  But that was like...  Leo, what was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to come up with a search that nobody's ever typed before.  Baboon frenzy inside my pants.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  See, there's a search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Put that in quotes.  Put that in quotes.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Let's see.  I have to pluralize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember when we used to play the game Google?  Leo, add Piers Zador to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then Piers Zador.  No results found for baboon frenzy inside my pants.  I have found the end of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Piers Zador, baboon frenzy.  It's got to be the first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it just stuns me.  I'm sorry.  It does not sound credible that one in five searches are something Google's never seen before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's one of the stats that stuck with me because it is so striking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, what are people searching for that's so bizarre and weird?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's just that language is generative and you can stick words together to make a  phrase that no one's ever said before.  You can, but it's usually nonsense.  Well, no.  You know, that's the way that language is structured.  It isn't.  You have clusters of ideas.  The interesting thing they said in response to that was that when they watch people using  it, we were talking about, well, this is going to mean that you don't have to just get on  the first page.  You have to get on the first three results for the first two letters.  But they said people will keep typing stuff and adding words to try and bring the one  they want up to the top, even if it's like four down.  They're going, I want that further up.  I want that up.  Move it up the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin, I think you raise a really important point on the industry here is that for various  reasons we see the defrocking of the SEO wizards.  Number one, because we see how much more personalized search is.  And so it's hard to say, well, I rose you up 10 stops from Gina you did, but from Kevin  you didn't.  And also, I think you're right.  What you just said is that the first page isn't even the issue.  The first three listings are the issue.  Right.  And back to your other point, Leo, about the going to all the same.  It's not just that you go to the same that everyone else goes to because it's personalized.  It's going to go to what I've gone to all the time before.  And someone on Twitter said to me, well, I don't want to go to what I've gone to before.  I want to be surprised.  I want to go to a new thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, the chat room is explaining to me why one in five has never before been seen  in Google.  Of course, I should have known this.  Misspellings.  Yeah.  And languages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Especially generative language.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think people are idiots.  That's really the reason.  But now Google does, of course, the spelling corrections.  And these work as well in this instance search.  So if I start typing C-A-L-A, calendar, properly spelled, is the first item on there.  So the spelling suggestions get now kind of incorporated into the search results.  It doesn't even say, did you mean calendar?  So this is, you know, I think this is helpful.  I'd be very curious.  Somebody asked Marissa, well, how many people in your testing said they didn't want it?  And she said some did, but you could turn it off.  I'd be curious to see what the results are in that regard, if a lot of people turn it off or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what's amazing?  Justin Bieber has J-U.  Not only does the guy have his own racks at Twitter, own server racks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see that?  He's got like three or four servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a myth.  Oh, he's got J-U.  Does he have J-U for you, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nope.  Is it just somebody?  Oh, he's number two.  Somebody's been searching a little too much for Justin Bieber.  I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just Justin TV, I get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I get Justin TV.  But J-U-S gives me Justin Bieber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting.  I really don't search for Justin Bieber very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Justin Bieber tattoo.  Now, that's what I want to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Back in the early days, I was one of the Jeffs on the first page, but I can't even find myself now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you make a good point because I was typing in Leo and I show up very well if I'm logged in.  But as soon as I log out, it's that stupid Deutsch English dictionary, leodict.leo.org, that beats me every time.  You win Leo space.  I'm Leo in my own Leo space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a life of Leo is top result for Leo.  Oh, good. For you?  Oh, thank God.  And Leonardo da Vinci.  It's a pretty good company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not Leonardo DiCaprio.  It's all in my school for me.  Yeah, he's there too.  He's a pretty good company too.  The TMZ searches are coming through, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, I'm just going to shut up.  I'm going to stop revealing my own.  It's revealing, isn't it?  That's very interesting.  It's very revealing.  I'm reading my mind and I'm reading it to you, so I'm going to shut up now.  I get Leonardo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get Leo gets me first, then Leonardo DiCaprio, Leonard Cohen, Leona Lewis and Leo Laporte.  But that's pretty good.  And Leo, I don't.  Oh, I get you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get you number five.  Yeah, on the.  That's the normal search.  On the topics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I log out, I will get and I type Leo.  I will be sixth down on the list if I log out.  So it really is paying quite a bit of attention to your search history, obviously, which it should.  I wonder now where does that happen?  Does Google?  Is that happening in the server side or client side?  Is Google sending to the browser my search history?  I guess it knows.  No one knows it because it's in the server.  Yeah, they have it on the server side.  That's one of the settings.  Of course, it's in the dash.  Yeah, this is I mean, you're doing it everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of engineering right here.  I mean, not to be a total Google fangirl.  I mean, I am already.  Sometimes I feel bad about being so far up one company's butt.  But but but you know, this is a pretty good butt to be because this is really amazing.  I mean, this is like a show title of engineering.  What's going on here?  I mean, I'm starting to just get a little experience with non-trivial data with think up and it's hard and it's slow.  It's incredible what they're doing here.  And I just we have to kind of I want to just acknowledge that.  I mean, what what's going on is really kind of amazing.  And this at the speed that it is.  No, it's very impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then they talked about some of what they were doing to do this.  But yeah, we were saying, so we suddenly need to have 20 years to do this.  That's kind of scary.  But they what they said was they because you're searching queries that are auto completing, it populates the cache more quickly.  So this goes along with the there are fewer unique searches thing as well.  Give me a guess as to what this must cost Google to implement.  It's got to be costly, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have no idea.  I never actually knew when I was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know, the point is that it's increasing the amount of traffic to their data centers quite a lot.  Yes.  So it's increasing the number of searches measurably.  Right.  So yeah, it can cost them a fair bit to do that.  But the bulk of that is is back end stuff, not traffic.  I think the bulk of the cost is running thousands of machines to respond to every query, because as I said, you know, most of these queries are different.  So they won't hit the caches.  I think what you find with this is that the way caching works is you get a like an exponential thing for it.  There's a bunch of common stuff that will always be in the cache.  Then you get rare and rarest stuff that's further out.  And they always worked on optimizing the rarest stuff.  This will this will be some of the stuff that's called Kevin's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the more they force you toward a known good non typo search, the more likely it's cached in a way, the more efficient they can be.  Might save you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might save the money.  I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not you know, there's still more more searches.  But and they said there would be a bunch of other cleverness going on.  Right.  But that that was the the gist of it.  I also think it may be that they're imposing a different deadline because they have deadline based to do Google One boxes and things.  They have deadline based rules that says this box will only appear if you can generate results quickly enough.  So they may impose a shorter deadline for this search and then give you a slightly longer deadline for the for the full search.  As you've noticed that if you do the auto complete and then you hit return, it will sometimes change what the first result is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if they can cache 80 percent of all searches and they can take half of the searches that they're getting and move them into that 80 percent, that should be significantly improved.  I'm not sure it's 80 per 20th.  But yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, it's one in five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but yeah, but it depends whether that's one they've never seen before as opposed to they wouldn't actually catch.  They don't catch because we see it.  We see it.  We're still let's say it's half.  There's a point halfway down that right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the impact on AdSense AdWords AdWords?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was interesting.  So the AdWords still appear.  They're still making those show up.  But some of the impressions may only be fractions of a second.  And so they said they were going to modify the web dashboard.  It tells you what you're adding when you're buying impressions, what you got.  And they will modify that to give you some information about how much time is spent on them.  But as it's paper click doesn't actually affect what you pay for your ads and what the and what the Google's revenues are from the ads so much.  If you type in used Carlio, you see stuff locally immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You used C.  And there it is over on the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the all that stuff.  But if I just now type carriage, is it going to see it?  It thinks I'm mistyping it.  Now it does.  Now it changes to car carriers.  So if I did that fast enough, that might be a split second that I saw the local used car dealers.  Yes.  So presumably there'll be some threshold.  It's not an impression base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a CPC base.  It's clicks.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it doesn't actually structurally change their model much.  That's right.  That's right.  But it will.  Yeah.  It will.  It will change the your it'll change your measured click through rates if you're getting fleeting impressions that aren't clicked on.  Right.  So it may potentially change that way.  This is stuff they're going to have to work out and understand.  And there's a whole sort of second order group of people who who work to try and optimize behavior in this.  And they're going to have to learn a whole bunch of new heuristics and tricks on that.  I mean, one thing that we were talking about, the personalization thing, one thing that is different is that they now have a much better idea of what you're doing.  Previously, they would show the search results and they would instrument some of them to see which one you clicked on.  So they could do the bounce back test and those those kinds of things with this.  They have a much tighter loop as you're typing, you're pausing, you're typing, you're pausing and a better sense of what you're doing.  And that's they're gathering that each character typed and then the arrow keys and whatever's going on.  So they should have a much better metering of each user in that in that sense, which they they don't tend to use individually.  They will average that out to prove search overall.  But that's that there is certainly more information going back to them about the search as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want fast. Gina's already published an article on how to get the most out of Google.  It's that that's fast, Gina.  We're going to talk about that Google scribe.  And I'd still want to show that ad, the scary ad that was up on Times Square every few minutes to terrify you about Google and Eric Schmidt.  We're going to do all that in just a bit. Kevin Marx is with us.  He is at the site of the Google event at the Museum of Modern Art.  Thank you for being here, Kevin. We're so glad to have you from the Lufthansa executive lounge in beautiful Newark, New Jersey.  Jeff Jarvis is here and from her bicycle lab, Gina Tripani.  This is where she repairs the bikes, ladies and gentlemen, and writes the software on the articles.  We're glad you're all here. And we want to mention our friends at Squarespace dot com.  Squarespace is where amazing websites begin.  It's hosting plus software to make a really great experience for people who want to create a website.  If you have an existing site, by the way, you can easily move your Squarespace or your site over to Squarespace.  And I especially want to talk to people like Vox users who are being kind of disenfranchised right now as Vox shuts down.  And yes, you know, six apart will move you over to TypePad, which is not a bad solution.  But you might want to look at Squarespace dot com.  Squarespace dot com is, I think, kind of state of the art, modern, and it's more than blogging.  It is for any kind of website. A lot of photographers use Squarespace because they have got great portfolios and photo albums.  They have features that are unique to Squarespace, the great iPhone app, the social integration, the stats.  But most of all, I really like to point people towards the templates.  You start with a great designer template, but the customization is so easy with point and click that you can make it look like anything you want.  And that's why no two Squarespace sites look alike. If you go to the examples, you'll get an idea.  They're all unique. They're all beautiful. They just do such a great job.  Squarespace sites start at eight dollars a month, but you could try it free for 15 days right now.  That's nice. This is called the NYC grid. Looks like it's a photo site.  This is Squarespace. Yeah, they've got Google Maps embedded. They've got they've got photos. They've got a gallery.  And this is this is an example. That's just one of many great Squarespace sites on the examples page.  If you go to Squarespace dot com slash twig right now, you can get 15 days free.  You don't even need a credit card. And if you decide to buy, you can you can start sign up for as little as eight dollars a month  and use the word twig as your promo code. You'll save 10 percent off the life of your site.  Ten percent off every month. Plenty of bandwidth.  True cloud hosting means if you ever get hit by slash dot or dig or the twig effect, you don't have to worry.  There's bandwidth to spare. Statistics will let you know where all those hits came from.  Great content management solutions to and because you can use CSS and JavaScript, there's really nothing you can't do with Squarespace.  Give it a try for yourself. You'll see what I mean. Squarespace dot com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  Back to the conversation on Google.  Kevin, you said you were interested in this scribe technology, which now it came out yesterday.  But now I can see it's kind of got a little bit of the Google instant built into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tell us about scribe. Well, scribe is applying the same kind of auto complete thing but to you typing.  So if you play it, as you write, it suggests the next word for you to say.  And you can hit tab to get the word or you can choose one to five.  So if you start typing a sentence, it'll suggest the next thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also, are they vacuuming? I think they're cleaning up behind you.  Yes, they're vacuuming. I'll try and put the mic in place.  That's OK. As long as we know where that sound is coming from.  You know, it works in Gmail. You could put a little bookmark in your browser.  And then when you click it, you'll have it in your Gmail.  I don't know if somebody would actually open this as a word processor exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think so. It works in any text area. That bookmark can activate in any text area.  I mean, it's fun, right? But I don't know that it's exactly something I'd use when I'm writing on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think it's what it does. And I read a long blog post on this last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I could type eight now and it would jump and fill in baboons in my pants.  And see, even something as weird as that, it kind of knows where I'm going.  So the bookmark, bookmark let you drag to your toolbar.  And then any time you have a text window open in Chrome or whatever browser you're using.  It looks like I don't know if we've lost Kevin or not.  It seems like I hear his audio, but I don't hear him.  I guess that's that's they're cleaning up in the Lufthansa lounge as well. All right.  Are you still there, Jeff? I'm still here. OK, good.  I'm just going to get Kevin back on real quickly because he was going to talk a little bit about Google scribe.  It's a labs feature. It's not necessarily something anybody would really want to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not the same technology in any way as the instant search. It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's the underlying stuff is similar.  The structural language model is the same idea of auto completing what you're doing.  But doing it when you're writing as opposed to doing it when you're typing a query is a different thing.  But it has similar problems. The problem is that I was citing Orwell in frame and things there is that it makes you write cliches.  It makes you write something that everyone else has written before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just like the search makes you search for people, things people have searched for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And so part of my worry is that we've got Google running this system over the net to try and decide what you're going to say.  What your next word is going to be.  At the same time, we've got all the spammers constructing text that is generated by a very similar process where they're where they're sitting there writing a machine that looks at what people say and then predicts.  It's trying to make you look human. And so we've got this sort of two robots battling over what it means to what it means to be human against each other.  And in the middle, we're sitting there going, well, I'm trying to write something myself here.  So I'm slightly nervous about that because precisely because it has this sort of weird convergence effect where of normalizing everything, which is the opposite of what you want to do when you're actually writing.  You want to be able to bring your say something that people haven't seen before.  I think you need queries when you're when you're writing something, you want to come up with the phrase or the expression or the idea that hasn't occurred to people before rather than just repeating the cliches over and over again.  So that is a yeah, that's a sort of weird.  I would think to worry about.  But that was the thing that struck me when I saw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you wrote a good blog post actually on it on your blog, a pay a sepigney.  If Google predicts your future, will it be a cliche?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a great headline. I love that idea.  I mean, you really do want to reward the like unique turn of phrase over, you know, over just encouraging people to echo the cliches.  Right. Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had editors who used to do that.  I remember when I was at People magazine, I said that I can't remember what it was, but it was a pot calling the kettle metal and the editor wanted to make it black.  And I said, no, that's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You also you also quote George Orwell, Kevin, in his book, Politics of the English Language, in which he said, I love this.  He says he talks about modern writing at its worst.  He says consists in gumming together long strips of words which have already been said or already set in order by someone else and marking the results presentable by sheer humbug.  And I think I think a lot of I watch my my high school age son write.  And that's exactly the process of an inexperienced or novice writer is the first thing that jumps into your mind, which is usually a cliche or something you've heard before is the first thing you write down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you're often running a high speed chase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, high speed chase. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Well, I've read to Michael Frayne, who wrote this wonderful book, The Tin Man in 65, which was imagining a machine that would do this.  And his thing was constructing newspaper stories about royal royal occasions and said there are all these boilerplate phrases that you just pluck out and stick together to do this.  One of his he said, whenever you see the word fireman in the newspaper, it will be followed by wearing breathing apparatus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true.  Eric Schmidt, when he was speaking at IFA, says the next step of search is doing this automatically.  When I walk down the street, I want my smartphone to be insert doing searches constantly.  Did you know? Did you know? Did you know?  Schmidt said, I think it's so annoying. I want to throw it out the window.  He says this notion of autonomous search to tell me things I didn't know, but I'm probably interested in is the next great stage of search.  Do you agree? Well, Kevin's gone. I'll ask you, Jeff. Do you agree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To some extent, yeah, but I think you have to turn it on and off.  You're not going to use it all the time. But when you are walking down the street, I think look at what's happened to our whole idea of facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, did you know? Did you know? Did you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we sent it to our friends. We are reflexes now to go find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  True. That's, I guess, the whole idea of augmented reality browsers. You're looking at something. Did you know? Did you know?  Well, he said it's augmented humanity.  Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said in the talk that man and machine make each other better. It is a little sci-fi.  Yeah.  And it does scare people. I had a discussion on Twitter today on the word creepy.  Creepy is just this ridiculous word that means nothing. It's purely emotional.  But when they say things like that at Google, it does creep people out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you want creepy. Let's watch this video.  Oh, boy.  You can see why I think sometimes people have this visceral reaction to what Google's up to, although I think it is the people who think there are elves in the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'll say too, as you watch this, remember that this is reputed to be from an organization that's backed by Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what we were talking about on Twitter. We were trying to figure out why is it the consumer watchdog has such a hard on for Eric Schmidt  because they really portray him as evil. He even has a little Hitler mustache in this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's hosted by Edelman PR's service.  Oh, that's interesting.  And it uses Google Analytics and Google's cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now that I like. They showed this ad. There was a 15 second version which aired in Times Square over and over and over again.  And that's really what bugs me because I think if you and I see this ad, anybody who listens to this show sees this ad, we're not too, you know, we know what the threat is and whether it's risky.  But I do worry a little bit about people who don't have much background in this story.  And I get email all the time from people say, why do you talk about Google so much? They're trying to steal my brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to Germany right now to talk about that. And they go back duty on Google.  Yeah, we're there. I think it's evil. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let me see if I can. I could show the 15 second version, but it's so much more fun to look at the the full length version.  And let me see if I can get the full body scan working here.  And I'll play it for you.  This is not the version that shows on Times Square, but it but it gives you the full the full idea.  And it's by the way, it's on YouTube. That's that's even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an ice cream truck. Get your free ice cream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the evil Eric Schmidt ice cream. Hi there, boys and girls.  They should know there's no such thing as a free ice cream.  Give me a dozen full body scans. So evil.  Come on, kids. Get your ice cream. I already know your favorite flavors.  Now, hold still while we collect some of your secrets.  And if there's anything you don't want anyone to know, well, you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So why is consumer watchdog doing this?  I mean, this is an ad hominem attack against Eric Schmidt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're arguing for the for the do not follow registry, which, of course, is also known as Trey and off cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, do not try. It's the demonizing of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think there is. I mean, somebody sent me email.  The lines to Microsoft aren't necessarily solid, but they but it comes from a group that just constantly does nothing but demonize Google.  Why doesn't it even eyes? Microsoft? The funding came even as a well or Yahoo or some other big old company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The funding for the ad and for its airplay came from apparently the Rose Foundation.  And I think that's the connection to the Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's also just the consumer watchdog group. Whatever that group is, has done stuff with them as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And well, is there anything wrong with having a do not track registry? A government run do not track registry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, talk about that. How would that work? I mean, what does it mean? Do not track? I can I can say right now, don't track me.  I can turn off cookies. I can I can put on a browser window that doesn't have any tracking.  You can do it, can't you? It's easy to do far more far more doable than me having to go register somewhere with my name and email address, which, by the way, is what this ad wants you to do is give them your name and email address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which isn't bound to the cookies in the first year. That's kind of weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think that this idea of it sounds good. Do not do not call this do not track list. But it doesn't mean anything.  It's it's so it seems to be just pure anti Google hype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you want, if you Google, as I have done, Rose Foundation, Eric Schmidt, Microsoft, you'll see the nexus of and it's just it's a little it's a little bit convoluted.  So it's a little hard to try to figure out what's going on. But it's it's it sure feels like someone has an axe to grind rather than a legitimate privacy concern.  Will this ad fall on fallow ground or are people going to believe it?  Is it persuasive, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little over the top, I think, to be persuasive. But it does seem to be the story that that that the media likes and that people people like to figure out a reason why, you know, this is all so scary.  It's the scary future or ever, you know, Big Brother's watching. But yeah, I don't know. That's the first time I've seen it.  So I haven't seen the entire thing, but it seems a little too over the top, I think.  Is this this is airing in Times Square and TV also or I don't think they have TV. I don't think they could afford TV time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cecilia Kang writing for The Washington Post says that the person to look at is John Simpson, who runs I don't know if he runs Consumer Watchdog.  Yeah, I guess he does. A 62 year old veteran journalist with a deep suspicion of big business and a mission to break up the search giant.  Simpson lost two jobs during restructurings and he yeah, he works for Consumer Watchdog.  And it's an interesting article. Simpson doesn't deny that this is a battle he takes personally.  You become convinced something is this a quote, you become convinced something is wrong with corporate America if someone who has loyally worked for 30 years can be thrown out on his ass.  So it sounds like he maybe is a little upset with losing his job because of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of my readers sent me a link to something called tech rights dot org, which tries to dissect the motive here between this grassroots enterprise and grassroots dot com and who's after what what the history is.  You know, this is an absolute case where you just want some more more transparency.  And if Edelman is behind it again, like they were behind the I Love Walmart tour, then you know, this does not serve them or their clients well in the long run.  Simpson was the one who organized the antitrust press conference with lawyers from Microsoft, Yahoo, Amazon and other Google competitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He petitioned the Justice Department for an antitrust investigation.  He petitioned the Justice Department for an antitrust investigation.  So this is this guy is has really got a bone to pick with Google.  Right. As long as as long as people my concern is a lot of, for instance, as I said, I get a lot of email, especially from the radio show.  I should pull one. I should pull one up.  But from people who really think Google is is is watching them, who's actively watching them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, have you seen the one Google?  That's the plan. You seen that video?  It's about three years old. That one is actually better done than this.  But it starts out saying this, this and this.  And then it goes, and they're part of the CIA and they have it.  And it starts going, you know, very tinfoil hat ish.  But that one is actually better done than this one, which is just weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Well, I guess we could ignore it then.  I hope we can ignore it then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but it's it, you know, it plays into the creepiness factor.  One of the things that Schmidt said yesterday again was that we can do face recognition and show you information about people you walk past.  But we're not going to do that because it's creepy.  So where's the creepiness line? Right.  I'm not sure if that. Yeah. Where's the creepiness line?  But does it decreep it to know that they can do that, but they're not sharing with the rest of us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, that makes it so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. That's the thing.  You'd rather they just come forward with what they know and show it to you versus hold back so that you don't feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the sort of the thing that gets Jeff so wound up about the street view thing, which is that the UK is the case in point where there is a surveillance camera on every corner anyway with people watching it or people able to watch it.  But you can't see that, can't see the results.  So you don't know, but they drive us.  It will drive the street and put it on the Internet.  So everyone gets up in arms.  So there's the David Brin thing here of the Transparent Society, which is if you, his assumption, this was written 15 years ago, is that we will eventually be surveilling everything and recording everything and uploading everything all the time because the technology won't be that possible.  So we want to make damn sure that we all get to see it, not just those who are already in power.  And that's the, you know.  Oh, absolutely.  Google has done a good job of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty obvious.  I mean, you know, the government surely has face recognition attached to those cameras that are watching everything going on on the street.  And I pointed out on the radio show that if you're worried, don't worry about Google, worry about your Internet service provider.  Somebody like Comcast, who has almost 100 million subscribers, knows far more about you than Google does.  And they save it all for several years at the behest of the American government.  So my biggest problem with this, besides the fact that it's so obviously ad hominem, is it's really misdirection.  Pay no attention to what's going on with the government and your Internet service provider.  Look at Google.  Aren't they the bad guys?  And of course we should watch Google.  Nobody's saying we shouldn't pay attention.  But it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we saw somewhat the same thing this week.  It may be stretching, but I actually think that the attack on Craigslist for the sex ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a similar thing where it's the disruptor.  People are going after the disruptors.  Old power is going after the disruptors.  Right.  Those sex ads are in lots and lots and lots of places.  And indeed, Dana Boyd wrote a wonderful piece on Huffington Post that said that.  That was brilliant.  Taking out this disintermediation, you bring back the mediator, and in this case it's Pips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And it's already happening, by the way, and it's spreading throughout the rest of Craigslist.  So it's not in the adult section anymore, but it's at other places.  It's in the back of every newspaper.  It's not deep now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  And so why did they go after, why did both government and media go after Craigslist and not go after Village Voice and not go after the newspapers and not go after these other people?  Because they don't understand why Craigslist exists and how it operates and what it motivates.  It scares them.  It's scary.  It's not a purely profit-motivated company.  It's scary.  Yep.  And it's creepy to the old powers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a, Huffington Post also has a article from Melissa Petro, a former sex worker, about why Craigslist empowered her to do her own thing versus working for a pimp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what you see, I think, in a lot of these cases is from two different sides demonizing the technology disruptors.  Yeah.  From the one side, it's the kind of anti-corporate, anti-capitalist, oh my God, they're making money.  Right.  And from the other side, it's the, I'm the old guy, it used to be my money we were making.  Right.  And now I'm not making it anymore, and I'm going to try to find some way to go after you.  Yep.  Well said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think that that's a stretch at all.  I think it's exactly what's happening.  And it's happening in every area.  This is the disruption.  This is the paradigm shift.  And the old school just fights as hard as they can and sometimes dirty.  Yeah.  Google settled the Buzz Privacy suit, $8.5 million, into a fund which will be distributed as awards for organizations that focus on Internet policy or education.  Hey, maybe the consumer watchdog can get some of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe they can give some to Dana.  Give some to Dana.  That would be worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good thinking.  Good thinking.  So this was the lawsuit, bogus as well, saying that Buzz violated users privacy.  Of course, Google fixed it almost immediately within a week.  That one wasn't wholly bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was some dodgy stuff happened there.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, and Google said so.  And although I don't know if anybody proved any harm, certainly the potential for harm was there.  That's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was with some people last night who are in the new ad business, the new behavioral targeting ad business.  And one of them said they talked to a regulator in government in Washington and that they really are having a hard time finding harm.  There's a lot of fear and there's things to be careful about and protect against.  But to try to define the harm is actually extremely difficult.  It's a lot of people saying that's creepy.  But what's the harm?  Right.  And if you just cut out something because it's creepy, well, yeah, a lot of things are creepy in life.  If we cut out everything that's creepy, you know, a lot of geeks are doomed.  It's like porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what the harm is, but I know it when I see it.  You know, if I feel bad about it, it's visceral.  Not that you'd ever see it, Leo.  Not that I would never see it.  Well, that Pia Zadora, though.  She is hot.  Google agreed also to make efforts.  Not anymore, Leo.  I don't think she was hot at that.  But let's not start talking about that.  Google agreed to make efforts to better educate Buzz users on issues of privacy and the particular privacy that Buzz offers.  I haven't I don't know.  I haven't seen anything along those lines.  I'm not sure what that would look like.  Maybe a button that says privacy.  Why it's important.  Why they settled this?  Because it's eight and a half million.  It's it's chicken feed.  Get it. Get it out of their hair.  They've got bigger fish to fry.  Of course, the state's attorney, attorney's general are going after him over Street View and Texas and so forth.  So they have they have other lawsuits.  This doesn't get rid of all of that for sure.  Anything else you want to tackle before we get to our tip tool and number of the week?  And we could let Kevin go if if you need to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm fine.  I switched on to the mobile Wi-Fi.  They just granted demolishing the set around me.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What fun.  He stayed till the party was over.  I know.  Last one to leave over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But there's a there's a there's an event tonight at one one one Minna in San Francisco at seven as well.  Apparently, I thought that was kind of funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said that at the event.  And if you want to know more, we're going to have a little meetup.  Come on and talk to us.  Wow.  I don't think Apple I don't think Steve Jobs would go to a big meetup to talk about the new iPods after the event.  Wow.  Now, how many people were at this press event?  Kevin, was it pretty well attended?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was about probably three or four hundred.  That's good.  Guessing from the size of the room.  That's an Apple size Apple size attendance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and I guess it's open to the public this minute event, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wasn't clear.  It really wasn't clear.  So we'll see.  It was open to everybody who watched the stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not a very big it's not a very big venue.  You're right.  Yeah.  Have we did we talk about Priority Mail last week?  I guess we did.  We did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I loved I loved.  No, I finally got it.  And boy is it great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it so much.  I have moved off of my IMAP service fast mail and I've moved to Gmail.  I have all my mail going to Gmail now.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Right.  Wow.  I know.  That's a big move for you.  It's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How long has it been?  A couple of three days.  It's a little disorienting.  I bet.  And when I by the way, I'm going back through all of Gina's old articles on how to use Gmail  better.  Thank God for the Internet.  Finally, I'm reading your articles about that.  JK.  JK.  JK.  I got JK and I got left bracket right bracket.  It's taken me a while to understand the metaphor is different from a desktop client.  The idea of archive inbox.  Yeah.  Filters.  Labels.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's very different.  But there are analogs for everything that I did with Apple Mail and I'm still having  maybe this is a crutch, but I'm still having my fast mail download it all and still sieve  it and still getting it through Apple Mail.  So it doesn't look so different on Apple Mail.  It's good.  I like it.  I'm starting to get the keystrokes.  What are the keystrokes that we need to do for Google Instant within that fast company

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  So tab to autocomplete the next word suggested.  Okay.  Up and down to move through the drop down.  You knew that already.  The only shortcut I found that they didn't mention during the stream was right arrow  will launch the I'm feeling lucky.  So if you see the top result is what you want, like if you type twit.tv, you can just hit  right arrow and I'll shoot you right over to twit.tv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that was that was kind of the only one that I discovered.  Kevin, have you found any other new ones?  No, no, no.  So if you go down and then hit right, it'll send you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cool.  That's neat.  Very neat.  Hey, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, sir.  I think I probably better get on board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get your plane, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  But give us a number before you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was afraid you said I think I escaped that I lost it.  Actually, Leo, I can't find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, CNN says senior moments happen more to men than they do to women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't need senior moments anymore.  I have Google.  I have a safe flight.  It knows where I am.  It knows what I want.  It knows what I think.  Who needs anything more?  Tell the Greens that you tell those Greens that I will take care of Google dot com and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we'll type in twit number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think one billion a week should be the number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's white.  It's white.  It's white.  It's white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is white.  No, no, no.  So one billion, one billion what a week searches.  One billion uses a week compared to half a billion for Facebook a month.  A billion a week.  That's a good number.  Jeff safe travels.  Jeff Jarvis blogs at Buzz Machine dot com is the author.  What would Google do?  I have it right here.  I never I never put it down.  What would Google do?  Very cool.  And I guess, Gina, in a way, you've already done your tip if unless you have another one  that you'd like to.  I have I have one other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is from Kevin Purdy at Lifehacker.  The priority inbox is really awesome, but you can only get it in the browser so you  don't get it in your on your mobile device.  But it introduces this what the reserved label important.  So if you just if you do a search for label important in inbox, you can bookmark that  search on your phone, whatever phone it is, and check your priority inbox that way.  So and that also works in the Gmail Android client.  But you can't save searches there.  So it's a little hard to get the type that whole thing out.  So that's a little annoying.  But you can see your priority prioritized messages using that using that search label  important in inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I find as I use it and I tell it this is important, this is and it gets smarter  and smarter and more and more useful.  It's really it's almost like a new metaphor for email.  I really like it.  Yep. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm glad you got it.  Yeah. I got it actually almost right away.  It was it was really the fact that you switched to Gmail is kind of a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It made you try it out for I fought it.  I fought it for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I always had a multiple Gmail accounts, but it wasn't my main it wasn't where Leo  at Leoville.com goes.  Now it's where Leo at Leoville.com goes and all my other addresses.  A couple of tips.  One is now you can sign up for Google with open ID, which means you can use your Yahoo

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  account to sign up for Google, which is weird, which is a recursive like I'm going to sign  up for Google with Yahoo.  But I love that they're supporting open ID.  I think Yahoo is the example.  In fact, it's great because it just shows how open Google is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the support for open standards from Google is oh, it's one of the reasons I supported  Buzz and I support Google in general is that they always seem to opt for open standards  when they can.  And I know that you're a lot of the reason behind that, Kevin.  Well, I'm not sure I'm that was the culture they had before I got there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I helped encourage some of the some of that group to reach out more.  Yeah.  But it's it that is good to see.  I'm hoping they'll do it more generally using Webfinger, which would mean that you can do  with any site, not just the ones that have got open ID.  And that's something that's being worked.  There's a whole bunch of these authorization models that people will working on to to to  make this stuff easier.  There's there's there's a real meal.  If you heard of that one, that's Tantex putting that to us to let you use old to log into  sites.  So if I can I can log into his site by putting my blog name in because I have a link to  Twitter and use the Twitter author login.  So there's there's a bunch of thinking going on to make this stuff easier and more useful.  It's part of the problem we've had with open ideas that has been a bit complicated.  And all has been showing up as an easier model for doing combined authentication and  authorization.  So not just letting you log in, but giving you access to certain things as well.  So being able to log in with Twitter has been a powerful part of that.  So the iteration going on at the moment is to try and make that general.  So it's not just one particular site and to have similar APIs between the sites so that  you can get the same kinds of data out of it.  But this is that certainly the Google Yahoo thing is a is a definite move in the right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  direction.  Yeah.  I want to find out more about this finger thing at some point.  Webfinger.  Webfinger.  You've touched on it before, so to speak.  Yeah.  But at some point, let's spend some more time talking about that.  My tool of the week is actually has to do with Gmail and this new Google Voice and Gmail  and something that you know, I'm sure, Gina, all the people are watching probably know  this, but it was a revelation to me.  I use Google Voice.  I use it religiously.  I use it on my Android phone.  It's just fantastic.  And of course, you could set up Google Voice to ring all your numbers.  And you can also set up Google Voice to ring Google Chat.  Yep.  And what's happened to me all of a sudden is now I'm sitting in Gmail and when my phone  I noticed this the other day, my phone rang on my three different cell phones on the desk,  but it also rang in my browser and I picked up the phone in my browser and I talked in  my browser and the quality was great.  I didn't have to hold anything in my face.  I didn't have to leave my computer.  This is fantastic.  Welcome to the future.  And well, you know, that was the kind of a mini epiphany I had is, well, wow, this really  is integration because now all my communications, SMS, chat, mail and phone are in this one  browser window.  Now I'm trying to figure out, well, you know, I should just keep that window should just  be a permanent window.  It should be my desktop, shouldn't it?  Can you write an article about how to make Gmail your desktop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's it.  Just, yeah, just fix it to your desktop.  That's what I want.  Contacts, tasks, phone calls, IM, email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It also made Chromium make a little bit more sense because now I can see, well, maybe you  do really want to live in Chromium on a tablet or a netbook if really all of your, it becomes  your communicator.  And I immediately went to my netbook to see if Linux, well, they're moving the chains,  aren't they?  To see if Linux supported the Google Voice calling and it's not great.  It does.  There's a plug-in for it, but I couldn't really to get it working on a netbook, which  is too bad.  I think the drivers weren't working or something like that.  But very, very cool.  And I have to say Gmail now is my kind of my always open page because it's all the communications  that I do.  Okay.  Well, they're chaining up Kevin Marks.  So we, oh, wait a minute.  Those are the baboons in my pants.  I'm sorry.  Kevin, thank you so much for joining us.  Kevin's at Ribbit.com.  Thanks for having me.  We're so glad you wanted to be on and right from the event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Making things, bringing the browser, something we've been doing for a while.  So it's good to be here.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not new, is it?  You did it.  You did it first.  Yeah.  I just love that idea.  I don't need a phone when I'm on my computer.  It's amazing.  I started making calls that way now.  It's great.  My son said, where are you calling from?  My browser.  I'm calling you for my browser.  Gina Tripani is a blogger at smarterware.org.  She writes for Fast Company.

You can also watch it after the fact audio and video available at twit dot tv slash twit.  Stay tuned.  Tech news today is coming up next with Tom Merritt.  I'm Leo Laporte on behalf of Gina Tripani, Jeff Jarvis, Kevin Marks.  Thanks for joining us.  We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.  I'm going to start and stop my video.  Who's that?  Colleen!  Colleen!  It's Colleen!  I recognize her.  Oh, that's awesome.  I'm wearing the shirt that Colleen gave me.  Yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I love my hand.  Oh my God.  That's great.  So of course Colleen streams these events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm really glad they do it.  I'm so glad they do it.  I'm so glad they do it.  I'm so glad they do it.  I'm so glad they do it.  I'm so glad they do it.  I'm so glad they do it.  I'm so glad they do it.  I couldn't fly up there.  Yeah.  I'm really glad they do it.  Colleen, do you know if the licenses allow us to restream?  Because we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have absolutely no idea.  But the thing is I just wanted at certain times to make sure that other people can see  the streams.  And luckily you were providing a stream of somebody watching the stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you knew.  It came in beautifully.  We've always had great results with the Google streams.  So is that kind of what you do?  You manage those things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of my many responsibilities is basically Google produced content.  It's mostly like internal corporate communication stuff.  But when there's big external events, I make sure that they work correctly too.  And then I'm working on some other fun stuff on the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you actually doing switching and things or are you just supervising?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So for events like this and for the stuff that's done in the Mountain View campus, they  actually have a crew where they have a dedicated switching person, a dedicated camera person,  a dedicated audio person.  And for smaller events, I'm exploring other options.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's neat.  Hopefully it'll be if we just automated all of it though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Love to hear about that.  When you do, then I could fire all these people.  Fire.  No, no, no.  I'm kidding.  Just kidding.  All right.  So we have...  Thank you very much, Kevin, for letting Colleen pop in there.
