We have a great panel  Introduced them but our we can finally let it be heard actually  Let me help let me introduce Jeff because Jeff can help me on this Jeff Jarvis  From the City University of New York where he teaches journalism the author of what would Google do and his brand new and public parts  He blogs at buzz machine.com. Hi Jeff. Hey, are you so our cohort?  Miss dearly, but for good cause. Yeah, miss Gina. Turpan. He was not here last week. We didn't really know exactly  Why at first but she then sent us an email  She said that her wife had to go into the hospital and we were a little bit concerned about that  But it turned out she was in the hospital for a happy reason

So that's why Gina is gone this week  She may be gone a few more weeks because she really does want to be there for baby Etta, but she assures us  She's not abandoning the show. Yeah, she will be back  With us now from Google Matt cuts who's in charge of fighting spam on the Google web search results  Great to have you back Matt. Good to be back and also we  He seems to be living  Here lately we welcome also Aaron from  Oracle or son or a witch I can never go with the source show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Recuses my me of saying anything I wouldn't want to say Aaron newcomer who is has his own podcast called

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The source show the source at the source show calm  But also is a regular on floss weekly and was just on our ball about Android like like a couple hours. Yeah, right literally

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  last night so

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, it's great to have you Aaron. So we'll make this we'll make a deal when we talk about Java  You can recuse yourself when we talk about Google you can use yourself Matt  That way everybody will be happy because we are gonna talk about Google just a little bit. In fact quite a bit  Lots of our top story really has to do with Google Maps and this is a story that's been breaking  Even as we speak  So as most people by now know certainly if you listen to any twitch show  We've been talking about the fact that Apple booted Google Maps and iOS 6  Replacing them with their own maps product which they had talked about  in at WWDC in June  And in fact it turns out according to many reports  that June was when Google learned about it, they were a little shocked because  Apple had over a year left on its contract. We had initially heard that the contract had run out  this story by Chris Ziegler and the verge  says that his sources say that  Two independent sources familiar with the matter say that the the agreement had another year to run and  Google was sent scrambling to develop an iOS Google Maps app an app with which both sources stay is still in complete currently  Not scheduled to ship  For several months that kind of now clarifies Eric Schmidt's comments of two days ago where he said hey  What are we supposed to do force Apple to include our maps product?  and  Others who said well we want to be on every platform  it's clear that this was a business decision on Apple's part and of course Apple's getting a lot of heat because  The iOS maps some say are not as good now. I think it depends a lot on where you are  According to people I've I've heard from in China. It's actually better  Apple bought data in China that was better than the data Google was mainly a data problem, right?  Well, it's no source issue. It's not just data sources Tom Tom was quick to point out this it's not our fault  That's where most of the data for Apple's maps come from it's really seems to be and I think this is  Pretty clear from the way Google works. This is it's a question of merging source disparate sources  Always a problem because it's an impedance mismatch  So there's you know, there is there are GIS standards for mapping data, but it's more than that because it's not just mapping data  You also have points of interest which Apple's getting from Yelp and other places those have to somehow be properly merged in  Google Google said last week that they've been working on this for 400 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Matt can you explain that number because actually that's that was an interesting the headline on that story said Google's been working on it  For over 400 years, but Google never said that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get bit by headlines every single show. I know so what Google was essentially saying though that a lot of manpower

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there have been a lot of stories that point out that mapping is really hard  Yes points of interest aligning things all those Street View cars  There was an article in Business Insider several months ago that claimed  7,000 Google employees work on maps in various different ways or Google contractors and people like that  so I mean mapping is fundamentally a very hard problem and  And you know, that's just the reality of the situation. It's it's gonna be a difficult problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, I wonder whether Google isn't you know, I probably wasn't planned this way  but I wonder whether Google isn't just as well off for at least some delay because  Apple Maps are getting some crap out there people do miss their Google Maps and gee it was Apple's fault not ours and  Maybe maybe some of you don't really want to go run it out to buy that new

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got to be really careful though in in in today's world. You can't you can't be too anti-competitive  So the last thing you'd ever hear Google say is yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you go enjoy those Apple Maps  We still got some good maps over here on the Android side of the  equation  But I think that's the case right now anyway, and you're right. It's probably good for Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it was kind of funny because you know  I'm far enough away that I don't I don't know all the internals of those kinds of negotiations  Of course  But you know you read the headline or the story that says there was a year left on the contract and that you know  Sounds plausible. I can definitely believe that but it is the kind of thing where if you've seen that the tumbler of the different iOS 6 stuff  There was one that had a route to the San Jose airport, and it went over the the runway and  So that you really wouldn't want to follow that right?  Yeah  That may be gasp, but it's definitely the case that it'll get better over time right it you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the tumbler that you're talking about the amazing iOS 6 maps  Yes  The amazing iOS 6 maps dot tumbler comm I've got a few of them  Here and and they are there they really show a world that is  Very different for some reason that's white. I don't know why somebody painted the landscape white there. Here's the one you were  The Helsinki Central Railway Station is a park  But you know you expect this this is it's a big world. I don't expect it. This is Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're talking about I personally feel like they should have tested this a little bit more thoroughly before they put it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know how many other services have they messed up remember back to various of their cloud services  That were horribly messed up beginning they make products a different way, but services at Apple have never been  Well not never but have often been messed up on launch no

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, apparently the Huey Long Bridge is available at Home Depot  That's that's good to know in New Orleans New Orleans is actually more messed up than  many other cities  The it was a hubris you think that Apple thought it could do this it was interesting because remember just before  WWDC Google held a hastily convened  Mapping event at which they showed the 3d the new 3d map views that they were getting by plane  And and I think there've been a number of articles before the iPhone 5 was announced and before it came out  People invited into the secret Google mapping center and a tour of how we're doing  It's clear that all along Google's been saying exactly this this is hard stuff  We know what we've been doing it Nokia could probably make the same case Nokia has been doing a very good job with its maps  Which are used by Bing and by Amazon and of course by Windows Phone and Microsoft  Is it hubris did Apple did Apple bite off more than they can chew I mean to me it certainly feels like it was rushed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And and you're right. I mean even Google Maps when it first came out wasn't you know like it is today  It's taking time, but and it's still not perfect. There's always little problem  It just feels really rushed and I wonder if they're to me  that's the more interesting thing to think about was it a rush to get away from Google or  was it a rush to  Get because they really saw the intrinsic value of all the data that comes from  Having your own maps and getting people reporting their locations back to you  Or was it just coincidence that it just happened to be you know they happen to not see these problems when they were testing it  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's very clear that this is from a business decision  And I think some of the criticism Apple's getting is from people who said hey Apple you used to say you cared about  Users and the user experience, but clearly you've made this decision that is not best for user experience for business reasons  Come on I  Think only somebody totally naive would believe that Apple doesn't make decisions for business reasons. They're a business

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but the question is not that so much as it do they have the discipline they should have which is a you know  I think what you're saying  Mmm. I don't know you know it is the magic gone. We use these stock stories now wondering whether it's hit its peak  We'll see the music name for me this week is as you see Leo  They've been trying to Google's we're trying to push Google Maps and of course it just released  Street view in the ocean and the joke there of course is that Apple Maps will take you dump you into the ocean  At least we'll show you what you're looking at

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I also think that  This is more than just business in the sense that let's screw Google  I think what really is going on here is that every company has realized that mobile and location are the future and somebody said  This on Twitter. I think it was Peter Rojas of gadget that  Apple is it was a computer company. Let's not forget. That's its genesis and and realized at some point that  Mobile was where it was happening  I mean all they had to do was look at the sales of their iPhones which they make far more money on now than they  ever did on computers and  That in order to compete and Nokia realized this to Nokia spent something like ten billion dollars to get to have a foot in

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mapping and mobile even Amazon is going to map because they want to deliver to you locally

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's where it's where the world is moving  So if you're going to compete as a company and survive as a company you need to be strong in mobile and location, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, that's the data that that's the first layer of data for targeting  Especially when you when you have mobile devices and mobile services, you know  Where's the nearest pizza is is the beginning of the small data you need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Contra who has a contra counter notions blog  and this is quoted by Jean-Louis Gosset in the Monday Note says  In answer to the question why didn't Apple kick Google Maps or why did Apple kick Google Maps off the iOS platform?  Shouldn't Apple have waited his responses waited for what for Google to strengthen his chokehold on a key iOS service?  Apple is recognized as significance of mobile mapping and acquired several mapping companies  Which they did and they they were on a buying spree over the last year  IP assets and talent that we heard from TechCrunch that they're actively courting  Google map contractors trying to get them over to Apple to help out  Mapping is indeed one of the hardest mobile services Contra goes on to write involving physical terrestrial and aerial surveilling or surveying  data acquisition  Correction that's maybe where Apple's fallen down  Tile-making and layer upon layer of contextual info married to underlying data all optimized to serve often under trying network conditions  Unfortunately like dialect recognition or speech synthesis things Siri mapping is one of those technologies that cannot be and this is it  This is the important point cannot be fully incubated in a lab for a few years and unleashed  You need to put it out in the wild for it to mature and that's what you said that Google Maps Jeff when they came out  Weren't great, but they've been around now for how many years and they've been collecting a lot of user data  So they have gotten better Apple needed to do this Apple's never been hesitant to  Take a you know to bite the bullet and do something that's tough

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In order to get brag about the number of data points they've gathered in the maps through use which really matters  But as I said on the show last week though  I think it does become a new splitting point here is that the reason that I have now switched to my Android phone is  Because of Google services Yikes, right and it's my it's my gmail and my calendar and all that  But Maps is one of those and I think that for iOS users to say oh we have the latest phone  We have this phone and well, where do what happened my darn maps and yeah, it's a business decision on Apple's part  But the other thing you have to ask is don't you have to super serve your customers?  And if your customers do want that option  shouldn't you know another option for Apple would have been to leave both on and  The Apple fanboys would have gone to Apple Maps. They would have had time to work it out  They could have pulled it over then they you know could have pulled it out of iOS 7 or something  Instead this switch over before they were ready  That's so cool. I don't know unless there was a not compete clause that Apple, you know in the contract that Apple couldn't have its own  Mapping, but I doubt that how about this? How about

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're seeing and I actually applaud this at least because it makes our job much more interesting  We're seeing a couple of companies Apple and Microsoft take massive chances risk pissing off their their  Embedded base of users with Windows 8 and and this new maps thing in order to move forward and that these companies are bold  And brave and this is what we keep saying  We want companies to take chances to be bold and brave and and Apple's doing that isn't that what Apple's doing?  Isn't that a good thing?  It's interesting. It's risky. It is risky

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But like there was an article that came out just today that talked about  Developers in Windows 8 and some of the article the comments on Hacker News were saying well  But we just got used to this one API two years ago, and now we got to switch to a new API  Or the risk I guess would also be there was a new study that just came out that said iOS is customer satisfaction  Yes dropped for the first time first time ever  Now the thing is it makes sense and I understand why Apple wants to be the master of their destiny  And so I think ultimately they have to choose on you know  What the impact will be on users and and how good they can make it how fast and all that sort of stuff the main  Thing I would just say as a Google employee is that there's a lot of love for Apple at Google  There's a lot of articles that want to you know push the companies apart or or try to turn it into an adversarial thing  And you know we we wrote mostly run on Macs whenever the engineers are in the meetings  I'm like the one guy with the Linux computer  And it's all Mac book errors all around the table other than me  And so there's a lot of people that use and love Mac products at Google so  It would be interesting to to learn how Apple's feeling about it on their side

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure that many if not all Apple engineers use Google right I  Think I think you this you know I remember waiting in line in 2007 for the first iPhone for six hours  I was sitting next to two Google engineers who were a work who were working on reader  And they told me they had spent the last 48 hours sleeplessly updating reader to work  Well with the iPhone, so I think you're absolutely right  I think and I don't think that love is gone at least among the ground level troops  these are high level business decisions and what we're seeing is a battleground and  Jeff we've talked about we talked about this on almost every show  This is a battleground now location is a battleground for Facebook  Amazon by saying we're gonna do maps to we're gonna use Nokia maps. They're saying we're in this to everybody  This is what they that's what this Kindle HD fire HD is all about its location, and it's mobile and  And I think that Apple's doing what it had to do and unders I think Apple fully understands the risk

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know as you just talked about this  I hadn't thought about this before but I've argued that we are moving in the economy  In many cases from vertically integrated industries to ecosystems with platforms and entrepreneurial development and the networks right that were one replaces the other  The funny thing here is what's happening in in the former world of platforms is they're going back into being vertically integrated industries  so that each one of these has  Software it has services it has hardware  and that's Amazon and Apple and commerce and  That's that's Google and Amazon and Apple all of them doing all of those things  you know, it's part of the reason that I guess  Arrington keeps on trying to yell at  Facebook and Twitter that when you go to get your phone because everybody has to operate the same and I'm not sure that's true at all  No, I think face

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a good example because Facebook Mark Zuckerberg said this over and over we're not gonna build a phone  We don't need to build a phone. We need to be on every phone that's built right? Yeah, so maybe that is the other thing  Maybe Apple and Google could have worked together  It's okay you but but that the question is does Apple get access to that data that is so important and so valuable to Apple  They don't right Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do they want to do with it, right Facebook?  You know their stories out about how they're changing their ad structure and Facebook wants to deal about relationship data  Google wants to deal with relationship data because it can make a fortune on that in terms of advertising and now commerce and services  Amazon can do that the the odd thing to me in this equation is I don't see how  Apple benefits from relationship data. Yeah, they can sell me some songs and some movies and stuff  But that's kind of where it ends. They're really in they think well, that's the question

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Apple thinks it's in the hardware business, but maybe but it's not in any advertising business. No, it's in the hardware business

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, but is that is that sufficient? Is that worth all of this effort?  I mean, yeah, it's the most it's the most valuable company in the world. So I guess it is  but  I understand the strategy of data data data for those other three companies  I don't see a strategy yet out of Apple for how it  Good point really maximizes and optimizes the exploitation of that data. Good. Do you guys think I'm wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're building the foundation of that right now. I think that's what this is all about  Yeah, maybe they can't capitalize on it right now with what they've got but that's what this is all about  They're building that foundation. They're gathering that data and I'm sure you'll see services come out based on this data later  Like in future releases, that's a reinvention of the company. Yeah, absolutely  But they've taken like what they've done with iTunes for example  I mean that was they were one of the pioneers of this but they always said we don't make money on iTunes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's to sell hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  True, they do make a cut though, right? So make 30% just they say no  I don't know claim covers the cost if it's in their interest in other words to recommend another album  Based on you know, my interests, let's say it's I'm interested in this this and this wouldn't you like to buy this?  I mean, I want to sell more out. They want to sell more stuff  So I think that you know both in the hardware business and in other things that they'll come up with it's about differentiating  They're their hardware in this case the iPhone  In future versions with the data that they're getting right now or they will be getting from their map services  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me throw another data point in that may change everything you want another one  This article just published in all things D by John Pitchkowski was excellent sources in Apple he says  The talks between Apple and Google over Maps crashed over voice guided directions  Multiple sources familiar with Apple's thinking say the company felt it had no choice  But to replace Google Maps because of a disagreement over turn-by-turn  Spoken turn-by-turn has always been offered on Android as a free service  But it was never part of the deal that brought Google's Maps to iOS Apple wanted and this this is gonna turn everything upside down  Apple wanted turn-by-turn and  Google wouldn't do it  It wasn't part of the deal and Google Google's the one that wants to differentiate  That's an Apple pushed Google hard to provide the data  It needed to bring voice guided navigation to iOS  But according to people familiar with Google's thinking the search giant which had invested massive sums in creating that data  And views it as a key feature of Android wasn't willing to simply hand it over to a competing platform  This changes the conversation entirely  It is now saying Apple wanted parity with Android and Google said no we're gonna keep that benefit  Which is a huge benefit and as a I think it's the reason a lot of people move to Android  Is not just turn-by-turn but turn-by-turn with Street View. Mm-hmm  So that when you pull up to vorax like discovered this and you can't stop talking about it like John has been here for years  When you pull up in front of a place it shows you a picture of where you're going which is hugely valuable  Yeah, that's where I'm going  Apple wanted it and Google said no, how about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that says that that that it right your tears it on its head  That says that I'm full of crap and that the strategy in this case notice I saved that till after you let you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I gave you a bunch of ropes  No  No, cuz I think both points of view are commonly well not both points of view your point of view and I would say  I held it as well is that this was Apple  Saying hey, it's time for us to get in location

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And maybe is Apple just saying that it would really hurt so that goes back to my earlier crack about Google saying hey  What the heck if we're not on there?  The game

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very interesting, I don't know who's right on this one  One source familiar with Apple and Google's negotiations told all things D quote  There were a number of issues in flaming negotiations, but voice navigation was the biggest ultimately. It was a deal breaker and  That's when Apple quietly began acquiring mapping companies fast-track develop of an in-house Maps app with  Turn by turn right with an eye toward making it a tentpole feature of iOS  6 and that's when it decided to dump Google Maps entirely  now I think because of the  Brouhaha over Google Voight the Google Voice app where Apple did not approve it for a long time  Didn't say they hadn't approved. It just didn't approve it and then got a letter from was it Markey  I can't remember somebody in Congress and then the Department of Justice saying hey  Can you explain this Google? Why are you saying no to and they said oh, no. No, we did not approve it  We approve it. It's approved  So I have a feeling and ever since Chrome and everything has been you know instant  So I have a feeling even if Apple would like to say no to a Google Maps app  That they'll have to say yes  The rumor is that there is one in development, but it won't be available until maybe Christmas at the earliest  Matt and I want to say this upfront is not speaking for Google  When he's yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Far enough away that you know all I all I do is you know whenever I can test software internally at Google  I enjoy testing it, but I have no idea about okay what negotiations happen or whether there's an app

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can you can tell us what your dog fooding then go ahead go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell us do you have iOS Google Maps app lying around? Well, no, unfortunately, I use I use the Galaxy Nexus  So I wouldn't know anything  Convenient

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry. We don't you know, we'll never get Matt back if we do that kind of thing  We we don't we don't ever mean to put you on the spot. We're nicer than spammers

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, let's talk about that. I want to take a break. We come back Matt got a nice letter

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  from Senator John D Rockefeller  On Tuesday about yeah, we'll talk about that letter that  Rockefeller said not just to Google but to Microsoft and Yahoo  But first a word from our friends at Ford who believe in social too now you would think what come on  It's a car company and this is I one of the things one of the reasons that we're really happy to have Ford is a sponsor  I think one of the reasons that Ford is  So visible in new media and podcasts and on websites is because they really are excited about  The potential that the 21st century consumer electronics technology like smartphones and social media can bring  to a  20th century  Industrial company like an automobile company. I think they've done it better than I know they've done it better than anyone else  I first really fell in love with the Ford Sink in my 2010 Mustang  And I and you know  I've been singing its praises and then they added app links that you could have  Your smartphone apps talk to Ford Sink so you could actually bring new apps into the car just by bringing in a smartphone  And now they've created a social site to help share the ideas  Help you learn about it. They've got a bunch of great articles and I admit they're great because I wrote one of them  Actually an interview I had with Jim Butchkowski  Who's a lead technologist of Ford and then one of the things I asked him about was the app link API  For sync and what apps might be coming. We also talked a little bit about  Autonomous vehicles because I know that's something you all are very interested in  You can find that article here along with a lot of other articles about  Ford technologies your stories, of course, and I love this a social suggestion box  Replaced one. I love this. I don't you know and you can vote on these ideas  Replace the windshield with a 4k LED flat panel HD display with night vision capability  The vehicle would have a steel metal covering where the windshield would be I you know  I wouldn't be surprised if that happens, but that's what's cool about this  This is a place where you could put your ideas however however futuristic or crazy or whatever people can vote on them  You can read what other people's ideas are and you can see images and videos of Ford  Owners and their vehicles and of course grab a badge and there's some great badges  I probably would get the pony car badge, but there's lots of other ones including I love this the tech geek  You're not just ahead of the curve. You're the one leading it get the tech geek bad  I want this badge and put it on Twitter Facebook Google Plus  Send it to your friends add it to your email signature. I don't know whatever whatever it is keep the kids do with badges these days  I'm gonna make a sash. Oh, there you go. Yeah, and embroider some badges. I'm gonna make a dickie  Whatever floats your boat mr. Duke of  Social dot Ford just something about word dickie just it makes you laugh kids still wear dickies. No, okay  Kid people are watching have no idea what you're talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's a dickie daddy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't ask me that son  Social dot Ford comm go there today and have some fun with it  It's really a great site and by the way the new  Fusions are out the focus is out the escape is out look at the mileage  That they're getting now on even though with these EcoBoost engines even on gasoline engines  But of course the fusion plug-in hybrid and regular hybrid  I mean these just uh  They are doing some great great stuff  social dot Ford comm become part of the Ford Revolution  Go further in a Ford  So you got an what did the how does a letter from a senator arrived? Is there a footman with a silver salver? I mean what I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually got an email with an attachment so for people haven't seen the the article there it is  This is the first spam complaint I've ever gotten from Senate letterhead  That's and it actually is it it's addressed to me, which is you know  Distinguished title yeah, that's my title which means I've been around long enough. That's so engineer comma Esquire  Wow so what's interesting is they did a 20 page report they had Senate hearings on moving company scams people who  Say it'll be $1,200 and then once you get things loaded up they actually are gonna charge you  $6,000 and if you don't pay them they got your stuff off yeah  And what's interesting is that they were really sad you're how is that your fault? That's that's a that's a real-world scam  It's a real-world scam and and we try to have a very light touch  We don't want to be accused of being the truth police you know and Google decides  What's right about vaccines or global warming or whatever we try to just reflect?  Whatever is on the web as best as we can in terms of relevance  But what they did really well is they did enough research to find out one of these companies  They called out and the report was scamming and and spamming in terms of buying links and doing stuff that violates  So the good news is they sent they've been investigating this for months it actually we launched a search engine algorithm  update in April called penguin and  Penguin tackles among other things this sort of links spam  And so they're the traffic to this website actually gone down by 75% even without  They were gonna send us a letter so we'd we'd also cracked down on scammy link networks earlier this year  And we call them in that roundup as well  So you know it's it's really just a great spam report and we're gonna investigate it more and see if there's more we can

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do but I just love that as always Google's ahead of the government. That's that's the way it is  Now what we got you dr. Spam  I've been getting I don't know if you guys have gotten this I'm getting a constant barrage of what you know look like fairly human  You know they can spell emails saying I want to talk to you about  submitting a blog post to you on  All these various topics and I asked on Twitter with other people getting it and all the bloggers  I know said oh god. Yeah tons of them you see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have and so you know the spammers  They'll move from the easy types of spam to the slightly harder because they they try to be lazy  So it used to be the case that guest blogging was a very respectable thing you'd hand write  You know something really thoughtful  There's a lot of guys who are now writing one article and they'll make  50 copies of it changing a few words  And then they'll ask to do a guest post on your blog and they're just doing that to try to get links

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so it's it's it's another form of link farming in effect because but yeah more legitimate way because  Then they're gonna get all the Google juice that's available from a Jeff Jarvis's blog  That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, sometimes they are real. It's just a lot of the times. It's it's somebody who's writing 500 words  They don't know anything about it  And they're just basically asking you for a link and they're gonna wrap it in some some prefab text that they've written

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love I love that they mentioned the Cornell Gymnastics Club in the letter. I don't understand  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They actually  They did enough research to find out where they were getting links from and so there's like the bought the muscle building link forum

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know and all this kind of stuff so people so their forums that are not moderate heavily moderated or properly moderated. They're jammed with links

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right, and and it looks like they'd also been doing a lot of paid links  There was a link network called well, you don't need to worry about the name  But we caught them earlier this year and they were participating in that so you so this is actually great

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because this means that penguins working  Exactly. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For me, it's a good reminder that you know when we launched penguin there were a lot of unhappy  SEOs, you know and and so I saw tons of people say

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're not we're not a link farm and they've reduced our ranking and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and and we do have to be mindful of the impact and the scope of Google's changes  So we do try to be very careful about that  But it's an important reminder from across the aisle that there are scammers and they do try to exploit rankings and we have to take  strong action on that actually  Yeah, yeah just hop in and hang out with the senator we've actually already taken action on several domains in fact  Almost a thousand domains because there were clear spam violations here  But we're gonna keep iterating and improving our algorithm  Hopefully we'll catch lots and lots of sites like this not just the one they call out the report

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's the beginning of Matt's political career

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd vote for him. I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just glad that somebody in government is actually paying attention to this  I mean it seems historically this kind of stuff gets kind of like whatever nobody pays attention to it. I  Personally, I think this is a big issue and I'm glad that somebody in our government is actually  You know taking a look at some of this stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I was right and I was prepared to mock it but it sounds like they actually did their homework and this was a good  this was a good report and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What we normally see is people who don't understand how search engines work, right?  And so we talk where you guys talk about that every single week  And in fact, there was another story in the rundown about a Brazilian judge  Who ordered the local president of YouTube to be put in jail?  So, you know, it's really refreshing to see a report where people did their homework  They understand how it works  And then of course we want to respond to that and figure out how to make things better actually Danny's Aaron

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead. You're right. The tone here was not Google's done something bad technology does something bad  It's that you know, we want your help to get rid of these bad guys. That's fine. That's what I'm gonna be  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Danny Sullivan says it's actually is evidence that penguin didn't work because these some of these are still in the search results

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's interesting because when we started to dig into it  We found almost a thousand doorway domains belonging to this guy  So we had affected the main site that they used but we're gonna have to you know, do some research  Making the rank go down by by three-fourths is pretty good  But there was one-fourth of people who are still affected by this particular scammer. That's not a great result for them  So there's always we're always open to constructive feedback and trying to figure out how we can do things better and we're gonna definitely  Pour over this report and see what we can do better

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It just shows these guys aren't I mean nobody would expect you to flip one switch and have it all go away  We have plenty of experience with email spam to know they've these these guys are like cockroaches  They find it just find another

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Crabby the interesting here though Leo is that this is a case where it ends up in a real-world scam, you know a physical scam  Yes, as opposed to a you know, why are us money kind of thing this there's a truck at your door with big broly guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're seeing more and more of that because what's happening is con and that's what started with the those Nigerian email scams  The con men are taking what would normally be real-life cons and bringing them to the internet and and finding a whole new  Way of exploiting people. I was I was trying to a real estate agent  About fake Craigslist listings and I said, well, how could you fake a craigs?  She said what they do is they steal our listings with pictures and everything create a Craigslist entry  But say the owner is out of the country  So what you should do is mail us some money and we'll mail you a key or you should come to the house at three o'clock  I'll be there with the keys. Give me the money and they so they're able to get the money and and skedaddle both  In fact, she said this past weekend  One of the houses if they were leasing the owner came and there was a family living there and the and the family said  Oh, no. Yeah, we just rented it. He said no you what? No, you didn't  I'm still showing this and they had gotten keys. They had gotten in they had moved in they were living in the house  Wow  So and then yeah, I mean and that's a Craigslist scam  But the point is that these are what would be traditional real-life scams just moving to the internet as everything else is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Be aware of it and you and you'll probably see more just earlier this month  This guy who was working for a site called decor my eyes. His name was Vidley

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that must have made you happy because he was the guy we talked a lot about it who was saying yeah when I when I  When I yell at my customers, it's good for my Google juice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  I'm really happy that that technique is probably not gonna be more

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and it's and it's true is what happened was he would say horrendous things and people would blog about and post about it  They put a link to his decor my eyes site and that raised his ranking, right?  But I think you guys we fact we even had you on I think at that time  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It turned out to be this news stories writing about the guy getting sued that that was how he was getting the links, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wasn't all the complaints that were helping him out. But nothing you could do nothing you could do about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey Matt, are we gonna ever see the?  comeback of the personalized domain blocking for search results

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, good question  You can still there's still a console where you can use it so it's not in the search results  But there's a Chrome extension so you can use that and and there's also a console where you can go  So it's it's just things have to defend their pixels on the search results page and enough not enough people use it  Then we're more likely to turn that off. Okay, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One other question we were talking about this either last week of the week before the pirate Bay auto complete. Is that under you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um  It's it's in search quality. So it's not me specifically that worked on it  But I know some of the guys that so that is the case that the the auto complete

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For when you start typing the pirate Bay went away  You don't get a you have to actually type the whole thing and hit enter and hit enter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's correct  And and the theory behind that is with auto complete would suggest when you're typing something in it's it's much more  Obtrusive to get up in someone's face and say did you mean this is this what you wanted to search for?  So if someone wants to search for X Y or Z we return results for X Y or Z  But maybe we're a little more careful about what we suggest. So he's had a slippery slope

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a little difficult because this wasn't at the German the first lady the ex-presidents wife  Yeah, who said well, I don't want you to come up with is a prostitute when you search for me  But that's but those search results though. Tell us how auto complete works. They come from other searches, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do they do and it's it must be really great to be a policy or a lawyer person at Google because you are on  The bleeding edge of these kinds of issues, but we've actually come up with some pretty good policies  I think we're gonna try to make those more public soon, you know, basically hate speech  porn  Spam, you know  There's a there's a very small category set of categories where we'll say  Okay  This is where we don't want to get up in someone's face and suggest stuff that they don't want to see but in general  It's it's by looking at people searches that we help learn. Okay that people who search for this might also be searching for this  So here's a useful query for you to type in

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think nobody would complain at all if you had a very clear set of standards  The risk of course is just as you said looking at you want to reflect the truth of the net and not be  Editorializing about it. So it's a very difficult line to walk

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is and and I can imagine, you know a situation in which  Maybe if there's something already in the web search results, so maybe there's been a newspaper story or something like that  So there's some evidence, you know that this is already a controversy that people are talking about this particular  Search then it might make sense to show that search  so we're always trying to find the right way to split the difference between  Free expression and trying to give people all the information they need and and still be responsible to very tricksy very difficult thing to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google News 10 years old and  In the years  With a cake  Because Google is only like 12 years old right so 14 14 now Wow  Wow Google News was launched September 22nd  2002 and  I've been using it religiously ever since yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  through the online News Association in San Francisco, they they held a party so  Christian Barat the founder of it Richard Gingras is in charge now were there and we had  Pot stickers and cake and the in the San Francisco office wasn't that was dinner wasn't it controversial Jeff and originally that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could algorithmically determine news

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was controversial a few ways right that was one of oh my god  What happens to editors and then controversial of course in the other way of saying this is stealing our soul  Oh, yeah, taking a picture of us, right? That's it. You know, that's just happen today. It's not on that  Well, it's not on the rundown  And and I love this story Rupert Murdoch who called  Google parasites and stopped looking to us pulled the stuff from the Times of London  We purpose pay wall from Google just meekly just came back and now allows Google to put up headlines and snippets because he needs  them  He needs the eggs

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting because that was the issue is like yeah. Okay, so the snippets are there, but it links to your properties Rupert

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's not like it's actually so it's a great timing too because right now for Google's sake right now  in Germany is I think I mentioned we have a  high potential below called a light stones should select an ancillary copyright going in which will require Google and other  Aggregators to pay for snippets and headlines that that notion is spreading to France of crazy  so in the meantime right now Murdoch the greatest Google hater there was out there and  Now comes crawling back with his tail between his legs, which is where it is these days most of the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's essentially an acknowledgement that we could we it cost us  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Even with a wall so so, you know, he's he's still sending people to a wall  So it's not really an advertising strategy, but he needs subscriber acquisition and and the Times is completely  Unseen in the conversation now, you don't even know it comes up that it has anything to contribute to a cluster of news  So he had to be back in there, which is kind of beautiful

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that. I saw that was pretty good. It really is all about eyeballs  I mean people aren't noticing anymore and when it's not there people don't notice they don't see it  Yeah, good luck having them find you whether you're making them pay for it or not if they don't see it then  Eventually, here's what he's gonna be paying for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you're right Aaron and and you can get it back into Google search  but what you're not gonna get it back into is Twitter or Facebook or Google Plus because you know, you're you know, you're not gonna  If you send someone to the Wall Street Journal, at least it's a porous paywall in New York Times is porous paywall  New York Times has a setup so that any links will come through the article but the but the Times of London nothing does  Yeah, I'm not  Like a link to it and Wall Street Journal too, right? I mean you thought as as

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Steel as it has some porosity you see an excerpt and I guess Google search was or Google News  Gets you the full article stay FT. Hello. They took that up

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I took that out but FDFT you can get some number of articles a month like the Times now contrast this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if you read David Carr's piece about David Bradley the owner of Atlantic Media in the New York Times  really interesting story Bradley  Thought there'd be money to make in in magazines  So  dollars later  he he bought the the Atlantic and  He says it was expensive and painful. I clearly did not know what I was getting into  He wanted to buy Newsweek couldn't get it  So he bought the Atlantic in 1998 along with the National Journal and Government Executive magazine. So fast-forward  took 14 years later and  He's doing basically web business, right? It's doing great

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He hired a I think the most brilliant business side guy in magazines in the US named Justin Smith who was responsible for the launch  Of the week and Justin's been on a high-end digital first view where he's pushed  Atlantic online made really well and it can read the entire magazine online  It's great stuff that he just started. Well, they just started this week courts, which is a new  Qz.com which is a new financial new service for the high so free  He very very good just the beginning of it  But really really good and there's a great quote toward the end of that article Leo where Bradley says that  digital Trump's print and  You know 100% digital Trump's print and and I think it's a really important way which again goes against  the religion of the Murdochs of the world who want to hold on or the Columbia Journalism Review who want to hold on to the  old models and  Justin Smith with Bradley's backing  Created a new model in the Atlantic and now they're expanding it with courts and I imagine they will in other areas now  What they do is they go to very high-end advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He saw high-end that courts has Boeing Cadillac chevron and credit suisse and they've bought it out through the end of the year by the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Way, they also create a scarcity that way. We have a high-end audience. We have a way so much very important  And it's really good to see digital winning. It's good. It's not just good for my you know  Nia nia nia points. It's good because it's the future of media and it's good to see some success stories

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and they've been profitable three years running. That's the key  They were losing money hand over fist and they are now profitable by giving it away  Free ad supported media. I think this is when I read this article  I couldn't wait to bring it up with you Jeff because it's just it's such good news

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, it really is. It's a good David Carr column very good one. Yeah, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe Rupert should read this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't looked at courts yet. Is it good? It's very good qz comms. You want to take a quick look at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's great URL. How do you get that? Huh? Wow?  What that's  Qtz qtz QZ two letters QZ. Oh there it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very simple looking what's it's straightforward blog with good coding across them part of part of what the editors have said is they don't  Have beats they have obsessions. Yeah, so if been going on right now, they'll dig it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just point out this is our model and  This is what we've learned  But it works on and that supported media do your passion do your obsession  That's what people want to read they want to read somebody who's like so involved in this that they they know everything right and let their  walks

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They hired some of the best and brightest young folks. Yeah  Interesting back Seward and others. Yeah, Nate silver interview a former head of  Digital at the economist very interesting stuff. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My favorite was a tweet from Chris Sokka who's a former Googler who said actually Google's efficiency is approaching the theoretical limit  more so

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is not a bad point to make that the  Electrical cost of using the Internet doesn't stop with your personal power bill  That when you go out on the net and you're using servers those servers are plugged in too  So that's appropriate I think to let people know that but the good news is just as centralizing  Power production and power plants makes them more efficient  These these with companies like Facebook and Google where this is a an Apple to where it's a huge part of their cost  They pay a lot of attention to making these as efficient as possible

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm buying wind power and and spending a fortune on alternative power and trying to figure that out and and it's never a  legitimate comparison to the old world ways and  How you know not driving to the library to get the book that was right over there by a truck?  That's a good point. It's a classic New York Times kind of trend effort for a trend story. There's a great  I recommend this highly there's a great Twitter account called NYT on it  I love it makes fun of all of the trend stories. So this one was it always starts this way guys  Apparently it takes a lot of energy to power the Internet's and the Times is  The earlier one I love this guys turns out not drinking soda is much better for you than drinking soda and the Times is on  Guys some New Yorkers live in really small apartments and the time

Transcript:  It is a very it is very very funny  It's almost as good as that horse account, what is the name of that one that is so funny  Yeah, ebook horse ebooks. You've seen that one, right? I haven't seen that one. This is a spam account  I think I kind of feel like it is. Yeah, is it horse underscore ebooks? Is that what it is? I can't remember  Yeah, so it's unclear what's going on here, but it's the funniest kind of non sequitur  And and you see they have a hundred ten thousand followers  Because you just read their tweets and and like here's one  you that you could be destroying and preventing these pests from your beautiful organic garden within hours after or  What can you do about it but see every once in a while there's a link see that's why I think it's a spammer  Mmm, yeah vegetables are tender turning in 1992. I innovated  or wrong  Then every once in a while there's a little link so I can only think that there's something going on here  I'm sure it's the exact same number interval number, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then they have earn on clickbank ebooks and yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure that's what it is. I  never really understood that I even the concept of spam and in an ecosystem like Twitter where you actively have to follow somebody but  It works somehow. Yeah, here it is earn on clickbank ebooks. So that's the spam right there  Hidden buried deep within things like sweet recipes and become a bail  Okay enough of that now I can talk about stamps comm I have I have sanitized the stream  from my nerdiness  Stamps comm actually this is a little nerdy  It's on-demand postage. I mean, okay  And the reason that stamps comm loves doing ads on the Twitter network is because they know you guys get it  You don't want to go to the post office  You have a computer you have a printer wouldn't be cool if you could use your computer printer to print postage  Now you can't print us money yet, but you can print official us postage  It's kind of cool with stamps comm if you can try it  I'll have to give you a no-risk trial offer in just a second. There are many advantages to doing this for one thing  It's on-demand postage we wake up in the middle of the night need you want to mail something you can on demand  But it's also a great way to save you get discounts  You can't get at the post office 21% or more even on Express mail priority mail up to 15%  They get a  International mail they've got discounts. You can't get those at the post office  You can mail stuff of via stamps comm that you have to go to the post office to mail normally be the post office  You know anything over 13 ounces you can't throw in a mailbox if you could find when they took all our mailboxes out  Have you think there's no more mail? Have you can you know where there's no more mailboxes at Petaluma?  I found one and you know where they put it where next to the bit next to the post office

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no next to the City Hall because all the people at City Hall don't want to like they were like well  We're taking them all out of the city except for ours. There are no mailboxes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's so they can mail their parking tickets because I got one for forty eight dollars  Oh

Transcript:  Maybe that's it  Sorry, sorry about that when you were here. You got a forty eight dollar ticket all of the good cause Leo  All send it send it to us. We'll don't take here.

It's a $50 scale  they'll give you a $5 supply kit to kind of make up for that and a four-week trial free and  If you can cancel it anytime, you don't have to pay a thing, but you can keep the scale forever  I think you're gonna want to stick with it stamps commits. It's the post office comes to you. It's fantastic stamps  Comm what are you doing going to the post office that that's wasteful?  That's wasting energy worried about the Google  Networks centers. This is waste driving the post office. That's waste  Google Play I just saw this stat this morning  25 billion downloads. Is that your number? I hope not Jeff. It's okay. I got another one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All I was missing as far as I was concerned what I use on on my my beloved  Nexus 7 was HBO to go and Showtime to go. I now have HBO to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm waiting for Showtime then then I'm good. I got it. Hey as long as we're talking about that. This is the Kindle Fire HD  Same size as the next seven. It's a little cheaper if you compare RAM  It's 200 bucks for the 16 gig version and they have a 32 gig although nowadays RAM  I'm not RAM storage doesn't seem that important because frankly almost everything you're doing on here is streaming  And it is Android but you'd never know that I'll tell you it's that it's that weird  Amazon interface which I've now somehow  Done something with and I'm lost. Oh, there we go. There's the New York Times, you know, it's fine  The  Whole equation is changed by the Nexus 7 because the Nexus 7 is is roughly the same price  And it's and it's it's jelly bean and it's and it's on you know, how about the nook is the nook also?  Do you know they just now announced their new nook which is definitely a competitor to the Kindle Fire HD

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it also has the it's highly tailored for  Barnes and Noble. I mean they're starting up some businesses

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is it is as de googled as

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yes. Yes. Yes, absolutely because they're doing the same thing that that Amazon's trying to do right there trying to drive  You know business so they're starting up new magazine business and video business to try to you know  Get people to you, you know to drive business back to them  So, you know, it's but I think people like it. I mean, it's it looks like  Technology wise it looks like a very good competitor to the Kindle tablet

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So and anybody who's watching this show would be buying a Nexus 7

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right you cuz you I use it as my Kindle. It's a wonderful thing, but I but I get so much more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My mom is addicted. I got her one just right after the next alive a Nexus 7 and she's like I will not use a tablet  I will not use a tablet. I don't like these things and so I said, you know what?  I'm gonna give her one if she doesn't like it  She can send it to me cuz I'll definitely use it. So I gave her one and she is hooked  She keeps telling me I'm so glad you I take it everywhere  I use it. I play this silly ball game. I love it. So, you know, she's she's hooked  She's 70 years old and she loves it. So oops, I shouldn't have said her age

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My mom's turning 80 in January, but she's an iPad user. I just sent her the new iPad 3  The browser somebody asked me how about the browser? It's not as it's like not as quite chrome  The silk browser supposedly is caching is faster. I don't see that at all  Let's upload load in Oktoberfest feasts, you know, I mean guess it's pretty fast  It's you know  I I can't see any reason to get this unless you're so hooked into the Amazon ecosystem and I bet you that's the same thing  For the nook if you're so hooked into the Barnes and Noble ecosystem that you really want to just live there, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've been meaning to read the privacy policy because I wonder if you went and just looked at  An article about Oktoberfest. Are you gonna see the recipes? Are you gonna see a cookbook in your recommendation soon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That will be interesting. Well, I'll let you know because that's what I just did. I looked at it a Oktoberfest recipe  You do get offers you could pay to get the offers off, but it's not a big deal  You saw it for when I launched. It's not a big deal  It's but the point is the Nexus 7 is all that and more  Yes, so I just don't see any compelling reason since you can get that there's okay. I'll give you one reason  There's one thing you can do on this and it's very you know, it's very nerdy if you're reading a book that you have  The equivalent audiobook for so this is an Agatha Christie book that Amazon was offering for free when the audiobook  What it sees it puts the audio here. I could press play and  It will narrate the audiobook and highlight the text as it's reading. I have to turn it down like  So as it's reading it highlights the text that it's reading I don't know of any other device that you can do that on  I mean, that's I don't know also  This would be good I guess for kid who's learning to read or maybe a dyslexic or something but  It does have that every but every audible has the whisper sync thing  And if you're reading a book it will automatically jump to you to that part of the audiobook so you can listen on from there  X-ray that was a unique thing. So  This is wild actually I didn't I've never done this before so there's four characters mentioned on that page  And I could see all the places they show up in the book now, that's kind of wild

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is kind of wild the digital humanists will go to I mean digital. What do they call it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's one humanism digital. Yeah, here's all the references to mrs. Cavendish. Would that be good in a text like a like a text?  Maybe you know for college. It'd be good for porn. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good idea, okay, let's see here's all the places where pony play occurred, okay, I  I  Wow, that's  Here's the good parts  Yeah  Anyway, get the Nexus 7. Yeah, the Nexus 7. There's just no question about it unless you're watching  audio porn  Or something the x-rays kind of interesting you it's a little distracting you're watching a movie and it says here's who's in the movie and  You tap it and you stop the movie and you can read their bio. It's kind of I think that's kind of an interesting thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't they link that to  Have they linked it to products yet? I am DB  Well, maybe I'm when you're watching a video if they zoom in on somebody's shoes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

I think I might  Actually  No, I never I don't know what whoa. No, stop. I pressed I tapped it by accident  The chat room says off the shades of gray. You know, it's $20 and 99 cents  Hmm. Okay. Let me find something so I can here super 8 is on free  So if I watch it it will pop up I'll just show you it's a long way to go to show you this silly thing  But it as you watch the credits  You see there's the x-ray see full cast okay, you can you hit it and then you're gonna get an IMDB  I think that's I mean it kind of reflects how people I often do that. I'll say oh who was that?  Yeah, especially since you have your devices in your living room now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a lot of times I'm watching movie I'll pause it and then bring up my tablet or my my laptop and type in you know  I am DB or right, you know, oh, I remember that person. What else was she in, you know?  So this person is on screen so it's showing his his bio

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh group shot  So whatever happened to that kid did he ever have a career or was that it that kind of thing I  Think that I think this is it and you're right  I think the future of this and I'm sure Amazon's prepping for it is oh, I'd like to buy that t-shirt, right?  Yeah, right wouldn't that be cool? That would be actually I wouldn't mind that no no not if it's a choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Save me a lot of time. Yep a lot of trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of time and trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that  Speaking of time and trouble we better wrap this thing up. There's so many stories  Okay, I get each of you stuff each of you could pick us pick a story that you think we ought to be talking about  There was a big Samsung touch whiz vulnerability, which they have patched it was pretty stupid vulnerability  Apparently they there's a code you could enter into the dialer that would  Erase the phone everything a hard reset all your data  And then there was a further code that would erase all the data on the SIM card  It was you know just open all you had to do is enter it and then it turns out that you could do that with  An NFC chip you could do that with a text message  Could do that with a malicious website, and you just go to the site and boom your device is reset  So if you have a Samsung Galaxy s2 or s3 and there's a and and Samsung offers you an over-the-air download today take it  Because they have patched it  And I was just checking because I'm running cm10 on my galaxy s3 and cm10 is not vulnerable

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think jelly bean or maybe if it's even ice cream sandwich and up was okay at least jelly bean

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure jelly bean and that's why I did cm10 because I want a jelly bean. Yeah, I really love jelly bean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just use the stock Android. You're safe. Yes. It's just it's the touch

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep, which should be spelled differently

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dick did you see dick Costello of a Twitter talking at ONA and I jumped up to ask a question  He spoke at the Online News Association, he's been on a PR role he did Charlie Rose. He just did I think CNBC  He's done some others. So Emily Bell  Brilliant a journalist from the X for the Guardian now at Columbia my friendly competitor interviewed him. He did an excellent job  She started off asking him. Well, how how is it? How is it dick to be in charge of the free speech of the modern world?  Great question. It was  he got a lot of stuff about the platform his his argument, which I  You know don't fully understand but he was arguing that  What their aim is is to enable people to accrete value?  That that you know Amazon opened up its platform and enabled other stores to come in to sell goods at lower prices than Amazon  but they accrete value to the customer and  To the partner and to Amazon itself in that process and he wants the same thing  But he keeps on talking about developing into Amazon  Not on top of it into Twitter into Twitter into Twitter  Commerce partner  If you blog about shoes, so so developing into Twitter and I don't know what that fully means  I push them I got up and and asked about the  you know the communications and then I ended up I said are there any more shoes to drop and  He said no that was the headline

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No more shoes to drop

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if this than that Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sounds like you are you that all great great question Matt. He somebody asked about that  Well, he said he said it had nothing to do with them in their platform  This is stories that come out

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We should explain that they they were cut off from Twitter access if this and that's a great website that lets you say hey  If I if I see a tweet with this hashtag then email it to me or do some other action

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They no longer have that access here's well, here's the problem that that so dick said on the stage  Well, no that people are saying that's the the API has nothing to do with the API and then he changes subject  And then afterwards I was talking to the good folks from storeify  And they said well  No  The reason if this and that went was because they were storing and forwarding tweets  And you're not allowed to do that which also could affect a place like storeify though Twitter said they love storeify  So there are shoes dangling. I would say Matt still

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, he also says there's he's got he's got a he's got a replacement in mind for the follower count  There's kind of a clout score. No, I think it was have a web said that that's right. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've wanted he says retweets are more important than followers  Hmm. I think that's that's kind of true. Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But how many people see the retweet is your follower count? Well, that's that's what ev said the money

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ev was being impish I saw ev2 at medium and some really interesting thinking that he's doing of course and  So I tried to talk a little bit Twitter and he just kind of you know shrugs  And so he did an appearance in New York this week at with BuzzFeed and branch  and I think he was being impish about saying well, I shouldn't say things because I'm on the board, but and  You know he made that mention a retweet being probably a more important metric and said that the real goal  This is this is this is I think very impish because I've asked about this before  The real goal is to get a number of the tweets that are actually seen  You know, there's there's a huge impression actual impressions actual impressions tweets, right?  So I my my follower list got so big and I'm not kind of groom it and so it's a mess  So I use my media walks list mainly I read that every tweet on that  But I don't read every tweet of everybody I follow  most don't so there's a huge volume of tweets that are never seen by human eye and  For ev to say that that's kind of a little weak underbelly of Twitter there  But I think it's very honest that if Twitter is gonna argue that they have this value  They're gonna have to get honest about that valuation because if they are a media company and note  They may hire a Hollywood guy to be on their board Peter churn in X News Corp  If they were and and and costless said no, no, no, we're a technology company that is in the media business  We're not a media company. Yeah, they're a media company and if they're a media company  They're gonna have to do things like measure accurately and they're gonna get audited for those things  So they better get their act together because that's what media companies have to do, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Real quickly Marissa Meyer revealed. No, she didn't not really she said she was gonna but she didn't radical transparency  But she didn't say what she was gonna do  To an all-hands meeting  She called it an act of radical transparency Kara Swisher pointed out. They didn't say no such thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anybody else? Huh? Is anybody else bullish on?  Yahoo, yeah, I mean I'm absolutely I'm bullish on Marissa

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly so hard and if you look at the stuff she's done already  You know being able to sell some of the assets in Asia  Free food for the employees letting the employees get phones that aren't blackberries like she's she's taking really good steps to get goodwill  Which then she can parlay that into people doing good work. So yep. Yep, and yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She has to come up with a strategy  It's all it's all well and good to give people food

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we do see the big glimmers of it  I think I think that what and maybe this is just me projecting on what my thoughts are on her  but but she understands excellent services great experiences and  She understands data about people and acting on that data about people  And I think that I saw glimmers of that in what we what leaked out from from the session that she's gonna improve email and she's  Gonna clean it up and do other things but that I think services that yield data about people that she can act upon  I still think is probably where she heads

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, that's unless you guys have another story that you see  Real quick is the meeting your troll story. I thought that was interesting. What is that a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Guy was being horribly horribly horribly trolled. He left Twitter  He was getting not just things online, but he and his wife were getting horrible things

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not trolling that is stalking that is abuse

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Got a friend who was better at technology to try to track down and found out that even the foreign domains tracked back to a  friend's house  clearly  Teenage kid who was doing this and so he met the kid and you know  the kid one hopes learned a lot of lessons and is gonna get a lot of help and  so but it's an interesting way that we talk so much about trolls and faceless trolls and to get behind the story of  One that went overboard but then ends somewhere where you know where the ending is  I think it's kind of fascinating to people so I recommend that yeah, it's good. It's a trainer's eye

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the guy Leo trainer  t r a y n o r s e y e dot  Comm if you want to read about meeting his troll and he's back on Twitter has a happy ending

Transcript:  I had to start over again. Yeah, so they're working on making it easier to sign up  So you know ideally it would be like 30 seconds instead of like it'd be nice if I could just have more than one  Authenticator, but I guess that's you can you can so at one point in the process  There's a QR code that you take a picture up  Yeah, and that's basically a secret that seeds the algorithm so I could use two phones to take the picture  Yes  Just leave the QR code up and take pictures with as many devices as you want and then any one of those will be authenticator

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ready perfect, so I do it one more time, and I'm just gonna have all my phones ready and do it on all of my phones  18 in a row yeah, I am gonna do that I'm gonna do it on tablets on everything cuz I it's nice to have authenticator in a variety of  Spots yeah good tip.

Transcript:  I think it's interesting that Google stock  Passed its all-time high which was 748 90 it closed today at  46 over 760 and the interesting to me is according to  International Business Times that makes Google now that by market cap the fifth largest corporation in the world  With an only a five percent gain it would surpass Microsoft and Exxon mobile to become the third largest now  Then there's still I'm sorry. No it would surpass. Let me get that right is barely behind Walmart and Microsoft  It would so we could then become third behind Apple and Exxon mobile. There's still quite a bit of a gap there  Market cap of Google is 245 billion market cap of Apple is  645 billion, but you know when this Maps thing plays out. You don't know where that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Man hit him while they're down  Boom and 25 billion downloads which was the other one yep  Oh  You want to talk about nuzzle all right we could do nuzzle as my tool  I don't think you have to be it's a beta are you have this is a Jonathan Abrams the guy who started Friendster  has a  Thing called nuzzle which is a new news friend news. There's so many of these  social news aggregator kind of a thing of a gob and  You  You have to sign up beta dot nuzzle comm and then get invited I did get invited  So here's what it would look like and actually it's a really good sort  Did you do this did you put this in here check cuz you're on nuzzle who put this in here?  I did Matt cuts  That cuts snuck it in I'm sorry no I needed a tool. I appreciate it. That's good  I was gonna do CM 10, but that's good. I like it so so this is this is nuzzle and I  You know it's there's so many social news solutions, but I do like I particularly like this one because you see all the tweets  It is and you can you have settings in this too not just that the the the how recently but also how many friends  You can sort it by the number of friends who liked it or the or sort of chronologically  You could show stories that say at least ten friends  Retweeted this so that's gonna give you a very strong  You know indicator that this is a story your friends are following we all know that Twitter is a really useful way  To find out what's going on  In fact, you know we were asking Steve Gibson last show how he keeps it with security says I let people tell me on Twitter  You know when somebody when somebody comes to me and says hey did Andy Williams just die what do what where do you go?  You go to Twitter right mm-hmm. Yeah, it's the first thing you do well the older people might  What do young people do?

She's a gmail  Which is why I'm pointing at Matt cuts as I try to remember Petra cross. That's it Brad cross Bradley crosses her husband  That's another social media play. They're quite a few of these social news play

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I just love the idea of you know, you don't have time to pay attention to Twitter all the time  So if you're in an eight-hour set of meetings you can come here and you can just see what you've missed  Yeah, what did I miss? Yeah, and if you go all the way down to the bottom, they actually have something  That's like 50 more stories and that will take out the people you follow but it will show stories from the people they follow  So you can kind of spread your viewpoint out a little bit. That's a good that's actually a really good idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then you can look at other people's nuzzle feeds  Yeah, nuzzle is a nozzle with a you  You're in the nozzle  I just got it  Anyway, thank you Aaron Newcomb from Oracle and more importantly from the source show org
