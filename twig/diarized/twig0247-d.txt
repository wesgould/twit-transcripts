It's time for Twig This Week in Google. The show that covers the Google verse, the Twitter verse,  the Facebook verse, and because it's the Bard's 450th anniversary, the Shakespeare verse.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Gina Trepanney of SmarterWear.org and think up. Hi Gina. English  major really appreciate it. Nice to have you and Jeff Jarvis who teaches professionally  professionally as a professor of journalism at the City University of New York CUNY.  He is also the author of public parts and what would Google do? Hello Jeffrey. Hello, hello,  hello. Always a pleasure. Yeah, I guess you know, this is actually an interesting story. This has  nothing to do with Google or anything but does have to do with Shakespeare. 450th anniversary  of Shakespeare was born we perhaps think April 23rd, 1564 a week ago, St. George's Day.  It was baptized on the 26th so I say we'll just honor that but which is kind of fun is  somebody from Daily News Gems reached out, Bill Lucy reached out to a bunch of people on Twitter  saying what's your favorite Shakespeare quote? Tina Brown said a little touch of Harry in the night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You go girl. I don't know what that means. Well her husband's name is Harry. Ah I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See that would be my favorite. That's very good from Hank Sank, Henry V.  The obvious one from Merchant of Venice, Chris Matthews said the quality of mercy is not strained  it droppeth as a gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath. Patrick Buchanan said we few,  we happy few, we band of brothers from Henry V also. Henry V is a good one for quotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Dershowitz would get extra points if he had said let's kill the lawyers first. Kill the lawyers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  first. Sam Tanahouse, American historian and writer at large for the New York Times, the more pity  that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly. I have to think about that one.  No fool, oh I changed the whole meaning of the sentence that fools may not  speak wisely what wise men do foolishly. Alan Dershowitz, our doubts are traitors  and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt. I like that from measure  for measure. David Ignatius, author of Body of Lies, columnist for the Post, men must endure  their going hence even as they are coming hither. Riteness is all. That's from King Lear.  I don't know. You want to know what Kara Swishers was? Yeah she regretted it she said on Twitter.  That's the one she regretted.  You are a good Shakespearean. I love Shakespeare. Leo as King Lear. I will do Lear. Actually that's from Richard the second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Kara's quote. This is the quote I would have picked for her. Though she be but little she is fierce.  There you go. Midsummer's night dream. Nice. That's why she regrets it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She knew there was better. She says I really picked a depressing Shakespeare quote.  That's fun. Anyway happy birthday to the bard. This is the bard of Avon. So we covered this morning  at 10am and you can see it in our TNT episode for this week with Mike Elgin and a couple of people  writer from Forbes whose name escapes me. Shoot. And from 9to5, Max Zach somebody.  We covered the, I'm sorry. And I'm always telling Mike, Mike you got to tell us everybody's name  so we know who you're talking. I forgot. We covered Fate, F8, the Facebook Developers Conference. First  one in three years. Although they did say that we will now do this from now on every year.  That they're probably watching how Apple and Google do their developer conferences and  realizing how important Microsoft do, how important these events are.  And especially this one because Facebook essentially, I believe, has decided, there you go,  Parmy Olson of Forbes and Zach Hall of 9to5 Maggis. Right there in the show notes. Sorry about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Parmy and Zach. It's age, Parmy and Zach. It's purely age. It's not that you're unmemorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can testify the same way.  It's that time doth fly in seconds and minutes and groans.  That they, I believe, and I think Mike Elgin had the insight this week and posted this in his  computer world piece, that these companies, particularly Facebook, realize, but Google  certainly started it, that the way to success lies not in making a web page that everybody  wants to go to. I mean, I think Yahoo learned this very early on. The portal is dead.  No, they still haven't learned it.  But yeah, we're still learning it. But in fact, to create a bunch of attractive  honeypots, if you will, Google Docs, Google Voice, Google Plus, apps across all platforms,  and then unite them across a common ad platform. And so you gather data, and this is what Google  really has been doing from the beginning. You gather data from all of these little flowers  and you bring it back to the home office and you make honey. And then advertisers  advertise across it all. You know everything and you've got a great platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And key to that, Leo, and I've been thinking about this too, is a lesson when I hear when I  hear people in my business say, mobile first, we got to be mobile. Well, what they think is they  build another bloody portal. And when Zuckerberg said to Farhad Maju that he was breaking up the  big blue app, I think we talked about this last week a little bit, and doing other things. I  thought about Google and the point of it is that Google is not thinking like a brand first,  it's thinking like a user first. So if I want to get somewhere, I go use Waze. If I want to  communicate in email, I go to Gmail. If I want to search for something, I go to search.  There are appropriate contexts for my needs. It's not that they're trying to create 25 cool apps,  it's they're trying to do things that are appropriate for what a user wants at that moment.  And so Facebook's going the same way. That's why I don't think Facebook's bothered about trying  to integrate WhatsApp, because WhatsApp is a different function. So you go there for that.  Instagram is a different function. You go there for that. But you're right, then you have a  relationship with a person across all those platforms and that gives you the opportunity  for targeting and advertising and all that wonderful good stuff, which we in media don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  understand still. And in fact, it's very interesting because it also gives you the capability,  and Zuckerberg was at pains to say this, that you can say, okay, you can be anonymous.  So Facebook Connect, that's the big blue button you say, sign in via Facebook. And a lot of apps  use it. A lot of websites use it. Now it can say, and we'll say, sign in, you'll have sign in via  Facebook. That'll let everybody know your personality, who you are, or sign in anonymously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But as someone pointed out on Twitter today, I forget who it was, Facebook will still know  what you did. You're only anonymous to the website. You're the only anonymous developer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of the third party app. Right. Yeah, that's not so cool. Well, and I think it's a spin, isn't it?  Because you really, I mean, it still works just as well for Facebook, maybe even better,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because Facebook owns the relationship now. Yeah, totally. And that's not so cool for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  app developer, a app developer. And that's going to be the challenge, isn't it? Yeah, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the benefit of using something like Facebook Connect is that, you know, users don't want to  have to create another username and email address and password, right? They could just log in and  it's easier. It's an easier user experience, easier onboarding, which third party, small apps,  new apps need desperately, right? And that's what Facebook Connect offers. I mean, and but part of  the offering is, hey, I can get this person's email address without asking them to type it in,  which is annoying, particularly on mobile. So I was thinking about logging anonymously,  which hasn't launched, by the way, this is something that's going to happen eventually,  right? Zuck just talked about it, talked about it today. You know, what do you get as an app  developer? Do you just get it? You get a token. Okay, so the user still has to enter, you know,  an email address. I mean, as an app developer, I need some way to communicate with the user.  It's generally through an email address or if your mobile app push notifications, I guess, or your  or your phone number. But yeah, no, this definitely benefits Facebook and it benefits users. So that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a good thing. But, um, well, but that's so now so you're right. So Facebook has to come up with  some sweeteners. And they came up with a couple. The first thing they said is, we're going to keep  our API solid and consistent for a minimum of two years. We are we want to be solid, reliable,  we want to be a platform that you trust. And in order to get you to participate, not only will we  give you connect with your users want, but we'll also give you things like parse, we'll give you  under we'll give you the tools for very, very affordable price, presumably, for data, the  database that you need a lot of the things that you want in your app that would cost you money or  that you would have to develop will now give you an entire developer platform and an ad platform.  And that's the come on, isn't it? Live in our universe, we'll make it easy for you, we'll make  it easy for your users, your users will be happy. The trade off is, you know, if you want more  information, you'll have to ask for it. By the way, people do that right now with Facebook Connect.  It's a little annoying for me. They say, connect with Facebook, you connect, they say, now create  a user account with the password. Yes, that irritates the hell out of me. But that's why and  that's going to use you more of that, right? Yeah, right. So now the advantage of using

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook Connect goes away. So this is the question whether whether as an app developer,  is Google sign in going to be better? Well, the argument from Facebook is, oh, giving you all this  much more control over privacy, which may be a good argument. What do you think, Gina? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, on the mobile side, you know, Google sign in is way easier, particularly on Android,  because you're absolutely logged in. Well, you're logged in to your Google account on Android,  multiple Google accounts. You just choose the one that you want and you're in. And I'm not sure how  it's implemented on iOS, but I think it's a similar thing. I think that you're logged into the suite  of apps. Oh, no, you are. Yeah. Yeah. Whereas with Facebook, now look, Facebook has incredible usage  on mobile. So presumably, maybe you are already logged in to, you know, to Facebook. But it's,  I mean, coming from my perspective, which is someone who doesn't use Facebook as much and  who's kind of Android focused, I would go with Google login first, because it is the most  seamless login experience for our native mobile app, particularly on Android. Note, it's not Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Plus login anymore. It's the Google login. Is that confirmed? Well, the rumor is. Well, we should,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we should talk about that. Okay. We should talk about Google Plus and, and, oh, we'll get to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to, we're going to get there. Don't you worry your little sweet little head about that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  dear. No, no, we'll definitely be talking about that. But I want to, I just wanted to get the  Facebook F8 stuff here. They also launched a new mobile ad network called Facebook Audience.  And Mark winded up the proceeds in a very Larry, I thought it was a Larry Page. We're going to call  these Larry Pages now, where the CEO comes back on stage after the, you know, keynote, as Larry did  last year at Google I.O., and says a final word about who we are and what we mean and what we do.  Now, Larry went on and on and he talked about an island and he answered questions from Scoble and  it probably wasn't as on point as it could be. Mark was very on point. And he basically said  that we are going to make our customer first focus be the focus of what we do as much as hacker,  you know, as we consider ourselves hackers, we're going to consider ourselves serving the customer.  And then he ended with that. And I think that that's a message not just to the audience watching in  and the developers in the conference, but as much to Facebook employees, customer first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think that's an acknowledgement. Go ahead. Is that a tension with move fast and break things?  Don't you feel like there's a natural tension there? Well, that's why he deprecated move fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and break things right at the beginning. He put move fast and break things right on the top there.  And he said, no, because we want to give you a stable and consistent platform. Oh, that's a big  change. Well, and it makes sense. Move fast and break things is great for apps, but not for the  platform. You want the platform to be rock solid. Well, let me ask this, Leo, because, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they made a great big deal. Now, God, five years ago about we kill a lot of our apps, we're opening  the platform, developers, developers, developers, we love developers. And then much of the apps that  people couldn't get any attention for the apps and developers just went away. So are they trying  to say developers, you're welcome back? Yes. What's the relationship of Facebook to a developer now?  Because because like Twitter, I think if I were a developer and I and I put a lot of effort into

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  something on Facebook or Twitter, I'd feel burned. I have to write, but this is the opposite, isn't it?  I have to say Mark has shown a real great willingness to to change his mind. For instance,  remember he was pushing HTML five as the app platform. And then they said that was a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  mistake. And they said, bye bye. He moved fast. He moved fast and break things in his own leadership.  I respect that. I respect that. Though it does make you wonder, you know, what's what's it going to be  at f eight next year. I think Anil tweeted earlier, kind of some of the things that were announced at  previous f eights that are just not around anymore at all. Fast. Right. I think this is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  redefinition of what he sees as Facebook. And I think he's actually right. And I think Google  pioneered this idea and that, you know, they continue to acquire apps. But now he's saying we  don't even have to acquire apps. If you're an app developer, develop to our platform and you'll be

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  part of the family said that before. And I'm not saying that he was wrong or right before wrong or  right now. I'm just trying to understand what's the difference in the attitude toward developers  from five years ago it was opened up and then apps went into obscurity. And so what is it they expect  now from developers versus what they expected the last time they opened up? He closed out by saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this. Here's the quote. I was looking for the quote. We have this really strong hacker culture  at Facebook and it's helped us grow. But it's really been focused on us. Instead, we want to  instill a culture of loving the people we serve as strong as our hacker culture, if not stronger.  It's an honor to serve you in our mission. Now the cynics will say, yeah, thanks, Mark.  But maybe he's sincere. I feel like he's as sincere as Larry Page was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I think he's sincere. I just try to understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a paradigm shift. That's what I think. I think it's a massive paradigm shift.  So tremendous paradigm shift. Yeah. And I think he's saying that he's saying we used to he started  off saying we used to have this famous mantra, move fast and break things. That mentality made  sense in a startup, but we're 10 years old and we need to be a platform now and we have to be stable  and consistent, stable and consistent. I think it's smart. I think this is, but I think the lesson  is learned from Google. And I think if you're Facebook that you see a brave new world, you're  an ad network. You're acknowledging what you have been all along. It doesn't have to be invented

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  here. Well, this is also part of the breaking up the, I guess here's the difference. Okay. Maybe  try that. Try this on. Here's the difference. The first time they opened up, they said, feel free to  write apps onto, into, as part of Facebook. And your son Jake did, right? Jake was a big developer  on that platform. He wrote it and sold it for a pretty penny. Now I think what they're saying is,  no, no, we're breaking up the big blue app, as he said. So feel free to use our API to write  new apps on top like paper. That's exactly what he's saying. That's the difference. Okay. Now I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  understand. And he said, and more than that, he said, we learned how to massively scale a network  backend. We have 1.2 billion users and we can handle it and you can use this. We're offering you  this, this platform. And boy, we do, we know how to serve 1.2 billion users. You know, it would be  smart for them. We were talking a little bit about this to go out and buy M Pesa or some sort of  mobile payment platform. Instead of creating their own and acquire a bunch of users in the  developing world who use their phone as a bank, they're already using WhatsApp.  Right. They could use a Facebook wallet. I think there's a huge opportunity here. I really do.  I think Google knows this. They were, they were smart enough to realize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, particularly with Facebook's numbers and non-US and Canada countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have to get people to trust them. Not non-trivial, as Google has also learned.  They have to get developers to buy in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and there's, you know, a story we'll probably talk about later, but there's a lesson in here,  I think, too, from Twitter. And we'll get to that story later about Twitter's slow growth,  but I do wonder whether if Twitter had kept an open attitude with developers and had developed  outside of itself on an API, would it be bigger now than it is? Would it still be growing faster

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  than it is? I tell you what, I just love this space and I love covering this space. It's an  intellectual exercise every month. It is. Well, here's the other, here's the other, by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  would Google Plus be bigger if they'd ever done the Rewrite API?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's talk about that.  Oh, yeah, that is interesting. That is interesting.  Is it over for Google Plus? Vickandotra says goodbye. The untold story of Larry Page's  incredible comeback. And what happened to Twitter? All coming up. There's lots more to talk about.  Also, Google's change log. We'll do that in just a second. But first, I want to tell you about this.  Wouldn't it be cool if all of the printers that you deal with day to day could handle Google Print?  Google Cloud Print is so cool. I love cloud print. If you have a cloud print enabled printer,  you could print from anywhere, from your phone, from your laptop, to any printer that's cloud  enabled at home or at work. But a lot of older printers, maybe your printer just isn't compatible  with Google Cloud Print. That must be a little bit frustrating, right? I want to print to this  printer and it doesn't understand it. Well, here's a way to do it affordably and very easily.  This is, yeah, we've talked about the Lantronics folks before. Their Xprint server, they have an  AirPrint version that works with Apple devices. This is their new cloud print edition. You plug in  almost any printer and it suddenly allows wireless mobile printing from your Chromebook,  from your Android device, from your iPhone, even from the Kindle Fire. And it will work with the  printer you already own, wired or wireless, USB or network. It's the first and only print server  officially certified by Google for cloud print and Android printing. It prints to your existing  printers. You don't have to buy a new one, more than 4,000 top brand printers. It literally turns  it into a wireless printer and it's easy. You might think you have to download or no, you just open  it up, plug it in and print. It's got a web interface for advanced configuration, but I  can tell you right now, in my experience, you don't need to do anything. You just plug it in.  It automatically discovers all the printers on your network. It says you want to make these  cloud print. You say, yeah, and that's it. This is such a great idea. If you've got a USB printer  that you currently have to plug into, suddenly it's Wi-Fi enabled. It'll work on your network.  It even works with large multifunction printers, pretty much any printer. It's 149.95  for up to 10 network printers and 8 USB printers simultaneously. People use these in schools and  offices. You plug this one thing in and boom, you're working. Visit xprintserver.com slash  twit for more information and to get yourself one. In fact, when you use the offer code twit,  you'll get free shipping on your order, xprintserver.com slash twit, the new xprint server

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  cloud print edition from Lantronix. I want that now. Isn't that great? Yeah, because you're a  Chromebook guy, right? I'm a Chromebook guy, man. It's perfect for me. I need that. I basically  my Mac does two things in life. This show and it's a print server. All right, good news. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  all it does anymore. Send one to the, we'll send one to you post-taste. You don't have to get it.  We'll send it to you. We got a few lying around. That's cool. It's great, isn't it? 10 printers,  huh? That's great. Yeah. I talked with, we got an email from a teacher who was using the Apple  version. She was responsible for running the network in the school as always. There was nobody  in charge of it. So she was in charge of it. She said, I couldn't believe it. I plugged it in.  All of our printers were suddenly air print compatible. We were printing, you know, the  students are printing and stuff. If you've got Chromebooks, this is a huge thing. Hey, let's do,  let's not delay it. Sometimes we delay it and I regret it. Let's not delay it. Let's do it  right now. Ladies and gentlemen, break out the horns. The Google change log. It's time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now here's Gina Turpani with the latest. Google released iOS apps for Google Docs and Google  Sheets. The apps were on the iPod, iPhone and iPad, and they let you create and open and edit  documents that you started on the web. You could share with other users. You can work offline.  You can add and respond to comments with Sheets. You can format cells, enter sort data. Everything  is saved automatically as you type. And both of those apps are available for free in the iOS app  store right now. How different is it from just using the drive app? You know, I haven't actually  had a chance to try these out. I think it's just a much more native, you know, better native  experience than the drive app and slides are not available yet, but they are coming soon. Cool.  I left my iPhone at home. Speaking of Google Drive, Google Drive can now cast presentations  to the Chromecast. That's cool. Yeah, it's really cool, right? So this only works on the desktop  right now. So to cast a presentation, there is a present button in the top right corner of a Google  Drive document. If you have the Chromecast extension installed, you have to have the Chromecast  extension installed, but you do if you have a Chromecast. You just see the option to present on  another device, and from here you can select which device to cast to. Really, really, really nice.  So just skip the projector and plug it right into the TV. I like that a lot.  Let's see. Google Glass updates. Field Trip, which is the app that tells you what's going on  or gives you information about things in your world, is integrated into Google Glass. We knew  that, but now it's voice integrated into Google Glass. So Glass wearers can say explore nearby.  It's one of the main core Glass voice commands, and Field Trip will show the wearer interesting  facts about the world that surrounds them as they walk. And Glass is also getting another much-needed  feature. I was pretty excited about this. Field Trip's pretty cool, but now Glass will have smarter  phone answering. So Glass will know if they're not on your head to ring your phone and not your  glasses, which I can't tell you how many times I've had my glasses ring because it was Bluetooth  connected to my phone when a phone call came in.  So your Glass would ring and not your phone?  Not your phone, yeah. So I'd hear my phone ringing, and yeah, you'd have to grab your phone and  switch it to phone. So, yeah, it's a really cool feature.  So some nice Glass updates there. Google Search now lets you filter restaurants by what's open now, price, and more.  So using Google Search on the web, yeah, this is really nice. On the web or on Android Search app, you can  filter restaurant search results. So if you go to Google and you search for, you know, show me some  restaurants in downtown Austin, or related searches, you can filter by how expensive, what kind of  cuisine, if it's open right now, the Zagat rating, which is very, very helpful. So do your Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  searches for restaurants? You know what I really, really want? What? Tell me what you want. I'll tell you  what I want. I want a lot of things, but don't get me started. When I'm driving from here to there, I want

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to be able to say Starbucks on the way. Yeah, that seems sensible. That seems like a small thing to ask for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It really does. And you know, especially in ways, I have a destination. It knows what roads I'm taking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I, you know, find me the next Starbucks. Yeah, or find me an ATM or a gas station. In some GPS

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  apps, you can do an intermediate stop. Really? Oh, because usually it's just the nearest and you're,  you know, you're between 20 miles between exits. And it doesn't matter that there's a Starbucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  two miles away because you have to chat. Chat says he wants a, how do I get gas on the way button?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Always. It drives me nuts. Well, Waze tells you the nearest cheapest. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there needs to be a, there needs to be a, you know, pit stop option because yeah, either you have  to redo a complete new navigation. And sometimes I've already chosen a different navigation and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you have to re-choose. I find it annoying. My car's always saying you're out of gas, you're out of gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want to see gas stations? No. I want to keep driving. Are you one of those horrible people that  drives down to fumes? Yep. You're also one of those horrible people that also appears two minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  before the flight takes off? If possible. Sometimes that's not always easy to do, but I try.  I like to, I like to walk in that plane as they're closing the door. Oh no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Two hours ahead. My mother made me neurotic as hell. I feel like this, this has a lot. This has,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm learning a lot about you. Five years later, I feel like this is indicative. What about you,  Gina? Are you the, I'm trying to figure that. I aspire to be Jeff, but in reality I'm Leo. Like  I come late, but I'm like harried and freaked out. I'm late because yeah. Oh yeah. I'm always late

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for everything. I just show up, you know, late. You're the only TV network on earth that doesn't  give a crap about the clock. And I'm proud of that, even though it drives our audience crazy.  Oh, I don't know. It drives them crazy. And I don't want to drive our audience crazy.  I should do a Mark Zuckerberg. We built this station on the notion that no show should start  on time, but now we want to take care of you, our audience. I'm pretty much never ready to start

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right at four. So I'm really glad like it was built for me. Yeah. See you and I, this is actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the week after next, right? When I'm, I'm going out to Google for it to do a privacy talk, right?  The next Wednesday morning, I either fly back and I think I would land at  2 30 at Newark and I live 20 minutes away from Newark airport. So I'm now the Leo would say,  no sweat, right? Jeff would say, hmm, I'm usually home at least an hour before the show.  Something could go wrong. Then I'll be really nervous and I can't tell anybody because I'm in  the air. Maybe I'll stay two more days just so I can be on the show. You should, they should have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on Google now, like a setting for that. What kind of person are you a Jeff or a Jeff or Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a neurosis slide. I'm like, you know, it's 15 minutes past showtime and Skype's like,  Hey, do you want to install updates? I'm like, what could go wrong? Like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I did that too. Yeah. Let me just update Mac, the Mac right now. I'll just run it.  I do it in shows.  Actually, I was so proud because I flew to Colorado to see my son on Thursday last.  And I arrived just as the boarding began for my row. Like I like walked in. That's what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am so proud that I am now here's how neurotic I am. I'm now global services on United.  Yeah, we go on before the pilots. We go on first. Right. And it's that horrible moment  when I used to hate those people that say, excuse me, excuse me, global services. Let me through.  I don't know. I'm nauseous. Right. So but even so, even though I know I can be the first to board,  I don't have to line up. I don't have to do anything. I still show up early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I'm neurotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I really do aspire to be that person who's who's like, you know, on time and quaffed and,  you know, prepared. And I'm no, I'm always the one that's like, ah, my hair is wet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now that your mom is even worse, you're probably even worse. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, forget it. Yeah, absolutely. It's true.  And it screws you up there.  Oh, yeah, because anything can happen with the baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I didn't know this, but apparently Wednesday is app update day at Google land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you know that?  Yeah, I noticed I noticed that Android police had said something like, hey, it's Wednesday.  So things things get updated. So I just assumed it was twig day.  So Google dropped their updates, you know, just in time for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like this update. I like this a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  True test of of of whether it's twig day or not is whether they listen to us about I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Anybody? Well, we'll get to that next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess. Yes, they did.  They did. Yes. Yes.  Still working on it. But someone did. So it worked.  Thank you. Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But first, we're going to tell you where you parked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Last item in the changelog.  And we talked about that this might happen. This is actually happening.  Google will now remember where you parked.  And I believe this happens automatically. This is a Google Now feature.  Google updated search app and that update is rolling out right now.  Basically, new card detects when you've stopped driving.  I love that.  Where you parked.  And if you want to get that, the APK is rolling out now.  If you want to get it right now, you can go to Android police.  They've got manual downloads. You can sideload the APK if you want.  I haven't had a chance to actually try this out.  I believe that it happens just completely automatically, which is sort of the beauty of Google Now.  I just love that.  It's amazing. It's great. It's pretty great.  I was earlier we were talking about Facebook and apps.  I was thinking about how Google Now, like both Facebook and Google Now,  Google, even though they want to spread the love across different apps,  there's still that core experience.  For Facebook, it's the news feed.  And now for Google Now, it's Google Now.  All that data kind of feeds back and informs a core experience.  And more and more, it just feels like it's Google Now for Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have such a massive advantage.  Although I have to say, I've been playing with this  with Microsoft's new Windows Phone 8 one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I don't smell you don't play with a Windows phone. I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do. But I play with it all the time.  So they've added Cortana, which is a dictation capability.  It's pretty.  But it's very Google Now ish too.  And I wonder if Microsoft's going to be able to do this.  So, you know, obviously they're playing catch up.  In fact, apparently it's not doing anything.  They're a problem.  But what the maybe my networks down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That could be seems like it's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the idea of this is it will tell you things like.  Well, it just asked me this morning.  Hey, it looks like you live here.  Is that right?  And I said, yes, it looks like you.  Oh, here we go.  Looks like you work there.  Is that right?  Yes.  And then says, good, we'll provide you with  commute information from now on.  So here's news updates based on I've told her my interest.  It knows where I am.  Here's the weather forecast.  But we'll also have commute times.  It can look at your calendar.  So they're trying to do.  I mean, this is very close to the idea of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the future of but but it's going to but its head up  against privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's you know, Google has and this is why you  do what Facebook's done did and what Google has done,  which is you have signals across a broad variety of things.  Yep.  And Microsoft does provide mail, right?  They have Bing search.  They, you know, they have a kind of similar layer to Google services.  But for you and I and Gina that we don't care because we're in  the Google world.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I imagine if you if you use Outlook, if you use all of  the docs and all that stuff in the Microsoft world, it makes  sense.  And as I've often said on the show, it was the apps that drew  me to the hardware.  Right.  It was the services.  I know about the apps.  It was the services.  Service is the hardware.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they've got one box.  They've got I mean, if you use office, they have office on.  I have in fact, just the quick thumbnail on this is that  they've Windows Phone 8 one is in many respects caught up.  If you're in the Microsoft ecosystem, if you are as I am in  the Google use system, Google has screwed you.  And it's not Microsoft.  It's Google because there's no Google Plus on here.  There's no Google Voice on here.  The Gmail support is weak.  I mean, it's there, but it's just not sorted very well.  It's just everything.  It's the all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's interesting, Leo, because that's why there really could  never be a Facebook phone because you don't do all of these  things on Facebook.  Well, yes, I agree ecosystem or the other.  Yeah, that's Microsoft or Google.  And those are the only two real competitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple has it.  But Apple has such strong privacy protections.  They're never going to be willing to do what Google did,  which is say, oh, and by the way, we're aggregating everything  from everything you use to together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And plus, you don't do all of these things.  It's going to run here.  You don't do as many things.  Well, maybe you do.  I do know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apps do theoretically has a similar,  theoretically similar capability.  So I have to say Windows Phone and now is every bit as good  if you live in the Microsoft ecosystem as Android is if you  live in the Google ecosystem.  I just wish Google, in fact, if anybody's listening to Google,  it'd be really nice if you provided your stuff here on  Windows Phone, because then it would be a really solid choice  for a lot of people.  What's the market share, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  I mean, 4%.  Although I have to say, that's what the Mac is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I have to say, that's what the Mac was for years.  Right.  And we didn't, as Mac users say, you know.  Was it that low?  Oh, it was 3.5% for almost until very recently.  It was very, very low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not like Google's not developing for other platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Google is, I believe, probably because of Scroogled,  but for whatever reason, they say it's  because it's too small a platform.  They are very much anti-Microsoft.  If they made Microsoft pull down the YouTube app,  remember?  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  No, they don't want their apps on here.  And it's a little frustrating, to be honest.  The only app that's on here is Google Search.  I should try it and see if it does now, Google Card, now.  I doubt it does.  Hey, as a former 4%er, that's still a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No judgment.  Just comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I went to the Acer event in New York.  Oh, yeah.  I saw that.  Yeah.  How was that?  It was interesting.  The reason I was there is I wanted  to see 10 new Chromebooks, and all they did was add  a Intel Core into their Chromebook.  So it's a lot faster.  And it'll do video better, they say, which is fine.  But I'm greedy.  I want lots of stuff.  But it was really interesting.  It started off with Jason Chen, who's started as CEO of Acer  in January, and saying, we've got to turn around Acer,  and we've got to bring it back.  And very candid, I thought, and also charismatic.  But just saying straight up, we know the PC industry is awful.  It's dying.  It's not a good industry.  It is.  It's dying.  We concentrated what we do.  And he emphasized Chromebooks as a growth area,  and tablets as a growth area, and phones.  I think they're the late phones, whatever.  So it was interesting to think that that fight  over that market share for PCs then became rather moot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you want Google to remember where you parked,  you need Android for now.  Presumably, it will do that on iOS eventually, or no?  No, maybe not.  I don't think you can, as an app, you have access to that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the Android API actually can tell you if you're driving,  or biking, or walking.  And I'm not sure that iOS offers that.  So this may be Android only.  I bet not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what if you take one of those things that we have here  on the East Coast called a bus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You never stop moving.  Which you don't have.  You parked your bus here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, well, think that you parked your bus.  We got Google buses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a really good question, actually.  I should take my phone on the bus and see how it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's where you go.  No, don't keep track of that anymore, because I'm taking a bus.  You'll know where your bus stop is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, right.  Worst case scenario, it says.  Well, yeah, because you got off there.  You got off there, and it knows it's a bus stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As soon as you stopped moving, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the bus is a very particular kind of movement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If your mommy drives you to work, it's the same thing.  I mean, it only knows when you stop moving fast.  It doesn't know who drove you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mom dropped you off here.  Anyway, that's all I got for the time slot.  That's the changelog!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got Cortana running the board here today.  Thank you, Chet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It had been so long, I thought we were done with it or something.  We were still changelogging!  And we were still changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For the longest time, I named my Wi-Fi access point Cortana.  And of course, the password was 343-guilty-spark.  And now, like, the Cortana is another thing.  I mean, I guess it's not another thing, but I don't know.  I loved Cortana before she was a voice assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was in Halo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She was in Halo.  Yeah.  The voice assistants, it always feels like they're women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They should be, because in fact, I'm told,  I was told in jet fighters, the heads up warning when you're stalling or you're,  you know, it goes, pull up, pull up, is a woman because fighter pilots listen to female voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pull up, pull up.  You're going to die, Jimmy.  I didn't mean to drop you off here.  Pull up!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not using the punch line here.  I'm not using the punch line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think men listen to women's voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, well, in Halo, I mean, Cortana's the brains and he's the brawn, right?  I mean, she's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's the monitor of installation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  343 guilty spark.  Are you a Halo fan?  I am.  I didn't know that about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I played the first one a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Halo's awesome.  Halo's pretty awesome.  It's pretty violent.  It's pretty awesome.  It's the same part of my brain that watches UFC.  This is how I know about you.  That is fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of fascinating, we're going to talk about Larry Page's incredible comeback.  I really got to know, Jeff, you've done the research.  You know if this Nicholas Carlson article is as full of it or accurate, so we'll find out.  Well, and also, it also peeved greatly our good friend, while we're having a senior moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, this is so embarrassing.  His name is Eric Schmidt.  He was-  Rights for Wired.  Oh, Stephen Levy.  This guy.  Who wrote-  Thank you, Stephen Levy.  Inside the Plex.  Stephen Levy basically said most of that stuff is stuff that I reported in the tribute.  Thank you.  See you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know how true that is.  I have no idea which one.  I take no statement here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a couple of interesting things.  He starts with an anecdote about an early day anecdote.  First couple of years of Google, Larry decided to hire all fire, rather, all the middle management.  This was, they had about 400 employees.  And he said, why do we need people managing programmers?  So he just fired them all.  And apparently, characteristically, this was kind of interesting insight.  In public, he had a staff meeting and said, by the way, you're all fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was the project managers, right?  Yeah.  He said he didn't think that engineers should have to report to someone who was not an engineer.  And he felt that project managers were  politicking and only pushing forward the projects that they cared about.  And he thought that it should just be a flat organization and engineers should  just self-organize and build the things that they wanted to build.  It sounds a lot like GitHub, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They talk about his flat robotic tone.  He, I guess Larry, like a lot of geeks, wasn't really comfortable with people.  As Page Talks, Carlson wrote, although who knows, maybe Stephen wrote this.  He kept his gaze averted, resisting direct eye contact.  Though he was in a, huh?  Geeks.  He's a geek.  I don't even look you in the eyes.  Though he was an appealing presence with above average height and nearly black hair.  That's appealing.  He was socially awkward.  So apparently that was a mistake because they ended up hiring all the project managers back later.  The story, this is an interesting one that the investors said you and Sergei are not  qualified to run this company.  You're under 30.  You need to bring in adult supervision.  That's always what Larry and Sergei called Eric Schmidt.  Apparently there was a lot of resistance to it from everybody, but those investors won.  Schmidt was brought in.  Oh, here's another one.  Everywhere you looked, there were no-at-alls ready to gleefully tear into you.  That was, for Page's employees working at Google, felt more like a never-ending thesis defense.  Page had originally bonded with Bryn over a day of fierce argument.  That's how their relationship grew.  Their debates were not shouting matches.  There were a series of blunt points made by one side and then the other with a little  name calling thrown in.  Page would call one of Bryn's ideas stupid.  Bryn would say Page's idea was naive.  Then they both call each other bastards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Once again, geeks.  Except for every geek except Gina, who was too nice to do that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, male geeks.  Sorry, guys.  Exactly.  This is a very sort of masculine way.  Like the whole game of one-up-smanship is sort of is a very, not trying to be sexist,  but it's kind of a masculine style of communication.  Not one that certainly women can engage in and men cannot engage in.  I'm just, you know, generally speaking.  But yeah, this is, this kind of thing drives me crazy about our community.  I'll be honest.  It's like the who's smarter, the well actually, the man.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Well, actually.  Well, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you knew anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, this actually sidebar here, but I saved this out to a pocket.  It was an interesting article.  I wonder if you read it.  Let me see if I can log into my pocket and show you.  About programmers and why being a programmer is such a bitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was a sexist.  It's in there.  It's called programming sucks.  It's in the doc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, the premise is all programs are written by a bunch of dicks.  It's from still drinking.org.  And basically, you know, it's like building a bridge  that he says building a bridge by a bunch of, imagine joining an engineering team.  You're excited.  You're full of ideas, probably just out of school  and a world of clean, beautiful designs, awe inspiring.  And their aesthetic unity of purpose, economy and strength.  You start by meeting Mary, who introduces you to Fred.  You're going to be working on a bridge.  After you get through 15 security checks installed by Dave,  because Dave had his sweater stolen off his desk once and never again.  Fred only works with wood.  So you ask why he's involved because this bridge is going to be out of steel.  He says, she's Mary says, don't worry, Fred's going to handle the walkways.  What walkways?  Well, Fred made a good case for walkways.  They're going to add to the bridges appeal.  But we're going to have to build them without railings because  there's a strict no railings rule enforced by Phil, who's not an engineer.  Nobody's really sure what Phil does, but it's definitely full of synergy  and has to do with upper management.  And none of the engineers want to deal with that.  So they just let Phil do what they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds so real, doesn't it?  Sarah, meanwhile, has found several hemorrhaging edge paving techniques  and work them into all the bridge designs.  So you'll have to build around each one as the bridge progresses.  Since each one means different underlying support and safety concerns.  Tom and Harry have been working together for years,  but they have an ongoing feud over whether to use metric or imperial measurements.  And it's become a case of whoever got to that part of the design first.  This has become such a headache for the people actually screwing things together.  They've just given up and forced hammered or welded their way through the day  with whatever parts were handy.  Now, the bridge was designed as a suspension bridge,  but since nobody knew actually how to build a suspension bridge,  they got halfway through it, then just added extra support columns to keep the thing standing.  But they left the suspension cables because, well,  they're still sort of holding up parts of the bridge and  nobody knows which parts, but everybody's pretty sure they're important parts.  After the introductions are made, you're invited to come up with some new ideas,  but you don't have any because you're a propulsion engineer  and don't know anything about bridges.  He then says, would you drive across this bridge? No.  Every single program you've ever used has some version of this dynamic, including-  They're left out one part.  One part.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When the lead developer goes and you hire a new one,  they throw out absolutely everything that was ever done before.  That's probably the best thing they could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Start over.  But you know what we forget?  We think of software as written somewhat perfectly with an attention to detail and so forth.  We forget it's written by humans, many of whom are dicks,  most of whom can't look each other in the eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I just kind of want to quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you're mostly working on your own on ThinkUp, right?  I mean, that's the way to do it, right?  He says, every engineer has in a drawer somewhere in his desk when he gets home  and turns off the lights, pours a glass of scotch, puts on some light German electronica  and opens up a file on their computer.  It's something they wrote or they found and they knew they had to save it.  They read over the lines and weep at their beauty.  Then the tears turn bitter as they remember the rest of the files  and the inevitable collapse of all that is good and true in the world.  The file is good code.  It has sensible, consistent names for functions and variables.  It's concise.  It doesn't do anything obviously stupid.  It has never had to live in the wild or answer to a sales team.  It does exactly one mundane specific thing and it does it well.  It was written by a single person and never touched by another.  It reads like poetry written by someone over 30.  I love this is the best piece ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I work with a lot of great engineers, some of whom with my company,  some of whom who are just community contributors.  Certainly we've run into these issues, but I have a very strict not in our community.  Like not in our community.  We don't mansplain.  We don't do this one-option-ship.  We don't refactor because it just makes it prettier for the programmers.  We build things and service the user.  These are all things that you have to continue to reinforce.  Constantly.  It's entropy.  It is.  I would say to Jeff in the pre-show that as a perfectionist and a completionist,  it hurts me to push code that isn't like Steve Jobs' story about the painting the back of the  fence that no one sees.  It hurts me when the back of the fence isn't painted.  I push code like that all the time because code needs to get used or else it doesn't matter.  If no one uses it and it doesn't matter, if it's not working, it doesn't matter and  there's a big scale of functioning.  I could go on about this forever.  But yes, part of the way that I got around this is by leading my own projects and trying  to set the tone for this stuff doesn't go on here.  But that's not always possible, particularly if you're in a big company on a software team  that you get assigned to.  It's funny because it's all true.  This stuff all happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why you want to work for Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is why you want to start your own company, you think.  I don't want to deal with this BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't there...  I can't say the name of this programming language, but there's a programming language  called Brain F star star star that is intentionally horrible.  This is in that language, a little code snippet on the screen here.  This is how you do hello world in that language.  Plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus plus bracket angle.  That is Brain F.  And people write code in it just to be ornery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the ways that I also avoid the hemorrhaging edge stuff is that I used a very old programming  language that people hate.  I use PHP in my sequel.  It's old.  No one cares about it anymore.  But what's nice is that it works and it has years of testing behind it and it doesn't  really attract programmers who are like, well, actually, you should be writing this and go  and not in Ruby and get my jam.  I'm a new guy.  So that's a good advantage in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's like a German doing an imitation of an American accent.  That was Gina doing doing programmer.  Programmer.  Yeah, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should really replace your tempering language.  When I love your nation and I'll...  Whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, your neck beard, you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see, I didn't see this.  There's a programming language called LOL code that is written in LOLCAT.  Hi, Ken has STDIO, visible.  Hi, world.  Kay, thanks.  Bye.  Sorry, programmer joke.  Let's move on.  Sure, we have other things to talk about.  Oh, yeah.  The end of Google+.  What do you think?  Vik Gundotra gone in a flash.  Very quickly.  Fired?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I think maybe frustrated, but he's too respected.  He's very respected in that world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Friends of friends told me that he was a real pain to work for.  And I didn't make anything of it because I think a lot of good managers are really a pain to work for.  But yeah, you know, look, I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We all like Vik, but we don't see the management side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't work for him.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, in my last meeting with him and Bradley and a few weeks ago when I was there last time,  yeah, Vik is like a Googler, holds tight to the chest and he's demanding.  And, you know, can be dismissive, but he's very smart.  And, you know, I respect the hell out of him.  I think he's done something amazing.  You know, we're getting to these death knell things.  Anthony DeRosa, who's now at Circa, just tweeted a wonderful thing.  He said, Twitter and the web are dead.  Long live back web and point cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody is writing the like XXX is dead.  I mean, Facebook is dead.  Yeah, it's such a bad trope.  I don't like it.  It's a dumb trope.  Everything's dead.  Walking dead.  Zombie dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I asked my, I was talking to my daughter.  Abby is very smart for 22.  And we were talking about sick joke cycles.  There's a guy, a professor at Berkeley called Alan Dundee named Alan Dundee,  who writes Dundas, I guess, writes, he's a sociologist.  And he says, sick joke cycles always have to do with morbid fears  that are suppressed in a society, but come out as jokes.  The dead baby joke cycle was right when Roe v Wade happened.  And the debate was very intense over abortion.  Segregation led to the elephant jokes.  You figure out why.  So I said, what do you think zombies?  Why do you think we're so into zombies?  And Abby said, well, I think it has to do with a fear of ecological disaster,  the end of the world as we know it, and an overall kind of underlying fear that this will not stand.  That we are, we are in fact decaying before our very eyes.  That everything is dying.  But why else would we all want zombies?  I'm an optimist.  I'm into fairies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A late optimist, but an optimist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I come and go, you know?  So I don't think Google Plus is gone by any means.  But I think that it seems to be the case, CNET reported that many of its employees have been  transferred to the Android group, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's talk about what we mean by Google Plus.  Do you mean Google Plus, the social network?  You think the social network is going to stick around?  Because I think that there's actually a possibility that will go the way it was.  But Hangouts and Photos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Hangouts got moved to Android.  Photos got moved to Android.  They're both standalone apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those are the things that I use the most at Google Plus, that are specifically Google Plus,  of course, not counting my Google Plus login to everything, YouTube and Gmail and everything else.  But Photos and Hangouts are the way that I use Google Plus.  I just haven't gotten into the social network.  And I wonder if the social network part of Google Plus won't make it.  And if it doesn't, that doesn't mean that Google Plus was a failure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you this, though.  It would be devastating to confidence in Google.  Every time they kill a widely used thing, and I mean,  Gina's already over this because they killed Wave after she wrote a book about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Reader.  And Reader and Buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can go on and on.  And we're watching the knife hanging over Google Voice.  If they kill...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, don't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't say it.  Well, exactly.  At what point do people go, well, screw that.  I'm never trusting Google again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Versus what Zuckerberg said today is you can trust us.  Right.  We'll be here for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a detriment to keeping...  Even if this is not a hugely successful thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But, you see, I'm still going to argue with that.  Because, yes, the numbers are kind of trumped with sign-ins and all that.  The numbers are ridiculous.  I don't really have three million followers and so on and so forth.  But I do find conversations there.  I do find people there.  The growth rate was considerable.  It's sizable.  It's bigger than Twitter, which is also being declared dead today,  which is just as ridiculous.  I don't think that Google Plus is a failure.  I think it's part of a larger strategy.  The bigger question, then, is what's that larger strategy now?  Does Google need these signals?  Are they willing to just kill this because they don't give us the signals we expected  and then risk that trust?  I think there's an opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, just so you know, the breaking story, not seeing it, it was TechCrunch.  And Alexia Soto's article said Google Plus is walking dead.  So...  Walking dead.  Zombie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Rest my case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, okay, here's one thing.  Google Plus might have been something that Facebook tricked Google into launching  because it seemed to be, and Facebook certainly was a strong proponent of this,  that social search was the more important search.  But I gotta say, that may not have been what happened,  that Facebook's own social search has been a flop.  There's no evidence that Bing benefits from social integration.  Google might have realized, you know what?  That was a mistake.  These signals we're getting from Google Plus do not help us in search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's not just search, Leo.  It's also advertising.  Is there any advertising in Google Plus?  No, not at the point.  Go back to what you said before.  Google is a bunch of disparate applications.  What ties it together is a relationship with the user  and the knowledge that comes from that.  So you don't have to put advertising in every app to get the advertising benefit.  If you get...  The question that I would say is, I don't think Google Plus alone  gives you terribly valuable signals for that monetization and that relevance,  that serving of relevance.  Maps gives you really valuable signals.  Search gives you really valuable signals.  Plus, not so much.  And it's a signals business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google Plus is the technical implementation of the unified privacy policy.  Google Plus is Google saying,  we know who you are across all of your apps  because you're using this single sign-in.  It's a platform.  And to me, I look at the social network, Google Plus, as one app,  whereas Hangouts is another.  Photos is another.  And then YouTube, which all got retrofitted back in, YouTube, Gmail, et cetera, is another.  And Google Now is only possible because of Google Sign-in.  If you think Google Plus is just Google Sign-in  as I'm the same person across all these things,  that's a huge success.  I think this is why when people talk about Google Plus,  I think that they're referring to the social network.  And you're right, Jeff, there's not a lot of signals there.  I mean, I guess there's plus ones and reshares and things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have they?  Have they?  Not really.  Yeah.  I mean, is this part of what Facebook was talking about,  the death of the page and the rise of the apps?  By the way, let's separate the notion.  I love Google Plus.  And a lot of people love Google Plus.  I loved Buzz.  And a lot of people love Buzz.  That's irrelevant.  We can acknowledge that how much love you feel for it is not a determinant.  Even how many people use it may not be a determinant.  I just think that if you mistake to kill another service at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's just to your trust point, it does.  Yeah.  I think it would be a big mistake.  It would be one hell of a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be catastrophic from a PR perspective.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And a morale perspective, I think, is inside,  they were all told, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, never mind.  Well, that's what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last year, your bonus was dependent on social.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It would be one hell of a platter of crow.  And I don't see it, but I don't think they've handled the PR here well  because they should have predicted this was going to be the case  and should have been out.  I mean, yeah, you'll find it issues some statements of denials.  They should do some tangible things to bolster plus.  Add a feature now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stat.  Yeah.  So do you think Vic left because he was, he saw the writing on the wall  and said he's disappointed.  They took a bunch of people away from me, moved it over to Android and Sundar.  That might make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did Vic leave?  I mean, I don't know.  What happened?  He's not there anymore.  Like with-  It sounds like this was a reorg and him, and him, his departure was part of that reorg.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is he, is it like in Silicon Valley?  Is he up on the roof with the rest of the guys who don't have a job  and he's having a barbecue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's on a sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you want to, you want to walk to Arby's for lunch?  Is that what he's doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Vic wouldn't have that.  And I'm sure that he's vested.  I'm sure that he can leave and do very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He drives a Tesla.  He's doing fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure he's doing fine.  Well, but the other thing was-  Drip box.  Okay.  I'll stop making Silicon Valley jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry.  I love that show.  Okay.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's replaced by someone who's keeping his day job, important job as an engineer.  Dave Brisson.  And that person is also not promoted to senior VP.  So now Google Plus is reports to something down a rank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Dave Besspress seems almost like a placeholder.  Like, okay, you're already, you know, director of engineering.  Here's another thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well respected, but keep it, he's still director of engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what about Bradley Horowitz who must feel like crap right about now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think so.  But one story that I read about Besspress, right?  Is that his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess.  B-E-S-B-R-I-S.  Could be Bailey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was that he just wasn't as visible that he really was Vic's right hand.  Okay.  And Bradley's who I saw because Bradley's a product guy.  Right.  But who is, you know, it's like working in a publishing house.  The only way to rise is because you sell ads.  Right.  Google, the only way to rise is if you're an engineer.  I like Bradley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bradley, we love you, man.  Bradley's great.  We love Bradley.  Yeah.  He was the product manager and outside I guess widely considered to be the logical replacement for Vic.  But as you say, maybe not.  Maybe Dave is always there.  Just we didn't know about it.  Larry Page said nice things about Vic, of course.  But when somebody leaves and leaves right away, like leaves like I'm gone now.  You can have my office.  Well, usually that's for going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm transitioning out in my last days in four weeks and I'll be, you know,  I mean normally, right, when these kind of things are planned, it's a little bit more.  So that was my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Usually that means a competitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, like what's his name who left to go to China?  Hugo.  Hugo Ibarra.  Who just like he said like I'm going to Xiaomi.  Yeah.  This wasn't that.  I mean, Vic's vested, right?  Maybe he wants to rest.  But it's like that memo he wants to spend more time with his family memo,  which is always like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Smoking gun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you ever get a memo that Leo wants to spend more time with his family, you know, I was fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what that does about your family.  Leah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the last thing I don't want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  Spend time with you spend time with my family.  No, no, no.  No choice.  We are your family.  You are my children.  You're my you're my people.  I don't know.  I will miss Vic.  Apparently he had a pugnacious approach, according to recode with Google Plus and maybe his employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if Google listens to us, not that it matters.  Don't kill plus.  It's nice place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really would prefer that nobody used it.  Just the few of us in the know and just let's keep it for that.  In fact, it's got a little bit too like real world for me.  Get the norms out of Google Plus.  No more normies in Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't have too many of those.  Let me go back to the question I asked earlier.  Rewrite API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a great question.  If you say the Google Plus is more about maybe not dead, but walking dead,  would a right API have helped?  So just so people who have been following this, you have a read API.  Apps can read it, but they can't post to it.  For instance, there's no Google Plus app on Windows Phone, but there is an app that lets me read my Google Plus.  I just can't post to it because it uses the API.  Would it be better if they had allowed third party apps?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot more people would have piped their content from Twitter or Facebook.  It would have made it like buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what killed buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would have automatically into Google Plus, which would have meant that they could probably claim a lot more active users who were not really active.  Google was pretty staunch that for the beginning that's not what they wanted.  They didn't want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that was the right thing.  I was angry, but I have come around.  By the way, there are normies and I can't avoid the normies because this was a mistake.  They started putting the hot stuff in my stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's always like some rows with an inspirational quote or something.  Yeah, it's Facebook crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those posters you buy in malls with the sunsets, which also says a very bad thing.  Well, in my view, I'm going to stop here, but we all are right now.  It doesn't send a great branding message about what Google Plus and people really are.  Why do I want to get mass crap there?  I had enough of that media.  This is why I'm on Google.  What's hot is just not very smart and it's not tailored to me.  I've always found that irritating and I constantly kill it and get angry at it, but then it goes away for a while.  I haven't seen it in a week or two.  They do things.  Let's think about Google Plus.  There were things that I complained about.  Day one, we all complain about day one and quietly, slowly, they get through the list and they fix things.  The first thing, of course, was the Scobal problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's still on there though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hasn't he declared that dead?  Like everything that he declared was dead.  Everything's dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He doesn't like glass anymore.  Yeah.  You know what?  I don't see the what's hot.  Maybe they did start taking that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe that's what Vic liked and they got rid of it.  I said, no, what's hot?  I'm out of here.  Right.  I want those posters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He stormed out.  He stormed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Vic, we also like you.  I think Vic's a very smart guy and when he gets bored of being home in two weeks,  I'll be eager to see what he does next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vic, there's always a show waiting here at the Twitter network for you.  It's time for the Vic Gundotra Show.  I think I like it.  Don't kill Google Plus.  That would be a mistake.  No, that wouldn't have anywhere to go online.  I'd have to find something else.  And notice there's not a lot of Twitter clones popping up anymore.  This might be an out of this might be an old and in the way idea.  This idea of sharing on a network.  All right.  I mean, do people create new stuff like this anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Their photo is different social networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, they create apps, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's lots of those.  It's interesting.  Maybe this is an old fashioned idea.  It's like the portal.  We had a long conversation on the Twitch show on Sunday about the FCC proposed FCC rules,  the lying sack of filth that is the chairman of the FCC, Tom Wheeler, cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who, by the way, finally talks about it.  Public guest where he does that.  The cable show.  Yeah.  The cable show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, of course.  He's the one who said, oh, we didn't pay no attention.  That's what I said.  I love Alexis Ohanian.  He we're going to try to get him.  We're going to have any six.  Did he respond to my request to get him onto it?  Yes.  Is he going to be on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  His people got in contact.  I had no idea that was happening.  So I was very confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  We'd love to get the Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian on.  He's the guy who did the SOPA PIPA protest that was so successful in killing SOPA and PIPA.  Mark my words.  We'll be president one day.  I love Alexis.  I love him.  So now his latest plan is he wants to buy a billboard outside the FCC saying, save our net.  Now he hasn't determined what it's going to be called yet, but he's got a crowd.  CrowdTilt is one of his startups.  He's got a CrowdTilt campaign to raise money for the billboard.  They're up to $10,000.  They've got 15 days left to raise the next 10,000.  I put a thousand in because I think this is a good idea.  You did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good for you.  To me, this is a hot button topic because-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'm very upset there isn't a lot more heat in the discussion about it.  It's hard to understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I knew that.  And I've talked about it on the radio.  I've talked about it as many places I can.  Alexis does a very good job of explaining it so real people can understand it.  But it's hard.  It's really hard to get people to care about it.  And the sad thing is they won't care until it's way too late.  So the FCC-  By the way, no one sees these proposed rules yet.  But they said, Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, alas,  said that the FCC would circulate them on Thursday still waiting to see them.  What are you afraid of, Wheeler?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about this stuff, Leo, that-  The argument made in some quarters is he has no choice  because the way the legislation is written on section 720 or whatever.  I can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get to give you the whole pricey rate in a couple of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The choice is they can instead just declare it a utility and be done with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You remember Verizon sued the FCC over their open internet rules,  their proposed rules, and lost in court.  And the court was very clear.  They said under the Telecommunications Act, specifically 706, section 706,  you cannot do this.  You don't have the right to do it unless you say broadband providers are common carriers.  They are utilities.  Then you do have the right.  The court was very clear.  Even the court even said, the opinion of the court said,  we understand you've got to protect the open internet.  This is an important thing.  But you can't do it the way that the Congress has set up the FCC.  You can't do it unless you declare these broadband providers common carriers.  Now, I'm not, and we talked at length about this with Denise Howell, who's an attorney.  She's talked about it on This Week in Law.  I'm not sure why the FCC would be reluctant to do that.  Maybe there are unintended consequences.  But it is a simple, clear path to preserving an open internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'll tell you, the unintended consequence is it's a reduction in campaign contributions.  Crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How's Tom Wheeler going to get a job with the cable industry after his chairmanship's over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just like Powell, the prior chairman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Michael Powell now runs the NCTA, the National Cable Television Association.  That, by the way, is Tom Wheeler's old job.  Tom Wheeler is in the-  That revolving door is hitting us in the ass, people.  Tom Wheeler is, beside being the chairman of the FCC, he's also in the cable hall of fame  and the wireless hall of fame for service to the cable and wireless industries.  So, I mean, it's so corrupt.  It's so obviously corrupt.  Obama, how dare you?  I'm really disappointed.  I really feel like he has let us down in a great many ways.  And this is one of the worst.  And-  For our tribe, this is the worst.  Well, for my business, this is the worst because I have a very big dog in this hunt.  Twitter wouldn't exist if I had to pay extra to get to you at a reasonable speed.  There would be no streaming video from us.  As so many have said, and by the way, and I retweeted her,  in fact, I think Elizabeth Warren is running for president,  but she had some really good, both two of my favorite people,  members of Congress have excoriated Wheeler over this.  One is Al Franken, Senator from Minnesota.  The other is Elizabeth Warren from New Jersey.  She said, we don't know-  No, no, from-  Massachusetts, I'm sorry.  We don't know who's going to have the next big idea in this country,  but we're pretty sure they're going to need to get online to do it.  Nuff said.  Great quote.  Isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that nails it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nuff said.  So here's a question, Liam.  My fear is that, and there's a story in The Wall Street Journal just about an hour ago that says  that Google and Netflix and Yahoo are considering a public campaign against Wheeler on this.  My fear, though, is that if they wanted to be evil, they'd say, well, you know what?  We have the money to pay.  We're now the big old guys.  Let's pull the ladder up behind us.  We don't want any upstarts killing us.  They totally could.  So they could really do that.  And I think there's a real moment of a moral test here for them,  that if Netflix and Google and company do come out against Wheeler on this,  yeah, they're not crazy about paying and they're not crazy about the telcos,  but they are the ones in the position to pay.  And so, you know, they're going to be teetering right now.  Some lawyer, and it's always a lawyer in these companies,  actually say, well, you know, it's not a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pull up that ladder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they're the ones who could fight on behalf of the net and need to.  And it's the soap of people fight all over again.  But the last time it was, hey, they're going to stop you from watching movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Savetheinternet.com, what can I do?  Just go to Savetheinternet.com and lots of information there.  I don't think you need to give money to Alexis Ohanian to build a billboard,  but certainly call the FCC, call Congress.  There will be a day of action May 15th.  I'm not sure what our participation will be in that.  Last time on SOPA PIPA Day, we went black and white,  which I thought was a really perfect way to both raise interest,  but also to continue our mission, which is to inform people about this stuff.  Contact your Congress critter.  Unfortunately, the only people who really understand this are geeks,  and geeks are notoriously inactive in politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because on the bridge, they just go ahead and connect the wood to the metal and don't wait on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a bridge, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you do have to say, where are Google?  Where is Netflix in all of this?  I mean, why aren't they yelling bloody murder?  Because they're already, they got the money.  They'll pay Comcast a buck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's where the Wall Street Journal just said that Google,  Yahoo and Netflix are considering a campaign.  Considering is not campaigning.  Well, exactly.  That's why we've got to keep the pressure on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see, I want to get through this pretty quick here.  What's new with Glass?  Explore Nearby, Field Trip, you mentioned that.  One plus one, you guys talked about that extensively last night on All About Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We did.  We did.  And we talked about the Android Silver program as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, Silver.  So let's do one plus one first.  So these are former Oppo guys.  Oppo makes a phone that's pretty nice, pretty sweet, although nobody I know has it.  Android phone.  And now they've gone off to form a company, O-P-O, one plus one, one less P.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're associated with Oppo.  They're bankrolled by Oppo, which people were upset about for stupid reasons, which I don't get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They want to make the ultimate phone with Cyanogenmod running on it.  They're saying in June, but we have seen it.  Some people have one, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they did this crazy marketing thing where you had to enter a lottery and agree to smash  your phone if you were picked to be in the lottery.  You had to destroy your current smartphone to get a one plus one for a dollar,  which we agreed on.  All About Android was just dumb.  But otherwise, the phone itself looks pretty cool.  I mean, it's a really nice handset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And cheap, $299.  It'll be like a Nexus.  Except for Cyanogenmod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think about that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As I recall, you said last week, doesn't it run either Cyanogenmod or the current Google  Android official?  Or is it just Cyanogenmod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought it was just, but I could be wrong.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought you said maybe that could be my mistake from hearing you wrong last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, June availability.  That rendering looks beautiful.  But it is, in fact, just an artist's rendering.  I wouldn't rush.  There's a lot of slip, twix, the tongue and the lip.  I would wait and see.  I've been burnt so many times with phones that looked great on paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a few people who have them in the wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's review units out there somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Who has one that we know of?  MKBHD has one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, Marcus has one.  Marcus Brownlee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Getting through a 30-second ad before we show it.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Marcus is raking it in.  I would never allow a 30-second pre-roll.  I really wouldn't.  That's just, you have to, there's no skip?  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This has been an option for some content creators that they can have a full 30-second pre-roll ad.  Ironically, from Microsoft.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's got it.  Where is it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's gone.  So the hands-on footage is from him.  I'll link that right below the like button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, apparently.  Oh, he doesn't have it.  He doesn't have it.  I thought I had one.  I thought I had one.  I was teased a lot by this Chinese manufacturer, OnePlus.  It's a relatively new company.  Yeah, teased.  That's the word, teased.  Turns out it has really nice specs.  So it's running in a 5.5-inch.  I can make up a phone with really nice specs, too.  5-core Snapdragon 801, the Adreno 330 GPU.  This is, you could do this in your sleep.  So that's the problem.  I, I'm not, I'm skeptical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would, I would, I would, I would, I would, I would, I would, I would, I would, I would,  I certainly wouldn't smash a phone, although I've got plenty lying around I could smash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just such a, such a bad idea.  Of course, it's attention grabbing, but it's just wasteful.  We're covering it.  Better things to do.  Yeah.  Anyway, June 29.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tony Wang has just texted.  He says, I entered, he's our editor.  I entered to destroy my phone.  I hope they don't pick me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you have, you don't have to destroy it until they pick you.  Yeah, I'm on, I'm on the page and I was considering it too, but it just seems like such a first world.  Like, yeah, it's gross.  Somebody, that's gross.  Absolutely absurd to destroy a phone.  It's incredibly offensive.  It's disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's wasteful and bad for the environment when you throw it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So can I give it to a homeless person instead?  Yeah.  But I'm going to enter just in case, because if I win, I'll smash.  Okay.  I have to tell them what I'm going to smash.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Destruction method.  You have to tell them what should I do?  Hammer, baseball bat, screwdriver, fire blender.  Leo, if it's, if it's a...  It from the top of a very tall building.  No, that's going to hit somebody.  Now, Leo, what phone would you push?  I said the HTC One M7.  Oh, okay.  In a deserted area, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not the M8.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, the M8.  That's why I can do the M7.  Right.  I don't need it.  I got the M8.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  I actually have a dead, I have a dead M7 I could, I could smash.  My point exactly.  I'll smash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My Nexus 5 screen's a little cracked already.  So, I mean, it's going out the window anyway.  Don't you dare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't you dare, young Chad.  Not a Nexus 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I need a, I need a screen replace.  I could give them, there are so many old phones, a Galaxy S.  Yes.  One, two, three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could just give your phones to 20 friends and they can all get $1 phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I should just give, I do give these away.  You know what I do?  I like to surprise people.  I just put them under a chair and then I just-  Oprah.  Yeah, like Oprah.  And you get an old phone.  And you get an old phone.  So is the, now he's looking.  No.  Is Twitter dead?  The Atlantic says the Twitter is dead.  Adrian LaFrance and Robinson Meyer.  Or this idiocy.  Twitter's not dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm on Twitter every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing is wrong with Twitter, but Twitter did have to report that their growth rate  has slowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what?  Which set the stock down quite a bit.  But, yes, it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter is not what it used to be, but I, you know, we were talking before the show  about my methodology, which is intimately connected with Twitter for gathering news.  I love Twitter.  Tony just says, just said you should look at the TOS, the terms of service, before you enter.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What have I done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree to the terms and conditions.  You may apply to break or damage your current phone if selected.  You will submit a video of yourself breaking your phone.  All right.  Contest entry successful application.  All submitted videos must be shot in one frame with no cutting or editing.  The applicant must show that their phone does turn on and use the phone that was  chosen by the applicant in their initial application.  The phone must suffer significant and visible damage to qualify for the one plus one purchase  code.  The applicant must show evidence of the damage in the video following the smash.  This was such a bad idea.  Really terrible promotion.  But then there's that blender company, right?  Will it blend?  Blender tech blends everything.  That's true.  Destroyed every time.  Did you see Acer's liquid leap, their new watch when you're at the Acer event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they went past this very quickly, but I think they pulled a Samsung and I think  that it is connected to their phone.  Right.  I don't fully understand why that seems to be the case because my Android's Android.  Yeah.  Fitbit, you know, works across all kinds of things and it's wonderful.  And if you're if you're yeah, I understand you want to pump your phone, but you if you're  going to come up with a new product, then come up with a new product because that's  where the growth could be.  And if you if you tie if you tether it just to your own device, I don't why bother?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Chinese government has decided and courts asked the question, why China are you censoring  Big Bang Theory, but not Game of Thrones, to which I answer because they have good taste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, oh, oh, oh, here he goes again.  Here he goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you really going to argue the Chinese government has no television?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, they say they're beautiful.  To shame, they say they've been to Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These four American television shows because they're offensive, but Game of Thrones is  not offensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Game of Thrones is not offensive, violent and sexy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everything I look for.  It's what they want their government to be.  They bang bang.  I mean, they banned the Big Bang Theory, the Good Wife, NCIS and the practice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess those show American decadence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe because it's medieval times.  They don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Good Wife.  Okay.  Good Wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Onion is going to.  Is this true?  I just love the I hope it's true.  That's why I put it in there.  The Onion is going to create a new website in June called clickhole.com.  It's a website that's putting content and sponsored posts side by side with barely  any distinction between them.  People will climb into this click hole and find content so interesting they won't be  able to keep it to themselves.  Every post is engineered to be as shareable as possible so it spreads like a deadly wild  fire on social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then you won't believe what happens next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You won't believe how rich they get.  Apparently items will be like quizzes like which pizza should I have for dinner tonight  sponsored by Pizza Hut or uplifting personal tales in list forms.  Seven jerks that defied the odds and didn't go into finance.  I don't know.  Is this site up?  Not yet.  It won't be till June.  Is it real?  You never know with the Onion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't tell.  It's one of those great onion moments.  I'm not ashamed to admit I had to check with the Onion PR to find out if clickhole was  satirical or not.  I don't want to end up like literally unbelieve.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's the clickhole.com coming this summer.  An all new internet experience filled with content so shareable snackable and clickable.  It will rob you of all logic and reason.  Snackable content.  Hey, that's the secret.  How could I have been so wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're just not snackable enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Step one, use your pointer, locate a link to a piece of content that you want to explore.  Step two, locate the part of your mouse or trackpad that enables you to click.  Step three, click your content.  Practice clicking the button below between 800,000 and 12 million times in preparation  for our launch this June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is clearly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Keep clicking.  Keep going faster, faster, click faster, faster.  Wow, you're doing great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice reinforcement every few clicks.  Seriously awesome.  You're almost there.  That last click was great.  But where's the slideshow?  Apparently there is going to be a slideshow without any captioning of 17 different kinds of hey.  It would be one of the...  One of the fab...  I can't wait.  This better be real.  Don't mess with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know that's why I put it in there.  I know.  I want it to be there.  I want to make fun of those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  IFTTT is on Android.  And I'm really sorry to anyone who watched AAA last night because this is my app that  I put in the arena, but I'm excited about it.  Did it win?  We don't know.  I wouldn't ask for votes, you know.  You need to campaign.  But if you want to vote for me, IFTTT is if this then that.  It's IFTTT.com.  It lets you kind of chain together actions online.  And the Android app, which just came out, I don't know, last week, lets you do things  like access your phone's wallpaper and location and phone calls.  You can say things like, hey, set my device's wallpaper to my latest Instagram photo or  mute my phone when I'm in the office.  I mean, it's kind of like it sort of gives you Tasker-like abilities.  But much easier to implement using IFTTT's recipes or IFTTT's powers and it's shared  recipes.  It's got these social recipes in this community, people sharing recipes.  And it's really it's a nicely done app.  So check it out.  If you like IFTTT, you can now have it on your Android device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, they came out with the iPad version first and that was a pick.  I have great minds.  I made it a pick on iPad today.  But because you can do so much more on the Android, it really is much more useful on  Android.  Because I mean, changing your wallpaper.  Wow.  I mean, things.  This is really cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can get push notifications if it's going to rain tomorrow or something like that.  It's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If this then that IFTTT on Android.  Jeff Jarvis has many numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't like any of them actually.  But so, you know, we could do the old NSA has hundreds of billions of entries.  But we know that.  We know that.  We already talked about Twitter.  I guess I'll do this.  People like to save money.  Sony Z Ultra Play Edition is $200 off now $449.  I almost get tempted.  It's gigantic.  How big is it compared to a Samsung?  No, it's bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's 6.4 inches.  The note is six inches.  I think it's a little bit bigger.  The note three.  Maybe it's a little.  Yeah, it's a little bigger.  It's half an inch bigger.  I think a little bigger.  Which matters.  It's impressive.  Not a phone, though.  Or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is a phone.  I really wanted this phone, but it wasn't available.  Otherwise, I would have bought this.  It is.  Really?  It's a phablet.  Yeah.  I mean, I like it that it's Google Play Edition version of this.  That's what's appealing.  It is gigantic.  And it's also water resistant.  And it does the it has an FC.  And I believe it is a wireless charger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These phones are like purses.  Tell me this is true, Gina.  The women, if you get in this cycle, you're dead.  You need a bigger purse.  And then you get a bigger purse.  Then you need a bigger purse.  And then you get a bigger purse.  And then you need a bigger purse.  Right?  And I've seen women literally carrying purses the size of suitcases, dragging them behind them.  And that's what's happening with these phones.  Because now I have a six inch phone and I'm going, oh, it's 6.4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you should make it real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're making fun of women.  Men just like something to be bigger and bigger and bigger.  I mean, we got the same problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but you don't have the same options.  It really is not much you can do, Jeff.  Well, in my case, that's certainly truly.  You're pretty much stuck with what you've got, if I'm not mistaken.  On the purse or phone side, however, and watch too.  Big watches.  I don't understand that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like the gigantic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can hardly lift your arm because you have such a heavy.  You can't get your shirt around.  That's status.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So really, Chad, you think this would be enough?  If I had the money, I would get this so fast.  It's 200 bucks less.  It's still $500.  They're unsubsidized price.  Yeah, 450.  Their unsubsidized price is $650, which is another reason I didn't get it  because the Nexus 5 was so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a good price now, I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, now I would say it's competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Snapdragon 800.  I like it that it's Google experience.  It came out a little bit before the Nexus 5.  So this is like somewhere between the Nexus 7 and the Nexus 5.  Yeah.  1920 by 1080.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So my question is, could I?  I mean, I carry the Nexus 7.  I carry the Nexus 5.  Would that replace both of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure.  I don't know.  I have to say this is 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the Windows phone, the Nokia 1520 that I was talking about.  And it's great.  It's small enough that you can still put it in your pocket or your giant purse.  And look ridiculous.  But no, I don't think so.  I think we're going beyond the days where that looks stupid.  No, it's the pocket part.  That doesn't look dumb.  It almost looks like a pocket square, like I'm Dapper Dan.  Hey, hobo man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, Dapper Dan.  You're always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For me, it's being able to use it in one hand, though, especially now with the baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can use this with one hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's my son Jake's point.  Even my Nexus 5, he says it's too big for the hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Moto X is, and presumably the new iPhone, which is 4.7 inches, is actually the sweet spot.  I think any smaller, any bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I find the iPhone to be dainty now.  Dainty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it is.  It's really it feels it's too small.  It's ridiculous.  Huh, Sony Z Ultra Google Play Edition.  I didn't know this was a mega camera.  Well, I'm fascinated.  I didn't realize they were even offering this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so we did a really bad job with releasing this in the American market.  They did a horrible job.  They had no carrier partnerships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could use this with T-Mobile, right?  It worked with LTE.  Yeah, it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the funny thing is that it could work on most of the carriers,  but they just didn't make it happen fast enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile on their LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How's the screen resolution versus?  This is 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's about the same.  Yeah, 342 PPI pixels per inch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's good.  It's only 16 gigs.  The reason it's cheap is because it's maybe superannuated a little bit.  It's old.  Yeah.  Why use one syllable when six will do?  Superannuated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you guys think there'll be a Play Edition announced at I.O.?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now we didn't do this story, but apparently the Silver Editions  Silver.  Are what they're calling the Nexuses for future.  This is, by the way, if anybody's paying any attention at Google,  what Microsoft thought they'd do with Windows, they did Windows Signature PCs  with none of the crapware.  And this is a real problem in the Windows world.  You'd buy an HP and it'd be loaded with gigs of junk, trialware, crap.  You had to remove.  Microsoft thought, well, we want to give people a better Google,  a better Windows experience.  We'll make a signature edition.  No manufacturer made one.  No one bought one.  You could barely find them.  It was a complete flop.  Even though it's apparent, this is obvious.  This is what people would want.  So I warn you, Google, this is dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think this is going to happen even with Google Play Editions  already kind of underway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't sell that big, do they?  I wonder the Play Editions.  They don't.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think that's what Silver is about.  I think that Silver is about bringing, getting consumers to buy  what's essentially the Play Edition or the Nexus now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's different about this is it's not sold at play.google.com,  but it's sold everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sold in stores.  They've got associates doing the data transfer, doing the onboarding,  creating your Google account for you, getting you set up.  If they market it right and they get it into the right stores  and they really make it kind of the premium Android experience,  I think that'll be good for everybody, right?  Because right now there's a Samsung Android experience, right?  There's an Amazon Fire OS, right?  And Amazon, I mean, who knows?  I don't think we can cover this story either,  but if Amazon has a phone, if there's a Prime, you know, Contra, whatever,  there's going to be some sort of Amazon flavor of Android.  There is one and that'll probably continue to go on handsets.  I mean, Google kind of needs to say,  the Google experience is the superior Android experience  and here's how you get it.  And it can't be, you know, nerds like us.  Which is fine, but here's my fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's my fear, Gina, is that what's going to happen is that we're going to...  Don't forget the other thing Google did was make reasonably priced phones.  And probably the manufacturers didn't like that,  didn't like the price pressure on them.  So now, yeah, the deal is we'll stop competing with you and showing you up  if you use our software okay,  but that means you can price this stuff through the roof again  and charge $700, $800 for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just think the real problem is that you can't compete with  Samsung's massive marketing budgets.  I think it's provable that no one should buy a Samsung phone of any kind.  They're horrible.  They're horrible.  Even the Play Edition, they're horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to get email about this, are you not?  I think it's provable.  They're a Samsung fan, they're a Galaxy fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're, well, they're wrong.  They're crazy, they're nuts.  I'm with you, brother, but...  They're nuts.  I like the Galaxy S2 was very good after that downhill.  And really just now this stuff is crap word.  But because they spend literally hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in marketing  and it's going up all the time because it's directly tied to the profits made by the division.  So the more they make, the more they advertise,  the more they advertise, the more they make.  You just can't compete.  And that's why the demonstrably superior HTC One, right?  Doesn't sell for beans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the silver would be very similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google can't compete with Samsung's advertising.  I mean, they're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They could, but they're not going to spend $400 million  to promote the Silver Edition.  Are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're running Chrome commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the Samsung?  I hear you, I hear you.  That would be weird.  I would notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hard to compete.  It's really hard to compete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If an Android Silver commercial came on, I would be on my TV.  I would stop and notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you ready?  Are you ready for a number?  Here's a number, Jeff.  Samsung's 2013 marketing budget.  What do you think?  God knows.  $14 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good luck, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I know from people who work there,  Samsung decides to do something, the boss decides to do something,  and then four weeks later, they got a watch.  Yeah.  They got stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good luck, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  $14 billion.  Well, that's what it says here.  Must be that includes refrigerators.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess that's why, I don't know, when I'm playing Dots,  I see an ad for the...  Everywhere.  You can't get away from it.  That's everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is from Boy Genius Report.  According to Reuters, Samsung's marketing death star has spent an estimated $14 billion  in 2013, an amount greater than the entire gross domestic product of Iceland.  That's triple the $4 billion it spent in 2012.  And it's because Samsung, it's set up that the more you make,  the more we...  The budget is tied directly to the sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good luck Iceland.  Poor Iceland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a chart.  This is out of date.  This is Apple advertising, HP advertising, Dell advertising, Microsoft advertising, Coke,  Samsung electronics, Samsung marketing expenses, dwarves, all of them combined.  Oh, Coke?  More than Coke.  Like by a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wish they put some of that into better products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The purple one is 2012.  So it's quadrupled this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's why people buy Samsung phones.  I'm convinced there's no other reason.  All right.  My pick of the week is a screensaver.  I want to thank my good friend, Mike Elgin, from whom I get all of the information that I  know everything I learn.  I learned from Mike Elgin.  There's a great Google Trends website where you can see the search trends  at google.com slash trends slash hot trends slash visualize.  Well, if you go there, now you'll be able to download a Macintosh screensaver,  which you can configure.  I've got it configured to show Google search trends in the United States  in a four by four grid, constantly updated.  Now this is a screensaver.  Now you know what people are searching for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's neat.  Isn't that great?  In the film, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Looks very Windows-y.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not available on Windows, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Flat primary colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
