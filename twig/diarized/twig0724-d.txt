Transcript:  Do you do it in my voice?  No, but you know, it's funny when I read it,  I do hear your voice when I read it, which is interesting.  I think a good writer,  you kind of hear their voice when you're reading their prose, their text.  And I definitely hear your I hear your voice to Stacey when I read your  website.  Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

End time: 306.80
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, he has a very distinctive voice, doesn't he?  So I guess it makes sense.  So I guess we have to talk about threads because it launched  right after the show last week.  Right. In less than a week.  Almost as many listeners as this show has 100 million users.  It's pretty fast. 100 million users, half on iOS  and half on Android is best we can tell, which is interesting.

Start time: 307.32
End time: 314.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it is interesting because, you know, the brands are all on iOS  and and boy are the brands there.

Start time: 315.84
End time: 316.52
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Holy cow.

Start time: 316.62
End time: 318.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What percentage of that 100 million is brands?

Start time: 319.12
End time: 322.70
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It felt like they were just waiting for somewhere to be.

Start time: 323.42
End time: 338.28
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  What percentage of it was  meta nudging folks into getting into it versus people saying,  I'm actually curious about this.  Let me go ahead and sign up because I'm pretty sure  that's my sister in law.  The nudge that's happening.

Start time: 340.18
End time: 354.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, my sister in law, who's on Instagram,  knew about it, which was unusual because normally no clue.  Right. It's not it's not her thing.  But she hadn't signed up.  Oh, that's interesting.  She didn't know about it.

Start time: 354.16
End time: 400.96
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Instagram does kind of incur encourage you, I think, to join threads.  And this is the strength of it.  Threads is a Twitter clone created by Metta, really created by the Instagram  division of Metta and has taken off.  It's pretty obvious why it's taken off.  One, because of Instagram.  And the sign up process, very straightforward,  maybe even too straightforward because you have to have your Instagram  username as your threads username.  And it also brings over the people you follow and who follow you.  So you if you allow it.  And I'm sure most people do. That's the default.  So you you kind of instantly have a group of people to follow.  That's one of the downsides.  To Twitter and even more so in Mastodon is if you can figure out  how to get in and sign up, then what?  Who do you follow?

Start time: 401.06
End time: 414.08
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Which is my portability of your social graph is going to be so important.  And once things are really federated, if they really are,  it opens the door for other small networks to start  because you could have the starter kid of friends and move over there.

Start time: 414.28
End time: 447.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and that's an interesting point.  We're going to get to that, actually, because there are some  interesting mismatches in in the Fediverse and and activity pub and threads.  But threads also learned a lesson that it wasn't available to Metta  or even Instagram when they launched, which was the algorithmic feed,  the tick tock style feed.  And so unless you take steps to avoid it, and it's not not obvious  how to do this when you are on threads, it looks just like Twitter,  except you see people you're not following.

Start time: 447.06
End time: 462.76
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Wait a minute. So there is an and there is a non obvious way to fix that,  because that's the problem I have with this platform.  It's pretty and and I'm not seeing a bunch of junk,  but I'm also not seeing things that I'm truly interested in.

Start time: 462.94
End time: 535.29
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think for the beginning, it's a good way to do it,  because you immediately have a feed that's full of stuff. OK.  And it's probably interesting.  Plus, there's people to follow. Yeah.  And so I there must say Adam Maceri, who runs Instagram  and is kind of the lead voice and that says, yeah, we're going to have  what they call a following feed.  Twitter added that for you feed.  And the same thing. It's horrible.  But it was the same idea.  And people learned this from TikTok.  Even when YouTube started, there wasn't really an algorithmic feed.  But once everybody saw how effective that was on YouTube  and then TikTok adopted it, I think it's it's the it's the thing everybody does.  Because you know, when you first in the early days of Twitter, you join it.  And then it's like, well, OK, now what?  There's nobody. Yeah. It's like blue sky.  I came to a party and nobody's there. Yeah.  It's like blue sky.  So it really threads instantly feels like something's going on.  Let me I'll show you how to.  I think I've been told how to do this.  Let me turn on my screen mirroring.  So I'm going to go to AirPlay one Benito spinning still.  But as soon as I can. Yeah, there it goes.  So now let me show you.  I'll go into threads.  Can you see my threads here?  He's trying to change.  It's still happening.

Start time: 536.30
End time: 538.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Takes a little while to get going.

Start time: 538.88
End time: 568.78
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, yeah, all the brands.  So so it was that.  And then the second part of the equation was everybody.  Elon's just been, you know, driving, driving the airplane into the ground.  And so people were looking for it.  So this is this is threads right now.  This is my threads.  By the way, there is no desktop version.  That's why we had to airplay it from my iPhone.  See it. You can run it on desktop if you're running Windows and you install Android.  The Android subsystem.  You can have the Android Chromebook.

Start time: 568.84
End time: 571.43
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's no problem. I want to.  That's right. That's right.

Start time: 572.14
End time: 598.50
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So anyway, this is how you do it.  And you go to your account and you hit this menu in the upper right hand corner,  which is settings. OK.  And then you go to notifications.  OK. Threads and replies.  And I'm told and I think it does work because it seems to be doing it from  for me is you make everything for people you follow,  from people you follow, from people you follow.  I don't want to see anything from anybody but people I follow.

Start time: 598.92
End time: 602.68
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  But then I also have to turn on Android's notifications.

Start time: 603.08
End time: 645.80
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, you don't. No, no, no, because I don't.  Yeah. See, I have my notifications paused.  I don't I don't want notifications. OK, great.  But see, this is why it's not obvious that happens to change.  Also, what you're seeing now on threads, except I am.  There you go. You saw the thing that was at the top is gone.  That was somebody I wasn't following.  These are all people I'm following now. OK.  Well, I meant not carnage for life. So maybe not.  Oh, no, that's because Alex Stamos, who I do follow, replied to it.  So that is one thing that will happen.  Well, I don't care to see.  They'll give you a following only feed. I agree.  But but right now, I'm only seeing stuff  that is either people I follow or has been replied to or re  rethreaded, I guess you call it, by people I follow.

Start time: 646.28
End time: 647.83
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  OK, so far I'm seeing that.

Start time: 649.00
End time: 668.72
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it is a lot of brands.  There's the New York Times and PR, which famously left Twitter  after Elon accused it of being government funded media  immediately joined threads.  There's a lot of people who have been looking like Reuters there  for for somewhere to be. That's not tons of those kinds of places.  And there's George Takei, right?

Start time: 669.02
End time: 670.70
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Didn't show up on Mastodon yet.

Start time: 670.88
End time: 687.02
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. It also does a good job with video.  You can see it's Instagram Heritage.  And I think you probably appreciate the images look good.  How good the images look.  Plus, the way it does the image slideshow, you can do panoramas with it,  which is people have been playing with that a little bit.  So I haven't done any images.

Start time: 687.06
End time: 696.79
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Somebody read the book and they put up screenshots with things  underlined. Yeah.  See that like six screenshots.  Yeah. Isn't that great?

Start time: 697.46
End time: 719.06
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So so it's like a Twitter with a very good  graphical interface, you know, for video and for  for pictures.  I don't think it does audio standalone yet.  And there are no there's no spaces.  There is no lot of the features that we love.  Here's Patrick Mahomes, the quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs.

Start time: 719.18
End time: 722.80
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I didn't expect I'm here following Patrick Mahomes, but looks like you are.

Start time: 724.32
End time: 767.09
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know why? Because this was his first tweet.  There's a video of him going, I'm here.  I'm here. I'm here.  And I thought, OK, I'm going to follow you just because of that.  Notice, by the way, these plus signs, there's Jim Costas.  I can't make that bigger, but there's a little plus sign in his head.  If I and this is also smart.  I'm looking at this feed and I go, oh, you know, I didn't know Jim Costa  of CNN was here.  I could just tap it, follow him.  And so it's very easy to add people, your followers.  So I think that this is it's cleverly done.  It's I think it's well done.  Now, here's the question.  OK, first of all, did this rehabilitate Zuck?  Some people are calling it Zuck 2.0.

Start time: 768.98
End time: 799.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't want to join this and I haven't joined it  because I don't like the data grab that's happening.  I hate being like I'm not on Facebook.  Like I have not either.  This is on. Yeah, yeah.  I'm not I am on Instagram, but I don't have the app downloaded.  I have none of this because I don't want to be part of that.  And I was kind of shocked at all these people were like, wow, there's so many people.  I'm like, can we not talk about like how Europe's like,  that's doesn't really handle privacy to the point where we're comfortable with it.  It's a little different.

Start time: 799.20
End time: 812.96
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's threads saying we don't want to be in Europe  because we are concerned about the data  rules in Europe and we don't want to deal with that yet.  So it's not Europe saying you can't be here.  It's threads saying, well, right.

Start time: 813.06
End time: 818.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll hold off. Well, is Europe saying you need to abide by these rules?  And I don't know if I want to play your game.

Start time: 819.32
End time: 859.38
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's not clear, by the way, that that's not going to  that they're not going to figure that out.  It could change because it can't really see not being in Europe is a big deal.  Right. For for any social.  I think so. But here's you can also see it's grabbing a lot of data.  Yeah, here's the here's the data.  This is thank you, Apple, because Apple does force companies to publish this,  including health and fitness, financial info, contact info,  browsing history, usage data, diagnostics, purchases, location,  context, search history, identifiers, sensitive info and other data.  In other words, everything, everything.

Start time: 859.80
End time: 872.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a lot of data that and I'm not Facebook is not.  I mean, I know it's Facebook.  I know they're grabbing everything they can, but that's why I got off Facebook  in the first place. So I'm kind of like, yeah, maybe I'm just not as well.

Start time: 873.40
End time: 876.92
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Where's the outcry from the masses about this collection?

Start time: 877.02
End time: 881.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it was so desperate for a replacement to Twitter.  Really? That's what it is.

Start time: 881.26
End time: 882.70
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  OK, we'll just give it all up.

Start time: 882.80
End time: 885.12
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what it is. You know, there's a couple of.

Start time: 885.60
End time: 902.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's our job as journalists.  Yeah, we're all like, I think we're sitting down on the job  because we're not explaining this to people.  And I also think people don't understand the risk to their.  I'm actually writing about risk in data privacy right now.  And it's a frickin nightmare because. Yeah, but Stacey, it's a lot.

Start time: 903.22
End time: 912.75
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Most people, a lot of people do what I did.  So I won't have Facebook on my phone, but then they put Instagram  or WhatsApp on their phone. Right.  Do you have WhatsApp on your phone?

Start time: 913.42
End time: 920.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do have WhatsApp on.  But WhatsApp is encrypted and no, no, no.  WhatsApp actually. No, no, no.  No, no, no.

Start time: 921.08
End time: 929.08
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Look at the health.  Look at the health notice and WhatsApp on the iPhone.  Well, you don't have an iPhone, but I don't know.  I think the app itself is grabbing the same information.

Start time: 930.18
End time: 930.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Damn it, Leo.

Start time: 932.22
End time: 936.06
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  But that's my point is that, yes, you're absolutely right.

Start time: 936.64
End time: 942.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Again, absolutely right.  But most people, most normal people are already giving meta all that information anyway.

Start time: 942.90
End time: 955.84
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Can you get in touch with all of these Congress folks out here  and share that screen that you just share with our tweet folks?  Because all of they're worried about all they're worried about is Tick Tock  and what it's is that hysterical.  And this is this. Yeah.  Just as egregious. Right.

Start time: 956.48
End time: 1012.68
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that does bring me to to the second point, which is this is,  I think, good for the Fediverse.  Because for somebody like you, Stacey, you could you could put  a mastodon app, for instance, on your phone.  And if you look at the the privacy card for mastodon, zero, nothing. Right.  And and this is the beauty part, thanks to if and will.  This will be a good question if they do this.  If threads goes ahead and and and as they have promised,  incorporates activity pub, then you could follow.  Let's say you did want to follow Patrick Mahomes.  He's on threads.  He's not on mastodon.  You could follow on your mastodon and since get all of his threads,  he could follow you from from Twitter social or mastodon  or any other mastodon, since not any other, because a few have said  we're not going to have anything to do with this,  but the the ones that are not defederating meta.  And and you would have a perfect back and forth conversation.

Start time: 1012.72
End time: 1025.98
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I was wondering how that was going to work,  because I heard you talk about it briefly on on the show Sunday.  Like, what is meta getting out of joining activity pub?  Nothing. So it goes against their business logic, right?

Start time: 1026.36
End time: 1031.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It kind of maybe if you want to like really screw Elon Musk,  this would be a good way to do it.

Start time: 1031.80
End time: 1125.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So here's an interesting post from the new stack.  Get better PR.  This is Richard McManus writing threads adopting activity pub.  Makes sense, but it won't be easy.  And I'll go to his his conclusion.  It's early days, but in my humble experience,  Richard McManus, senior editor of the new stack, writes  threads feels like a text based version of Instagram.  That's accurate.  The content is a mix of aspirational and motivational.  And the current algorithmic timeline is peppered with celebrities  and influencers peddling their memes.  Perhaps the biggest challenge integrating with Fediverse apps  like Mastodon will be the cultural differences  between the two communities.  But but I'm not worried about that, because it's like parallel rivers.  Just because you tap into something from one doesn't mean  the whole river comes through that pipeline.  He said, I hope Metta does successfully adopt the protocol  so that Mastodon users like me can add a few thread users to their feeds.  The ideal outcome would be a bunch of new apps getting built  that tap into both Mastodon and thread social graphs.  But he does say it's in the interest of Metta.  He's promised it.  And Metta has actually put a software engineer,  Ben Savage, on the activity pub working group in the W3C.  They have continued to make the steps that they would need to make.  There are some technical issues, but I think at this point,  they've really promised that they would do this.  It doesn't. Let's face it.  Does it hurt Metta if Stacey, who's never going to have threads on her phone,  follows Patrick Mahone's on Mastodon?

Start time: 1126.28
End time: 1133.12
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It actually helps.  It makes threads more valuable to Patrick Mahone.  Exactly. Because he can get more people. Exactly.  OK. And maybe. Right.

Start time: 1133.24
End time: 1135.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All those brands will be super thrilled.

Start time: 1135.38
End time: 1152.68
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sure. And maybe even at Patrick Mahone's at threads.net.  Notice, you know, somebody on Mastodon says, oh, he's on threads  and goes over and follows him on thread.  It doesn't hurt. It doesn't suck enough.  Enough people for a way.  Those are people like you, Stacey, who would never join it in the first place.

Start time: 1664.94
End time: 1680.34
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  My question, the lawyer or a group of lawyers  that decided to send that information over to Metta,  that they actually send that thinking, OK,  Twitter has a leg to stand on in this situation.  I think they just they just took the check.

Yeah.  So Larry Ellison gave him a billion dollars of Oracle,  but he's not paying his Oracle bill like this guy will.  Elon will bite the hand to feed you.  He's another Trump. Right.  So I wouldn't work for him for free.  I'd make sure I got the money up front.  Anyway, yeah, that's ironic.  He's here's another one.  He's suing Wachtel, the law firm that Twitter hired to make him buy Twitter.  Because he's he's suing them because as the Twitter board left,  they gave they paid Wachtel 90 million dollars.  They said, thank you.  He just paid 44 billion. You made him pay.  Here's your money.  Elon, who is required, by the way, to pay them.  When you buy a company, you absorb all their contracts.  Is furious that they got paid 90 million.  So he's suing them to get the money back.  He's so Trump.  I I don't you know, I'm actually starting to worry about his mental health.  I think there's something bad going on, to be honest.

Start time: 1756.40
End time: 1769.64

Start time: 1821.52
End time: 1829.80
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think there's a lot of loyalty.  I wish I was small loyalty to it.  So there's all kinds of weird lists in there, right?  It's or let me let me look here.

Start time: 1829.86
End time: 1831.26
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 1831.60

There's a lot of stuff in gardening Japanese cluster.  There's one that's just a picture.  A better film feed for movie lovers.  Film Sky. Yeah, this is interesting.  I mean, these are lists, right?  That's all they are.

Start time: 1881.12
End time: 1900.32
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, but what it shows is the possibility, I think, of rent your own algorithms.  Yeah, I think that's it.  So I could imagine blue sky being really good at this and saying,  finally, my people are here by photography and football and bad people are all here  because I can finally find them.

Start time: 1901.00
End time: 1909.26
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 1910.14
End time: 1921.68
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I hope not, because wouldn't that be a bit of an echo chamber?  And when people want echo, it is right down the road that we're going right now.  Far as all of the stuff that you see on the Twitter verse.

Start time: 1922.60
End time: 1951.40
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And nobody ever sees all of Twitter.  As all right, no two people see the same Twitter.  You and so the idea of trending is so ridiculous  because probably the biggest trend is a tiny, tiny percentage point zero, zero,  zero something of the total of Twitter.  We're all seeing a tiny window.  And it's better if we do, actually.  You don't want to see everything.  OK, that's what people get mad when you see too much.  So no, I think we're already there.

Start time: 1951.48
End time: 1955.88

Start time: 1959.04

Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 1962.62

Start time: 1977.78
End time: 2003.72
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They say they're going to add that to.  If you are an Android, you can turn on the beta version of the threads app  and some of those features will appear cool because they are trying them out.  I think they'll probably have much of the feature set.  They have quote tweets, which is something Mastodon has refused so far.  Yeah. And that's been used to good purpose, I think, on threads.  I think the quote tweets are good.

Start time: 2004.10
End time: 2044.09
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I wonder what their moderation strategy is, because,  you know, when Musk came around for Twitter, his whole  free speech pitch was big, but he also talked a lot about,  you know, how many bots are here.  That was like his reason for not wanting to buy was because of all of the bots.  And he said he's going to fix this and that.  But I haven't heard any mention about bots on threads,  even though my feed had a ton of them.  Were they bots or brands?  Bots, not brands like just random.

Transcript:  This is, of course, the Wall Street Journal.  I have I know every you tell me they're good.  The news department's good, reliable, trustworthy journalists.  What Stacey says it.  I have friends who work for the it's not the it's not the editor.  I understand it's not the opinion section.  But I have to say that a lot of times you feel like they're kind  of got an axe to grind against big tech.  I feel like that.  And I feel like this is a little bit slanted when it says, well,  she's losing. So there.  But she did lose a big case yesterday.  Microsoft is trying to block the acquisition of Blizzard Activision,  a big gaming company by Microsoft.  It's one of the biggest tech acquisitions of all time.  And they sued in court.  They asked for an injunction to prevent Microsoft from going ahead and doing it.  Because even though they're under investigation,  Microsoft could just move ahead with the acquisition and then say, there,  now you break it up, you do something.  So so the FTC's thought, you know, they are going to continue this investigation.  And there's a hearing in August with a administrative judge  to decide whether they should actively block it.  But this might have been a mistake on the part of the FTC,  because when they asked for the injunction,  Microsoft fought back and fought back hard.  And a judge in San Francisco has now ruled against the FTC  in such a dramatic way that people like Paul Thurotte said, it's over.  This acquisition is going to happen.  The UK is still out there trying to.  Yeah. And I think the thinking is that the the deal has a  breakup clause on the 18th less than a week.  And so the thing is, they'll just do it now and, you know, the next week  and say to the UK, need a, need a, sue us, fire a, fine us, do something.  Who cares? We don't care.  It's a lot harder, I guess, once it's happened.  The judge was fairly brutal.

Start time: 3107.49
End time: 3112.15
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis

Start time: 3116.30

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what I think. We have to always have to ask now.  Oh, yeah. The federal judiciary is getting more and more suspect.

Start time: 3122.94
End time: 3226.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But anyway, she wrote that the FTC failed to show evidence  backing up its claim that Microsoft was likely to withhold Activision's  blockbuster games from competitors such as Sony.  In fact, Microsoft has made 10 year deals with Sony and others  to make sure those games are still available.  The judge noted those deals, which would expand consumer access  to its biggest game franchise, Call of Duty.  The judge was pretty clear that the FTC had not proven its case  and is allowing it, you know, did not give them that injunction.  Anti-trust experts expect that the FTC will appeal.  But the pundits I've heard talking today don't think there's much to say.  They don't think there's much merit in that.  And they think now because of this judgment that the administrative  court judge in August will probably just say, yeah, you got no case.  And that's that.  And the UK, which is fighting it over grounds that it would somehow  monopolize a non-existent cloud gaming business,  really is not a business, you know, and Google just killed Stadia.  Yeah, Stadia. Yeah.  So I think this is probably Amazon still has what?  Well, was Amazon's cloud gaming Luna Luna, Luna and Nvidia has GeForce now.  They're few, but they're all tiny.  They're not. Oh, yeah. It's not a it's not a big business.  And so, you know, some people said that the FTC forgot to bring its crystal  ball or time machine to the court because it's all about the, you know,  well, this is what might happen or what if this happens in any event?  The real question is, does this hobble Lena Conner, her attempt to go after

Start time: 3226.82

Start time: 3258.92
End time: 3270.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's also a difference in any trust, because I think bringing these cases  by itself forwards the notion that you've got to be thoughtful about these  mergers and that you're not as you fail.

Start time: 3270.54
End time: 3278.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That actually is a greater.  I think it's a greater danger if you bring the case and lose.  Warning. Does that embolden if you back it up?

Start time: 3278.62
End time: 3303.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That emboldens people. Yeah.  I think there are a lot of companies like Microsoft, certainly Apple,  that don't want to go to court if they don't have to because there's discovery.  Stuff comes out. Oh, yeah. Yeah.  And so there is it is a little bit of a threat, I would say.  But you're right, if they never if the FTC loses every case, then it's not  then it doesn't have so much power.  I'm trying to think of what else I really don't know.

Start time: 3394.98
End time: 3408.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what we've had and we have lionized tech  and given it a pass for far too long based on the fact that they  they used to be building things in their garage.  And that hasn't been true since since the 80s.  Forever. And you I mean.

Start time: 3409.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah. And when I think about like the the people I talk to, even  I would say it started happening around 2006, 2007,  is when people started talking.  I mean, there was always like, you know, the stock option people. Right.  Those the sales culture and tech has always been the sales culture and tech.  But those people are now in charge.  And that has kind of eaten over everything.  And you get these people who are doing like.  It's like the app for it's like the Uber for this. This. Right.  So it's like building these apps and things that are very divorced  from the infrastructure itself.  And some of that might have come about from things like  you no longer had to come construct a server rack to run any tech thing.  You you've made tech very accessible to people  who are not necessarily technically savvy. I don't know.

You used to have to build your own mastodon server if you want it.  Now look at all these losers who don't really want to be here.  There's there's pluses and minuses to that accessibility.

Start time: 3484.14
End time: 3520.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would argue that's not the problem.  There's a big plus to know that anybody who has a vision  for how something can be. It used to be.  Yeah, you'd have to know Pearl and be able to, you know,  write a CGI script or something.  I mean, there was a much higher barrier to entry.  The fact that the barrier entry is lowered is good.  I don't think, however, the entry of big money and VCs  and the perverse incentives that they bring with them is a good thing.  Because they force you to quick exits.  They force you to quick capitalization.  I mean, it's not it's not as good.

Transcript:  Go ahead. This is kind of along the lines of the regulation thing,  because it turns out in some in some regards, we're letting the EU  regulate big tech.  There is something called a flop, a very large online platform.  This is under the Digital Services Act.  The EU has now added their seven.  They've announced the 17 companies that are VLOPs that include  Alibaba, Aliexpress, Amazon, Apple and their app store,  booking face dot com, Facebook, Google Play, Google Maps, Google shopping,  Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat, Tiktok, Twitter,  weirdly, Wikipedia, YouTube,  and a European retailer, Zalando, and then very large online  search engines are Bing and Google search.  These are companies that have to. Google is the Mondo VLOP.  Yeah. Well, these are companies.  So the DSA is about social and disinformation.  So these are companies that have a large enough footprint in the EU.  I think 15 percent of the EU uses them.  And it gives them responsibilities to protect their users from illegal content,  counterfeit or illegal products, hate speech and so forth.  Amazon complains, saying, we're not a VLOP.  We're just this little obscure Internet boutique.

Start time: 4067.18

Start time: 4069.38
End time: 4094.30
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Obscure Internet boutique.  Amazon sues EU for calling it a very large online platform.  Amazon actually said, you know, we we've done a lot to protect.  Our customers, a vast majority of revenue comes from retail,  which isn't covered by the DSA.  And we have done.  But Amazon is an advertising company, a big advertising company.

Start time: 4095.08

Start time: 4111.26
End time: 4116.92
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis

Start time: 4123.84

Start time: 4136.44
End time: 4163.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, I think, I mean, they wrote their own laws.  So I think a lot of their laws around this are newer  and more applicable to the era we're in, whereas like the FTC is kind of run in  with some old school anti-compete.  Plus, the EU has had a different  metric or framework for anti-competitive behavior than the US,  which has been driven by consumer prices.

Start time: 4163.34
End time: 4166.92

Transcript:  if you could do it as accurately?  I mean, umpires are notoriously inconsistent.  Truly don't know.  In fact, that's why we have replay.  One of the things that happens with the baseball game is the batters  get to know the umpires strike zone.  From umpire to umpire, it can change, you know, and real.  Technically, it's from the letters to the knees.  But, you know, and the width of the plate.  But the umpires often strike zone is higher or lower.  And you get to know it. Right.  So it would make a lot more sense if you had a machine do it,  if it could do it accurately, I guess it would still have to do it.

On average, if this keeps up pretty soon, they'll be all day.  Be like cricket. Right.  So more commercial art.  Well, yeah, maybe there's anyway.  Part of it is the rituals that both pitchers and batters go through  in between every pitch, you know, the batter steps out of the  out of the they got to do their dance and spits and goes this and  and the pitchers going, hey, it's a bunch of guys with ticks.  So, yeah, they institute to do a 30 second pitch clock.  And it's games are now average two hours and 27 minutes.  It's a good article.  If you like baseball articles in the Atlantic about this.

And for a while, they thought that AI was going to kill chess  when Deep Blue beat Gary Kasparov, the world champion.  And it is true that the machines actually now play chess far better  than any human.  And at the time, I was worried a lot of people were worried  that people would stop playing chess.  It's like, well, what's the point if if, you know, your your phone can be you.  And no, in fact, more people play chess than ever before.  Sometimes they do with the help of machines.  You know, if you're going to be a world champion,  you're going to have to train with a computer and so forth.

Start time: 4705.92
End time: 4710.06
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  OK. Well, hasn't the machine taught humans new moves and new strategies to

Start time: 4710.52
End time: 4800.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  to some degree? Yes.  I mean, mostly what you would use as a champion, you know, grandmaster,  you would use a machine to investigate lines and stuff.  But ultimately, your judgment is is going to be paramount.  One thing that's happened is kind of weird.  You know, one of this can happen because a chess game,  even though it's very, very complex, is solvable, right?  You could say, well, this move, if you follow it all the way to the end,  you're going to win.  Humans can't do that.  They can only do, you know, a little bit ahead.  But nevertheless, machines could solve it.  So it could be theoretically solvable.  It gets much less complex with fewer pieces.  So if you get down to a handful of pieces,  the machine can say in every possible position, this is a win, this is a win.  That's a loss. That's a draw. That's a win. That's what.  So they have tables now of positions in the end game,  all of which have been solved, like just completely solved, like,  oh, you win here or you lose here.  And masters have started memorizing those so they know this is a win.  This is a loss. And this is how you play.  So it has changed the end game a little bit.  It changed the opening a little bit.  Yeah. But the middle is so complex that a machine  is not quite as surpassing as as it is in the other parts of the game.  And there's, you know, sure, a car can drive a marathon in 10 minutes.  Right. Or a minute.  But that doesn't mean a marathoner isn't that that's not still a thing.  The human running a car cannot drive a marathon in a minute.

My argument would be, are are you against making baseball right?  You know, are you against having the correct call in the games?  And so if you want this AI here, you're going to get a better call  every time you come to the plate.  So shut up and. But Ant.

They're scared at a deep existential level  about the very idea of what they're doing,  building powerful AI models and releasing them into the hands of people  who might use them to do terrible and destructive things.  Many of them at Anthropic believe that AI models are rapidly approaching a level  where they might be considered artificial general intelligence, AGI,  and they fear if they're not carefully controlled,  these systems could take over and destroy us.

Russerite's not every conversation I had at Anthropic revolved around  existential risk, but dread was a dominant theme.  At times, I felt like a food writer who was assigned to cover a trendy new  restaurant only to discover that the kitchen staff wanted to talk about  nothing but food poisoning.  One anthropic worker told me he routinely had trouble falling asleep  because he was so worried about AI.  Another predicted between bites of his lunch that there was a 20% chance  that a rogue AI would destroy humanity within the next decade.

Then you have panic as a business near its view,  where you have these charities that are here or not for profits  that are hugely funded, open philanthropy, future of life,  future of Humanity Institute.  This is what Emil Torres writes about that's so so good.  And they're making a fortune on this this kind of moral entrepreneurship  of having all this money to give away.  And then you have the people who are actually worried about the current problems  of AI like Dare Institute, which is near  Timnit Gebru and and Emily Bender and Margaret Mitchell and those folks.  And it's it's ridiculous spread now.  And you know, I've been I've defended geeks.  I've liked geeks. I've written books about geeks.

Transcript:  If you give people a tool that says, I can help inspire you to make better decisions.  I think that's good.  What happens then is, oh, here's comes our old buddy.  Financialization comes in and says, oh, this can do it so much faster.  And then we don't need, you know, we can cut down on people by weight in room.

Transcript:  And instead of having a doctor, we'll just run this AI and that the nurse will do  or have to actually there was a nurse that was suing.  I think it was in the Wall Street Journal about this.  But like the AI made a decision and the nurse couldn't  couldn't question it, even though she knew the call it was.  That was not the point.  That's bad. Of Margaret Mitchell and that's how we're going to get

But we also the problem is humans look at a computer say, oh,  the computer gave us the answer. It must be true.  And that's the that's the secondary risk of all this is.

Start time: 5514.20
End time: 5528.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is that we people it's not stupid people.  It's gross financial interest that is going to drive people to say  to drive organizations or ownership to say, oh,  we'll just let the AI do it.

Start time: 5528.36
End time: 5561.64
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll start there at the top.  But I hesitate calling them stupid people.  I think it's just normal people who are told computers don't make mistakes.  They're right. And they're, you know, and it's our job.  It's incumbent upon us as tech journalists to say, no, no, that's not true.  These are unreliable.  And you shouldn't trust them. Garbage.  It's not stupidity. It's just, you know, we haven't done the it's.  Yeah, we haven't done the job we have to do of telling them, you know,  again and again, computers make mistakes.  Most people know that by now.  I hope so. This day and age.  But they but AI somehow seems like a superior kind of computer.

Start time: 5561.70
End time: 5602.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's not just that we think that data like you hear people talk about.  We're trying to get to a world where human judgment doesn't  matter, where you can offset human judgment and the cost of it.  And the equivocacy of it, the the ability to make those  find the nuance, because not everyone's going to make the same decision  the same way. Right.  So we computers, if you it will make the same decision the same way every time.  And we we trust that because we're like, yes, that's right.  When we start letting people make those decisions, they can be gamed.  And we fundamentally hate when people get gamed. Right.  It's kind of like talking about that.

Transcript:  It's the mistake, assuming that the computer doesn't have biases,  that doesn't have flaws.  It has the same flaws.  They're up in the system.  The humans that put it together,  put those flaws in, they built them in because it's made by humans.  So maybe a computer could be a perfect line judge.  But I definitely don't think a computer could be a perfect physician.

Transcript:  Well, I'll give you an example.  A physician is really two skills.  One skill is a memory that can remember all the diagnostic information,  remember all the possible illnesses and put the two and two together and say,  you've got Epstein-Barr syndrome.  It's the second part is the person who is a human who can  interface with a human and talk to them and help them.

Start time: 5680.32
End time: 5712.50
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you know, here's where it really makes a difference, I think, is when I had  I had a vascular oritis or something.  And and and I had fevers and I had a problem and my temple.  Right. And I took all the symptoms to end up for doctors.  And it was blind men and the elephant. Right. Right.  The cardiologist says it's cardiology.  The rheumatologist says it's right.  All right. And finally, it was one guy who happened to be the right guy.  Whereas if you could feed all the symptoms in and maybe drive  the cardiologist to say, no, this isn't cardiology, actually, it's something else.

Start time: 5712.60
End time: 5725.02
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's a big if.  But yes, that's the that's the idea is that you could, in theory,  create a perfect diagnostic machine.  They might argue with the machine and say, no, this stupid.  I still think you'd want, you know, humans in the treatment end.

Start time: 5725.58
End time: 5729.04
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But but you want to inspire inspiring possible diagnoses.

Start time: 5729.34
End time: 5741.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly. Maybe the computer could say, well, there's four possibilities.  Given these symptoms, there's four possibilities.  Here are the four.  And that might make the cardiologist think a little harder about the others  that were cardiology related, I guess.

Start time: 5741.98
End time: 5758.40
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And the other thing that can happen, which which LLMs right now don't do.  But you want to design it in such a way that it says, here's why  this diagnosis comes up, because there's end percent with this symptom.  Right. And you want to start to tie it to that so that the doctor  could be part of the logic of it.  So we're getting in our.

Start time: 5758.48
End time: 5779.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's the key part, because, yeah, there are issues like  if if the diagnosis, the computer diagnostic says, oh, I'm basing  this diagnosis on the fact that they've got like high white blood cell counts.  If they're on a drug that promotes high white blood cell counts  and the doctor knows that they can discount that. Right.

Start time: 5779.26
End time: 5786.16

Transcript:  Well, the computer should know it, too.  I mean, all of this depends on having perfect information.  It has the data. It's got to have the computer can ask.

Transcript:  So we're getting in our. Well, this court has a good example.  He says my atometrist has automatic machines that measure what your vision numbers are.  We've done this. You go to the atometrist.  They sit down from a machine goes,  you focus is focused on focus and comes up with a prescription.  But then he still does it manually himself to double check and refine it  and generate the prescription. Right. That's awesome.  That's all yours. Not do that.  Better. I haven't been in a couple of years, so I can't answer that.  But I love that idea. Yeah. I love that idea.  That's a nice combination. Yeah.  I went to the optometrist a couple of weeks ago, optometrist a couple of weeks ago,  and she put a meta quest on my head of the thing.  Really? So they used to do.  I don't know if this is better. I don't think it's better.  They used to you put your chin on the thing  and you look through the thing and it tests your peripheral vision.  And you have a clicker.  And when you could see the light, you click it right.  And it goes all around testing your peripheral vision.  Now they put a VR headset on me  and I kind of do the same thing, but I don't think it's as good.

They must. Right. They must.  I'm trying to think if I move my head around.  I guess that's the point of it is you don't have to put your chin on it.

Transcript:  who suits here is suing open AI and meta for copyright infringement.  You know her as, of course, a comic.  She says of her, she says,  authors Christopher Golden and Richard Cadry are also in the suit  that some of her material is showing up.  And the reason is so she wrote a book called Confessions of a Bedwetter.  The book has unfortunately been pirated and is on  what they call shadow library websites like Bibliotheque Library, Genesis,  Z library or available in bulk via torrent systems.  So she says she believes the AI is scraping these pirate sites  because she feels that chat GP.  She says here in an open AI suit, the trio offers exhibits  showing that when prompted, chat GPT will summarize their books,  which it couldn't do unless it had seen the copy.  Silverman's Bedwetter is the first book shown being summarized by chat GPT  in the exhibits.  Golden's book error at is used as an example as Cadry's book Sandman Slim.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I can read the book.  In fact, somebody did this to my last books and they're doing it right now  to the new one where they read it and they sell their own summary.  They're free to do that.  That's this entire show

Start time: 6229.86
End time: 6245.37
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's being transformative.  I think it's transformative as can be.  Now, the question is, did they buy the original copy?  Do they have the right to go to the copy?  That may be a question.  Once they do. So one is fine.  One twenty dollar book.  And now I've read it and now I can do with it what I want.  And I can summarize it for you.

Start time: 6246.36
End time: 6255.35
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And so this will be interesting to see what the court says, because you're right.  It's not like they're reproducing actual verbatim passages from the book.  They're summarizing it.

Transcript:  It's the essence of copyright says that you can copyright  the treatment of information, but not the information itself,  because in an enlightened society, you can't own information.  Meanwhile, there is a Google suit at the same time.  Downline 67 just got filed as a class action suit,  which tries to bring against Bard, which unnamed complainants  trying to come up with the class action with multiple different tax on this.  All the stolen information belonged to real people who shared it online  for specific purposes.  So they're trying to argue that anything you shared online in public

Start time: 6292.08
End time: 6325.16
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  and Google learns from it is theft.  Here's a here's a hypothetical.  Wikipedia, probably somewhere in an article about Sarah Silverman,  talks about events that are described in that book  because some editor at Wikipedia read the book.  Yeah. And wrote the article.  That's not copyright infringement is the only.  So this is what the judge is going to have to decide is the only difference  that that the Wikipedia editor bought the book and read it  versus chat GPT finding a copy of it online and not pay.

Start time: 6325.20
End time: 6338.80
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wikipedia editor may have gone to a library.  Number one. Oh, and yeah.  And and by the way, chat GPT does not retain the book.  Once it maps relationships, the books mean less to them.

Start time: 6338.92
End time: 6366.22
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, what we don't know is it may well be that chat GPT or any of these  is regurgitating somebody else's regurgitation.  Yes. So it may be that chat GPT actually did ingest as it did Wikipedia  and is repeating something it read on Wikipedia.  That is a repeat of something the editor read in the book.  So I think this is going to be a very hard case to prove.  I understand Sarah Silverman's point of view.  But I think it's a pretty hard case to prove.

Start time: 6499.36
End time: 6522.94
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you just did my fault.  But meanwhile, what's happening, I think, is that is it  you're going to see places come along and say, well, in the meantime,  we're going to do a clean version.  So Shutterstock, I think we might have talked about this before.  Well, Adobe's doing this to do it.  Right. They're doing that.  But what's interesting, Leo, is that let's say that let's say the service  of Windsor suit, a training data set that is licensed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How? So all you're going to do is retrain the models  and they're retraining models all the time. Oh, OK.  So this is actually something I learned about, because again, that FTC lawsuit,  because Amazon part of the settlement was that they would have to eliminate  any work product that used some of their ill gotten data.  Ill gotten data.  So, yeah, I mean, it's expensive,  but you're also retraining your models often. That's true.  And now is there a way to audit to make sure that's habit?  Not really. But going into this all the way back in like 2016, 2017,  there was this kind of idea they call it MLOps.  And the idea is responsible companies.  And they've been talking about this for a while, is you have to think about  where your training data comes from, improving that out,  that you have rights to it.  And companies have been doing that for quite some time.

Creators of AI technologies pay a small fee into  without all our writings and photos that AI companies are using to train their models,  they'd have nothing to sell.  So we're owed profits, says Bruce, for data powered.  That was an interesting article.

In the end, it is a tax on reading that if this company comes along  and it reads the open Internet and then says, well, you got to pay a tax on that  to pay to every citizen because you read what we said in the open on the Internet.  I think it's a terrible idea.  You disagree?

Transcript:  No, I agree with you.  I think to make a tax on reading anthropomorphizes it.  It's not that it's tax on scraping that if a company writes a tool  that scrapes the public Internet for data, it should have to license that data.  And since you can't say, well, that data is owned by an you don't have a license.  You have a license.  There is no. So what you do is you say, well, we're going to pay a penny per megabyte.  We're going to pay it into a fund.  And everybody will get a copyright mentality of Earth.

Transcript:  So so so I I I earlier today, I talked to Richard Gingras,  as a Google's the senior VP News, and he told me an amazing story from Korea.  He had just been there.  And in Korea, Google's this is going to be relevant, I promise you.  In Korea, Google's market share is much smaller, smaller than anywhere else.  It's their lose to I think it's called.  What's it called? A big site there.  I forget the name of it.  But the big site that has all the news, it's it's more like a Yahoo.  And everybody goes to it and all their news is in it.  And they license the news.  And Gingras said a few years ago, he went and he said,  you're going to regret this because you're going to want to build  your own relationships with customers and you're not building it  because everybody gets the news from this big portal.  And you're going to hate this.  So he goes back. And in fact, yes, they hate it.  They said, you were so right.  We don't have anything.  And they tried to push the portal to link to them, to link to the news producers.  And the portal came back and said, well, only if you will link  to a certain number of pages where there's only four ads  and you're not allowed to promote your brand, you're not allowed to navigate.  I think you're not allowed to sell their own tax, basically.  The publishers are saying, oh, they're trapped.  And so it's the exact opposite of what's happening in Canada.  And in Australia, where the publishers are saying, we want links.  Give us links, please. We need links.  They have value to us and we can't get them.  It's the mirror image of the other places, which is kind of so hilarious, I think.

Dave Winer says that RSS was made successful  and Martin Nissenholz, the senior VP News of the New York Times,  chose to put RSS feeds out of the Times.  That's what made it popular.  That's what made people realize the value. Right.  So if you don't have a lot of feeds, whatever reader you have is no good.  On the other hand, if people don't have a convenient reader to use like Google  Reader, then the company, the media company say, oh, stop making.

And then he says, well, here's the notes from our conversation.  Apparently he has a set up. So damn, it loads.  It loads the audio to Dropbox, uses whisper AI to transcribe it,  uses chat GPT to generate notes from the conversation and as a takeaway list,  an item list of things to do based on it.  So he says, here's the notes from our conversation.  That's pretty cool.

Transcript:  If if so, my child is uses my child has an audio processing disorder,  so it can be very hard for them to take in information auditorily.  So they actually have used things like Otter has a service that does this.  The challenge is they have to get the recording permission.  They have to get permission.  But then they have to get the recording close up enough  to the teacher to get.  Or like access to a soundboard if you're in a in a classroom, right?  To get a good enough recording to make the notes worthwhile,  because otherwise it's a little the transition.

It even recognized his Charlie's son came in.  And he's just graduated from Pritzker.  He's got he's, you know, working as an intern.  And he's talking about a photo shoot that he did.  And the A.I. said a young man named Zach came came in  and started talking about photography.  Here's the things that we decided he should do.  It was really great.  Brock said, well, what are some tips for what you tell people  when you're taking pictures?  He summarized it.  The A.I. did a great job of summarizing it.  And then I said, well, who owns the ad agency you're working for?  The A.I. said, do some research into ad agency ownership.  It was pretty it was actually really good.

Transcript:  Actually, you know, be interesting to talk to him about  National Geographic firing everybody.  He used to be a photographer.  Look at them.  So that would be very interesting.  All right. I think that's a good that's a wrap, kids.  I'm going to get my trike here.  Oh, before we do that, we've got to do your picks.  The week is stay tuned. Stay tuned.  No, I want to actually do a little pitch here  for our incredible ad sales folks.  Yeah. And are and really in a way a pitch for you, our audience.  We've got a great qualified audience.  Nielsen says a 56% of podcast listeners  pay more attention when a host reads the ad.  That's why we do those host read ads.  Seventy two percent percent of our listeners have a job function  related directly to technology.  Eighty seven percent are involved with tech I.T. decisions.  We've got top earners listening.  You guys, 66% of our audience earns over 100000 annually.  Almost a quarter of them over 200000 annually.  Great people. And I know you have a great product.  Wouldn't you like to advertise on our shows to bring your product  to our audience? That's what we do.  And I think we've got the best team in the world to do this.  Not just Lisa, my wife.  I'm a little prejudiced on that one.  But I love Max and Ryan, our salespeople.  You can give them a call and then they will talk with you.  They're really, I think, experts in marketing.  They will help you market your products.  It's not just you give us money. We read ads.  It's a really great relationship.  We also have an incredible continuity department  headed by Debbie and we've got Viva and Sebastian.  And they will give you full service.  Everything from copywriting to graphic design.  Anthony Nielsen does great graphics work.  All our ads are embedded in the content, as you know,  which means they're unique every time.  We guarantee over delivery on impressions.  We have onboarding services, really white glove onboarding service.  We give you detailed reporting free of cost when you're a direct client.  You get courtesy commercials you can share on your social media  and your landing pages.  We also put you lots of freebies like we'll put you in our newsletter  that goes out to thousands of fans.  We've we've had some recession bonuses.  Social media promotion, of course, comes along with it.  And we even give you value ads  that you don't have to buy shows and ads you don't have to buy.  I could give you testimonial after testimonial.  Let me pick one from you've probably seen the ads we do for the Thinks Canary.  Haroon Mir, who, you know, is founder of that company, said, quote,  We expected to work well for us because we were long time listeners  who over the years bought many of the products and services  we learned about on various shows.  Haroon says we were not disappointed.  The combination of the very personal ad reads  and the careful selection of products that Tweet largely believes in  give the ads an authentic, trusted voice.  It works really well for products like ours.  Ten out of ten we'll use again.  Thank you, Haroon. We love you and your product.  And we're really glad to do those ads.  That's the that's a big part of it is it's a genuine endorsement  from people that you your customers will trust.  Our listeners are very intelligent.  They're very engaged. They are tech savvy.  It's a great place to advertise.  So just a little pitch for our ad team.  You can launch a campaign today, break out of the advertising norm  and grow your brand by giving an authentic introduction  for your products and services to a qualified audience by experts they trust.  Check out what we have to offer at twit.tv slash advertise.  That's the call to action.  Just go to the website twit.tv slash advertise.  You can send an email from there, fill out a form if you want, but learn more.  And I think really, if you've got a product  you want to bring out to an audience of a great audience of engaged listeners,  this is the place to do it.  Twit.tv slash advertised.  Now it's time for our pick of the week.  Let's start with Stacey's thing.  Can I call it a thing?

Start time: 8143.24
End time: 8190.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can. Stacey's thing.  Not it's it's not always a thing, as it were.  But I was going to show off a smart button and it didn't arrive in time.  Oh, I can't show you a smile.  I know that's how I felt.  So instead, we're just going to do a quick latency test.  And I'm going to tell you about different ways I use sensors that might be surprising.  So this is last week, I showed you the Roku stuff.  This is the open close sensor for that.  And I was just.  I don't know.  I ran out of buttons because I don't have a smart button.  So I was like, oh, you know what I need?  I need a button that I can press to like indicate like an on air or on a call,  like because my kids are from school right now and they do you have an on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, in half the time, my office is my door is usually open  because I'm not always recording.  But I am sometimes on Zoom calls and no one can tell because I'm like  typing furiously on my notes, you know, and just whatever.  So I have created.  I use this Roku thing.  So now you can check latency on this device.  I open it. Oh, my.  And then. Ta da.  Oh, look, the lights change. Oh, no.

Start time: 8221.16
End time: 8223.44
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham

Start time: 8240.78
End time: 8243.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Wow. Yes.  It's a little bit. Yes.

Start time: 8245.48

Start time: 8248.96
End time: 8250.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Use better sensors. OK.

Start time: 8251.76
End time: 8255.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 8256.14
End time: 8263.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is this is a proprietary signal that goes to a base station  that then goes to the cloud that then goes to.

Start time: 8263.34
End time: 8267.66
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the problem is that it goes to the cloud is the problematic words.

Start time: 8268.34
End time: 8302.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the point is, now you got to see two things.  One, latency on the Roku stuff that I've been testing.  The review, the formal review will be out Friday.  But then you also got to see like I actually  we have this deal where my husband's office is also our guest room. Mm hmm. And.  There are lots of LEDs on computer equipment.  This man has like lights and buttons and bobbles and printers.  And like when you when you turn out the lights, it's like that drives Lisa crazy.

Start time: 8302.38
End time: 8306.55
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She does not like it that everything has a light on it these days.  Drives her nuts.

Start time: 8308.44
End time: 8345.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's one of the reasons why I got an additional smart button.  And you can use any kind of smart button, but just tile that into.  I like using a what are those called?  The long ones, surge protectors.  Oh, OK. Doing a smart surge protector so you can program certain things like  I don't actually love when our Wi-Fi goes off, but it's plugged in down there, too.  So I turn the LED off on the ear.  I plug that into the surge protector.  But then I did the surge protector.  So only certain of the outlets are turned off.  And then I created a button.  It sounds like a lot. Jeff is yawning.  But now when you walk in,

End time: 8367.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You give the guests a button and you're like, hey, the lights bother you.  Boom. And in this case, you get an open close sensor.  It's whatever I have lying around at the time.

Start time: 8367.62
End time: 8371.92
Speaker: Ant Pruitt

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's count. I was just curious.  One thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, one thousand four, one  thousand five. So five seconds. That's not the end of the world.  It's pretty long, though.  I mean, I have some latency in my Hue lights, but it's about a second or two.  It's not five seconds. Right.

Start time: 8392.40
End time: 8400.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's a again, the Roku stuff I showed you last week.  That's what you're seeing right there today.  That's the Roku and the close sensor.

Start time: 8400.54
End time: 8403.64

Start time: 8403.78
End time: 8412.64

I believe online experiences are meaningful  replacements for in-person experiences.  Old farts, 19 percent.  Kids, 50 percent say they believe that online experiences  are meaningful replacements for in-person experiences.  So all the old farts are out there getting appalled right now.

Start time: 8552.06
End time: 8570.17
Speaker: Leo Laporte
