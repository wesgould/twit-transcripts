Hey, Kevin, good to have you.  Hi there, nice to see you again.  Our honorary regular.  He's of the Irregulars, the Twig Irregulars.  Jeff Jarvis is...  Yeah, we love having you.  Jeff Jarvis is also here.  Always.  Where are you in Brussels, Bruxelles?  Brussels.  I flew in this morning, spoke this afternoon, I fly back tomorrow.  Is this where the sprouts are?  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Brussels.  I flew in this morning, spoke this afternoon, I fly back tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this where the sprouts come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that comes from some strange nuclear reactor somewhere.  They're not made in nature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we know which side you fall on in the Brussels sprouts debate.  Oh, God, I cannot stand that.  Isn't it funny?  I love Brussels sprouts.  Lisa hates them too.  I do too.  I love them.  Gina, you love them too?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I embrace the healthy foods.  I like Brussels sprouts.  Yes.  Gina Trippani is in Brooklyn.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Still with the panel in, Gina.  What happened?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't have a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Still in my mom's basement.  Yeah, you know, we got the internet hooked up, but you know, the reality of doing construction

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  in a home with an 18-month-old baby who has to nap during the day kind of sank in.  I love it.  A blogger who's actually in her mom's basement.  I'm actually in my mom's basement, so it's going to be a couple more weeks before we're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in the new place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you can enjoy the new place.  I love it.  Gina, my kids got so used to the hammering that when it left, they couldn't sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's all the noise, Daddy.  The noise stopped.  Now the scary monsters are going to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's good to have all of you here.  We were all talking about house of cards, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is the geek topic of the hour, of the week, of the year.  But no spoilers.  We won't do that to you.  I get so...  You know, you say the same thing.  I get so...  No spoilers.  We won't do that to you.  I get so...  You know, you say the slightest thing.  Yes.  And I will get hate tweets for days.  People are very...  I don't blame them.  I mean, I wouldn't want to give away the ending of it or anything.  But the thing is, there needs to be a statute of limitations.  There is none.  We discussed this, and there is none, as far as I can tell.  And there should be.  Now it's true detective time, right?  Because the last episode of True Detective is on Sunday.  And the debate rages of whether this is a crap show or a great show.  And I'm not sure myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I so couldn't bear McConaughey's Oscar speech that I don't care how good the show is.  People were saying, well, he's a good actor.  But I just cannot bear the guy.  I just can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was the strangest speech.  And declaring yourself...  Your hero.  Your hero is very odd.  But I give him a lot of slack because I just love the guy.  I thought he was brilliant in Dallas Buyers Club, deserved the Oscar.  And I'm really liking him in True Detective.  But anyway, how do we get...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't he not on next season?  Right.  I think that was the rumor I saw right as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think Woody Harrelson will be there either.  Oh, wow.  But the real debate is, is it just a police procedural in ghosts' clothing?  Or is it actually going to be something different and weird?  And we really won't know until the last episode, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I should be watching this.  You should watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really good in the beginning, although some say slow, but dramatically interesting.  And the acting is just wonderful.  Do you watch Banshee?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Howard Stern said he liked it, and I just started watching it.  I never heard of it.  Cinemax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I don't get skin of Cinemax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I don't either, but I bought it on the Play Store.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, I'll have to check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I need airplane watching.  I need things I can download.  Yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, I think we live in a brave new world where I think that these long form episodic  television shows, dramatic episodic television shows are Dickensian in ways.  They're like Dickens novels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It also reminds me of my days as a TV critic because I used to have to watch the miniseries  straight on through.  The worst torture of my entire career was AD.  I don't even remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was it about Jesus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it was kind of horrid Rome's Caligula with no sex.  It was the most incredibly boring thing on earth.  Caligula with no sex, what's the point?  I think I had to watch 17 hours.  Oh, God.  24 hours, 24 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I interviewed, because I've sung the praises of this book, it's by a guy, Brett Martin,  who writes for GQ and New Yorker and Vanity Fair.  He's a features writer, but he wrote a book about the Sopranos and he calls it the third  golden age of television.  And he says he's very grateful that he's not a television critic because of, for that very  reason.  Especially now, you'd have to watch, you know, Sopranos you could watch maybe one or two  or three episodes, however many they produced before the opening.  But now you'd have to watch the entire house of cards before you could review it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That'd be tough.  And I used to have to fight to get episodes of things and scream at publicists.  And I would scrape together and not have enough to review.  And now you can do it the way people ought to do it, which is, hey, I never saw Ben.  She just looked at it.  Wow, it looks interesting.  Here's what I think.  You could do that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And buy the whole thing.  So I guess we could mention the Oscars.  Since there is a Google angle in this, Samsung paid a considerable amount of money.  I think it was one point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do we know what the business deal was?  And was she paid for it or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what I read in the Wall Street Journal.  And I think they probably have some good sources.  First of all, Samsung bought five minutes of TV time on the Academy Awards.  That's worth about 20 million dollars at one point eight million dollars per half minute.  When Ellen said, you know, it'd be fun to do a selfie.  The producers, the ABC producers said, oh, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And she initiated that during the rehearsal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was her idea to do it as content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, she said she wanted to do selfies throughout.  She's huge on Twitter.  She's very active on Twitter generally.  She's very kind of connected to the digital.  She said, I want to do selfies throughout the show with celebrities.  And then it sounds like Samsung said, oh, OK.  Well, she used her iPhone backstage.  Yeah, she or her team, we don't know who.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those weren't service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was her assistant had the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the question.  She has a team.  You know, I was such a sad thing when I learned that George Takei, Mr.  Sulo does not create his own social media entries.  He's speaking at South by.  I hope somebody asks him about that.  And I would imagine that anybody as big as Ellen.  In fact, her Twitter handle is not Ellen DeGeneres.  It's the Ellen Show.  So there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's definitely her writers show.  It's people.  It's her people.  Yeah.  It's funny. It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's her YouTube channel is perhaps one of the most watched YouTube channels.  It's right up there because people want to see the clips and stuff in any event.  So she wanted to do the selfie.  The Journal says the ABC producers said, well, can you use this Galaxy Note 3?  I could barely lift that is huge.  And the nice thing about the three is very distinctive.  As soon as she lifted it up, I saw the white pleather with the stitching and the size of it.  I said, right.  Lisa, I said, no, three.  I knew immediately.  And then and I imagine quite a few geeks did.  And then apparently a Samsung representative was brought in to train her how to use it.  The first selfie she shot right at the beginning was all blurry.  But then you've got to admit inspired moment when she gets, you know, these great movie stars to gather.  But it was funny how she didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bradley wanted to take the picture.  She's like three times started trying to stop.  And I'm thinking, does she get paid more if she takes the picture?  No, is it copyright?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's well, believe it or not, there have been blog posts that because Cooper took the picture, it is his.  Not hers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Discussion about about the copyright.  Yeah, Vivian Schiller, who's now an executive of Twitter, was speculating about that on on Twitter.  Did you also see the saddest picture on Earth?  I just put it up on the on the rundown chat.  Liza Minnelli trying to get in.  Oh, it's the saddest thing on Earth.  Oh, where did you put it?  I mean, I got to find it on the on the rundown chat to the side.  It's I put the link saddest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I don't see it.  I don't see it there.  There.  Where did you see it?  You know, return.  There it is.  There it is.  Buzzfeed.  So she she was a few rows back.  Ellen was sitting on Meryl Streep's lap.  Oh, this is like one of them Buzzfeed GIFs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, as you go down there, there it is.  The blue dress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, she's standing there, but you can't see her because she's four foot tall.  She's trying to crane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's funny because she went there's an Oscar Oscar winning actress from 12 years of Slave Lupita is in the back there.  Her brother was in the front.  He got really got the exposure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I wasn't making a leap as if she'd known her for decades.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's Hollywood.  You know, ever been to the Oscars, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Backstage. Yeah.  Covered him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I figured I had to wear a tux.  Must be quite the scene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this was so many years ago.  My children, it wasn't quite the scene it is now.  Oh, come on.  It was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Huge ratings, huge tweets.  Oh, I don't know what the current count is.  It was close to three million retweets of that selfie yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, three point two million.  Wow.  One point eight million favorites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The most the most retweeted of all time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, like blew away Barack Obama's most retweeted by by a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder what Ellen DeGeneres is cloud score now is.  And if anybody cares or no.  I did see a heat map, actually, on Klout's blog.  Of course, here's the impact of three million retweets on your cloud score.  So there's the tweet.  There's the people in it.  I love Jared Leto, who's trying to get in there.  Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A shame that Angelina Jolie's face is partially blocked, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a Kevin Spacey's doing the weirdest photo bomb in there.  There's Lupita way in the back.  Anyway, her cloud score.  Here's the heat map.  So this is supposedly an animated gif.  So when when she does the tweet, watch the explosion as as she gets retweeted,  it suddenly goes nuclear.  That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The West Coast took a little time to catch up there.  Yeah, we're three hours running from the east.  Yeah, it was live.  Yeah.  But people are still eating dinner and it's early on the on the West Coast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually was not there.  I was you know, she said, OK, every retweet this, we'll see if we can break the record.  And I was I got sucked into it.  I almost did.  I totally did it. I was like, did you?  Absolutely. Ellen told me to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ellen is my spirit guide, man.  I'm on a bad thing.  Oh, yeah, I would do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Basically, whatever Ellen says I would do.  Yeah, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I remember going to see her in San Francisco when she was a little known comic  and had these long discursive stories that were just I thought hysterical.  But I've seen her do the other at the other cafe in San Francisco.  Wow, that's that's quite something.  She said triumphantly, we broke Twitter, not realizing that's not an accomplishment.  Everybody does.  I've broken Twitter.  You've broken. Everybody's broken.  Whatever. Yeah.  Hadn't had a fail well in a while, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Wall Street Journal conjectured that this was perhaps more valuable than the Samsung ads on the Oscar.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.  Was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it got news coverage to every every local TV station was putting it up there.  The the earned, as they say, coverage was huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like the greater value is making selfies a legitimate sort of cultural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my God. They're already President Obama did it with with Angela Merkel.  I mean, or whoever the Danish prime minister.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was no Samsung hashtag.  Nobody except us is going to look at the back of that phone.  That's right. And know what it's a Samsung phone.  It was clear that it was not an iPhone.  Right. Because you can kind of tell.  I feel like I'm trying to channel a normie as Chad was calling him last night on all that Android and normal.  You know, I would know it's not an iPhone.  It looked big, right? Big and white.  She had a white suit on it kind of kind of matched.  But, yeah, I don't know. I don't know if it was a good thing for Samsung.  I thought it was interesting that she hashtagged the first photo blurry, which I felt like was her kind of way to kind of make make fun of the fact that it was blurry.  I don't know how much that helped Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There have been a lot of it's a meme now.  There have been a lot of animated gifs.  This is they live.  I'm sorry.  There's a there's one with Kevin Spacey and all the faces.  If Bradley's arm was longer, he did get the copyright, though.  Three point two million retweets, one point eight million favorites.  That's pretty amazing.  Now, I just put up also on that's the other one.  Now, that's the first one.  She needed more training, apparently.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, does that have a hashtag or anything?  Does that say?  No, none of it says Samsung.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think she could.  That would have been.  Secondly, there are FTC laws about this, that if it was paid for, you got to reveal it.  If it just came along as value add to buying five commercials and the second most expensive event you can buy, then I think it's less paid placement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think I think I think that that proves that she did not get any any extra.  Well, here's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does she get did the host get paid to host the Oscars?  Yeah.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Work pay the host the way that of course it's a job.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a lot of work.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's also, you know, spotlight.  I presume they got paid.  Yeah.  Did she get paid extra to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a union event.  She got paid.  They donated money to her charities.  Samsung did that after that selfie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, that's right.  Because she gave away Samsung Galaxy Notes on her show to everybody in the audience and announced that Samsung was going to give a buck per retweet up to three million dollars to her charity.  So three million dollars was raised.  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Twitter put up put up a chart, which I put this in also in the rundown, the anatomy of a tweet, one tweet, 13,000 embeds, 2.4 million retweets at the time, 8.1 million saw it.  And then it has this other weird stat.  I've been going back and forth with Twitter, 32.8 million total views.  And I'm saying to Twitter, I don't understand the difference between that and people who saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, those are unique, 8.1 million.  And then the total views, each of them looked at it roughly four times.  Well, but that doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is not like a pass along for a magazine.  Well, but no, that's like saying I saw the New York Times on the kitchen counter.  My wife moved to the couch.  I saw it again.  Thus, I saw it twice.  It's not like a pass along rate of more people seeing it, which is what you do with a magazine like People magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the point is, it's reinforcement.  It's reinforcement.  So it's like multiple impressions of an ad.  Right.  So it gets more baked into your head if you see it four times and you see it once, which is one of the things that they say the reason that people buy more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we count impressions and we count uniques and they're two different things.  That's not unfair.  But boy, you know, Vivian Schiller's posting it.  I'm just trying to figure it out.  Yeah, no, that's how it's kind of done in digital advertising anyway.  I understand maybe not for circulation purposes, but in digital advertising, you count both uniques and impressions.  And clearly this is very good for Twitter's monetization strategy.  Oh, yeah.  They're going.  Then what?  I mean, I can see why Vivian Schiller's read is tweeting this because they had to be they had to be hooted that night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like, yes, I'm some paid her money and we got all these people.  Yeah, I think I think Gina's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was less Samsung and more in selfies and Twitter.  Twitter got probably the most promotion out of this.  Right.  Not that they need it.  But how much would Bradley, how much would Bradley have paid for Bradley Horowitz paid for them to say, OK, everybody Google plus this.  People would have said, what?  Why didn't you mean tweet it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter and celebrities has always been one of the things that Twitter really did right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although early Google search is now going to let you vote for American Idol.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Facebook will offer real time voting with progress updates.  So American Idol, not to show it was at one time there in the 13th season, a little bit less popular.  But now you can.  So let me let me actually let me let me do this.  Let me do the search.  Visit Google and search for American Idol or Idol during the voting window.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So let's try it here during.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if we're in the voting window.  No, no, no.  But we will be.  We will be.  It does.  I wonder if does it know your time zone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it adjusts?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, this is it.  I get a sponsored box at the top of the search results.  This is that thing we were talking about where there's the knowledge graph on the top of the search results.  Where there's the knowledge graph on the right.  But there's the sponsored box and says American Idol airs tonight on Fox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At least it isn't a giant image, although it could be.  The knowledge graph is a big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and let me show you what you will get during the voting opportunity.  You're going to get all the contestants and you're going to get to vote, I guess, by clicking their heads.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really?  And Google enforcing unique votes and everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, they don't care about unique votes in American Idol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't care as many as you 50 per contestant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you're a lot of people.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you but they all think what they care about is geolocation demographics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's much more valuable than a text message because it helps them plan the tours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where we get a lot of votes, that's where we're going to send Dexter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because a few years ago when I was at BT, we built a to show off our mobile dialing API.  We put a vote on American Idol app for Facebook.  So you would you would go there during the show and you'd say, I want to vote for these people four times each.  And it would do the dialing for you and make it work.  And there were two things about this.  One was we had that built.  The other thing is we then actually had a really good statistical sample of people.  And so we could predict the votes for next week, which was kind of fun.  The Australian we could place bets, which was kind of a shame.  But were you pretty accurate?  Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We got we got a few thousand people voting.  That was enough to get a reasonable sample.  But eventually they told us to stop because they because we were all the dialing was coming from our outbound access number.  And they said, no, no, we actually want the area codes.  Right. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. It's amazing. It's amazing.  If you're good at manipulating this stuff, it's just a brave new world for marketers and and researchers and data and all that stuff.  It's amazing. Speak.  Speaking of Samsung, it's a little windy out there, I guess.  Two new Samsung Chromebooks.  Wait a minute. Let me pass.  Honest. Yeah, sure.  That's your story. Go ahead. Stick to it.  Two new Samsung Chromebooks. In fact, very interesting.  They're going to make them pleather or at least one of them.  Let me see if I can find it.  I got to get the link.  Do you have it there?  I can't. For some reason, I can't click this link.  There it is.  There'll be one of them will be Exynos powered.  Oh, maybe all of them will be Exynos powered.  Eleven point six inches and thirteen point three inches.  Yeah, faux leather finish starting at three nineteen.  These are the mid. I think these are the start.  We'll have to see when we get them.  But I think this is perhaps the mid range Chromebook we've been asking for a little bit more.  The only thing I want. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only thing I want is LTE. I want I want cell connectivity with them.  Oh, I'm sure that I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Greedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can use your phone for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true. You could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pain in the butt. I just opened the machine and it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're both based on Samsung's own ARM chip, the Exynos.  They'll both have four gigs of RAM, which is probably the primary way they can be important.  Yeah, that could that's mid range.  There's the eleven inches, thirteen sixty six by seven sixty eight.  But the thirteen inch is a 1080p display, 1920 by 1080.  Not touch eight hours battery life.  Three nineteen ninety nine and three ninety nine ninety nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, maybe the thing about this, Leo, is that back in the glory days of Dell,  I could have gotten the machine I wanted.  I could have said I want a touch screen and I want LTE and I want four gigs.  And you know, whatever happened to those wonderful days where you could customize your machine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, these are these are not these are the opposite of the four three pixel.  These are 16 nine screens. They're wide screens.  That's interesting. Are the other Chromebooks aren't wide like that, right?  I don't think so. No, this looks like Samsung just loves that stitched faux leather.  Yeah, I don't get that. I think some of them maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, the thing is that screens that shape are cheaper because they're used for TV.  So is that why? Oh, so they make more sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like the wide screen. I don't mind the wide screen.  But Jeff, what's the tablet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't like it on the laptop because because it's the wrong shape for text.  But you could have side by side documents, couldn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or can you? What's the slowdown with on the Chrome on the Chromebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like, what's where do you where are you feeling like you need to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Feeling like you need more to get to get to get versus four gigs,  at least when I had the original Samsung, it would just hang up with too many tabs.  As soon as you had more than a number of tabs, you had too many tabs.  And four gigs, four gigs made all the difference in the world.  And four gigs works. And I don't know why to keep on putting out two gig Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, my son is too big a ram to run a browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He pinched your pixel. So he was in the old Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then he borrowed the pixel one day and it hasn't come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're a nicer dad than I am. Yeah. Better not pinch my pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I got the back pros. Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK. But what's what I think what's telling is that your son wanted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he had he had well, he originally got a Windows machine because he wanted to  he had a particular thing he needed for speech and debate and he wanted to game on it.  And then when he broke that, I gave him the Chromebook.  I say, OK, well, hang on to you can use this.  And he actually liked it. And he said the advantage is that he's not tempted to go off  and do other things as much as he was on the on the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he's a school school thing. Very wise child. That is wise. Yeah.  Is this the one that's going to Cambridge or the younger one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's the younger one. My son is on a Cambridge.  He's at King's College London and Christopher's got various offers.  We're still waiting to hit to here.  So we're in that tense period where different universities send us things and we're like,  that's exciting. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  King's College is not is no no no small time either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So King's College London Andrews King's College London doing English and and theater and film and stuff.  And Christopher is applying for economics at various places.  Oh, my. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's very important to start planning for the old age home and and who's going to pay for it.  So this is always timely.  Samsung has released a couple of YouTube videos on the Galaxy Gear and Gear Fit, as well as the Galaxy S5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's a question for you. Will the gear work with non-Samsung phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no. However, a wider range of Samsung phones in the original.  I don't. Yeah, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I get it for the first generation just because they had to control it enough.  But when you have supposedly Google and Apple coming out with them to limit it that much, I don't understand from a business perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can promise you the Apple will only work with iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but that's that's its own little world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And and and the only one that's completely cross platform right now is the Pebble.  So that advantage Pebble on that and they also has the best battery life.  But it doesn't do as much as the gear.  It's gorgeous. Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think the Google will work with an iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's an interesting question. That's an interesting question.  That's a very good question. I think if you're Google, it should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And, you know, I'm not so sure on the Apple either, because, you know, iPods work with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no. Apple. No, I promise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you're right. But but I could I could argue that Apple's feeling a little closed in and needs to get back into the lives and bodies of other people.  No, there'd be chattering down below.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If Apple ever makes anything that works with Android, that seems highly chattering down below.  What does that mean? It's frozen in hell. It's just a very long way.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  I thought that was a little obscure. I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I was getting talking private parts.  Chattering down below.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what happens after your pencil gets fixed. I mean, your pixel gets pinched.  Let's take a break.  We have the changelog still to come. Now that Gene is back.  We didn't do a changelog last week. We just said, screw it.  It's hallowed ground. We can't do it. It's hallowed ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's unflattered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's getting into the real estate market.  And Bing books. Get ready for the Bing book.  Plus, I don't this just broke this.  Bing bingled.  Bing bingled. The guy who created the Scroogled campaign is now director is now in charge of strategy of Microsoft.  Mark Penn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you see he collects the strategy tax. He's a strategy tax inspector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. He also came up with one of the worst.  We were talking about this on Windows Weekly.  One of the worst current television campaigns, the Microsoft honestly campaign in which you go to Microsoft.com slash honestly.  You can see these ads. They're airing everywhere now in which people say honestly.  No, honestly, Windows isn't that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, my God. Oh, painful to watch.  Yeah, it's sad.  The entire premise of our ad is either that someone else is worse or we're not that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where'd your respect go, Microsoft?  But this is a Mark Penn. Mark Penn created.  You've seen the one with the teacher who says, I don't like computers.  Here. Here. I'll just play a little bit of it.  Oh, you can't hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little old fashioned. I love chalk and erasers, but change is coming.  Yeah, I don't like this.  This is so awful.  It was so awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't really like computers, but I guess if I have to use them, I'll use these strange tablets from Microsoft because that's what we got.  The un-computer.  Anyway, that's the there's this whole bunch of these. Honestly, I couldn't.  How's this for a stunning, a stunning recommendation?  I couldn't find a reason not to buy it.  That's a triple negative now.  Honestly, I could.  I needed a laptop and a tablet and I was confused.  So I don't love change.  I couldn't find a reason not to buy it.  Honestly.  So anyway, this guy's now in charge of like dinosaurs, isn't it?  It's very strange.  But, you know, I mean, one thing Mark Penn, this is what Paul Theroux pointed out, and I think it's true.  Maybe Mary Jo Foley.  Mark Penn was known for when he was a pollster for the Hillary Clinton campaign was data and he's very data driven.  And so it's my presumption is that both the Scroogled campaign and the Isley campaign come from research on, you know, what people are thinking about Windows and so forth and responding directly to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say someone else in one of the features, one of the features on someone else said that he, you know, he picks his data selectively to make himself look good in the Hillary world.  You know, I'm a Hillary voter.  He was controversial, too, because the 3 a.m. campaign.  He didn't humanize Hillary enough.  There were other.  He was fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was fired halfway through the primary for a reason.  For a reason.  Well, he's found he's found a home.  We're going to take a break.  Come back with more.

Transcript:  And when I had I had a really good steak tartare plate, went to this place that had different  tartars and the one I had had was loaded with anchovies and the anchovies were not salty.  They were sweet.  Fresh anchovies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I also will admit that I now have my.  Tom's.

I don't know where her timers are her measuring cups.  I've been using Google search, the voice search to set timers and to say, you know, how many ounces in a cup and I get those search results.  I my wife laughs at me because I'm you know, I'm like, I got to search for mom's measuring cups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  I don't think it just happens.  I think you have to turn it on to I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't believe so.  I'm not actually not running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't imagine they would just put that on by default.  It would freak people.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, no, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're right.  So I'm looking at the I'm looking at the screen on the Google Chrome blog.  And so when you first get this and you go to Google dot com, there's a little pop up that says, hey, say, OK, Google to start a voice search.  And there's a button that says enable enable.  OK, Google.  So you'd have to you have to click the button enabled.  OK, Google.  So, yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I am enabled.  Oh, it says, sorry, this experiment is not available on your platform.  Oh, that's the app launcher.  No, that's Chrome for Chrome.  Let me search.  I'm just searching for voice.  That's the only one I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the little microphone kind of fills in.  It's hollow when it's not when it's not enabled and it fills in what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, chat room, find us the link.  I know it's Chrome colon slash slash flags.  And then there's like a hashtag that would give me directly to it.  Let's find that so we can enable it.  I don't see it here.  And I'm on the I'm on the I'm the beta channel on the latest today.  Version thirty four dot zero dot eighteen forty seven dot forty five beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is February 27th.  And they said the next few days so that you should have it.  So when you go to when you go to Google dot com, do you see the you see the  microphone in the search box?  Yeah.  And it's filled in or it's hollow.  It's hollow.  OK, OK.  It's like that. Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I click on it, it works.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you click on it, it works.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mom's measuring measuring cups.  At Kmart, apparently.  Go back to Google.  Go back to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the first update to the Hangouts app for iOS since they released it in  November.  This adds video messages and animated stickers and just basically redesigns the  app for iOS.  New loading screen and menus, cleaner look, different typography, the kind of  flat iOS seven design.  You can now attach a map to your current location, your conversation, your  conversation, which is something that has been available on Android for a while.  You can also record and send video messages up to 10 seconds long in Hangouts  for iOS.  So that's definitely a welcome update for iOS users.  We were using Hangouts at work and my coworker said that the experience on iOS  just was not good at all.  So that's good.  I'm glad to see that.  It's not crazy about Android either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It still mixes Hangout and text in a way that just the UI just doesn't work for  me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't feel like Hangouts is quite, you know, it has been the universal  messaging platform of our dreams.  I'm hoping that it's going to get there, right?  But it's not quite.  I'm still running Google Voice and Hangout separately.  And yeah, the way it intermingles text messages, but hopefully we'll get there.  I have a big problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm getting spammed by attractive girls.  And I put that in air quotes because I know that they're probably, in fact, I know  they're not.  They're bots.  And they say, hi.

And I don't use it as SMS, but I just, if I go to Hangouts and look at invites or  highs, cause you can't block those.  You can't say only let people on my list.  See, Martine, Martine, you're not going to get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How others get in touch with you.  Here are your choices.  Everyone else, I can either have hang out with me or invite only.  Yeah.  So I'm getting invites.  There's no way to say I don't want invites for somebody who's not in my circles.  See what I'm saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought I implied, oh, I thought I implied only you could invite them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they can invite you, my friend.  And they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was interesting.  So I've gotten a ton of invites, but I haven't gotten any of the notifications for them.  And I definitely shut this down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I did turn off notifications because I was getting a lot of them.  But now, but that doesn't mean you still don't get invites and they don't show up in other spots.  And they certainly show up in your hangouts.  And I have to explain to my girlfriend that I don't really know Linda Lopez.  And I don't know why she's wearing her underwear or why she messaged me the words, L-U.  Seriously, Lisa, I never met that woman.  I don't know.  Should I add her too?

And if I didn't have an understanding girlfriend, well, I do have an ex-wife, so there may be that explains it.  This could be embarrassing to people, right?  If somebody didn't understand, why are you getting all these invitations from attractive young women?  Right?  I would have a problem.  So stop it, Google.  I don't know them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Plus for Android updated with new photography enhancements.  Yay.  Nice.

You've seen them before from Snapseed.  A couple of interface tweaks, such as a new view all option, which displays your entire photo library, local photos and cloud photos in one central interface.  And there's a new option to quickly view photos by date.  There's like a there's a slider and you can.  That's a biggie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  In fact, we were talking about this last night and all my Android.  I literally started going through my photos and lost track of the show because I was like, oh, look, the baby was so little, you know, a year ago.

Transcript:  It's three a.m. Did I miss the show?  Yeah, very easy to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And last thing, the Google Now launcher, which shipped on the Nexus five is now in the Play Store and it's available to all the Nexus and Google Play Edition devices.  So the Nexus four, Nexus seven, Nexus ten and Google Play Edition device owners like me, my HEC one Google Play Edition.  You can go to the Play Store.  You can download the the Google Now launcher.  It is exactly the APK that you may have sideloaded, which is kind of available everywhere.  It gives you Google Now.  If you swipe to the right, it gives you wallpapers and a couple of different way to kind of organize your widgets.  It's really nice launcher.  In fact, it's my default launcher now because I like it so much.  It gives you some transparency in the status bar.  Really nice.  So it's pretty limited still just Nexus and Google Play Edition devices.  But really nice option if you got one of those devices, you don't have to feel left behind by the Nexus five.  That's all I've got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know, Chad, you were a little, little slow on the update on that one.

Transcript:  So this auto download or?  Yeah, an auto download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's an update.  You get an update to Motorola Spotlight, which is not an app.  So I don't know how exactly to launch it.  But at this one, you have a flashlight.  So the way these work is they're sensitive to the accelerometer in the phone.  And as you move the phone around, it advances the story.  It's got music and stuff.  It's really, they're really cute.  I really like them.  But I don't have that.  I don't know.  I don't know how to launch it now.  It's frustrating.  I know it's in there.  You know, whenever you don't want it, the hat would just float in and out all the time.  Maybe I disable.  But no, I saw the little bug and then I didn't click it in time and it went away.  So I guess they're sensitive to it all.  I guess we could go to YouTube and watch it, but it's not quite the same as getting to play with it as you aim the flashlight.  Here is from Ian Heath via Mike Elgin, a Lego version of Ellen's selfie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  That's special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Taking on a life of its own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What?  What?  I just installed this new thing and it messed up my layout.  Oh.  And it's given me one fewer row of icons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Google Now launcher?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, put it on the Nexus 7.  It's like a dead row of icons that I can't put things into anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  The Nexus 7 does not have a bottom row.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does have a bottom row, but it's like they were laid out in a particular way and they've all been scrambled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because you put a different launcher.  Go back to your old launcher.  Right.  Or does it replace your launcher?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's replaced my launcher.  Oh, so you can choose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it said import your import the icons.  Oh, it didn't do it.  Import where they were.  It just like.  Are you coming from the old Google launcher?  Yeah, it just poured them in at the top.  It's like my spatial memories all gone bad.  Oh, I hate it when that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I led you astray.  What's it called?  Is it just called Google launcher?  Yeah, I just think that launcher, but I don't see it on here.  Maybe I can't put it on a Moto X.  I thought that was the point that you could put on anything now.  Yeah, it's Nexus and Google Play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you can be Nexus.  OK, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google Now launcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Now launcher.  Yeah, I get a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do have a choice.  Yes.  That's what I thought.  You can go back to your old not your old.  What's the opposite of now?  Google then.  You Google then launcher.  Google then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Launcher.  Just plain launcher.  Launcher.  I haven't looked at launcher in forever.  I'm going to switch back to launcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to just tidy this desktop up actually, because it's a bit of a mess.  I use it.  I use it.  It did.  It took a row of things off and put on the next screen, which is kind of weird.  Bad.  And I've got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is totally different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I've got a bunch of nice widgets on my other screens, which is eight.  So this is definitely a step backwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And thanks to Kevin Marks for sitting along David Cameron's tweet.  I've been speaking.  Can you say it in a posh, poncy British accent as David Cameron might say it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He says, I've been speaking to Barack Obama on the telephone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then there's a picture of him very seriously.  Can you can you get this on the telephone?  I don't think he's really talking to Barack Obama in that shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is reposed.  It's so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very old telephones.  I've been speaking to Barack Obama about the situation in Ukraine.  Hello, Barack.  It's David.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And people are now making fun of this.  Oh, this is going to be a meme.  People holding phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think we should submit it to Shutterstock.  It could be a great stock photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what that's speaking to Ellen on the phone about the situation.  Quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody tweet that.  Oh, oh, world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Speaking on the phone of Verizon about the situation.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's a mean.  It's quick.  Start the Tumblr.  I've been speaking on the phone.  It's better than Biner's full of women.  I was speaking to Hitler about the Hitler video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The era phone, A-R-A, is that how you pronounce it?  This is the phone, the kind of Aura.  You say Aura?  Yeah, the modular phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've been saying Aura on all about Android.  Yeah, well, that's you get to decide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the part of Motorola mobility that didn't go off to Lenovo.  And for the first time, we've seen a demo of it.  This was at the launch event.  Jason Calacanis's launch event last week.  Paul Aramenco from Google demonstrated it and showed off prototypes, but non-functional.  So it's just like bricks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they're just sort of like pieces that snap into the back.  Right.  Yeah, they kind of look like Legos.  Yeah, but it seems like it sounds like consumer release early next year.  Wow.  And with a big focus on aesthetics and styles and making your phone look the way you want it.  So Moto Maker like, which surprised me.  I thought we were talking about this last night on all about Android.  Aaron was saying, Aaron Nuka was saying, you know, this is the maker's phone.  But the way that the phone blocks put out a video and it sounds like they're targeting people who really want to customize even the look of their phone as well as the functionality.  So what's your bet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Will these things ever be on Verizon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on, Jeff, get real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If we have a special Verizon module, it'll be like much bigger.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The point of it is very cheap.  Fifty dollars to get started.  So I mean, it's really is Wi-Fi only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very basic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  But then you could then but that gives you the endoskeleton, which you can then add more stuff.  It comes to the display low end CPU, a Wi-Fi module, small built in battery runs Android.  But then as your budget allows, you can add modules to it, which is, I think, a really interesting idea.  The modules are hot swappable so you don't have to shut down.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cool.  And if you think about these devices as something more than phones, you know, if you want to build your own baby monitor or you want to with the video, somebody to attach one of the bottom of a skateboard to map, you know, their route or if you think of them as a Wi-Fi connected device that's modular and that's interesting, get all sorts of different sensors.  You can use them for anything.  It's kind of like, you know, a more consumer friendly, I guess, Arduino in a way.  So it's not just a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really is.  So I see what Aaron's saying.  It's a maker thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  And it also means you're not going to be throwing out people like us throwing out phones every every nine months.  But imagine that you're on the phone and it crumbles in your hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The parts fall.  My phone's falling apart.  Wait a minute.  Let me put it back together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, how much time do we spend with our phones like this?  You know, anymore.  We don't.  Right.  We can use them for other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's best not to think of this as a phone, but to think of this as a device in the Internet of Things as a as a thing that's connected that you could do stuff.  I mean, I think this is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Running Android with lots of different apps, lots of different things, depending on what sensors that you have.  You know, it's kind of one of those.  It's a little bit one of those catch all like it can do anything.  But what would I use it for?  Anything.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anything.  Will come out of the maker community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could put it on my mother's measuring cups and they will call me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a Google Wave problem.  You know, it's like it's everything and nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think that I think, though, that we are in a mature enough environment in the maker world, thanks to Raspberry Pi and the match modules and all these other things that people understand that a connected device, configurable device has all sorts of wonderful uses and they will use these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there is there a consumer market device like that yet?  Is this the first one?  This is the first maker consumer device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it's pretty easy.  I mean, let's say, OK, your kid and you like that.  I think this sounds like it'd be easy enough.  What is that snap together thing?  Yeah.  For the kids.  But imagine, OK, so my kid and dad and father and son, we want to make a balloon that'll do aerial photography.  Well, you just get one of these.  You put a camera module on it.  You put it in the thing and you go, there's all sorts.  I mean, I think that that is this is very intriguing.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like we need a GPS.  We need an accelerator and we need a camera.  Yeah.  Or we want a better camera or we want, you know, whatever, a different camera kind of camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just it's not excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somewhat specialized market, but not that not so much.  And boy, you know, we always just at the Makers Maker magazine on Thursday and we got the tour and stuff.  And it's just what's interesting is how they tapped into something and it just grew like Topsy almost instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The first thing I'm excited about this is that you now get an aftermarket for the guts of the phone.  Yes.  Right.  That's what that's what's amazing is now it's it's become open source hardware.  It's it's it's what Chris Anderson's been arguing.  People are arguing as hardware is the next frontier.  I don't know if I buy that yet, but it's an exciting opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but if the Internet of Things is really going to be a thing, then the Google has to have a position and a stake in it.  It's not going to be glass.  It's fifteen hundred dollars.  It's not even going to be a Google watch.  Much better to have a generic vanilla thing that you can use to prototype ideas.  And maybe you're right.  Maybe Jeff become a market as well.  I love this idea.  This is what exactly what Google should be doing to me.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, the thing is, you can already buy lots of bits and pieces that do certain things like this.  You can buy little cameras that sticks the wall or you can buy extra screens and things like and so on.  And the question is, can you make these these sort of pluggable modules cheap enough to make cheaper than buying one of those outright?  Right.  If he's not yet it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think it's more than that, Kevin.  I think it also creates it creates a framework for devices.  And so now, you know, you just you know, you go to the store as you would say, our store and you you keep buying more of these modules until you have people like us will have 20 modules in five spots for them and will have wives and husbands.  People yelling at us.  If you can get the price down, it'll help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean, fifty dollars to start is how you see the market.  That makes sense.  The Raspberry Pi is twenty five to thirty five dollars.  And that's certainly selling very, very well.  It's Tinker Toy Phone.  Somebody said in our chat room.  Tinker Toys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like that.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  A Rector Set.  Yeah.  Heath Kit.  No, it's actually no, it's easier than Heath Kit.  Danny Sullivan calls it SEO's Oreo moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A tweet relating to search engine optimization that is getting as much attention as Oreo's Super Bowl blackout.  Do we remember that last year in the Super Bowl?  Last year in the Super Bowl, the lights went out at the Superdome and Oreo said you could still dunk in the dark.  And it was a huge success for social media marketing.  Yesterday, Matt Cutts announced a new Google Scraper report for publishers to use if they see a site that is scraping their content right on.  It's a big problem.  Of course, immediately people pointed out the kind of Google kind of scraper.  Scraper like you mean like Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was the particular screenshot that was so good as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said, I think I've spotted one, Matt.  Note the similarities in the context.  It was a good point for a joke.  It was very, of course, pointing out that the knowledge graph uses Wikipedia and scrapes it.  Although I would guess that Google has a deal with Wikipedia to do this, right?  Doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wikipedia's content is righteous for reuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  It's a bad example, right?  Because Wikipedia's content is righteous for reuse.  It is, but it's funny.  It always was.  It was very, the screenshot was perfectly timed.  It was funny.  But when he gets down to it, it wasn't a good example.  It's not a legitimate complaint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a big difference too because really the scraper sites are doing is taking Jeff Jarvis's blog post and putting it on their site with ads around it as if they wrote it.  And this happens a lot.  I mean, people are really kind of down with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Google is taking Wikipedia and putting it on their site with ads around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wikipedia's license allows it, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What it does say is that it does highlight how hard it is to do this and to actually write a crawler these days.  That is harder and harder because so many sites blog anything that isn't Google from calling them.  Right.  We, as a technology, we wrote this.  We wrote the crawler that would crawl blogs and do stuff like that.  And we were creating tag pages and things like that that were showing up in Google results.  There was always a slight tension back and forth about will they decide we're a scraper site and throw us out of the results or are we adding value?  So there's a bit of tension there.  The reason.  But the challenge now is it's actually quite hard to write a crawler because so many sites will actually block you directly or require login.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's why we're moving towards social search and others, better forms of search anyway.  Crawling is going to look as antiquated as Yahoo's human editors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, that's the other way around.  I think the call is going to come back as people realize that they're missing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? The social isn't good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Interesting.  Well, as the social stuff gets more and more polluted with like its own weird rankings and its own ad priorities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that's what we're doing was we're just trying to stay ahead of the pollution.  Just try to stay, stay upstream, whatever possible.  The reason Danny Sullivan calls it an Oreo level tweet is because as of as of his writing, 14000 retweets and 12000 favorites for Dan Barker.  That's pretty good.  That's pretty good.  That was within 24 hours.  I wonder what it is now.  Oh, that's Apple calling me from Texas.  Well, I'll take it later.  Long story.  The Mac Pro.  Mac Pro.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so somebody's been calling me from Apple Austin, which is I think where the Mac Pros are made.  So they want to figure out why there's a footprint on my ram.  Google invests a million dollars in getting more female entrepreneurs.  It sounds like a lot of money, but I don't know.  Not much.  Really not much for Google.  It's a million dollar grant to galvanize, which is a Denver co-working hub and a startup center.  They're giving a million dollars to them and others to increase the number of female entrepreneurs by 25 percent.  Galvanize has a program to do that, I guess, to increase the involvement of women.  And there are others, but it's a million dollars not just to galvanize, but to 40 programs worldwide.  So it's kind of they're relatively small grants.  Maybe they're enough, though.  Sometimes they'll ever positioned exactly right.  Can move a mountain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's it's it's it makes a statement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I would hope they would do more even.  Right.  Yeah.  Keep it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Google, Google, we also need more journalistic entrepreneurs.  I'm just talking, just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Google, you could support Internet television broadcasting.  That's a useful thing, too.  You know, a little grant here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Both things at CUNY will do the show.  I want to do that with our students.  We do. We talked with Sarah Bartlett about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've talked with Lisa.  We love that idea.  We're on. All right.  All right. CUNY wants to do more of the kind of stuff.  CUNY, CUNY, CUNY, not CUNY.  CUNY wants to do more of the stuff, the kind of stuff we're doing here in the brick house.  We would like to have a little base of operations in New York, New York.  I hear that's a pretty big city.  And so maybe there's a little synergy possible.  And then we get, you know, and Gina can do her third show.  Gina, get her out of the basement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Get me out of the basement, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get Gina out of her mother's basement.  And ironically, she'll be in CUNY's basement, but that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  CUNY's my alma mater, so.  I graduated CUNY in graduate school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's that program called in the basement there, Jeff?  What's the program called?  I think Sarah said there's a name for it. Maybe not.  It's just some kids in the basement with a camera.  I don't know.  We're going to make up something.  There isn't something there already.  No, we're going to make something new.  Oh, this is something new.  Yeah, because when your dean, Sarah Bartlett, was here,  she mentioned that they really like to, in the School of Journalism at CUNY,  they really like to get kids doing real world journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the other thing is, I actually almost said this on the air.  I'll wait.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Save it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Save it for offline conversation.  Yes.  I'm going to just hush my phone.  Well, the Google barge has found a new home.  This is funny for anybody who knows the Bay Area.  It's moving to Stockton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, why is this funny? I don't get it. Why is this funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's not exactly the headquarters of the world.  Okay.  I think it's inland. Isn't it in the valley?  There's no water in Stockton. That would be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think it's...  There's a lake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can somebody verify this?  I believe Stockton, we call it in the valley, do we not?  Which would imply that it's in a valley.  It's at the tail end of the river.  Oh, there is a port. Okay.  The port of Stockton at the end of a river. Okay.  The San Joaquin River.  It has two miles of dock space.  It's just outside the jurisdiction of the San Francisco Bay Conservation  and Development Commission.  Well, there you go.  That's the advantage. There it is.  So they're going to take that barge and they're going to go all the way up that river to Stockton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they've got to go all the way around through Martinez and the Delta.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if the drought were still on, I wonder whether they could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that that's not really a river. It's a tidal slough.  Yes.  Bay Ship and Yacht is subleasing their pier to Google.  So there goes the barge.  Sometime in the next 24 hours, weather permitting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you need a live coverage of this.  I think you need a drone over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really kind of pathetic.  I don't think there's going to be a huge wave of people heading to Stockton to see Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you need to do a stand up at the empty pier.  I'm standing here in...  ...that they just left or that they are about to arrive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo Laporte from Treasure Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This water used to have the barge. Not anymore.  Good, Gina. Good.  I will do a stand up just for you.  If you were a real TV guy, Leo Laporte, that's what you're doing.  I know. Why am I sitting in a studio? What's wrong with me? I'm unambitious.  The helicoptes chasing the barge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The nice thing with the internet is that you can time it so that the barge is going by you while you're talking.  You can draw your own schedule.  Slowly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, the San Francisco Giants play in AT&T Park was relatively recently built.  Beautiful downtown ballpark in San Francisco. I know you all know it.  And there's a giant Coke bottle. Beautiful, huge Coke bottle out in left field.  And it's got slides in it and the kids can go down it.  The thing is massive. It was made here in Petaluma and barged down the Petaluma River.  And I was in fact there for the barging of the Coke bottle to the ballpark.  Why didn't I do a stand up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's live action television right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just stood there and watched it. Me and the kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you can actually go by canal all the way from Petaluma to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah. That's why Petaluma exists.  We are a finger of the bay that the gold and the lumber and the chicken and the eggs and all that...  Chickens.  Can go right into the...  Chickens.  Is it still a chicken, Capitolio?  No, it's now ducks.  Really?  Yeah, we still have the chicken and eggs... butter and eggs day parade.  We still do that. But in fact...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, layout, layout, layout, layout.  Have you ever dressed up as a chicken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Colin.  They have a contest called the cutest little chicken town  in which parents and their children dresses chickens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want pictures, Chad. I want pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody search for that.  So we were actually in the 1900s, early 1900s.  What was happening is Jews who were being persecuted in Russia by the pogroms, by the Tsar,  were rescued by do-gooders in Northern California.  But all of these Jews were for the most part peasants.  They didn't have any skills.  And they were, what are we going to do with them?  They realized it was a very low capital business.  They could start them up and it was chickens.  Chickens and eggs.  So the whole countryside around here is dotted with these hundred-year-old chicken coops.  Giant chicken coops.  We had two on our old property.  Giant chicken coops.  But as that kind of died out as a business,  we were for a while the number one producer of eggs in California.  But what has survived...  Why am I telling you this?  What is this? A tour? A travelogue?  We have survived as the home of fine, high-quality ducks.  There's a restaurant you could go to, you New Yorkers,  called Petaluma in Manhattan that serves Petaluma duck.  And every duck you get in Chinatown and San Francisco comes from Petaluma.  Liberty Farms up here. Fabulous Peking duck. Yep.  Just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They always look so sad in the window of the Chinese restaurant.  Well, they're dead.  They're dead, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if they're sad or...  The knackers.  Sleeping. It's sleeping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's take a break and talk about something else.  When we come back, that's a dead duck.  Yahoo is turning off Google and Facebook.  We will talk a little bit about Google Maps,  as far as Apple is concerned, with CarPlay.  Android's a big seller worldwide.  And a lot more.  Oh, and the CNN Zeit story.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  I have a yawn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's late where I am.  Your yawn sounded like a yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hey!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Those are going on sale today at Teespring.  Nice!  We liked five...  I don't know how many designs we got, like 20 or 30.  We liked five of them so much that we bought five of them  and we're going to make some other stuff.  But this was the winning...  We had a vote and this was the winning design for the hoodies.  Keep voguing.  More voguing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to see...  Are they voguing?  Come on, guys.  Let's do it.  Strike a pose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we have a woman's sweatshirt too.  So not just a hoodie.  There you go.  Oh, look at that.  They're naturals.  Glenn and Chad.  When do you get the twit underwear?  That could be next.  We always do...  You know, we realize the way to do this...  No, I think Jeff is asking you to do this.  I think Jeff is asking you to model the underwear.  I don't want to...  I am wearing Scott Evest underwear.  Should I show you that?  You already did that.  I already did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK.  Scott Evest has underwear, huh?  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they got little pockets in the boxers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, so you can get wired up.  Get some heat sensors down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was that joke Ellen made about the...  It was very funny about...  You know, the Wolf of Wall Street.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, um...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Something about that.  Yeah, she had a couple of really good ones.  She was funny.  Yeah, she was good.  She was a good host.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've seen it.  Yeah, I liked her.  There you go.  Stop showing that.  There I am in my Scott Evest boxer shorts.  It does not have meat sensors in it.  Is that what you said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no.  That is not what I said by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mom, I'm trying to find your meat sensors.  What drawer do you keep those in?  Anyway, back to the commercial.  So, that's where we got the hoodies.  99designs.com.

What is that story?  Could be it's a threat.  You're saying that thanks to manmade global warming,  my burrito bowl is going to be free of guac?  Could happen.  No.  Really?  Chipotle, in its annual report, said,  In the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw  ingredients, we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items,  such as guacamole or one or more of our salsas,  rather than paying the increased cost for ingredients.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Meanwhile, they added tofu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not going to do it.  They added the sofritas vegan tofu dish.  Actually, we have vegans here in the studio.  One of those two people posing for you is a vegan.  And so I'm sure he's very...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's that, a squeal from you?  You get to guess which one.  It's not the one you're thinking of.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chipotle uses 97,000 pounds of avocado a day.  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember back in the day, there was an avocado glut.  Every doctor in California bought avocado ranches.  Remember that?  See?  It was the great tax dodge.  See?  And doctors and dentists.  Yep.  And so there was a glut of avocados.  Did you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There can never be too many avocados.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although Chipotle's doing 34 million pounds of avocados a year, this story goes on to  say that while the avocado industry is fine at the moment, scientists are expecting drier  conditions which could have an impact on California's crop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That would be sad.  Chipotle's guacamole is serviceable.  It's solid.  Yeah.  It's not.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not fake.  It's an accessory.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's an accessory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so easy to make your own guacamole.  Everybody should go out, get a couple of very nice avocados.  You want them to be a little soft to the touch, not hard, hard, hard, but not mushy, mushy,  mushy.  Look for hollow parts.  You don't want anything.  And then you just cut them in half.  You mash them up with a little salt, some pepper, some garlic, some onions, maybe a  little salsa.  Hot sauce.  A little hot sauce if you want.  And it's a fabulous dish, easy to make and good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Seven years in San Diego.  That was my big takeaway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you get avocados in New York City?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, Fresh Direct, I've been using Fresh Direct a lot because it's just easier.  They didn't deliver to me in San Diego, so it's kind of wonderful.  And like they're great.  Like the avocados are great.  Is that Amazon?  Welcome to the Central Universe, Mr. Benny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that Amazon Fresh Direct or is that something else?  It's just grocery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just a grocery thing.  Grocery shopping for New York City.  In more important Chipotle news perhaps, have you heard about the quesarito?  What?  The burrito wrapped in a cheese quesadilla.  There's a link right below the guacamole crisis link in the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a Chipotle burrito made with a quesadilla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You wrap your burrito in a cheese quesadilla.  All the rage apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sounds like something from epic meal time.  That is disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was not the reaction I was looking for.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why not just wrap that in a piece of pizza?  And then you can deep fry it.  And then deep fry it and put a croissant dough around it.  And call it quesarito.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Put a little bit of duck and then inside a chicken and then inside a turkey.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And then some fritos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Turdac-turrito.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I watched the poor person at the end of the line in Chipotle.  The people really stuff them.  Trying to get the tortilla and the foil so you can still wrap it up into something is really tough sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then there's the blowout situation which you never want to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anytime I go to Chipotle I worry about the blowout situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they go get another, they get another tortilla.  That kind of works better because then it mixes all the ingredients together.  So actually the blowout is okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way we should point out that the quesarito is not on the menu at Chipotle.  It's part of their secret menu.  So you have to know to ask for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that as for research for the show I really should try it out and let you guys know how it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I get somebody to go there right now and get us one before the show is over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, with a live shot. Live shot.  Google Glass. Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could have the quesarito, but you could also have the burrito dilla.  It is a diet friendly alteration of the quesarito that is essentially a Chipotle quesadilla.  Except only half the fillings of a regular burrito are sandwiched between heaping handfuls of cheese.  They will make this for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a hard enough time to get them to listen to me to put the right salsa in there.  I can't believe they're going to do all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says if the server is not aware of this secret recipe,  have them place a handful of cheese on one side of the burrito  and order about half the amount of fillings of a regular burrito on top of that cheese.  Then place another handful of cheese on top of the fillings,  fold it in half and place it in the giant warmer for a few minutes.  A grilled...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because Taco Bell had the grilled stuffed burrito and they ruined it by putting basically tons of lard in it.  The grilled stuffed burrito was a wonderful thing at Taco Bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right, now I'm really hungry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the torture Gina segment of the show.  Did you know that originally the Chipotle secret menu was only known to a few lucky diners?  Who knew about the quesarito, the burrito dilla?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm envisioning in about 20 minutes Gina Trippani going around her house saying,  damn it mom, where's your meat thermometer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Where is the meat thermometer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The double wrapped burrito.  Did you know about that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know, I didn't. There's all kinds of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The double wrapped burrito is a delicious creation.  If you crave the warm and chewy tortilla shell more than anything else, you're in luck.  Because Chipotle actually lets you get your burrito wrapped in two tortillas if you wish.  And ask nicely before they are warm up.  Ask them nicely to warm up both the tortillas in the giant warmer.  I want a giant warmer.  This is an accident.  This is your fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One problem here is that my one gets really slow.  And so the worst of the line is at the checkout, the colder your meal is by the time you get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's no good.  All right, here's a quiz question for you.  Who spent more for acquisitions in 2013, Apple or Google?  Surprise.  The answer may surprise you.  Apple has reported...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We should turn that into a Buzzfeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Headline.  What would the headline be?  You won't believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who spent more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who spent more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, that's a question.  Let's see.  Apple, over the past five quarters, has officially reported total acquisition investments of $11.12 billion  in addition to a billion in cash business acquisition payments.  So I think this is all cash.  Apple has certainly enough cash to do this.  Google reports spending $7.36 billion for property and equipment, $1.45 billion for acquisitions.  That can't be right.  Google spent more than that on the Nest thermostat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I'd want to know is are investments put into this?  Because I know that with Google Ventures, they put in a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, you wouldn't count Google Ventures.  That's different.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not an acquisition.  But also Apple bought a huge amount of their own stock back, so they may be counting that.  Maybe.  They just misread that.  Yeah.  That's Apple insider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Zite, which for some reason CNN owned, has now been flipped to Flipboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you might say, oh, they made such a good deal, but Raffa Dali, founder of Skift, pointed  out that it wasn't really, it was bought for $20 million, supposedly sold for $60 million,  but not much of that was cash.  It was an assumption of options.  It was stock back and other things.  So I think CNN didn't know what to do with it and got a good deal getting out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's good, though.  I mean, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it belongs at Flipboard.  Flipboard can do wonderful things with Zite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Zite really was a Flipboard competitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Zite was also adding more of the personalization stuff, and they'd get that in.  When Sarah Bartlett and I were out there, we visited Flipboard and they met their chief  scientist and they've got neat stuff going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Yahoo is turning off both Google and Facebook Connect sign-ins.  I think that's a mistake.  Is that why they feel that that's competitive?  Why support competitive services?  I bet they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that also means they could get some level of signals.  If you signed into a Yahoo service using Facebook, now Yahoo can know something about you from  Facebook and now they lose that opportunity.  That's silly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it's also a short side in that given they've already got these sign-ins and these  accounts, it makes more sense to let people link multiple accounts together and give them  some isolation.  This is like the indie-orth idea of saying, OK, we'll let you sign in with more than one  account, and that way you've got some protection against those accounts going down or whatever.  But you've also got the ability to draw information from more than one source.  And there's definitely value of both sides of that.  So I don't get this.  And the other thing is that Yahoo's login has historically been pretty bad.  If we use them for open ID logging, you would get like a 27-digit hex string rather than  actually your name showing up when you try to comment on blogs and things.  Oh, that's not good.  Yeah.  So there's a bunch of stuff they could improve with where they've been.  Also, I find that it keeps logging me out and then it's much more likely to sulk until  we reset my password and the others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if they're still going to do it on Marissa, but Yahoo used to kill accounts  regularly if you weren't loyal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They get rid of you, which is really frustrating.  So they killed a bunch and then they said they could recycle the namespace.  And so this was like a couple of months ago.  So you can now get the names of abandoned accounts, which seems like a good thing, but  except that then you start getting there with an old mail.  So it's messy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I just went to Yahoo as of now.  If I go to Yahoo.com, I can create a new account or sign in with Facebook or Google.  So it's still turned on.  Yahoo apparently is doing its own thing.  Is this oath?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have done oath-based stuff in the past.  They've been involved with OpenID Connect, which is oath-based.  Certainly, I'm not sure how much they still are.  They were definitely part of the contributors to that spec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So right now, if you say Google, it says Yahoo would like to view your Google email address  and view basic information.  So this would pre-populate my Yahoo account with stuff from my Google account.  Oh, it says, do you have a Yahoo account?  To continue, you need to create a Yahoo account.  So then I could create a new one or log in with my existing Yahoo account.  So now if I do that, I've just channeled stuff from Google into Yahoo.  Now they know more about me, as you pointed out.  Not a bad thing for them.  On the other hand, if they're trying to promote their own Oauth logins, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But here's the thing.  If I have a relationship with you, cherish that.  I went through this. I'm staying in an insurance hotel.  It's a very nice hotel. It's absolutely fine and dandy.  I had not used my, what do they call it? Who owns this?  SPG. Who's that? Starwood.  Hadn't used the Starwood number in a long time.  So what happens? They deactivated my account.  Oh, that's rude.  That's a fine way to treat me when I come back.  Yeah, no, that's the wrong...  Of course, I went to Twitter and lined and they fixed it.  That's fine.  But whether you're Yahoo or Starwood or any of these companies,  if somebody leaves you when they come back, don't slap them around.  Welcome them. Say, oh, good, we missed you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.  Unless, as is the case of the airlines, these affinity groups are losing the money  and they're just trying to get rid of you.  They don't want you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They were hoping...  Well, they already expired my miles. Starwood already expired me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's probably what they wanted to do, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they expired anyway. They didn't have to also kill my account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay. Yeah, keep the account alive. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's all I'm saying. Same with Yahoo.  Is there cost to maintaining it? The minimus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Google's got the Loon project. Facebook has the Drone project.  Now how afraid are you? I don't mind Google balloons over me.  I'm so on versus Mothra in disguise over the world.  I love the headline from Wired, Facebook drones to battle Google balloons  in war of airborne internet.  I want to see an animation of that. I want to see a cartoon.  It might be a great video game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can you Amazon drones? Get in there, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All the drones. According to multiple reports...  This is kind of like rock, paper, scissors.  Yeah. Facebook wants to buy a drone maker whose solar-powered aircraft  could operate at high-altitude wireless hotspots  circling in the stratosphere for years without refueling.  So this is similar to Google.  You know, I always feel like Mark Zuckerberg has a serious case of envy.  Like he wants to do everything to everybody else.  If you have balloons, I'm going to have drones.  Actually, it's part of his internet.org effort,  which is actually a philanthropic effort to bring in...  Which is more philanthropic, yes.  ...to people around the world. So that's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's it, Leo. Make fun of the charity, huh, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, you know. What's new? I'm a jerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know. I had the same reflex that I had to stop myself and say,  there goes the punchline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, all right. Google's donating $6.8 million  to fund free transit rides for San Francisco youth.  This story just doesn't stop, does it?  What could possibly go wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Next Google employees will be throwing candy out of the Google bus  to the urchins in the street, like World War II, going through Belgium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, chewing gum here. Silk stockings.  Free Muni for low-income youth program,  previously paid for by the city of San Francisco.  31,000 low-income youth aged 5 to 17 have taken advantage of the program.  It's a good program.  I think they should let them use the Google bus.  What is it? Well, seriously, what's the bus doing  after it gets all the employees there, brings them back?  It's just sitting around all day.  They could take them on field trips.  Take them on field trips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they should just...  I think the problem is they wouldn't at about the same time.  They could just lounge in the bus and drive around the city and use the Wi-Fi.  Free Wi-Fi, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, for the classrooms. I like that, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Travel to the classroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Except at that point, all the buses are down at Mountain View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, then drive Mountain View youth around.  They've got kids in Mountain View.  It doesn't solve the problem, though.  Maybe send the Google buses to Stockton.  That's where we need them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me just say this.  Startups, geeks, come to New York and be here.  We're not going to make your lives difficult.  We're not going to go picketing you because you create jobs here.  We are capitalists in New York.  We believe in innovation.  To heck with this Silicon Valley stuff, it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you did see Nick Bilton's article in the New York Times  about the San Francisco housing market.  Nick is a great writer. Listen to this.  First couple of graphs.  Not long ago, the pink house at 1829 Church Street  in the Glen Park neighborhood here hit the market for $895,000.  It sold for $1.425,530,000 over the asking price in less than two weeks.  It's a fixer-upper, three bedrooms, two baths, linoleum floors,  Eisenhower-era kitchen.  It's a dump.  But it's two blocks from the Google bus stop.  Location, location, location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can do a free market, man.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But a number of people have pointed out...  It's not a free market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's probably because you can't actually build anything in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly the problem, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think there are places where what's needed is more housing  that's built in places, and that's what the government can do.  But if I owned a house in San Francisco  and suddenly somebody wants to press the market for it,  it's not going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  According to Redfin...  No, no, no.  The problem is that they're not handing out permits to build new housing.  And the people who've got existing housing say,  no, we're not blocking our view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, even if they try to sell the housing for less,  Nick says you'll have a bidding war from 20 different people.  That's how it gets so much over the asking price.  The average teacher in San Francisco County earns $59,700 a year.  Not a single home on the market in San Francisco  is within reach of the average public school teacher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's pretty much always been that.  When I lived there, I left in 81, dating myself badly.  I don't want to know, Gina, how far away you were birthed.  And I couldn't find a place in San Francisco.  It was hard, but it wasn't impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Five years ago, police officers and teachers could have afforded  36% of the homes on the market.  Today, not one home for teachers and police officers  who average $80,000 a year.  There's one house in the whole county that they could afford.  One house.  They all live in Novato, down the road a piece.  Manhattan, too.  Yeah, well, that's the thing.  I mean, I think it's true.  You know, the Gold Coast of Chicago, this is...  It is, like Manhattan, San Francisco's bordered  not on four sides by water, but on three sides by water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then the other side on Daly City, nobody wants to live there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody wants to live in the tiki-taki houses.  So I think that's bad for a city, though,  when the people who teach your children and keep you safe  can't afford to live in that city.  Well, but then you can do other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Newark, Cory Booker put up a whole complex that houses teachers.  Yeah.  You know, the city could do that.  The city could...  We need a teacher ghetto.  ...property. Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My mother was a public school teacher, and, you know,  I grew up in Brooklyn, and I take a train across a bridge every day  to get to my office in Manhattan.  And growing up here, you know, like rich people live in Manhattan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's getting to be that way in Brooklyn, too, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Oh, Brooklyn has changed a lot.  It's really gentrified.  Yeah, it's very gentrified.  Trying to buy property in Brooklyn was an eye-opening experience  for me, for sure.  What did your mother teach?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What did your mother teach you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She taught remedial reading for like 25 years  in a public school to students who were sixth, seventh,  and eighth grade students who were reading at the second and third grade level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So where do you stand on the de Blasio Charter School?  What was her name, Eva?  Eva, what's her name?  The Success Schools?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I heard a little bit about this.  I honestly don't know enough about it.  So Success Schools, which was a charter school movement

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that was championed by Bloomberg,  and highlighted in Waiting for Superman, the wonderful documentary.  Oh, yeah. That was a great documentary.  Fairly controversial because they take over schoolrooms  in regular public schools, push the kids out.  They're fairly aggressive about it.  The director makes $475,000 a year.  It is funded entirely by public school funds, not by private funds.  And de Blasio...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this a give back to the Teachers Union for supporting them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a give back to the Teachers Union  because Teachers Union hates these guys  because they're all non-unionized teachers straight out of college.  So de Blasio hates them.  On the other hand, the success rate of these schools  is very high on standardized testing.  They do much, much better than the public schools typically do.  It's an interest. I don't know where to...  Yeah, it's not an easy issue.  Yeah.  Yeah. And of course, there's a long waiting list  for kids to get into these schools.  That's the tragic part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I went to private school.  My mom taught in public school and I went to private school.  But because of the religious aspect of it was really important to my mom.  My mom wanted me to go to Catholic school.  So it was... My house was always a very...  Even though my mom thinks about New York City public school system is amazing  and she loved her school,  I come from kind of a weird, weird background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Her name is Eva Moskowitz.  And she's the director of Success Academy Charter Schools.  I don't know. I mean, she's getting really good results.  So it's hard to...  Anyway, they serve 6,700 students,  90% black or Hispanic, but they don't have remedial reading.  They don't have a lot of things that the public schools are required to offer.  And also, the schools sound a little different.  But anyway, it's an interesting story.  There's a good article about it in the New York Times today,  in the New York Region.  In the New York Region section, pretending that I live in it.  Wow.  I just like to keep up on what's going on in my old town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I lived there two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You'll be back working in our basement, Leo, before you know it.  The first two years of my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say, you're qualified to open a studio here.  That counts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do want to do that. I really do want to do that.  We do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good idea. What is OPEA?  You're the open source expert, Gina Trapani.  OPEA, Google's new open source project,  allows anyone to create an interactive learning experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this looks pretty interesting.  Actually, maybe I should have included this in the change log.  Is this a MOOC?  It's a MOOC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a MOOC.  Not what we mean in Brooklyn when we say MOOC.  It's a massively online, open...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's more of a teaching thing, right?  It's more like the Card Academy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so you can create online courseware using this software, OPEA,  which is also open source.  You can contribute back to it.  It's written in Python, I have determined, which is not surprising.  That's a good thing.  Yeah.  And yeah, they've got a sample.  If you go to OPEA.com, they've got kind of a sample exploration,  they call it, on the front page.  So you can see that there's, you know,  you can walk through solving a math exercise on the front page.  It looks pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OPPIA, OPEA.  Byte-sized learning journeys by anyone, for anyone.  I think these are really great.  Because I think they really do democratize education.  I don't think we talked about this in the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like this plus help-outs is kind of interesting.  I'm sorry, Jeff, I didn't mean to cut you off.  But you can see kind of Google's really, you know,  interest in peer-to-peer education and creating and providing tools  and platforms for people to teach and learn each other, which I really like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we had a, I guess we talked about this last week,  Google itself is running a data analysis class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is kind of cool.  Making sense of data.  If you go to Datasense.withgoogle.com,  do you work with surveys, demographic information, evaluation, data?  This is something people really do need to learn, right?  It's a self-paced online course for somebody who wants to learn more  about how to structure, visualize, and manipulate data.  Wow.  We should, you know, we have, we got 17,000 responses to our survey,  which we're trying to parse.  I think, Glenn, you need to take this course.  Wow.  March 18th through April 4th.  So it doesn't, it starts in a couple of weeks.  And of course they have to say,  That's sad.  To get to the Opia site, it's opia.org.  That's the hosted version.  Or you can see the code.  Right, you can run the code yourself.  At code.google.com slash opia.  All right, let's take a break.  When we come back, we're going to have a tip, number, and tool.  And Kevin, anything you want to throw in that mix?  It's stone soup for the geek.  But first a word from squarespace.com.  They're making the web a better place.  One website at a time, maybe yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I don't remember if I've done this before.  Tell me if I have.  I was short on a tip this week.  But I love this site, and I look at it all the time,  especially now that I'm here in New York and the weather has changed so much.  Forecast.io.  You've talked about this, Leo.  You have to, right?  This is the service that powers Dark Sky, which is an iOS app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you get Dark Sky on Android?  You can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't believe you can.  I got to tell you, forecast.io, which is just the website,  is a really nice mobile experience.  This is awesome.  And I know this doesn't matter as much to people who live in California  because it's always sunny there.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're going to rain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When you're wondering what exact time it is going to start snowing  or how many inches of snow are going to be in the ground  when you leave your office that day and whether or not you should wear boots,  this is the site that I look at in the morning.  I just absolutely love it.  The service matches up to weather data from a bunch of different sources  and makes predictions literally down to the minute.  At 2.30, it's going to start to rain.  And it's really, really quite good.  Beautiful layout.  It really helps you plan out.  If you haven't looked at it before, forecast.io has been awesome,  especially now.  I knew about it when I was in San Diego.  Now that I'm here on the East Coast and the weather deeply affects how my day is going to go,  it's really indispensable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you have a weather app?  I mean, I do recommend Dark Skies for iOS.  Do you have a weather app you like on Android?  This is the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just use the website.  Google Now, Card.  Yeah, I basically have this open in a tab at all times in Chrome on Android.  And I swipe over to Google Now to look at the web.  So I'll swipe over to Google Now to see the temperature.  And then if I see any sort of precipitation, I go to forecast.io to get the whole story.  That's everything you need.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I have, well, there's a website I like, which I'll put in the chat,  which is I think is part of the source info they use for forecast.io.  It's the precipitable water in the atmosphere, which is really handy here  because you can basically see the rainstorms coming into California.  Oh, that's neat.  So if you look at that, it's a return.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I can see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm looking.  What I found with Dark Skies was it wasn't that accurate here.  People would say, oh, no, it's fine.  And it was actually raining last week.  It's like, yeah, you had one job.  Yeah, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The one thing I'd like to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I've got a couple I use.  I use Weather Underground because they make a really nice widget, which is handy.  I should have to see where the rain is going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny how much we love weather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's something about it.  I don't understand it.  It matters.  And there's one called Radar Now, which is very simple and just gives you the animated version of that map.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use Yahoo Weather, actually, on both iOS and Android.  They've done a really nice job.  There's an Android one now, have they?  Yeah.  And what's nice about Yahoo Weather is they take pictures from Flickr.  So if you've got a bunch of cities, you'll get Creative Commons Flickr pictures of those cities, which is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, like in the particular conditions?  Yeah.  Okay, that's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So unfortunately, because Petaluma, sometimes they'll have downtown Petaluma, which is cool.  And if you slide up, you've got a lot of the Forecast.io stuff, including maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The thing that Forecast.io does is the forward projection, which is nice.  It's where the rain is going to be.  Whereas all of these ones are historic.  So you can look at it and go, I can see that rainstorm is coming this way.  Whereas Forecast.io says, oh, it's going to rain over there, which is also why it's a little bit off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just bad at maps.  I look at a weather map, I'm like, I don't know what this means.  This is what I like about Forecast.io is it's like 2 o'clock, it's going to start to rain in your location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a nice representation.  I think you need a version for England called Lights.  It's going to be sunny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never. It never happened.  Say again, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it give you snow accumulation maps that you don't need in California, but we do?  Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It'll tell you.  So you give it your location, it'll be like two inches tonight.  Oh, well.  Between one and six inches.  Yeah, yeah.  It'll tell you about what.  And of course that changes.  I mean, there was one point it was predicting six.  But if you keep an eye on it, it will give you an accumulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The rest of them just bury it.  It's like it's the ethic of the weather, the TV weatherman who just keeps on.  Next segment we'll do.  Next segment we'll do.  The first site I created on the Internet, I got so sick of TV weatherman, I created a site that was nothing but five day forecast, because that's all I care about.  Really?  Yeah, we call it raidershine.com and we sold it to AccuWeather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have tapped into some sort of weather thing here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You won't believe what your commute's going to be like tomorrow.  That's literally the tease for local news.  It makes me crazy.  I'm like, I could just go to a podcast that I own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't need to watch your crappy broadcast.  One other thing I like about the Yahoo thing, because it's connected to Yahoo, and this might be a portent of things to come.  They call it smart weather.  Easily add friend and family locations.  You can log into your Facebook or your Yahoo account and it will add all the locations of your friends and family to your maps.  So I can have all of these maps, because I know people in all of these areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My parents should do that.  My parents, God bless them, are always calling and saying, get a lot of snow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says right here, it's snowing.  Yep, it did.  You know what?  You're taking away from them the one topic of conversation they have.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not going to tell them about that.  I don't know, Mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me look out the window.  Oh, look, you're measuring cups.  They're on the sill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they're measuring the snow.  Measuring the snow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Put a ruler in it.  Jeff Jarvis, give us a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, I think you teased this and then we didn't do it, so I'll do this one.  Okay.  Google has poured another $50 million into the real estate marketplace auction.com.  And a $1.2 billion valuation means this is the fourth company that they've invested in that has over a billion dollars valuation, said another report.  Wow.  I just find this fascinating that Google is in the real estate business at any level.  I think that's real estate business is an incredibly inefficient business.  I always get brokers mad at me when I say this, but real estate brokers do not earn 6%.  And I think it's ripe for disruption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They get paid 6%, but you're saying they don't earn it.  Right.  I get it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I come to my house to Zillow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Zillow is so great.  I love Zillow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did.  It's great.  And you know what?  Every single place that our agent showed us was packed with people and done off for the day after.  We found a place for sale by owner from Zillow's.  I had a search set up that just emailed me listings, new listings, found it through Zillow, didn't have to pay the fee.  We made it off very quickly.  Offers get made very quickly here.  But it was, yeah, and it was Cochrane, which is like the big real estate place here.  Zillow did better than my Cochrane agent.  Sorry, Barbara.  But yeah, there's a lot that can be done here, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But did Zillow give you a bottle of champagne and two glasses etched with you and your wife's name on it on the day you bought?  No, it did not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And also I should say Zillow did send us to a place which was a for sale by owner.  And it was clearly turned out after a couple of weeks going back and forth with the guy, just a guy who wanted to see whether or not he'd get an offer.  Like he wasn't serious.  And so he kind of yanked our chain for a bit.  So like you kind of had to take the good with the bad.  You know, it's.  You should have done what Mark Zuckerberg did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said, I like that house.  He sent his agent to knock on the door and said, how much would you take?  I will pay twice what it's worth.  And the guy said, oh, really?  Yeah, I never heard that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When I when I make my first billion, I'm not going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you wish somebody come knock at your door and say, I will pay you.  That's what he did with WhatsApp.  Yeah, yeah, right.  I'll pay you eight thousand times what it's worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Instagram, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I want to recommend something I've actually recommended on on the Mac side,  but it's also an Android app.  But do not look if you do not want to waste time.  If if you do not want to waste time, I don't know why it was Steve Gibson who told me about this.  And I've gotten so hooked on this, I can't stop playing it.  It's kind of a simple game.  It's called Rails.  You're doing basically what you're doing is your traffic directing a railroad.  But there's something so seductive about it that I just can't stop playing.  Maybe it appeals to the same kind of mind that does knowing, you know,  and knowing is that's where you arrange everything in in square right angles on your desk.  This this game trains come out of different stations.  You've got to route them using switches and lights.  So they go to the right station. Oh, no, the blue train is going to the red station.  Stop, stop, stop.  And here comes a blue train going, oh, no, I got to get the.  So anyway, you get the idea.  It's a lot of fun and I can't stop playing it.  And it's Buck 99.  For those who graduate from Thomas the Tank Engine, this is like grown up Thomas the Tank Engine.  I earned one hundred seventy five coins and set a new record.  Wow. So you start a gamer. Yeah.  No, you would love this.  No, I know. I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't like games. I don't like crossword puzzles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You would love this. You draw you draw lines.  I try. I got dots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did dots like twice and I said, what's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. You you actually want to be productive or something.  Is that it? Yeah. Oh, see, I don't care.  Really? I'm just a podcaster.  I don't need to be productive. I just sit here and talk.  What do I need? I'm not productive.  I'm on Twitter and I. Yeah, right.  You know, Twitter, that's productive. Oh, yeah.  I know. Thank you, by the way, for sending me a bunch of selfies.  People using their dogs to create parody selfies.  Let me pause this game. I want to save that.  That's Rails, Buck 99.  David Letterman. David Letterman did his own Oscar.  Oh, there's a movie. You want to watch the movie of trains?  Now, you already just saw that. No, I don't.  No, come on. You want to play this game?  I know you do. Oh, I don't.  This isn't a good. This is not good.  What is good about this? This is not even funny.  I think. Yeah. I think.  David. Yeah. You got some competition.  You got Kimmel. You got Conan.  You got Fallon. What are you doing?  This isn't funny.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's even the point of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. Love you, babe. But not.  And you know how many retweets he got? 67.  Now, if Kevin Spacey were making a face in the back,  then you know what we're going to do when we get Kevin here?  We're going to do a selfie and have him make that face.  Oh, that would be great.  Then how? Yeah.  You've seen, of course, the people who've made the Kevin Spacey selfie.  OK, that's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, this week in Google has come grinding to a halt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently it's gone dark as well.  The show is would be nothing without its panelists.  And we thank you, Kevin Marks, for joining us.  Kevin is not gainfully employed.  So if anybody would like to give this guy a job and get him out of his.  Brilliant. The brilliant Kevin.  The wonderful, the brilliant, the talented.  Let me tell you something.  This is the most brilliant Kevin Marks I've ever seen.  He's got a green card.  He's got a posh accent.  He'll add some class to your joint.  You never did his thing.  What thing?  You do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he does the number.  He did his thing.  He did 18 weather apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the thing I was going to mention is that this weekend in San Francisco,  we want to plug this empty out to South by Southwest.  We've got Indie Web Camp,  which is the camp for people who are creating the Indie Web.  And there's a few places left.  So if you're interested in building an independent web,  then and you're actually doing it, then come along to Indie Web Camp.  What does this mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this like your, your how Indie how?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Basically, hosting your own site, connecting to other sites,  bridging out to the large silos like Google and Facebook,  but not making them the center of your web experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excellent. Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a bar camp style.  I'm tired, but yes, did any of you consider going to South by Southwest this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought about it and decided that it wasn't worth what it would cost  because it's so much more expensive now than it was a couple of years ago.  Is it? How much is it?  Well, it's not the conference itself.  It's just that it's so overloaded that it's going actually fly there  and get somewhere to stay and so on.  I was looking at lots and lots of money.  I was like, no, yeah, it's a great party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if there's much information there.  We're going to do. I think we're going to do a special  at some point with sat with, you know,  do talk a little bit about what's going on.  If something big is happening there, we'll cover it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it does. It seems mostly it's a place for the independent people to go  because it was cheap and it was a way to get together in the spring.  And people from all over America would go out and chat about the latest web stuff.  It's fun.  And it's become such a corporate thing now.  You could only really afford to go if you could expense the whole thing.  And that's not a piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I've seen the marketing people are saying that it's over.  And I'm thinking, well, you're the guys who ruined it.  And then you abandon it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every app in the world wanted to duplicate Twitter and Foursquare's experience there.  And it just became crazy.  It's too bad. Anyway, it was, you know, it's a fun party.  I would go. I just can't justify.  Just can't justify it to go for a party, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I could just really pass the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that sad? This was this was this was, if anything, was was our thing.  Our thing. Yeah, if anything.  I should give actually you have a lot of good things, Kevin Marks, fixed patents dot org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, fixed patents are always a site that I put up a while ago,  and it's a bit scruffy looking at the moment.  That's your site. I didn't know that.  But the Julie Powell from who was at EFF, who was the Mark Cuban chair of fixing stupid patents,  has moved to engine advocacy, really putting up a big campaign site around all the new patent bills.  Engine dot I.S. Yes.  Yes. So and they asked if they could use fixed patents, or when I said, yes, please do.  So that's going to change from being an ugly site that I that I made one day because I was grumpy  and going to be a place where they're actually campaigning to actually fix patents  because there are four or five doors going to Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  God's work. So what is somebody going to take her place at EFF or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, she's still doing the patent stuff here.  She's taking the patent campaign with her to engine advocacy and EFF is going to continue campaigning on it, too.  Good. It's really important. Yeah. Yeah.  It's something that impacts a lot of tech. It's a nice site.  But there's an engine engine engine, a smart group.  I've been impressed with them.  They've been thinking about these these issues and working out how to translate between the tech world and D.C.  for quite a while. So it's I'm very encouraged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Judy's gone there. And you can follow them on Twitter at engine advocacy.  And you can follow Kevin Marks at Kevin Marks.  Yes. Or Kevin Marks dot com or Kevin Marks dot com or a picture of my table.  I just threw that in. That's my selfie. It's pretty ugly.  What do you think? It's in the scruffy scruffy table.

Who could forget?  The heavenly bed, yeah.  You can get it at WestonHotelsAtHome.com.  It's only... Holy cow, it's expensive. OK.  It'd be cheaper to just go stay at the hotel, frankly.

Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I don't know if I have the budget for that. But that's nice to think about.
